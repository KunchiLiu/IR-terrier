	<brief_summary>Considerable progress in the treatment of metastatic melanoma has been made in the past 5years, with the approval of immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies and agents targeting BRAF mutation. Investigators conducted a open label, dose escalation, phase I clinical trial of to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of intravenous administration of autologous NKT Cells in metastatic melanoma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of Adoptive Transfer With Autologous NKT Cells in Metastatic Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considerable progress in the immunotherapy of metastatic melanoma has been made in the past 5 years, with the approval of immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies. NKT cells are a potent immunoregulatory cell population heavily implicated in promoting immunity to infection and cancer. And now with new generation of amplification method, more than 1,000 folds amplification of NKT cells can be obtained, so NKT cell based adoptive cell transfer is now available and might show its efficacy in melanoma. Investigators conducted this open label, dose escalation, phase I clinical trial of to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of intravenous administration of autologous NKT Cells in metastatic melanoma patients.</detailed_description>
