	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of ALLO-ASC-DFU in Paitents With Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Adipose-derived stem cells have anti-inflammatory effect and release growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which can enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in treating a Diabetic Foot Ulcer.</detailed_description>
