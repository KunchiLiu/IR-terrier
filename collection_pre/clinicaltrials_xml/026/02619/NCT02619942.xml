	<brief_title>Investigate the Radical Extent of Lymphadenectomy of LAparoscopic Right Colectomy for Colon Cancer(RELARC).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study design is a two-arm, parallel-group, single-blind randomized clinical trial. The enrolled colon cancer patients would be divided into the intervention group (CME group) and control group (D2 radical operation group). The postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is determined by the pathological results. For patients of stage Ⅲ and patients of stage Ⅱ with unfavorable histologic features, six months of adjuvant chemotherapy of XELOX or fluorouracil-based regimen are recommended. The postoperative examination should be performed every four months in the first two years and every six months in the following three years, to exclude local recurrence and distant metastasis. Our study is expected to last five years, of which two years for recruiting patients, three years for follow-up.</detailed_description>
