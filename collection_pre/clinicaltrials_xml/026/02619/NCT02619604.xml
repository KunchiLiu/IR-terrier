Providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants will participate in educational initiatives geared towards enhancing their knowledge and confidence with managing QoL concerns for patients with CLL. Pre and post surveys will be conducted with providers to evaluate change in these areas. The project aims to train this team on how to enhance communication with patients and caregivers as a means to increase patient engagement in care and QoL in this population.</detailed_description>
