	<brief_title>Optical System to Continuously Measure Arterial Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurement of blood pressure during anesthesia is commonly performed by the inflation of a brachial cuff providing only intermittent blood pressure measurements. In some case, it is required to add a continuous invasive monitoring of blood pressure, via the insertion of an arterial catheter. Unfortunately, the related morbidity is not negligible. To limit the consequences of such a gesture, some developments have been done in the past to allow for continuous non-invasive measurements of blood pressure during anesthesia. Unfortunately, most of these devices are subject to important limitations and constraints of use. A new system has been designed by CSEM consisting of an optical system fixed on patient's skin, absolutely non-invasive and easy to use. In order to study the reliability of this device, the investigators plan to compare its blood pressure estimates against gold-standard arterial catheter measurements during induction of general anesthesia on 40 patients.</detailed_description>
