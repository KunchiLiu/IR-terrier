	<brief_title>Evaluation of Tests Performance on a New Digital Orthoptic Platform</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The demography of ophthalmologists is becoming weaker, many tasks are now performed by orthoptists. To optimize the achievement of orthoptic exams and thus make reliable screening in a shorter time, digital tools are developed. They attempt to renew the orthoptic screening equipment that is still made up of numerous tests, often with old designs that must be handled and adapted to each patient which constitutes a significant loss of time. It therefore appeared necessary for us to develop a platform of digital tools that integrates major tests used for diagnostic purposes, especially a visual acuity test, a stereoscopic vision test, a fusion test and a digital synoptophore enabling a detailed analysis of disorders of binocular vision. The purpose of the study is to evaluate this new tool, avoiding the mobilization of patients , and quantify whether this platform is precise, reliable, fast, comfortable and allow the realization of a safe examination for the patient and for orthoptics.</detailed_description>
