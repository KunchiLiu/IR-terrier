	<brief_title>Intellivent ASV in COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD patients often need invasive mechanical ventilation and due to the difficulties in the weaning of these patients, duration of mechanical ventilation can be relatively longer when compared with other ICU patients. Automated systems show promising results in shortening the weaning time in some patient groups. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Intellivent-ASV with Quickwean function on the total duration of invasive mechanical ventilation as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are success rate and duration of weaning, ventilator free days at day 28 and intubation free days at day 28 (including NIV) when compared to conventional ventilation with t-piece weaning.</detailed_description>
