	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a supervised resistance exercise training during hemodialysis is effective to increase physical activity in daily life in patients with end stage renal disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Resistance Training on Physical Activity in Daily Life and Functional Capacity in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients will be randomized into two groups: intervention and control groups. Patients in the intervention group will receive a supervised resistance exercise training, during hemodialysis, three times/week for 12 weeks, and patients allocate to the control group will received a passive stretching program during the same timeframe.</detailed_description>
