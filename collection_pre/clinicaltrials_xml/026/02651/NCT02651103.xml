	<brief_summary>The proposed research aims to investigate how different ventilation strategies may affect cerebral tissue oxygenation in the pediatric population. It will contribute to the literature exploring the NIRS monitoring device which is becoming increasingly utilized in a variety of anesthetic and critical care settings. It may help to guide clinical practice regarding optimal ventilation strategies, and how ventilation may be altered to correct suboptimal cerebral tissue oxygenation. This prospective study will include 50 patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion that requires placement of an arterial cannulation. There will be no change in the anesthetic or perioperative care of these patients. Tissue and cerebral oxygenation will be monitored using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).</brief_summary>
