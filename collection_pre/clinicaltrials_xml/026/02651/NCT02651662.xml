	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study of REGN2810 and REGN1979 in patients with lymphoma or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The study treatment period will be from 6 to 12 months, depending on how an individual patient responds to treatment. The follow-up period will be 6 months for all patients.</brief_summary>
