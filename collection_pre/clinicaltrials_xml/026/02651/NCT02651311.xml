	<brief_summary>Congenital Muscular Torticollis (CMT) is a postural deformity of head and neck detected at birth or shortly after birth, primarily resulting from unilateral shortening of Sternocleidomastoid Muscle (SCM). Surgery could be chosen for the treatment for some children, which is accompanied by moderate pain and discomfort. The investigators focused the effectiveness of intermediates cervical plexus block because the dermatome of sensory of cervical plexus block is correlated to that of torticollis. So the effect of analgesia could decrease the use of analgesics.</brief_summary>
