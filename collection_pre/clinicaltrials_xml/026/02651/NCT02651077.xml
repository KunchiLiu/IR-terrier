	<brief_summary>The investigators wish to highlight, in a Case-Control design, if there is an increased concentration of BFRs in omental adipose tissue of cases ( women with severe endometriosis with surgical indication ) versus bioaccumulation recorded in a control cohort ( women recruited in obstetrics and gynecology or visceral surgery showing no sign of endometriosis ) . Pairing will be operate on Age (+/- 5 years compared to the case ) , BMI ( BMI 5 Classes described by the HAS) and previous breastfeeding experience (yes / no , opposite the release expected bioaccumulate contaminants in breast adipose tissue , when the lactation ) .</brief_summary>
