	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effects the combination of regorafenib and perindopril has on hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), on high blood pressure (hypertension) and on any other types of side-effects and compare it to the published incidence of the side-effects with regorafenib alone. This research is being done in an attempt to reduce the side-effects associated with regorafenib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Perindopril and Regorafenib in mCRC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that treatment of regorafenib-treated mCRC patients with perindopril may reduce HFSR compared to reported incidence and severity. The investigators also hypothesize that treatment of regorafenib-treated mCRC patients with perindopril will likely reduce hypertension, a known adverse effect of VEGF/VEGFR inhibition. According to the 2014 Canadian Cancer Statistics, colorectal cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canadian males and the third most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canadian females, accounting for 13.9% and 11.6% of new diagnoses, respectively. Although mortality rates are declining very slightly, colorectal cancer is the second most frequent cause of cancer deaths in males and the third most frequent cause of cancer death in females, at 12.8% and 11.5% respectively. Metastatic colorectal cancers are generally not curable. Median overall survival for patients with unresectable mCRC who receive best supportive care (BSC) is five to six months. Palliative treatment with systemic chemotherapy is the best option prolonging survival and maintaining quality of life. Patients who are exposed to all active drugs can sometimes extend survival past two years. For many years 5 Fluorouracil (FU) was the only treatment, but the approval of irinotecan, oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidines, as well as various monoclonal antibodies targeting VEGF and EGFR growth factors led to the development of a number of different regimens. The ideal combination and sequence of the different agents is still not determined. Recently, Regorafenib has shown efficacy in patients pretreated with all these options in a large phase III trial, where it prolonged OS compared with placebo (Grothey, et al 2013). In addition, the results were confirmed in a smaller randomised trial in the Asian population, with patients being less intensively pre-treated (Li et al, 2014). Therefore, regorafenib is now considered a standard option in pre-treated patients. The intended outcome of successfully and significantly mitigating regorafenib-induced HFSR is that patients will be able to stay on the regorafenib for a longer period to increase efficacy. The hypothesis underlying this trial is that the co-administration of perindopril with regorafenib will mitigate HFSR symptoms. This may not be the case, and if the HFSR is more severe with the addition of perindopril than with regorafenib alone, the study will be discontinued. As a secondary endpoint, hypertension will also be followed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have progressed on/after, or are intolerant to all approved drugs for CRC and are eligible for regorafenib. In order to be eligible, all inclusion criteria must be met. A patient must: Understand, be willing to give consent, and sign a written informed consent form prior to undergoing any studyspecific procedure Be male or female and ≥ 18 years of age Histological or cytological documentation of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (Stage IV) previously treated with fluoropyrimidinebased chemotherapy, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, an antiVEGF therapy, and, if KRAS wild type, an antiEGFR therapy. Progression during or within 3 months following the last administration of approved standard therapies, or have experienced intolerance to previous therapy. Metastatic CRC patients with measurable or nonmeasurable disease Life expectancy of at least 3 months Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 (within 14 days prior to the initiation of study treatment) Have adequate bone marrow, liver function, and renal function as measured by the following laboratory assessments conducted within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment: Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 times the ULN Lipase &lt; 1.5 times the ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 times the ULN Glomerular filtration rate &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 according to the modified diet in renal disease abbreviated formula International normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time (PT; PTINR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.5 times the ULN Platelet count &gt; 100000 /mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3. Alkaline phosphatase limit ≤ 2.5 times the ULN If female and of childbearing potential, have a NEGATIVE result on a pregnancy test performed a maximum of 7 days before initiation of study treatment. If female and of childbearing potential or if male, must agree to use adequate contraception (eg, abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, or doublebarrier method) based on the judgment of the investigator or a designated associate from the date on which the ICF is signed until 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Patients who meet the following criteria at the time of screening will be excluded: Patients with hypotension (less than 90/60mm Hg) or at risk of symptomatic hypotension (fainting or dizziness) will be excluded.
