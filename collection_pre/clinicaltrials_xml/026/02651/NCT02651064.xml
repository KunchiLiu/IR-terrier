	<detailed_description>U.S. fruit and vegetable intake remains below recommendations, particularly for low-income populations. Evidence on effectiveness of financial incentives for addressing this shortfall is limited. This study examined effects of USDA's Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP), which offered financial incentives to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants for purchasing targeted fruits and vegetables (TFV). A randomized controlled trial of HIP was conducted in Hampden County, Massachusetts. 7,500 randomly selected SNAP households received a 30% rebate on TFV purchased using SNAP benefits. The remaining 47,595 SNAP households in the county received benefits as usual. Adults in 5,076 households were randomly sampled to complete telephone surveys, including 24-h dietary recall interviews. Surveys were conducted at baseline—1-3 mo pre-implementation—and in two follow-up rounds, 4-6 mo and 9-11 mo post-implementation. 2,784 adults (1,388 HIP, 1,396 non-HIP) completed baseline interviews; data were analyzed for 2,009 adults (72%) also completing at least one follow-up interview.</detailed_description>
