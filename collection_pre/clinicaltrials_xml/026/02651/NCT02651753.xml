	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial to Compare Safety and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of CKD-337</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, open-label, single oral dose, 2-way crossover clinical trial to compare safety and pharmacokinetics of CKD-337 in healthy male volunteers. Subjects will receive either a single oral dose of the test formulation(CKD-337) or a oral dose of the reference formulation(Lipitor+Lipidil supra). Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 7 days.</detailed_description>
