	<brief_title>Evaluating the Pharmacokinetics, Tolerability, and Safety of Once-Weekly Rifapentine and Isoniazid in HIV-1-Infected and HIV-1-Uninfected Pregnant and Postpartum Women With Latent Tuberculosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TB is a major cause of illness and death in women of reproductive age. Pregnant and postpartum women with latent TB are at higher risk of developing active TB. This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of 12 once-weekly doses of RPT and INH in HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women with latent TB. This study will enroll HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected pregnant women with latent TB and their infants into two cohorts based on gestation. Cohort 1 participants will be enrolled in their second trimester (greater than or equal to 14 to less than 28 weeks), and Cohort 2 participants will be enrolled in their third trimester (greater than or equal to 28 to less than or equal to 34 weeks). All participants will receive 12 directly observed once-weekly doses of RPT, INH, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) during their study visits at weeks 1-12. Study researchers will perform an interim analysis during the study, and a dose adjustment may be recommended based on this analysis. Study visits will occur at days 0-3, once a week for weeks 1-12, and once a month until 24 weeks after delivery. Visits will include physical examinations, obstetrical exams, and blood collection. Infants will be followed monthly until 24 weeks after birth.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age greater than or equal to 18 years, or minimum age of consent according to locally applicable laws or regulations at screening, verified per site standard operating procedures (SOPs); and able and willing to provide written informed consent for study at screening At screening, evidence by ultrasound of a viable singleton pregnancy with an estimated gestational age at enrollment of greater than or equal to 14 weeks through less than or equal to 34 weeks as per screening ultrasound (see protocol for more information) Has at least one of the following risk factors for TB: Per participant report, the participant is a household contact* of a known active pulmonary TB patient Per medical records, confirmation of HIV1 infection (see protocol for more information) and a single positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) at any time in the past. If not available in medical record, perform at screening. Note: A household contact is defined as a person who currently lives or lived in the same dwelling unit and shares or shared the same housekeeping arrangements and who reports exposure within the past two years to an adult index case with pulmonary TB. Shared housekeeping arrangements are defined as sleeping under the same roof as the index TB case for at least seven consecutive days during the one month prior to the index case TB diagnosis. Documentation of HIV1 infection status, or confirmation of HIV1 infection status (if unknown or undocumented). Confirmation of HIV1 infection is defined as positive results from two samples (described in the protocol) collected at different time points. All samples tested must be whole blood, serum, or plasma. As this study is being conducted under an IND, all test methods should be FDAapproved, if available. If FDAapproved methods are not available, test methods should be verified according to Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) and approved by the IMPAACT Laboratory Center. More information on this criterion is available in the protocol. If HIV1infected, documented current prescription of efavirenz (EFV) + 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimen and reports taking regimen for at least two weeks prior to enrollment (regimens containing protease, integrase, or entry inhibitors are not permitted) Documented laboratory values obtained within 14 days prior to enrollment: Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 7.5 g/dL White blood cell count greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/mm^3 Alanine transaminase (ALT) less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin less than 1.6 times the ULN Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 750 cells/mm^3 Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3 Per participant report at screening, intent to remain in the current geographical area of residence for the duration of the study Per participant report at screening, able to swallow whole tablets Per participant report, intention to keep the pregnancy Per participant report, willingness to permit infant to participate in the study Evidence of confirmed or probable active TB disease per World Health Organization (WHO) symptom screen and confirmation by Gene Xpert, shielded chest xray, or sputum sample Participant report of personal history of INH or rifampinresistant, multidrug resistant (MDR), or extensively drugresistant (XDR) TB Participant report of personal history of active TB in the past 2 years Participant report of previous treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) Household contact (as defined above) with known active MDR or XDR TB disease Known major fetal abnormality as detected on ultrasound Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or their formulation Known history of liver cirrhosis at any time prior to study entry Per participant report and/or medical records, evidence of acute clinical hepatitis, such as a combination of abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and/or light stools within 90 days prior to entry Participant report and/or medical records of peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 or higher within 90 days prior to entry Current use or history of active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements Participant report and/or clinical evidence of porphyria Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator of record (IoR)/designee, would preclude informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives, including taking the study medication Planned or current participation in an interventional drug study Current use of any prohibited or precautionary medications (see protocol for more information), including didanosine (DDI) or stavudine (D4T)</criteria>
