	<brief_summary>The study aims to investigate the influence of 5 cupping massage treatments on chronic non specific neck pain. 50 patients with neck pain are randomised into cupping treatment and waiting list control group. Before and after the intervention the investigators evaluate the neck pain (VAS), the neck related disability (NDI), pain on movement (POM) and the quality of life (SF36) and safety. To investigate neurophysiological effects of cupping the investigators also measure mechanical detection threshold (MDT), vibration detection threshold (VDT) and pressure pain threshold (PPT) and the two point discrimination threshold at pain related and control areas. The treatment group receives 5 cupping treatments over a period of 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
