	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate increasing dose levels of VS-4718 administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced cancer and to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further development of this combination in subjects with untreated advanced pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph 1 Study of VS-4718, a FAK Inhibitor, in Combination With Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in Advanced Cancer Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is comprised of 2 sequential parts: Part A (Dose Escalation of VS-4718) in subjects with advanced cancer and Part B (Expansion) in subjects with untreated advanced pancreatic cancer. Up to 60 evaluable subjects (i.e., subjects who complete at least 1 cycle (28 days) of therapy) will be enrolled, assuming that: 1. Part A: The maximum sample size will be 6 subjects up to 4 dose levels (exclusive of replacement subjects). However, additional subjects may be added if exploration of intermediate dose level(s) of VS 4718 is warranted. The starting dose of VS-4718 will be 200mg BID. 2. Part B: Up to 36 additional subjects may be enrolled at the RP2D. These subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment cohorts: - Cohort 1: IV treatment in 28-day cycles (nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 and gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15) and oral VS 4718 BID continuously starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1 - Cohort 2: IV treatment for the first 2 cycles, followed by IV treatment and oral VS-4718 BID continuously starting on Day 1 of Cycle 3</detailed_description>
