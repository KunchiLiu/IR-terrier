	<brief_summary>HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency. Severely immunosuppressed patients often experience an increased risk of opportunistic infection. A chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion, loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. However, it is still unknown whether reducing immune activation will restore CD4 T cell counts and leading to the restoration of immunodeficiency in chronic HIV infection.Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cells based on HLA mismatched allogeneic transplantation have been demonstrated to boost host immunity against tumor, attenuate immune-mediated inflammation, promote hemopoiesis without acute graft-versus-host disease. Thus, it may represent a novel treatment as adoptive therapy of allogenic adoptive cell therapy (AACT). Here, the investigators propose a hypothesis that AACT therapy can promote hemopoiesis in bone marrow and attenuate immune-mediated inflammation, which subsequently lead to the restoration of immunodeficiency in HIV-infected patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency, a chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion, loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. In particular, this immune activation has been identified as a disease determinant independent of viral load or cell death in HIV-1 infection. A series of clinical evidences have indicated that activated CD8 T cells may attack body cells infected with viruses. Because of this, CD4 cells infected with HIV are frequently destroyed by CD8 cells. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cells (GPBSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immune cells that have a potential role in immunomodulation and hemopoiesis. GPBSCs based on HLA-mismatched allogeneic transplantation have recently emerged as promising candidates for cell-based immunotherapy. Infusion of GPBSCs has been demonstrated to boost host immunity against tumor and promote hemopoiesis in a cohort of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. It represent a novel treatment as adoptive therapy of allogenic adoptive cell therapy (AACT) and has several characters as below: Before transplantation, donor and recipient HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 loci were typed at intermediate resolution by a polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primer method. All ATAII-treated INR patients had related donors who were HLA mismatched. Donors who had more matched HLA loci and matched red blood cell (RBC) type were first chosen. However, donor sex, age, and other characteristics were not considered with priority.The donor was subcutaneously injected with 5Î¼g/kg G-CSF twice a day for 5 days and then peripheral mononuclear cells was carried out with a CS-3000S cell separator. Donor cells were divided into aliquots and were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, but freshly collected cells were used in the first course. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and initial efficacy of AACT treatment for chronic HIV-1 infected patients with severe immunodeficiency. 20 patients received i.v. transfusion of 2.0-3.0*10E8 cells/kg of GPBSCs as the treated group and other 20 patients were transfused with placebo without GPBSCs as control group. All 40 of them received the routine management for AIDS. During the 24- or 48-week follow up, the evaluation of safety and efficacy will be undergone to help to establish innovative cell-based therapies for the treatment of diseases.</detailed_description>
