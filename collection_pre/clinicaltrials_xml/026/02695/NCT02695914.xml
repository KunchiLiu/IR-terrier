	<brief_title>Influence of Compound Qingre Granule on the Inflammatory Markers in Patient of FUO With Excess-heat Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All the cases will be provided by the Infectious Diseases Department of Beijing Friendship Hospital.Each patient should sign informed consent. Assessing the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to medical records. After collecting, sorting and entering the data, reducing the missing value, and then checking into the database. The stochastic indicator method will be used to simple random sampling, to ensure the probabilities of each individuals be given Chinese medicine intervention are equal.Operations must be standard to reduce errors. Quality assurance plan: Patient of fever within two weeks, or whose temperature is below 38.5 degree centigrade will be excluded. The registration form includes the following parts: Name, sex, age, address, phone number, admission time, primary diagnoses and levels of Inflammatory markers. Data will be analyzed using the SPSS17.0 (Statistical Product and Service Solutions 17.0) statistical software. Difference of measurement data will be compared with analysis of variance,and difference of enumeration data will be compared with rank-sum test.P&lt;0.05 has statistical significance.</detailed_description>
