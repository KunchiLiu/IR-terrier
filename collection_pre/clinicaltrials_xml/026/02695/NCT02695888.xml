	<brief_title>Mobile Technology Monitoring System to Assess a Web-based Intervention for Teen Risky Driving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study examines the feasibility of using an in-vehicle mobile technology monitoring system to measure teen secondary task engagement during on-road driving as the outcome measure for a web-based intervention to prevent risky driving in novice teen drivers. Approximately 20 teens who have been licensed for less than 90 days will be enrolled and evaluated at baseline, ~1 week and ~4 weeks. Participants will complete an intervention after the ~1 week assessment. This study will provide information on the feasibility of the web-based intervention to prevent risky driving and estimation of effect size of the intervention on cell phone use while driving.</detailed_description>
