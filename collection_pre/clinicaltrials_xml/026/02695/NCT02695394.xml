	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective non-interventional neuropsychological one visit study involving functional MRI (fMRI) is to ascertain emotional processing in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) compared to healthy control subjects. In different experiments, the modulation of cognitive and motor responses by visual emotional information and the ability to discriminate visual emotional stimuli will be tested using experimental behavioral paradigms. Furthermore, functional connectivity and - using fMRI - activations of brain regions known to be involved with emotional processing will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
