	<brief_summary>A retrospective study is conducted with 151 patients who has a soft tissue defect of digit treated with the sensate flaps from February 2005 to March 2014. Based on the different regions of soft tissue defects, the patients in the study are divided into four groups: (1) thumb group treated with the bilaterally innervated and traditional kite flaps; (2) distal finger group treated with the single- and dual-innervated dorsal digital flaps; (3) proximal finger group treated with heterodigital neurocutaneous island flap; and (4) awkward region group treated with Litter flap. The main outcomes are static 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of the flap, and pain and patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At final follow-up, sensory restoration of the flap is measured using the static 2PD test and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. Using the visual analogue scale (VAS) that consists of a 10 cm line, patients are asked to report pain sensations of the recipient site. Patients report their satisfaction with functional recovery of the injured finger according to the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire that is based on a 5-point response scale.</detailed_description>
