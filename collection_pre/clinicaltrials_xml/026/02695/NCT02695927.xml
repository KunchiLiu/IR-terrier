	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Glasses for the Treatment of Hemispatial Neglect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemispatial neglect is the inability or failure to attend and respond to the left side of space. Patients suffering right cerebral hemispheric damage from stroke or traumatic brain injury frequently suffer neglect and will ignore all information located in the left side of space. Currently there is no effective rehabilitation technique to treat neglect and many of these patients have severe long-term disability. The goal of this project is to determine whether a prototypical pair of rehabilitation glasses can reduce the symptoms of hemispatial neglect.</detailed_description>
