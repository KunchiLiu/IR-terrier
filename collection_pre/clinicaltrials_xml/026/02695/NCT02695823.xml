	<brief_summary>Acute or chronic liver failure (fulminant hepatitis or advanced cirrhosis) disrupts brain physiology. Beyond classical hepatic encephalopathy, intracranial hypertension may occur.During liver transplantation (LT) surgery, many factors can lead to cerebral assault. In addition, intracranial hypertension measured with invasive methods has been described in certain phases of LT, especially at the time of reperfusion. The invasive monitoring of the intracranial pressure is not used in these patients, due to a high risk of infection and bleeding. The non-invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure has been widely developed in recent years : transcranial doppler and recently ultrasound of the optic nerve sheath (ONSD) allow an effective detection of intracranial hypertension.</brief_summary>
