	<brief_summary>The overall objective is to compare the short-term (3 months) effectiveness of three glucose-lowering interventions (dapagliflozin, metformin and physical activity) on glucose variability, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight or obese individuals with pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4% / 39-47 mmol/mol).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Different medical therapies and lifestyle modification for the prevention of type 2 diabetes have yet to be compared head-to-head in individuals with pre-diabetes. This research project will compare different glucose-lowering interventions in overweight and obese individuals with HbA1c levels in the pre-diabetic range.</detailed_description>
