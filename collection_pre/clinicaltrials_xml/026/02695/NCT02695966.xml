	<brief_title>EVIS - Ex-vivo Assessment of T-lymphocyte Homing in Primary Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. It is a lethal disease that typically presents late, metastasises early and is resistant to conventional treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. In 2012 there were 8700 deaths in the UK from pancreatic cancer, making it the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death. Current therapeutic strategies are aimed at extending survival as well as improving symptoms and quality of life, but although conventional chemotherapeutic agents have achieved modest clinical benefit, the need for novel therapies is great. This study proposes to extend our pre-clinical studies to develop an ex-vivo assay for the assessment of AMD3100 effectiveness in human samples. The research team will investigate the feasibility of assessing primary human pancreatic tissue for changes to T lymphocyte function and localisation in the presence and absence of AMD3100 through obtaining a blood sample and fresh pancreatic tissue intra-operatively from pancreatic tumours located in the head of the pancreas.</detailed_description>
