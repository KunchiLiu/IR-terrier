	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect on FIX antigen and activity levels of ascending doses of SB-FIX. SB-FIX is an intravenously delivered Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) Therapeutic for genome editing. It inserts a correct copy of the Factor 9 gene into the albumin locus in hepatocytes with the goal of lifelong therapeutic production of the Factor IX clotting factor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ascending Dose Study of Genome Editing by Zinc Finger Nuclease Therapeutic SB-FIX in Subjects With Severe Hemophilia B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to provide long term expression of Factor IX in subjects with severe hemophilia B. SB-FIX is a therapeutic for ZFN-mediated genome editing which will be delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-derived vectors. SB-FIX is intended to function by placement of a corrective copy of the Factor IX transgene into the genome of the subject's own hepatocytes, under the control of the highly expressed endogenous albumin locus, and is expected to provide permanent, liver-specific expression of Factor IX for the lifetime of a hemophilia B subject.</detailed_description>
