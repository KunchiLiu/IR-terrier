	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I study of the ALK/FAK/Pyk2 inhibitor CT-707 in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of the study is to determine the MTD/RP2D of CT-707 and evaluate whether CT-707 is safe and has beneficial effects in ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must be diagnosed with ALKpositive advanced NSCLC. The tumor must be ALKpositive as determined by ALK rearrangement in ≥15% of cells (as measured by FISH using the Vysis breakapart ALK probe) or by using the Ventana ALK IHC test. The analysis may be performed locally. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2. Measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 Availability of tumor sample: Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who are neurologically unstable or require increasing doses of steroids or local CNSdirected therapy to control their CNS disease Impaired cardiac function or any clinically significant cardiac disease Patients with abnormal laboratory values during screening and on day 1 of predose Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of CT707 Patient has a history of pancreatitis or history of increased amylase or lipase that was due to pancreatic disease. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
