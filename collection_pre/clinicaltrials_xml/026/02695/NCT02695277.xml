	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized (2:1) multicenter trial to investigate the optimal treatment of Persistent and Longstanding Persistent AF referred for Radiofrequency (RF) ablation.The study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of two interventional approaches, in preventing the recurrence of AF in symptomatic, drug refractory patients with persistent or longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
