	<detailed_description>Pregnant women undergoing genetic amniocentesis within the 16th-18th gestational week will be enrolled at the Obstetric Unit, University of Ferrara. The selected patients will be randomly assigned to receive a vaginal compound containing 300 mg of lactoferrin 4 hours before amniocentesis or they will be untreated (controls). Amniotic fluid samples will be obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis and the sample not required for clinical purposes will be centrifuged to remove particulate material and the supernatants will be aliquoted and stored at -80Â°C until assay.</detailed_description>
