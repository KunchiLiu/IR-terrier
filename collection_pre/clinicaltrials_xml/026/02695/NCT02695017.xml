	<brief_summary>The investigator will proceed to assess changes in oxygenation of muscle tissue, electromyographic activation and strength in healthy subjects. For this, a measurement of all demographic variables on the first day of the study as well as a familiarity with the equipment will be performed. Participants will start the intervention 48 hours later to proceed with the first intervention with one of the exercises in this research (inertial pulley or regular machine). Later on, 48 hours later participants will perform the latest intervention that has not yet done, thus generating a crossover study.</brief_summary>
