	<brief_summary>Recent pre-clinical data provide strong evidence that short-term starvation before the administration of cytostatic drugs for the chemotherapy of solid tumors leads to significantly higher efficacy and lower toxicity levels. However, these findings have so far not been validated in patients. The aim of this trial is to provide first clinical evidence regarding the impact of pre-chemotherapeutic short-term starvation on response to therapy (primary endpoint). Additionally, progression-free survival, adverse events, and overall survival will be monitored (secondary endpoints). In perspective, short-term starvation before chemotherapy could represent a simple and secure way to improve both efficacy and tolerance of chemotherapies at low cost.</brief_summary>
