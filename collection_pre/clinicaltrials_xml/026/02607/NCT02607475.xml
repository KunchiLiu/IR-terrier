	<brief_summary>Robotic telesonography, in which an expert remotely performs sonography in real time, has recently emerged as an opportunity to perform sonography at remote centres. Using a robotic system and an assistant with limited training at the remote site, an expert can manipulate an ultrasound probe and generate images in real-time via an Internet connection. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of robotic telesonography for obstetric and adult and pediatric abdominal imaging in a centre with established sonography services which will be used as a comparator to robotic telesonography.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lack of trained sonographers in remote communities limits access to sonography for many patients. As a result, patients must travel or be transported to secondary and tertiary care centres, which often delays diagnosis and subsequent treatment, creates burdens for patients and their families, and increases healthcare costs. Robotic telesonography, in which an expert remotely performs sonography in real time, has recently emerged as an opportunity to provide sonography regardless of the availability of a skilled operator at the site. Studies primarily originating in Europe have demonstrated robotic telesonography in abdominal, pelvic, obstetric, and cardiologic applications in adults. However, the full potential of robotic telesonography across many imaging applications has yet to be explored, and robotic telesonography has not yet been trialed in Canada. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of robotic telesonography in a centre with established sonography services which will be used as a comparator to robotic telesonography. Approximately 30 patients will be recruited for each substudy (obstetric, adult abdominal, and pediatric abdominal). All patients will receive both conventional and robotic scans in a crossover design. The sonographer performing the scan will be asked to complete a data collection form which will collect information about duration of the exam and any challenges encountered. Following the completion of both scans, the patient-site assistant will provide a questionnaire to the patient (or for children, a parent/guardian of the patient) regarding his/her experience with the system. A physician will review images generated using either the robotic telesonography or conventional sonography systems and report findings on a standardized reporting form.</detailed_description>
