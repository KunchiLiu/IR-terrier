	<brief_title>Effect of Sarpogrelate, a Serotonin Receptor Antagonist, on Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes has been increased exponentially, arousing serious economic, social and health repercussions. Also, macrovascular complications of diabetes such as myocardial infarct or stroke have been increased. Individuals with diabetes have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), approximately two to four times than that of those without diabetes. Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires demonstration that new anti-hyperglycemic agents do not increase cardiovascular risk. The comprehensive and multifactorial management in type 2 diabetes, which includes control of hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity, is known to significantly reduce the risk of CVD as shown in Steno-2 study. However, most anti-diabetic agents currently used in clinical practice do not seem to provide enough cardiovascular protection.</detailed_description>
