	<brief_summary>An open label, prospective, multicentre, single-arm, post marketing study evaluating the safety, technical feasibility, and efficacy of the eCLIPs™ Family of Products for the treatment of bifurcation intracranial aneurysms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European eCLIPS™ Safety, Feasibility and Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to obtain data on the technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the eCLIPs™ Products for the treatment of bifurcation aneurysms. Specifically, procedural success of the eCLIPs Bifurcation Remodelling System (BRS) will be evaluated to determine feasibility of this product and safety will be measured as of a major stroke or death within 30 days, or major territorial stroke or neurological death within one year. Additional endpoints will be evaluated and data collected to assess the procedural success of the other eCLIPs Products Microcatheter, Microintroducer, Detacher) and collect efficacy information on the eCLIPs Products. A rate of 69% of aneurysms achieving Raymond Class 1 occlusion at the 12 month endpoint has been chosen as the criterion for success in subjects treated with the eCLIPs Device and coils (primary endpoint). An upper 95% confidence interval of 10% rate of major ipsilateral stroke or death at the 1 month, and 12 month endpoint has been chosen to demonstrate clinically safety (primary endpoint).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient whose age is greater than 18 years old 2. Patient with an unruptured or previously ruptured (at least 1 month from date of rupture and with partial occlusion of the dome of the aneurysm by endovascular techniques or by open neurosurgery, and in stable neurological condition—WFNS I and II with a good recovery to at least to mRS 02) saccular, intracranial aneurysm or recurrent aneurysm, which arises at a bifurcation of Basilar Tip or Carotid Terminus and has a neck length of &gt; 4mm or dome:neck ratio &lt;2. 3. Patient aneurysm arises at a bifurcation artery with at least one of the two branch artery vessels having a diameter between 1.5mm and 3.25mm 4. Patient understands the nature of the procedure and has the capacity to provide informed consent. 5. Patient is willing to have onsite 30 day, 6month, and 12 month followup evaluations as per standard clinical practice. 1. Patient who presents with an intracranial mass or currently undergoing radiation therapy for carcinoma of the head or neck region. 2. Major surgery within previous 30 days or planned in the next 120 days after enrolment. 3. Patient with an International Normalized Ratio (INR)≥ 1.5. 4. Patient with serum creatinine level ≥104 µmol/L (or 2.5mg/dL) at time of enrolment. 5. Patient with a platelet count ˂100x103 cells/mm3 or known platelet dysfunction at time of enrolment 6. Patient who has a known cardiac disorder, likely to be associated with cardioembolic symptoms such as atrial fibrillation 7. Patient with any condition that, in the opinion of the treating physician, would place the participant at a high risk of embolic stroke or with any medical comorbidity likely to affect the outcome (e.g. pulmonary disease, uncontrolled diabetes, blood disorders). 8. Patient with known allergies to nickeltitanium metal 9. Patient with known allergies to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel or other antiplatelet or P2Y12 agents or to general anesthesia. 10. Subject has resistance to Prasugrel based on a validated platelet testing method (Verify Now, Multiplate or other). 11. Patient with a life threatening allergy to contrast (patients with itching or rash as a reaction to contrast can be included if properly prophylactically treated). 12. Patient with inappropriate anatomy as demonstrated by angiography due to severe intracranial vessel tortuosity or stenosis, or intracranial vasospasm not responsive to medical therapy. 13. Patient who is currently participating in another clinical research study involving an investigational product. 14. Patient who has had a previous intracranial procedure associated with the target aneurysm such that access and placement of an eCLIPS device would be compromised 15. Stenting, angioplasty, or endarterectomy of an extracranial (carotid or vertebral artery) or intracranial artery within 30 days prior to the treatment date. 16. More than one intracranial aneurysm that requires treatment within 12 months. 17. Asymptomatic extradural aneurysms requiring treatment. 18. Severe neurological deficit that renders the subject incapable of living independently. 19. Unstable neurological deficit (i.e. worsening or improvement of clinical condition in the last 30 days. 20. Dementia or psychiatric problem that prevents the subject from completing required follow up. 21. Subject had a subarachnoid haemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrolment date. 22. Subject has a nontreated arteriovenous malformation in the territory of the target aneurysm. 23. Subject has a need for longterm use of anticoagulants. 24. Patient who is unable to complete the required followup. 25. Inability to understand the study or history of noncompliance with medical advice. 26. Evidence of active infection at the time of treatment. 27. Patient who is pregnant or breastfeeding. 28. Patient who has participated in a drug study within the last 30 days.</criteria>
