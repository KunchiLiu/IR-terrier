	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of treatment with pregabalin in patients with idiopathic small fiber neuropathy proven by skin biopsy.This is an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal study that comprises 4 phases: a screening and selection phase, a washout period from previous pain medication for enriched enrollment, an 8 week single blind pregabalin treatment phase; and a 4 week randomized withdrawal phase.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Pregabalin in Treatment of Neuropathic Pain in Patients With Idiopathic Small Fiber Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who show any increase in their pain intensity score during the washout phase will be eligible for the single blind pregabalin treatment phase. Patients who respond to pregabalin, with at least 1 point improvement in neuropathic pain from baseline at the end of the single blind pregabalin treatment phase and meeting all other study requirements are considered eligible for participation in the withdrawal phase. These eligible patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to continue pregabalin or to be switched to placebo for a comparison of pregabalin efficacy and safety. Patients who have a worsening of average pain relative to the last week of the single blind pregabalin treatment period by more than one point and average pain level &gt; =4 will be considered to have a loss of therapeutic response (LTR).</detailed_description>
