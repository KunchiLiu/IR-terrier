	<brief_summary>The main research question of this patient survey is to assess AF (Atrial Fibrillation) patients' preferences associated with different attributes which describe the different available anticoagulation treatment options (Vitamin K Antagonists [VKA] or New Oral Anticoagulants [NOACs] and, in case of NOACs, Apixaban, Dabigatran, Edoxaban or Rivaroxaban). VKAs (Marcoumar®, Sintrom ®) will be grouped together and compared to Rivaroxaban.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anticoagulation Preference by AF Patients Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to investigate the following research questions in a cross-sectional survey of German-speaking Swiss AF patients being treated either with a VKA or with a NOAC: - Which attributes of a medication to prevent stroke do AF patients view as important? - Do AF patients have a preference regarding the attributes of the medication options VKA or NOAC and, in case of NOACs, with regards to rivaroxaban attributes? - Are there subgroups of AF patients whose preference for one of the medication options appears above or below average? - What is the quality of life of Swiss German-speaking AF patients? Are there subgroups with differences in their quality of life (for example: subgroups of patients with different CHA2DS2-VASc scores)? - Which burden do German-speaking Swiss AF patients experience in association with their anticoagulation therapy? Are there differences in the burden of treatment (ACTS) between patients treated with VKA or with NOACs?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria for AF patients in both the NOAC and the VKA groups: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (persistent, paroxysmal, permanent), Age of at least 18 years at time of study inclusion, Generally willingness (informed consent) and ability to fill out a survey on satisfaction with treatment and quality of life, and to conduct a structured phone interview (approx. 20 30 min) in German language. Additional inclusion criterion for Group 1 (NOAC): Continuous anticoagulation with either Apixaban, or Dabigatran or Rivaroxaban for prevention of Stroke &amp; systemic embolism for at least the previous 3 months. Additional inclusion criterion for Group 2 (VKA): Continuous anticoagulation with a VKA for prevention of Stroke &amp; systemic embolism for at least the previous 3 months. Exclusion criteria for both groups: Participation in another study (clinical intervention / observational) within the 3 months prior to enrollment, Interruption of VKA/NOAC therapy of more than 2 weeks (bridging) within the prior 3 months or planned bridging in 4 weeks after study inclusion.</criteria>
