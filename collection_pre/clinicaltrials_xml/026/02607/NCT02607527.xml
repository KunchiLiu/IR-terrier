	<brief_title>Annular Reshaping of the Mitral Valve for MR Using the Millipede IRIS System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi center evaluation of the Millipede IRIS for treatment of clinically significant mitral regurgitation in subjects determined appropriate for mitral valve surgery. This trial is designed in accordance with the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines for valvular heart disease, and the consensus statement of MVARC 2015. Subjects will undergo transatrial implantation of the Millipede IRIS implant under two approaches. One (1) beating heart cardiopulmonary bypass. The second approach (2) up to Investigator discretion, subjects who qualify can be implanted with the Millipede IRIS via right mini thoracotomy. The two implant techniques may be used under this clinical protocol.</detailed_description>
