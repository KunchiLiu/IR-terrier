	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the optimal dosage and safety of Dalteparin when used as an anticoagulant for hemodialysis therapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Anticoagulation Method Using Dalteparin in Quotidian and Nocturnal Home Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Routine anticoagulation is required during hemodialysis treatments. In North America, the anticoagulant of choice for hemodialysis therapies is unfractionated heparin (UFH), whereas in Western Europe, it is low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Dalteparin is more commonly used in Canada and has been approved for use in the in-centre thrice-weekly hemodialysis population at a fixed dose of 5000 units. However, there have been no published studies to assess the use of dalteparin in home quotidian and/or nocturnal hemodialysis therapies. Patients on frequent hemodialysis or nocturnal hemodialysis in the home will be converted to Dalteparin from Heparin for 4 weeks to evaluate the optimal dosage and to assess its safety in this population</detailed_description>
