	<brief_title>Regulation of Intestinal and Hepatic Lipoprotein Particle Production by Blood Glucose in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be performed on healthy, lean, non-diabetic males and females who will participate two studies each in random order, 4 to 6 weeks apart. Study A: lipoprotein turnover with intravenous infusion of normal saline. Study B: lipoprotein turnover i.v infusion of glucose. In both studies, subjects will drink a liquid formula every hour to remain in a constant fed state and will be under conditions of pancreatic clamp (with the infusion of hormones somatostatin, insulin, glucagon, growth hormone). Subjects will be blinded with regard to the treatments.</detailed_description>
