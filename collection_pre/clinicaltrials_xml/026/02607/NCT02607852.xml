	<brief_title>BOQ Feedback Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this first phase of this proposal is to ascertain the feasibility and usefulness of a 'first draft' of the feedback system procedures and measures with a small, time limited sample of parents of children and clinicians and to describe the logistical and feedback characteristics encountered. The secondary objective of this first phase of the study is to determine clinicians' and parents perception of the experience of completing the BOQ+P and/ or the usefulness of the information that is fed back to the clinician and parent. For this reason we will collect a brief debriefing questionnaire from physicians and another from parents.</detailed_description>
