	<brief_title>25gr. Glucomedics vs 25gr. Zusto</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an experimental study enrolling 10 healthy female subjects. The study compares the blood glucose and insulin responses after consumption of 100ml water, sweetened with 25gr Zusto® and 100ml water sweetened with 25gr Glucomedics® (standard drink). Subjects need to be fasted for at least 8 hours before all visits. At visit 1, five women will consume the solution with 25gr Zusto®, the other five will have the solution with 25gr Glucomedics®. On visit 2, groups will be switched. Visit 1 and 2 will be performed within approximately one week interval. Both drinks will be identical in amount of water and only be different by the use of 25gr Glucomedics® and 25gr Zusto®. Before intake of the drink, vital signs, weight and bedside blood glucose and baseline blood samples - 15' and 0' for glucose, insulin and C-peptide will be taken at visit 1 and 2. Both drinks will be consumed within 5 minutes and time of start and end of intake of Zusto® / Glucomedics® will be documented. Blood samples for glucose, insulin and C-peptide will be taken at 15', 30', 60', 90', 120' and 180' after start of intake 25gr Zusto® and 25gr Glucomedics®.</detailed_description>
