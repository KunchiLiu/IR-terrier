	<brief_summary>With discovery of KIT mutations and the advent of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (GlivecTM, Novartis), there has been substantial improvement in overall survival in patients with advanced and/or metastatic gastrointestinal tumors (GIST). Recently, sunitinib (SuteneTM, Pfizer) showed activity as second-line therapy in GIST patients after failure with imatinib. However, virtually all patients will eventually progress or become intolerable after the first-line imatinib and the second-line sunitinib.</brief_summary>
