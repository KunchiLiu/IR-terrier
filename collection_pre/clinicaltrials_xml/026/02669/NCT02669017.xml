	<brief_summary>This study evaluates ADCT-402 in patients with Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lineage Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL). Patients will participate in a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2). In Part 2, patients will receive the dose level identified in Part 1.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ADCT-402 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lineage Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study ADCT-402-101 is the first clinical study with ADCT-402 in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). ADCT-402 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody directed against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1 (dose escalation) patients will receive an infusion of ADCT-402, at escalating doses. Part 1 will continue until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. In Part 2 (expansion), all patients will be assigned to the recommended dose level of ADCT-402 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering Committee. For each patient, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (until withdrawal), and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration will be dependent on overall patient tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment. It is anticipated that the duration of the entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could be approximately 3 years from first patient treated to last patient completed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients, ages 18 years or older with pathologically confirmed relapsed or refractory Bcell lineage NHL who have failed or are intolerant to established therapy, or for whom no other treatment options are available. Refractory or relapsed Bcell NHL (per World health Organization [WHO] Classification system) Availability of formalinfixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block. Measurable disease, as defined by the 2014 Lugano Classification. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/μL. Platelet count of ≥75000/μL. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL without transfusion within the 2 weeks prior to Day 1. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL. Serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); ≤ 5 times ULN if there is liver or bone involvement. Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN. Negative serum or urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (β HCG) pregnancy test within 7 days prior to Day 1 for women of childbearing potential. Males, and female patients who are biologically capable of having children, must agree to use a medically acceptable method of birth control. Patients who have any option for other treatment for Bcell NHL at the current state of disease. Active graftversushost disease. Autologous or allogenic transplant within the 60 days prior to the Screening visit. Known history of immunogenicity or hypersensitivity to a CD19 antibody. Evidence of myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia by morphology, immunostains, flow cytometry, or cytogenetics on a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy. Known history of positive serum human ADA. Active autoimmune disease, motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin, and other central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease. Known seropositive for human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), or antibody to hepatitis C virus (antiHCV). History of Steven's Johnson's syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Significant medical comorbidities, including uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 115 mm Hg), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (greater than New York Heart Association class II), severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia, poorly controlled diabetes, severe chronic pulmonary disease, coronary angioplasty, or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening, or uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias. Use of any other experimental medication(s) within 21 days prior to start of study treatment on Day 1. Steroid use equivalent to greater than 20 mg of prednisone within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to Day 1. Major surgery, chemotherapy, systemic therapy (excluding steroids), radiotherapy, or biotherapy targeted therapies within 21 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 treatment. Failure to recover from acute non hematologic toxicity (except alopecia), due to previous therapy, prior to Screening. Congenital long QT syndrome or a corrected QTc interval ≥450 ms at the Screening visit. Active second primary malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers, nonmetastatic prostate cancer, in situ cervical cancer, ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast, or other malignancy determined not be exclusionary. Any other significant medical illness, abnormality, or condition that would make the patient inappropriate for study participation or put the patient at risk.</criteria>
