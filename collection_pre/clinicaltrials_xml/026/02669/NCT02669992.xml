	<brief_summary>There are severel problems associated with the closing of a temporary loop-ileostomy after surgery for rectal cancer. The purpose of this study is to answer two questions: 1. The choice of anastomotic method - does it influence the postoperative course? 2. The use of a prophylactic mesh when closing the stoma site - will there be less hernias?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Loop Ileostomy Closure:Stapled or Hand-sewn Anastomoses? Suture or Mesh Closure of the Stoma Site?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative complications after closure of a temporary loop ileostomy after rectal cancer surgery are common. In this study the investigators propose the hypothesis that a stapled anastomotic technique will decrease postoperative small bowel obstruction and a mesh closure of the stoma site in the abdominal wall will decrease hernia formation. All patients will be randomized to stapled or hand-sewn anastomosis. The randomization to mesh or suture closure of the abdominal wall is optional. The stapled anastomotic technique is performed by the use of a linear staple device and the hand-sewn technique with a running seromuscular monofilament suture. The stoma site has two options and will be closed either by the use of mesh (lightweight), positioned under the muscle (retromuscular), or just by long-lasting suture. The anterior fascia of the rectus as well as the skin are closed by the use of running monofilament longlasting sutures, the latter in a pursestring procedure.</detailed_description>
