	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a posterior fossa decompression or a posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty results in better patient outcomes with fewer complications and improved quality of life in those who have Chiari malformation type I and syringomyelia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Posterior Fossa Decompression With or Without Duraplasty for Chiari Type I Malformation With Syringomyelia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with Chiari Malformation type I and syringomyelia will be randomized to either have a posterior fossa decompression done with or without duraplasty. The participant will then return to the neurosurgeon's office at the following time points which are consistent with standard of care practice: &lt; 6 weeks, 3-6 months, and 12 months. At these visits, the clinician will complete a physical exam and the participant will report on the prognosis of symptoms and complete two quality of life questionnaires. A brain and cervical spine MRI will be performed 12 months after the decompression.</detailed_description>
