	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of VX-210 in subjects with Acute Traumatic Cervical Spinal Cord Injury. Secondary objectives include the specific evaluation of the effects of VX-210 on neurological recovery and daily function after spinal cord injury.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), motor level of C4, C5, or C6 on each side (C4 subjects must have at least 1 point of motor activity between C5 and T1 on each side). American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A or AIS grade B. Scheduled and planned to undergo a spinal decompression/stabilization surgery that commences within 72 hours after the initial injury. Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is consistent with the subject's neurological deficit. Participation in any other clinical study for acute SCI. Inability to undergo decompression/stabilization surgery that commences within 72 hours after injury. One or more upper extremity muscle groups untestable during baseline American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) examination. Acute SCI from gunshot or penetrating/stab wound; nontraumatic SCI (e.g., transverse myelitis, acute disc herniation); brachial plexus injury; complete spinal cord transection; or multifocal SCI. Females who are breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy test. Body mass index (BMI) of â‰¥40 kg/m2 at screening. History of an adverse reaction to a fibrin sealant or its components. Unconsciousness or other mental impairment that precludes reliable International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) examination. Known immunodeficiency, including human immunodeficiency virus, or use of immunosuppressive or cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Any significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would significantly increase the risk of study enrollment and/or significantly interfere with study outcomes or assessments, in the judgement of the investigator.</criteria>
