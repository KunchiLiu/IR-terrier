	<brief_summary>Depression with ongoing insomnia is a common clinical presentation with patients. Clinical data suggests that patients with insomnia that receive concomitant treatment with a sleep aid experience a more robust antidepressant response along with a quicker response. The purpose of this clinical study is to compare the effectiveness of the FDA-approved insomnia medication suvorexant, also known as BelsomraÂ®, as add-on treatment to an antidepressant to that of placebo plus antidepressant treatment in patients with depression and residual or ongoing insomnia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Six Week, Randomized, Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled, Suvorexant Augmentation Study of Antidepressant Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Residual Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patients with depression suffer from residual insomnia. This study is a six week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial to study suvorexant augmentation of continuing antidepressant therapy against placebo with continuing antidepressant therapy. Patient volunteers must be on a stable antidepressant treatment and will remain on this treatment for the duration of the study. Patient volunteers that qualify and enroll in the clinical trial will either receive suvorexant 10 mg/day and may have it adjusted to a dose of either 15 mg or 20 mg/day. Treatment is for a total of six weeks in addition to a clinical follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
