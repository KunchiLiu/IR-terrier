	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to explore feasibility of testis functionality assessment and testis imaging obtained from Positron Emissions Tomography (PET) /Magnetic Resonance Imagine (MRI). Using advanced MRI metrics, investigators will study the three-dimensional structure of normal testis, the levels of specific elements and compounds in the tissues (which can only be found via these imaging techniques), and the directionality (and alterations in directionality) of tissue structure. Investigators hope to develop hypothesis that will in turn suggest bio-markers to be explored in subsequent clinical trials.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men with proven paternity desiring vasectomy who are over 18 years of age. Bilaterally absent testes, unilaterally or bilaterally undescended testes Patients who have proven azoospermia or no proven paternity Inability to tolerate MRI including conditions such as claustrophobia or inability to lay flat for &gt; 45 minutes. Presence of pacemaker/IImplantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) or perfusion pumps Ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial heart, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, bullets, tattoos near the eye, or steel implants. Substance abuse, medical, psychological, or social conditions that may interfere with the patient's participation in the study All women are excluded as such patients do not have the relevant anatomy being considered in this study Anyone from a vulnerable population will be excluded from the study</criteria>
