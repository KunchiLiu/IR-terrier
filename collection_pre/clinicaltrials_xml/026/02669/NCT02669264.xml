	<brief_summary>This study evaluates ADCT-402 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Patients will participate in a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2). In Part 2, patients will receive the dose level identified in Part 1.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ADCT-402 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study ADCT-402-102 is the first clinical study with ADCT-402 in patients with B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ADCT-402 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody directed against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1 (dose escalation) patients will receive an infusion of ADCT-402, at escalating doses. Part 1 will continue until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. In Part 2 (expansion), all patients will be assigned to the recommended dose level of ADCT-402 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering Committee. For each patient, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (until withdrawal), and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration will be dependent on overall patient tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment. It is anticipated that the duration of the entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could be approximately 3 years from first patient treated to last patient completed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients, ages 12 years and older, with relapsed or refractory BALL who have failed, or are intolerant to, any established therapy; or for whom no other treatment options are available. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02. Serum creatinine ≤1.5mg/dL. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); ≤5 times ULN if there is liver or bone involvement. Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN. Negative urine or serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit, for women of childbearing potential. Males, and female patients who are biologically capable of having children, must agree to use a medically acceptable method of birth control. Patients who have an option for other treatment for BALL at the current state of disease. Known active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. Patients with Burkitt's leukemia/lymphoma. Active graftversushost disease. Autologous or allogenic transplant within the 60 days prior to Screening. Known history of immunogenicity or hypersensitivity to a CD19 antibody. Known history of positive serum human ADA. Active autoimmune disease, motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin, or other central nervous system autoimmune disease. Known seropositive for human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), or antibody to hepatitis C virus (antiHCV). History of StevensJohnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Significant medical comorbidities, including uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure &gt;115 mm Hg), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (greater than New York Heart Association class II), severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia, poorly controlled diabetes, severe chronic pulmonary disease, coronary angioplasty, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Screening, or uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias. Use of any other experimental medication(s) within 21 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit. Major surgery, chemotherapy, systemic therapy (excluding hydroxyurea and steroids), radiotherapy, or biotherapy targeted therapies within 21 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit. Failure to recover from acute non hematologic toxicity (except alopecia), due to previous therapy, prior to Screening. Isolated extramedullary relapse. Congenital long QT syndrome or a corrected QTc interval of ≥450 ms at the Screening visit. Active second primary malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers, nonmetastatic prostate cancer, in situ cervical cancer, ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast, or other malignancy determined not be exclusionary. Any other significant medical illness, abnormality, or condition that would make the patient inappropriate for study participation or put the patient at risk.</criteria>
