	<brief_summary>Patients admitted for acute heart failure and undergoing right heart catheterization will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will undergo catheterization of the heart to obtain central cardiac pressure and other cardiac hemodynamic parameters. Subsequently, the subject will undergo a regional nerve block of the splanchnic nerves. Patients will remain in the catheterization lab for the duration of anesthetic block and will be continuously hemodynamically monitored. This study will be a prospective, uncontrolled clinical trial. The study will not be controlled as invasive monitoring of hemodynamics will be performed, allowing clear demonstration of a cause-effect relationship. The goal of the study is to provide proof of concept.</brief_summary>
