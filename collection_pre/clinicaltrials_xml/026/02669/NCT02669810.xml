	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this phase I/IIB is to evaluate the safety, the tolerance and the first efficacy trends of intracardiac injection of ProtheraCytes (autologous PB-CD34+ Stem Cells after automated ex-vivo expansion with the StemXpand machine) in patients with a De Novo acute myocardial infarction and decreased ejection fraction. ProtheraCytes will be reinjected using a dedicated catheter pushed through the femoral artery up to the left ventricle, thus avoiding open chest surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>De Novo Anterior wall AMI with or without ST segment elevation and with a detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values (troponin) with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit. LVEF ≤ 45% after stent(s) implantation: Combination of a LVEF ≤ 45 % and of anterior akinetic segment(s) by echography at Day 2 after stent(s) mplantations Age must be ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years Men and Nonpregnant nonlactating women who take efficacious contraceptive measures such as oral contraceptive medications or efficacious and permanent intrauterine device (drug eluted or not) (IUD) or subcutaneous permanent contraceptive implants or menopaused women (at least a 2 years confirmed menopause) or surgically sterilized women. Having previously signed a written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. LVEF remaining ≤ 45% assessed by cMRI at Day 7 +/ 2 days after stent(s) implantation. Identification of anterior akinetic segment(s) of interest assessed by cMRI at Day 7 +/ 2 days after stent(s) implantation. Identification of nonviability of anterior segment(s) of interest assessed by perfusion 99mTc SPECT uptake at a day between Day 7 +/ 2 days and Day 10 +/ 2 days after stent(s) implantation. Absence of stent(s) implantation Previous and known symptomatic CHF, from class II to IV (included) History of CABG surgery History of former significant mitral valve replacement surgery or heart transplantation. Severe valve disease: mitral, aortic stenosis / insufficiency. Diagnosis of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy due to valvular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, tachycardia, or myocarditis Aortic stenosis as determined as valve area less than 1 cm2 that prohibits.catheter access to LV Presence of a prosthetic / mechanical aortic or mitral valve or heart constrictive device. Documented presence of a known LV thrombus Sepsis Endocarditis Infectious pericarditis Pericardial tamponade Left ventricular aneurysm, collagen tissue disease Severe peripheral vascular disease precluding femoral artery access as determined at the time of original catheterization. Pacemaker, implantable cardiac defibrillator, and intracerebral aneurysm clips. History of metallic foreign body in their eye Severe claustrophobia Former or current aortic dissection Inadequate bone marrow function: Haemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL and Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109 / L Previous GCSF or other Hematopoietic Growth Factor administrations. Blood transfusion(s) within the previous 4 weeks (to exclude the potential of nonautologous ACPs (Angiogenic Cells Precursors) in the harvested blood). Hepatic failure or history of liver cirrhosis or hepatic severe impairment. Constitutional or acquired coagulopathy Treated chronic renal failure, or haemodialysis or renal severe impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30ml/min). Prior or concomitant malignancies except nonmelanoma skin cancer or adequately treated in situ cervical cancer or previous cancer in complete response without any treatment in the last 5 years. History of prior mediastinal radiation exposure Serious underlying medical conditions at the investigator's discretion, which could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial (e.g. ongoing infection, active autoimmune disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Systemic Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis). Chronic immunomudulatory or cytotoxic drug treatment intake. Active bleeding or major surgery within 1 month. Human immunodeficiency HIV12, HTLV1, HTLV2 (according to 2006/17/EC) Hepatitis B (without prior vaccination) and C (according to 2006/17/EC) Syphilis (according to 2006/17/EC) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Active participation in any other clinical trials Current or recent treatment (within the 60 days period before PTCA and stent(s) implantation) with another investigational drug or procedure). Any other coexisting medical or psychological condition that will preclude participation in the study or compromise ability to give informed consent. Requirement of i.v. catecholamines or mechanical hemodynamic support (aortic balloon pump) between Day 7 +/ 2 days and Day 10 +/ 2 days after stent(s) implantation.
