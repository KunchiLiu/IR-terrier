	<brief_summary>To demonstrate the efficacy of new product IVIG prepared by minipool technology as assessed by Bleeding Score and platelet count at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. The platelet response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects responding to treatment with an increase of platelet count from ≤ 20 x 10^9/L to ≥ 100 x 10^9/L and absence of bleeding (complete response) or platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and at least 2-fold increase the base line count with absence of bleeding (partial response), within the specified time frame.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To demonstrate the efficacy of new product IVIG prepared by minipool technology as assessed by Bleeding Score and platelet count at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. The platelet response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects responding to treatment with an increase of platelet count from ≤ 20 x 10^9/L to ≥ 100 x 10^9/L and absence of bleeding (complete response) or platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and at least 2-fold increase the base line count with absence of bleeding (partial response), within the specified time frame. Secondary: 1. To assess safety of mini-pool IVIG in patients with newly diagnosed ITP by assessing frequency of adverse events related to mini-pool IgG administration 2. To compare data on efficacy and safety of mini-pool IVIG with data obtained from literature on standard IVIG. Study population: Patients with newly diagnosed ITP attending Hematology clinic Ain Shams Children hospital Sample size: Seventy- two patients will be enrolled. They will be divided into 3 groups: Group A; platelet non enhancing group Group B; group receiving standard IVIG Group C; group receiving IVIG New product 24 patients in each group in a ratio 1:1:1.</detailed_description>
