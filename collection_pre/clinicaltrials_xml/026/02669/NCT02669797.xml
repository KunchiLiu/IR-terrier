	<brief_summary>This childhood obesity randomized controlled trial uses innovative methods, such as video feedback and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) to compare a family meals coaching intervention to a usual care condition in racially/ethnically diverse children ages 5-7 years and their families. The intervention utilizes in-home visiting methods targeting family meal quantity and quality delivered across a three-phased incremental 18-month period compared to obesity prevention messages delivered during well-child visits and monthly newsletters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Family Matters Intervention: Targeting Family Meals Using Technology to Reduce Childhood Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of the current study is to utilize state-of-the art methods and intervention techniques (i.e., EMI, video feedback, in-home visiting) in partnership with primary care to examine whether increasing the quantity and quality of family meals reduces childhood obesity. An individual randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted with socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse children ages 5-7 years at high risk for obesity (BMI ≥75%ile, or ≥50th%ile and parent BMI ≥ 25) and their families. Families will be randomly assigned to the family meals coaching (FMC) intervention or usual care. There will be three incremental phases of the 18-month intervention: (1) Interactive Learning (6 months; 12 in-home visits); (2) Making Changes (6 months; 8 in-home visits); and (3) Maintenance (6 months; 6 phone calls). Using in-home visits, video feedback about family meal behaviors (e.g., dietary healthfulness, parent feeding practices, interpersonal atmosphere), daily EMI prompts via smartphones, and well-child visits in primary care, families in FMC will be supported to increase the quantity and quality of family meals. The phases progressively provide less support for families to increase self-efficacy and sustainability of new behaviors. Usual care will include obesity prevention messages delivered at well-child visits (i.e., 5-2-1-0)44 and monthly mailings. Outcomes will be assessed at the end of each phase (6 months, 12 months), post-intervention (18 months) and 6 months post-intervention (24 months). Aim 1: Conduct an RCT comparing the family meals coaching (FMC) intervention to usual care in racially/ethnically diverse children ages 5-7 and their families to test the hypotheses that: Hypothesis 1: Family meal quantity and quality will significantly increase in households with children in the FMC condition compared to children in the usual care condition. Hypothesis 2: Children in the FMC condition will significantly increase their diet quality and reduce their BMI%ile compared to children in the usual care condition. Hypothesis 3: Parents in the FMC condition will show significant reductions in restriction and pressure-to-eat feeding practices as compared to parents in the usual care condition. Aim 2: Examine intervention "spillover" effects in other family members exposed to the intervention. Hypothesis 1: Family members in the FMC condition will significantly reduce their BMI/BMI%ile and increase healthful weight-related behaviors compared to family members in the usual care condition. Aim 3: Measure the cost-effectiveness of delivering the intervention via Patient Centered Medical Homes PCMHs. Hypothesis 1: The BMI%ile reduction resulting from the FMC intervention will be cost-effective.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The inclusionary criteria used to select participants includes: Boys and girls ages 57 years old who attend a University of Minnesota or Fairview primary care clinic, their primary caregiver, and at least one other family member. ≤3 family dinner meals per week: observational research has shown that youth who have three or more family meals per week are less likely to be obese ten years later. Thus, we will recruit families who report three or fewer family dinner meals per week in order to optimize the potential for change in family dinner meal frequency. We will use "family dinners" as the definition of family meals because the majority of families report having family dinners compared to breakfast or lunch family meals. Atrisk for childhood obesity, including: (1) age and gender adjusted BMI ≥75th percentile or (2) age and gender adjusted BMI ≥50th percentile and at least one parent with a body mass index (BMI) ≥25. One of the following race/ethnicities: Hispanic/Latino, African American, American Indian, or White. Speak English or Spanish. Exclusion Criteria. The exclusionary criteria used to select participants includes: Children with special dietary, physical, or behavioral needs. Noncustodial parents.</criteria>
