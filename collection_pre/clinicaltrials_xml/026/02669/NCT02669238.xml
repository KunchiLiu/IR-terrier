	<brief_summary>Endometriosis is a chronic relapsing disease characterized by the presence and proliferation of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. This is a serious disease, widespread, difficult to live with for the patients, but also difficult to treat for practitioners who take care of these patients. It affects 1.6% of the general population, but its incidence is 10 times higher (up 40%) in patients with infertility. It occurs mainly by complex chronic pelvic pain and a negative influence on fertility. It is a disease whose complexity can be explained to four levels. Firstly, through its extremely polymorphic character with intraperitoneal superficial forms, ovarian forms and deep sub-peritoneal forms. Secondly by the plurality of the main symptoms which are individually non-specific and the frequency and / or intensity is not correlated with the severity of the disease. This non-specificity of symptoms partially explains the long lead misdiagnosis, which vary by 5 to 11 years. Thirdly, by its prevalence which seems very high and largely underestimated. If its precise estimate in the general population is so complicated, it seems very high in many studies of patients supported surgically for gynecological reasons. These very large prevalence figures are observed when some consultations support the hypothesis of a widespread and probably insufficiently evaluated disease. Lately by its management, insufficiently amended, for which there is currently only a few scientifically supported recommendations. Chronic pain caused by the disease associated with altered sexuality to a loss of fertility significantly impacts the quality of life of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Subcutaneous Progestogen Implants in the Medical Management of Painful Endometriosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators propose a randomized trial comparing two medical alternatives: a continuous monophasic type of estrogen-progestin oral treatment of second generation versus the establishment of an etonogestrel contraceptive implant type. Are excluded from this study certain absolute surgical indications. Patients, by consenting to participate in the study, choose a medical care, which means not to be operated immediately. They are clearly informed about the various possible treatment alternatives. The benefits and risks of surgery and medical treatment they are explicitly presented. At any time during the study, patients who wish may discuss again a surgical treatment with their physician and stop the study drug if the decision of an intervention is taken.</detailed_description>
