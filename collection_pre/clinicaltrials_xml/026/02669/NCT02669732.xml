	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate change in insulin secretory capacity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as determined by hyperglycemic clamp after a 28-day oral administration of DS-8500a at 75 mg in a placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 crossover study. In addition, safety of this regimen will be examined in this study.</brief_summary>
