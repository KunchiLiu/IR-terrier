	<brief_title>Antimullerian Hormone in Endometriomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 5-10% fertile women are affected by endometriosis, and ovarian endometrioma is present in 17-44% of cases, with 40% of patients with endometriomas being sterile. However, the "gold standard" treatment is laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy and this therapy is associated with a diminished ovarian reserve, with a significant antimullerian hormone (AMH) decrease. Alcohol sclerotherapy is a new minimal invasive procedure in endometrioma treatment whose potential beneficial effect in fertility preservation is not still demonstrated. The investigators would like to demonstrate that this procedure improves fertility preservation and reduces morbidity and costs in contrast with conventional surgery. Moreover,the investigators would like to demonstrate that this procedure could be performed in different centers with similar results.</detailed_description>
