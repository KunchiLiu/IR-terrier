	<brief_summary>The fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) has been the preferred instrument for many years in the management of difficult tracheal intubation, and it is considered as a gold standard. The disposcope endoscope (DE) is a medical device for endotracheal intubation used in clinical practice recently.This study compares FOB and DE for awake orotracheal intubation in obese patients with anticipated difficult airway.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Disposcope Endoscope and Fiberoptic Bronchoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty obese patients with anticipated difficult airways were randomised to undergo awake orotracheal intubation by FOB(group F) or DE(group D) after conscious sedation. The conditions of orotracheal intubation, the time needed to view the vocal cords and to complete the orotracheal intubation, the hemodynamic changes and the adverse events including bradycardia, respiratory depression during orotracheal intubation, throat pain, hoarseness and memory after surgery were recorded. The ease of view the vocal cords and passing the tracheal tube through the glottis were also evaluated by using a visual analogue scale (VAS) by operator.</detailed_description>
