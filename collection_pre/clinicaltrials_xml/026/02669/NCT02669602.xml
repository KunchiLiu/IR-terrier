	<brief_title>Dynamic Mediterranean Prospective Cohort: the SUN Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SUN Project (University of Navarra Follow-Up Study) began in 1999, and currently more than 20,500 people participate. The Project is permanently open to new volunteers, and around 2,000 new participants are invited each year. A new questionnaire is sent to participants every two years. The questionnaires are named with the letter "Q," followed by the number of years that have passed since the participant first volunteered. The first questionnaire is titled "Q0" and is followed by "Q2","Q4", etc. The cohort is "dynamic" thanks to the fact that it is permanently open to new volunteers. Although the Project was created by the Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health of the University of Navarra, it now counts on the invaluable collaboration of other Spanish university centers. Thanks to the invaluable collaboration of our participants, the investigators are able to research cardiovascular diseases, depression, fertility, arterial hypertension, and car accident injuries, among other areas.</detailed_description>
