	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Norovirus (NoV) GI.1/GII.4 Bivalent Virus-Like Particle Vaccine against moderate or severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to genotype-specific (GI.1 and GII.4) NoV strains.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Immunogenicity of Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 Bivalent Virus-like Particle Vaccine in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine being tested in this study is called NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide. The norovirus vaccine is being tested to prevent acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to genotype-specific (GI.1 and GII.4) norovirus strains in healthy participants recruited from US military training installations. This study will look at the illness rate of AGE occurring &gt; 7 days after dosing due to genotype-specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains represented in the vaccine. The study will enroll between 2800 and 8700 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine - Placebo (dummy inactive solution) - this is a liquid that looks similar to the study drug but has no active ingredient All participants will receive one dose of study medication on Day 1 administered via intramuscular injection. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States at select military locations. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 45 days for participants in the Navy 53 days for participants in the Air Force, and 72 days for participants in the Marines. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit on the last day of study participation (Day 45, 53 or 72) for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
