	<brief_summary>Portal hypertension (an increase in blood pressure in the portal vein that carries the blood from the intestine and spleen to the liver) underlies most of the serious complications of liver cirrhosis. This randomised placebo controlled study in people with liver cirrhosis evaluates the acute effects serelaxin (RLX030) infusion on portal hypertension and liver blood flow.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serelaxin To Lower Portal Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the effects of the investigational drug serelaxin (a recombinant form of the peptide human relaxin-2) on portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis. The investigators will measure portal pressure by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and hepatic blood flow by indocyanine green (ICG) clearance to evaluate the potential benefits of the drug. In a recently completed small exploratory open-label phase 2 study (EudraCT no. 201200023626, NCT01640964), Part B demonstrated that serelaxin can lower portal pressure.</detailed_description>

Clinical imagingdiagnosed or biopsyproven liver cirrhosis of any aetiology 4. Evidence of portal hypertension either on imaging or previous endoscopy 5. Patients with large/grade 3 varices as identified by endoscopy within 6 months of screening must be in an endoscopic band ligation programme at the time of study entry 6. Suspected hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) â‰¥10 mmHg at baseline 1. Pregnancy or breast feeding 2. Severe liver failure defined by one of the following: Prothrombin activity &lt;40%, Bilirubin &gt;5 mg/dL (85umol/L), hepatic encephalopathy &gt; grade I 3. Presence of any noncontrolled and clinically significant disease that could affect the study outcome or that would place the patient at undue risk 4. Hepatocellular carcinoma 5. Portal vein thrombosis 6. Previous surgical shunt or TIPSS 7. Current use of betablockers or nitrates, any other drug therapy known to have an influence on portal pressure (diuretics permitted provided patients have been on a stable dose for at least 30 days) 8. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 month of enrolment 9. Arterial hypotension (sitting Systolic Blood Pressure &lt;100 mmHg) 10. Use of other investigational drugs within 5 halflives of enrolment, or within 30 days/until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline, whichever is longer 11. Long QT syndrome 12. Documented hypersensitivity to intravenous contrast agents and/or iodine 13. Severe renal impairment (eGFR&lt;30)</criteria>
