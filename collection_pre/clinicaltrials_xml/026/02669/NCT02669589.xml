	<brief_title>Investigating Different Anticoagulants for Renal Replacement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose of clinical trial: To evaluate the effect of regional citrate anticoagulation within the scope of continuous renal replacement (CRRT) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) on filter life span and 90-day all cause mortality. Patient population: critically ill patients with acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. Primary objective: Anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit is required in continuous RRT (CRRT). To this date, it is not clear which anticoagulant should be used for CRRT. Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) for CRRT in critically ill patients with AKI prolongs filter life span and reduces 90-day all cause mortality by approximately 8% (from 48% to 40%) compared to systemic heparin anticoagulation for CRRT</detailed_description>
