	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of fluorescence imaging on the location of colorectal transection lines based on evaluation of perfusion with indocyanine green, how it's going to affect surgical planning and its possible benefits in reducing anastomotic leakage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Indocyanine Green-enhanced Fluorescence Imaging on Bowel Transection in Left-sided Colorectal Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During surgery, the line of intended bowel transection would be determined by the surgeon. Then the anesthesiologist will administer a bolus of 5mg ICG intravenously (2.5mg/ml, 2ml), followed by 10ml normal saline flush. The perfusion of colon will be assessed via fluorescence angiography. The actual bowel transection, after ICG fluorescence study, would be compared with the intended bowel transection site. The difference in terms of distance and either more proximal or distal is recorded. Then bowel anastomosis is completed in the usual manner.</detailed_description>
