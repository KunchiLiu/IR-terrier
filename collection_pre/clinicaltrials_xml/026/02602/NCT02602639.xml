	<brief_summary>Currently, those with spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrate increased prevalence of obesity (75%) cardiovascular disease (30 - 50%), type II diabetes (21%) and osteoporosis in the legs (100%) when compared to the general population. It is important to identify the modes and intensities of exercise most likely to generate a reduction in these inactivity-related diseases in this population. Therefore, the main purpose of this pilot research project is to implement and test a form of a spinal cord injury-specific exercise, known as FES rowing (FES: functional electrical stimulation).</brief_summary>
