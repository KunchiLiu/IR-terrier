	<brief_title>Clinical Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of MUC1-DC-CTL Treatment in Stage IV Gastric Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PBMC of the patient will be separated from peripheral blood.DCs infected by MUC1 and pulsed by MUC-1 peptide are made respectively from PBMC, then they are respectively cultured with T cells into MUC1-gene-DC-CTL and MUC1-peptide-DC-CTL which will be infused to the patients as immunotherapy.</detailed_description>
