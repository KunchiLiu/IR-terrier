	<mesh_term>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient age ≥18 The patient requires mitral valve annuloplasty for mitral regurgitation without the need for concomitant cardiovascular surgical procedures NYHA functional capacity ≥2 The subject is high risk to undergo a mitral valve surgery as assessed by the center heart team The patient is willing to comply with study procedures and is available to return to the implant center for followup visits. The patient is willing to provide Informed consent Cardiac or noncardiac major or progressive disease, which in the investigator's discretion produces an unacceptable increased risk to the patient. Life expectancy of less than twelve months. Heavily calcified annulus or leaflets. Previous or active endocarditis. Active infection. A previously implanted prosthetic mitral valve or annuloplasty ring/band. The patient is contraindicated to general anesthesia. Pregnant (urine HCG test result positive) or lactating patient. Drug or alcohol abuse. Participation in concomitant research studies of investigational products that will interfere with the study.</criteria>
