	<brief_summary>Nausea after surgery may negatively influence patient satisfaction, may delay discharge, and cause unexpected hospital admissions. The trend toward ambulatory surgery has increased the focus on postoperative nausea, but published evidence is not based on standardized criteria for assessment. Therefore, the results for postoperative nausea are very diverse, especially reports on nausea incidence after regional anesthesia, i.e. spinal anesthesia. When peripheral nerve blocks have been applied for postoperative pain control, they significantly reduce postoperative pain, opioid consumption and side effects; patients receiving general anesthesia (GA) and nerve blocks are thought likely to have less nausea than patients receiving GA alone. This study is a pilot study looking at the incidence and intensity of nausea after orthopedic surgery under nerve blocks in foot and ankle (FA) patients and under nerve blocks with either sedation or GA in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) patients. The results of this study will help power a future randomized controlled trial, comparing the incidence and intensity of nausea in FA patients receiving GA through laryngeal mask airway (LMA) versus spinal anesthesia.</brief_summary>
