	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder. The management of atrial fibrillation is of great importance. Despite the presence of exercise intolerance, weight gain, and an associated decline in overall health and well-being in patients living with atrial fibrillation, recommended standard care does not currently include the prescription of exercise to address these significant health issues. Exercise training is a recognized form of treatment of persons with heart disease. An exercise program such as high-intensity interval training when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise training may provide a stronger training stimulus for exercise and clinical outcomes; may be more efficient and motivating; and, may help to improve adherence to exercise training in persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation patients. This has been shown in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure. The primary objectives of this prospective study are to examine the impact of high-intensity interval training compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise training in adults with persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation on exercise capacity and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Training in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (OPPORTUNITY Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder. Significant disease and death rates are associated with atrial fibrillation because of stroke risk, the complications of medications, poor quality of life and reduced exercise tolerance. Many patients report they have a lower quality of life because of this condition, so finding new ways of helping patients manage and cope with this health problem may help a great number of people. The management of atrial fibrillation is of great importance. Despite the presence of exercise intolerance, weight gain, and an associated decline in overall health and well-being in patients living with atrial fibrillation, recommended standard care does not currently include the prescription of exercise to address these significant health issues.
