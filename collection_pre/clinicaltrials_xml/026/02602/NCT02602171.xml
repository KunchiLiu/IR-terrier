	<brief_summary>The present study has the evaluation of a test to measure the localization performance goal . It is about the perception of danger audio signals in everyday listening environments nearby which are reproduced in controlled laboratory conditions. In addition, a dereverberation algorithm regarding speech intelligibility and localization ability is evaluated . The research hypothesis is that the dereverberation of the audio signals can improve speech intelligibility for both normal hearing and hearing-impaired persons. In addition, the binaural dereverberation algorithm should not affect the localization ability in everyday situations.</brief_summary>
