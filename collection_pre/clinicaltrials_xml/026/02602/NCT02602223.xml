	<brief_title>Comparison of Amnion Chorion Membrane vs. Dense Polytetrafluoroethylene Membrane in Ridge Preservation Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine if a biologically active commercially available amnion chorion membrane (ACM) is as effective as the commercially available inert dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane (D-PTFE) in preserving jaw bone dimensions and whether it provides the added benefit of reducing post-operative discomfort after dental surgery. The hypotheses for the study is that the use of ACM in preservation of bone dimensions in extraction socket will result in greater remaining horizontal and vertical ridge dimension, and reduced postoperative discomfort when compared with D-PTFE in sites where extraction socket will not be closed by advancing the gums. Subjects in need of single rooted teeth extraction on both left and right side of the same jaw will be recruited. Pre-surgical clinical and radiological measurements will be made using dental calipers, stents and reduced cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) three dimensional scans. Involved teeth will be extracted with minimal trauma. Freeze dried bone allograft (bone from human donors) will be used in all extraction sockets. ACM will be used in the one extraction socket and D-PTFE in the other extraction socket without advancing the gums to cover the socket. A Visual Analog Score (VAS), pain scale questionnaire will be given to record the postoperative discomfort and patient will be seen for routine post-operative monitoring as well as research measurements. At 3-months recall postoperatively, clinical measurements and radiographic measurements will be recorded as before. Wound fluid will also be collected at all visits. The sites will be reentered and trephine core (bone sample) will be collected for histomorphometric as well as microtomographic assessment. Statistical analysis will be performed to test the significance using a mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects needing bilateral nonmolar dental extractions in the same arch and consenting to a 2nd surgery for corebiopsy participated in the study. Subjects were required to be within the American Academy of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classifications ASA I or ASA II. Males between 1875 years and females between 1850 years of age were screened. inability or anticipated failure to maintain adequate oral hygiene; evidence of active periodontitis; pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, unstable systemic diseases or with compromised immune system (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, etc.) or unstable bleeding disorders; active infectious diseases (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis, HIV, etc.); mental disabilities that may hinder participation; active immunosuppressive therapy, cancer therapy and/or radiation to the oral cavity within last 6months; conditions/medications contraindicated for bone regeneration (e.g., methotrexate, steroids, bisphosphonates, cyclosporinA), and and selfreported tobacco usage (equivalent to &gt;20 cigarettes per day).</criteria>
