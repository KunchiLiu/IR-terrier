	<brief_summary>The central aim of this study is to test the efficacy of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), an intervention designed to disrupt the risk chain leading from chronic pain to prescription opioid misuse and addiction. The investigators plan to conduct a full scale clinical trial to determine whether MORE (relative to a support group control condition) can reduce symptoms of chronic pain and opioid misuse among patients who are receiving pain management in primary care via long-term opioid analgesic therapy.</brief_summary>
