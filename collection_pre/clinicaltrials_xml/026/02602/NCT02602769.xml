	<brief_summary>Rapid onset Obesity, Hypoventilation, Hypothalamic dysfunction and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a syndrome named in 2007. The hallmark of the syndrome is the rapid onset obesity and dysregulation of central ventilation. There is little information about the metabolic changes that lead to the rapid onset obesity in these children. The investigators would like to study the metabolic phenotype of these children to understand the disturbances in energy balance that lead to the rapid onset obesity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Phenotyping in Children With ROHHAD Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Late-onset hypoventilation syndrome with hypothalamic dysfunction was first described in 1965 and renamed to ROHHAD syndrome in 2007 by Ize-Ludlow et al. The hallmark of ROHHAD syndrome is rapid-onset obesity starting at approximately 1.5 years of age with weight gain of 12-20 kg/year, central hypoventilation distinct from the obstructive hypoventilation caused by obesity, hyperphagia, a spectrum of pituitary hormonal dysfunction, and autonomic disturbances including temperature, blood pressure, and nociception abnormalities. Some children have been noted with developmental and behavioral abnormalities. Tumors of neural crest origin have been identified in 25-33% of the patients. The etiology of ROHHAD syndrome and the cause of rapid onset obesity is unknown. The aims of this study are to understand the biological mechanisms behind rapid weight gain in early childhood in children with ROHHAD syndrome compared with age, sex and BMI matched controls. Aim 1. Determine if changes in the energy expenditure contribute to the severe obesity in children with ROHHAD syndrome: The investigators will perform detailed metabolic phenotyping including total energy expenditure by using doubly labeled water, resting energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry, body composition by Dual X-ray absorptiometry. The investigators anticipate that children with ROHHAD syndrome will have low total and resting energy expenditure compared to age-, sex- and BMI- matched controls. Aim 2: Determine if feeding and/or feeding signals in the postprandial period are dysregulated in children with ROHHAD syndrome: The investigators will measure spontaneous food intake, and following responses through the postprandial state: leptin, ghrelin and metabolic fuel concentrations (glucose, lipids and ketones). The investigators expect abnormalities in caloric intake adjusted for energy expenditure, peripheral hormonal signals of hunger and satiety, and metabolic fuel concentrations.</detailed_description>
