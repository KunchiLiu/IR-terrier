	<brief_summary>Investigators separated 20 patients with uterovaginal prolapse into 2 groups according to random numbers table. In one group, conventional abdominal sacral hysteropexy will be perform and another group bilateral abdominal sacral hysteropexy will be perform with polypropylene mesh. After 1 mont operation vaginal configuration will be evaluate with MRI on three plane (axial, sagittal, coronal). Then the results of thus two groups will be compare to results of nullipara patients. Investigators will investigate which technique keep the vaginal axis is closer to the original anatomic position.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Anatomic Results Between Bilateral and Conventional Abdominal Sacral Hysteropexy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since vaginal hysterectomy and mc call culdoplasty, many techniques have been described. Before, correcting only prolapsed part, now, we can measure anatomical and functional results more objectively by using different tool such us MRI, perineal ultrasonography, PISQ-12, IIQ-7 (Incontinence impact questionnaire). Hence pelvic organ prolapse surgery is important in terms of anatomic and functional results. Unilateral abdominal sacral hysteropexy can put vaginal axis to right side slightly. Therefore investigators hypothesized that bilateral sacral hysteropexy which mimic sacrouterine ligament can be more suitable in terms of anatomic results.</detailed_description>
