	<brief_title>Shaping Neural Activity Through Parenting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression and anxiety are among the most frequently diagnosed psychological disorders, with persistent patterns of impairment evident from childhood through adulthood. Impaired functioning of core brain systems that respond to reward and errors may increase risk for depression and anxiety. Importantly, these neural risk markers for depression and anxiety appear to be shaped, at least in part, by environmental input. Problematic parenting is a key environmental factor involved in the intergenerational transmission of depression and anxiety. Low positive parenting is associated with blunted brain responses to reward and harsh parenting is associated with heightened brain responses to errors. This study uses an evidence-based parenting program to test causal links between dimensions of positive and harsh parenting and children's brain responses to rewards and errors. Participants will include 80 6- to 7-year-old children and their mothers who will be randomly assigned to participate in a parenting program (Parent Child Interaction Therapy: PCIT) or to a waitlist control group, and brain responses to rewards and errors will be assessed pre- and post-intervention.</detailed_description>
