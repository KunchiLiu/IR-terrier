	<brief_title>Optimal Treatment for Recurrent Clostridium Difficile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of healthcare-associated infectious diarrhea among adults in industrialized countries. In addition to diarrhea, C. difficile infection (CDI) may also result in serious complications such as shock, toxic megacolon, colectomy, and death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated C. difficile results in 250,000 hospital infections, 14,000 deaths, and $1 billion in excess costs annually. Recurrent CDI is the most challenging clinical dilemma facing clinicians who treat this disease. An estimated 30% of patients who respond to initial treatment with either vancomycin or metronidazole develop recurrent CDI, usually within 1-4 weeks of completing treatment. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether 1) standard fidaxomicin treatment and 2) standard vancomycin treatment followed by taper and pulse vancomycin treatment are superior to standard vancomycin treatment alone for sustained clinical response at day 59 for all treatments, for participants with either their first or second recurrence of CDI. Veterans presenting with a first or second CDI recurrence will be screened, consented and randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to one of three treatment groups: 1) a 10 day course of oral vancomycin (VAN-TX), 2) a 10 day course of fidaxomicin (FID-TX) or 3) a 31 day course of vancomycin which includes a taper and pulse following daily treatment (VAN-TP/P). Symptom resolution is defined as an improvement or resolution of diarrhea (&lt;3 unformed bowel movements over 24 hours) for 48 consecutive hours compared to the participant's baseline. Recurrence is defined as having diarrhea (&gt;3 loose or semi-formed stools over 24 hours for 48 consecutive hours). A sample size of 546 randomized study participants is required to obtain at least 82% power to detect a 16% absolute difference (expected proportion of 31% in the VAN-TX group) in sustained clinical response (D- COM) proportion 1) between the FID-TX group and the VAN-TX group and 2) between the VAN-TP/P group and VAN-TX group at the 0.05 significance level. The study is expected to complete enrollment in 4 years with 90 days of follow-up. Twenty four sites, including 6 pilot sites, will be required to enroll approximately 0.6 participants per month (7 every year), or 21 participants per site (28 participants per pilot site) over 4 years (546 participants total). This assumes that 30% of Veterans with CDI have a recurrence and 20% of them will enroll in the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Informed consent obtained and signed Age &gt; 18 If female, participant must not be pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test required for females of child bearing age Confirmed current diagnosis of CDI, determined by having &gt;3 loose or semiformed stools for participants over 24 hours AND Positive stool assay for C. difficile EIA positive for toxin A/B; or Cytotoxin assay; or Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT, PCR or LAMP) based detection of toxigenic C. difficile Current episode represents the first recurrent episode of CDI within 3 months of the primary CDI episode in a patient who has not had CDI in the 3 months prior to the primary episode OR a second recurrent CDI episode occurring within 3 months of the first recurrent episode, as defined above At least one of the previous CDI episodes must have been confirmed by a stool assay for C. difficile Inability to provide informed consent Inability to take oral capsules Receipt of &gt;48 hours of antibiotics considered effective in the treatment of CDI, including: metronidazole vancomycin fidaxomicin nitazoxanide oral bacitracin fusidic acid rifaximin cholestyramine Known presence of fulminant CDI, including hypotension, severe ileus or GI obstruction or incipient toxic megacolon Receipt of more than a single course of oral vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or a vancomycin tapering regimen since the primary episode of CDI as defined above Known allergy to vancomycin or fidaxomicin Acute or chronic diarrhea due to inflammatory bowel disease or other cause (e.g., presence of an ileostomy or colostomy) that would confound evaluation of response to CDI treatment Anticipation of need for long term systemic antibiotic treatment (beyond 7 days)</criteria>
