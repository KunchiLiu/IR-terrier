	<brief_summary>Aims:To explore the consciousness stimulation role of DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) and TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Simulation) for DOC (Disorders of Consciousness) patients. Methods:Seventy-five DOC patients will be randomised into three groups: DBS group, TMS group and Control group. Three months after treatments, the result will be analysed and concluded.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To explore the consciousness stimulation role of DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) and TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) for DOC (Disorders of Consciousness) patients. Seventy-five DOC patients will be randomised into three groups: DBS group, TMS group and Control group. These patients will be recorded the conscious level and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) evaluation before treatment of research, and three months later the prognosis were also recorded. Finally, the variation of consciousness, prognosis and fMRI index for three groups will be analysed and compared. Hopefully, there will be a conclusion for these treatments to DOC patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients ages 14 to 65 years old; 2. DOC patients, including vegetative state and minimally consciousness state. 3. With normal body temperature, stable vital signs, spontaneous breathing without extra oxygen supply, no tracheotomy using metal trachea cannula, and feasible for magnetic resonance inspectors; 4. Written informed consent from patient families 1. History with nervous or spirit disorders, or some other serious diseases such as cardiac or pulmonary problems; 2. Patients with VP shunt or ommaya implantation, which may effects magnetic resonance scan signal analysis; 3. Body temperature is abnormal, vital signs is not stable, still need ventilator to support breathing; Plentiful sputum needed suction during MRI scans.</criteria>
