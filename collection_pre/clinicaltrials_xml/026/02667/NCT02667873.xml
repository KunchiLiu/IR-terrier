	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Trial of a Novel XPO1 Inhibitor in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study SL-801-0115 is a first-in-human, dose-escalation study in patients with advanced (i.e., metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable) solid tumors that are resistant to or relapsed following available standard systemic therapy or for which there is no standard systemic therapy and additional radiation therapy or other loco-regional therapies are not considered feasible. Eligible patients will be enrolled and receive treatment with SL-801 in a 21-day cycle. SL-801 will be administered orally and the dose regimen will depend on the cohort in which the patient is enrolled. The study plans to enroll 40-50 adult patients at multiple study centers in the US.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The patient must have histologic or cytologic evidence of a malignant solid tumor and must have disease that is resistant to or relapsed following available standard systemic therapy, or for which there is no standard systemic therapy or reasonable therapy likely to result in clinical benefit. The patient must have advanced disease, defined as cancer that is either metastatic, OR locally advanced and unresectable (and for which additional radiation therapy or other locoregional therapies are not considered feasible). The patient must have disease that is measurable by standard imaging techniques, per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), or evaluable per RECIST 1.1. (For patients with prior radiation therapy, measurable lesions must be outside of any prior radiation field[s], unless disease progression has been documented at that disease site subsequent to radiation.) The patient is ≥18 years old. The patient has an ECOG PS of 02. The patient has adequate baseline organ function, as demonstrated by the following: Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min. Serum albumin ≥2.5 g/dL. Bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional ULN. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 × institutional ULN (patients with hepatic metastases must have AST/ALT ≤5 times ULN). International normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5 or prothrombin time (PT) ≤1.5 × ULN; and either partial thromboplastin time or activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT or aPTT) ≤1.5 × ULN. The patient has adequate baseline hematologic function, as demonstrated by the following: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5×10⁹/L Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL, with no red blood cell (RBC) transfusions within the prior 14 days. Platelet count ≥100×10⁹/L, with no platelet transfusions within the prior 14 days. If the patient is a woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP), she has had a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment. The patient (male and female) agrees to use acceptable contraceptive methods for the duration of time on the study, and continue to use acceptable contraceptive methods for 1 month after the last dose of SL801. The patient has signed informed consent prior to initiation of any studyspecific procedures or treatment. The patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements, including followup for survival assessment. The patient has persistent clinically significant ≥Grade 2 toxicities from previous anticancer therapy (excluding Grade 2 chemotherapyrelated neuropathy which is permitted, and excluding Grade 23 laboratory abnormalities if they are not associated with symptoms, are not considered clinically significant by the Investigator, and can be managed with available medical therapies). The patient has received treatment with chemotherapy, externalbeam radiation, or other systemic anticancer therapy within 14 days prior to C1D1 (28 days for prior nitrosourea or mitomycinC). (Patients with advanced prostate cancer who are receiving luteinizing hormone releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists are permitted onto the study and should continue use of these agents during study treatment). The patient has received treatment with an investigational systemic anticancer agent within 14 days prior to C1D1. The patient has previously received treatment with SL801 or another investigational agent that inhibits the XPO1/CRM1 pathway. The patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of the study endpoints. Patients with a past cancer history (active malignancy within 2 years prior to study entry) with substantial potential for recurrence must be discussed with the Sponsor before study entry. Patients with the following concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: nonmelanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ (including transitional cell carcinoma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia), organconfined prostate cancer with no evidence of progressive disease. The patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or any New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure [Appendix 1], uncontrolled angina, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within 6 months prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmias not controlled by medication). The patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that, in the Investigator's opinion, would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications during the study. The patient has known active or suspected brain or leptomeningeal metastases. (Central nervous system [CNS] imaging is not required prior to study entry unless there is a clinical suspicion of CNS involvement). Patients with stable, treated brain metastases are eligible provided there is no evidence of CNS disease growth on imaging for at least 3 months following radiation therapy or other locoregional ablative therapy to the CNS. The patient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy for prophylaxis following a prior organ transplant (solid organ or allogeneic stem cell). Lowdose corticosteroid therapy is permitted. The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding. The patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus active or chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. The patient is oxygendependent. The patient has any medical condition which in the opinion of the Investigator places the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.</criteria>
