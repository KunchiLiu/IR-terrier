	<brief_summary>This observational study seeks to identify and validate novel soluble biomarkers (within blood, synovial fluid, urine) which contribute to the prognostic assessment of an individual with an acute knee injury, a group of individuals in which ~50% will progress to symptomatic radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA). 150 individuals will be followed over 5 years with clinical assessment including validated questionnaires, biological sampling and radiological imaging (X ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)).</brief_summary>
