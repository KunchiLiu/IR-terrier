	<brief_summary>FGF-21 and insulin are key hormones in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, both hormones are influenced by physical activity. The following hypothesis will be tested: FGF-21 is regulated insulin-dependent during exercise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FGF-21 and Exercise in Relation to Insulin Secretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by rising global importance. In Germany alone, more than seven million people are being treated currently. T2DM is characterized by permanently elevated blood glucose levels, based on insulin resistance and followed by associated beta cell failure. In our previous work the investigators could already shown that increased FGF-21 levels are accompanied by an increased risk of T2DM. Physical activity is essential in the treatment and the prevention of T2DM. Interestingly, it was shown that acute physical exercise was leading to decreased insulin levels and increased FGF-21 values. In this study the effects of acute physical activity on FGF-21 values should be investigated in 3 groups: a) Healthy volunteers b) persons with T2DM c) persons with T1DM.</detailed_description>
