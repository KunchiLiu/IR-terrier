	<brief_title>Evaluation of SODB® in Metabolic Adaptations in Overweight Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beneficial experimental results have already been obtained with SODB®. That is why, the investigators expect several effects of SODB® here. Indeed, this clinical study could show that SODB® is able to induce endogenous antioxidant defence, and then reduce oxidative stress generally observed in overweight adipose tissue. Moreover, this study could evaluate the impact of a decrease in oxidative stress on the others overweight-induced disorders, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, fibrosis, lipolyse alterations.</detailed_description>
