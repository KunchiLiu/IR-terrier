	<brief_title>Maximal Plantar Pressure and Comfort Evaluation of Orthopedic Stilettos</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>22 women Testing "orthopedic" stilettos compared to standard stilettos and a comfy trainer testing involved pedobar pressures and a validated comfort questionnaire. x rays with arthrosis 1. metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ), hallux valgus and Intermetatarsal (IM) angles will be recorded. Clinically, weight, height, foot length, heel valgus, 1. MTPJ range of motion, pain, callus, hammertoes will be recorded. Sole pressure in heel, arch and forefoot grids measured by in-sole pressure pedar-x (Novel) and possible Emed system (Novel). 3 working days in each type of shoe with Steps measured by pedometer Comfort assed as VAS according to: Mundermann,A., Nigg,B.M., Stefanyshyn,D.J., and Humble,R.N.: Development of a reliable method to asses footwear comfort during running. Gait Posture, 16:38-45, 2002. Primary outcome is the foot sole pressures. Both VAS comfort and foot pressures will be regressed to see if age, BMI, shoe size, steps, shoe type, callus, index minus, hallux valgus etc has an effect. 16 needed for the pressure and 21 for the comfort score. 22 will be included to make sure the investigators have enough power.</detailed_description>
