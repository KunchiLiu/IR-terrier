	<brief_summary>The study is being done to assess the ability of the radiotracer 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 to image atherosclerotic plaque that may rupture and break off artery walls. This is caused by apoptosis or cell death in the plaque. These ruptured plaques can block blood circulation in the arteries causing a lack of oxygen to the tissues. Atherosclerotic plaques can build up on any artery in the body.</brief_summary>

No significant carotid artery disease on carotid ultrasound; 7. No clinically significant abnormalities in baseline laboratory values. 1. Previous carotid stenting or endarterectomy, stroke or transient ischemic attack; 2. Diagnosis of vasculitis, dissection, or nonatherosclerotic carotid disease (EhlersDanlos, Marfans); 3. Pregnancy or lactation; 4. History of any disease or relevant physical or psychiatric condition or abnormal physical finding which may interfere with the study objectives at the investigator judgment; 5. Know hypersensitivity to the investigational product or any of its components; 6. Claustrophobia or inability to lie still in a supine position; 7. Participation in another clinical trial within 4 weeks before study inclusion, except for patients who have participated or who are currently participating in a study without any study drug administration; 8.
