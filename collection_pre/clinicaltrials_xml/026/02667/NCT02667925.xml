	<brief_summary>The treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is based on the combination of chemotherapy based on platinum salt and surgery whose quality is the major prognostic factor. A meta-analysis of retrospective series had shown that for every 10% increase in the complete cytoreduction rates were increased by 5.5% overall survival time (Markman et al, 2001). Currently, it is recognized that the best chance of survival conferred to patients whose initial surgical residue is zero (Harter et al, 2009). However, even if macroscopically complete surgery and whatever the type of systemic chemotherapy, peritoneal recurrence remains high for more than 75%. To reducing it of recurrence, a therapeutic approach is to administer chemotherapy intraperitoneally. The intraperitoneal chemotherapy consists to administer the drug directly into the peritoneal cavity. Alberts et al, 1996 and Armstrong et al, 2006 compared the efficacy in terms of survival of an intraperitoneal chemotherapy according to this method with a conventional systemic chemotherapy. Alberts reported a significant improvement in the median overall survival. Armstrong shows in addition a decreased risk of recurrence. It must be remembered that: - The establishment of an intra-abdominal catheter does not always ensure complete flow of drugs into the peritoneal cavity (major postoperative adhesions). - There may be problems of catheters becoming blocked and requiring local treatment; these problems can cause abdominal pain whose care is difficult. Thus almost half of patients fail to get all six courses of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Thus, the investigators propose to estimate the flow of intraperitoneal chemotherapy with IP peritoneal scintigraphy, using a radiotracer (nanocis®). The investigators hypothesize that the movement of colloids in peritoneal cavity is similar to the circulation of chemotherapy within the peritoneal cavity (From Forni et al, 1993, Varia et al, 2003, Young et al, 2003, Dawson et al, 2011). The accumulation of radiotracer will be more correlated with abdominal pain sites described by the patient as well as peritoneal recurrence sites found during monitoring.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of female cancer and the leading cause of death among gynecological cancers (Alberts et al, 2002). The treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is based on the combination of chemotherapy based on platinum salt and surgery whose quality is the major prognostic factor. A meta-analysis of retrospective series had shown that for every 10% increase in the complete cytoreduction rates were increased by 5.5% overall survival time (Markman et al, 2001). Currently, it is recognized that the best chance of survival conferred to patients whose initial surgical residue is zero (Harter et al, 2009). However, even if macroscopically complete surgery and whatever the type of systemic chemotherapy, peritoneal recurrence remains high for more than 75%. To reducing it of recurrence, a therapeutic approach is to administer chemotherapy intraperitoneally. The intraperitoneal chemotherapy consists to administer the drug directly into the peritoneal cavity at a frequency that is related to systemic chemotherapy (every 3 weeks). Alberts et al, 1996 and Armstrong et al, 2006 compared the efficacy in terms of survival of an intraperitoneal chemotherapy according to this method with a conventional systemic chemotherapy. Alberts reported a significant improvement in the median overall survival (49 vs 41 months). Armstrong shows in addition a decreased risk of recurrence. It must be remembered that: - The establishment of an intra-abdominal catheter does not always ensure complete flow of drugs into the peritoneal cavity (major postoperative adhesions). - There may be problems of catheters becoming blocked and requiring local treatment; these problems can cause abdominal pain whose care is difficult.
