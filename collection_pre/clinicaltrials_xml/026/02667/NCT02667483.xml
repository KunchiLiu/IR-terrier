Glucocorticoidnaive patients, or patients who have used glucocorticoids for at least 6 months prior to enrollment in this study with no dose changes for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. A genetic mutation that can not be expected the expression of dystrophin protein by dystrophin gene exon 45 skipping. A concurrent illness other than DMD that can cause muscle weakness and/or impairment of motor function. Current or history of severe disorder. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LEVF) &lt;55%.
