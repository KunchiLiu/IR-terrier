	<brief_summary>Meta-analyses indicate beneficial effects of cognitive training and cognitively challenging video games on cognition. However, cognitive effects of solving jigsaw puzzles - a popular, visuospatial cognitive leisure activity - have not been investigated, yet. Thus, the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of solving jigsaw puzzles on visuospatial cognition. As secondary aims, effects on psychological outcomes (self-efficacy, perceived stress, well-being) and visuospatial everyday functioning (instrumental activities of daily living and self-reported cognitive failures in everyday life) are examined.</brief_summary>
