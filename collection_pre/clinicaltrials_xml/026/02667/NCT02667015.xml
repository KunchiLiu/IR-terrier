	<brief_summary>The aim of the current study is to develop and pilot test an anxiety sensitivity-based intervention for co-occurring substance use disorders (SUDs) and anxiety. Research questions include determining whether a broadly-applicable AS-based intervention can significantly decrease both substance misuse and anxiety. Secondary aims include examining the impact of this intervention on general functioning and depressive/anxious symptoms. In phase I, an initial pilot was conducted to examine the feasibility, safety, and patient satisfaction with the protocol, and to estimate potential efficacy of the protocol. In phase II, participants will be randomized to the intervention or a control condition.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the current study is to develop and pilot test an anxiety-sensitivity based intervention for co-occurring SUDs and anxiety. In the proposed study, the investigators will develop, refine, and pilot-test an innovative cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for patients who suffer from substance use disorders as well as anxiety. The goal of the research group in the proposed study is to design a protocol that can be testable on a larger sample within an externally-funded, randomized controlled trial. The investigators plan to submit a proposal for this larger grant to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as outlined in our external funding statement. Research questions include determining whether a broadly-applicable anxiety sensitivity based intervention can significantly decrease both substance misuse and anxiety. Secondary aims include examining the impact of this intervention on general functioning and depressive/anxious symptoms. In this translational research project, strategies that have been demonstrated to impact the psychological mechanisms thought to underlie both illnesses will be tested in a "real world" clinical setting.</detailed_description>
