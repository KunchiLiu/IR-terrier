	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine which mindfulness-based intervention protocol, MBCT or MBSR, is more suited for use among local carers of people with dementia (PWD), as measured by better mental health outcomes in PWD such as reductions in stress and improvements in mental well-being.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study on the Use of Mindfulness-based Intervention for Family Carers of People With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 subjects will be recruited in the community and randomized into either the MBCT or MBSR group. Both MBSR and MBCT will be delivered through a face-to-face teaching session followed by regular telephone follow-ups. The primary outcome measures of the dementia caregivers will be stress with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1988). The secondary outcome measures of the dementia caregiver will be 1) anxiety with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmon &amp; Snaith, 1983), 2) depression with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977), and 3) burden with Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI; Zarit, Reever, &amp; Bach-Peterson, 1980). The control measure will be their level of mastery of the five facets mindfulness with Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, &amp; Toney, 2006). Focus group interviews with each group of participants will be conducted post-intervention to explore their experiences and perceptions. Data will be collected at baseline (T0), at 2 months (the mid-point of the intervention; T1), 4 months (immediately after the intervention; T2), and 7 months (the follow-up assessment; T3). Adherence rates, response rates, and drop-out rates will be collected and analyzed. The triangulation of both qualitative and quantitative data will be performed to determine the suitability and benefits of MBSR and MBCT for carers of PWD in the local setting.</detailed_description>
