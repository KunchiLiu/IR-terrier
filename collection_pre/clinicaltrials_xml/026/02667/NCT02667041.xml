	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating illness that affects millions of individuals in North America and can result in clinical symptoms including loss of pleasure and feelings of worthlessness, in addition to significant cognitive impairments (e.g., memory, attention) that affect daily functioning. Major depression bears a heavy burden for the individuals and family members afflicted, as well as an enormous health care and economic cost. Approximately half of major depressive patients seek out treatment for their illness and only 20% of those individuals report their treatment as satisfactory. Many MDD patients do not respond to pharmacological therapy following the first course of treatment, resulting in the need for alternative measures to alleviate the clinical and cognitive symptoms of treatment-resistant depression and the targeting of these therapies to better suit each individual patient. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well-accepted, non-invasive technique that utilizes currents to induce electrical fields that excite specific brain regions. The current recommended practice of rTMS involves the administration of a biphasic stimulus waveform; however, a novel method using monophasic pulses may prove more effective for the treatment of depression. The present study aims to determine the effect of monophasic rTMS compared to biphasic rTMS on cognitive processing in MDD patients through electrophysiological recordings of the brain taken before and after 6 weeks of stimulation. Additionally, the study aims to investigate various biological markers linked to clinical rTMS response; these brain markers will help in personalizing treatment for individuals suffering from MDD.</brief_summary>
