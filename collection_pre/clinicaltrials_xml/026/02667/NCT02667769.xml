	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study with a "crossover design", where fasting with a day of complete fasting and a fasting day with the permission intake of calories- and carbohydrate-free foods are compared in a randomized order. Underlying hypothesis is that at the same basal insulin substitution with the fasting of both protocols , no significant differences in the glucose-day or -night profiles revealed. So the same conclusions regarding the "consistency" of basal insulin dosing revealed during the implementation of the part of patients is rated as more pleasant when calories and carbohydrates-free food are allowed.</brief_summary>
