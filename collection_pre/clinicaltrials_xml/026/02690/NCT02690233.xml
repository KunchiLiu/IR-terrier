	<brief_summary>This study on minor surgery serves to explore whether a dose-response relationship exists between surgical stress and endothelial dysfunction in the early postoperative period. The aim of this explorative and observational clinical study is to closely examine the endothelial function and its dynamics in the early postoperative period after minor surgery (lap. inguinal hernia repair). The endothelial function will be assessed indirectly by EndoPat and plasma biomarkers of nitric oxide bioavailability. The study will contribute to the understanding of perioperative myocardial injury, which is crucial for optimized treatment of patients at risk of cardiovascular complications.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will include 60 patients undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair. The endothelial function will be measured before surgery and 4 hours after surgery with the EndoPat system. The NO-bioavailibility will be measured by plasma l-arginine, plasma ADMA and plasma biopterins.</detailed_description>
