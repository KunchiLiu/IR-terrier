	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ABY-035</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first in human study with ABY-035 (a novel IL-17A inhibitor (interleukin 17A)) consists of four Parts. Part A consists of a single ascending intravenous dose study with 40 healthy volunteers divided into five dose cohorts. Each group consists of 8 subjects where 6 subjects will receive ABY-035 and 2 will receive placebo. The subjects will be followed for pharmacokinetic and safety assessments up to Day 95 after dosing. Part B of the study consists of 6 healthy volunteers who will be given a single subcutaneous dose of ABY-035. The subjects will follow the same study visit schedule as Part A. Part C of the study will include up to 12 moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients who each patient will be given a single intravenous dose of ABY-035. The patients will follow the same study visit schedule as Part A and B. Part D of the study will include 6 moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients. Each patient will participate in 3 dosing occasions of subcutaneously administered ABY-035 at Day 1, Day 15 and Day 29. Patients will be followed regularly for safety and efficacy up to 16 weeks post-final dose.</detailed_description>
