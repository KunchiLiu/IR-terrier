	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if patient birthing experiences differ between the family-centered and traditional cesarean methods. We hypothesize that the family-centered cesarean method will lead to more unique and personalized cesarean birthing experiences without increasing the risks of adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes from those documented with the traditional cesarean.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be consented and randomized to one of two delivery methods by the research coordinator, resident physician, charge nurse or nurse on the day of their planned cesarean section. Several variables of interest will be collected via the electronic medical record and within the OR. Additionally, assessment of patient satisfaction will be conducted following delivery. Questions from an 11-item questionnaire will be asked of the patient by the study coordinator, resident physician, nurse or charge nurses.</detailed_description>
