In this study, patients are recruited from St. Olavs Hospital and Trondheim Municipality Emergency Clinic with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria Aged â‰¥between 16 and &lt; 60 years Have sustained a traumatic brain injury Exclusion criteria Severe TBI (GCS score 8 or less) Non fluency in Norwegian Living outside of Norway Major other trauma with high risk of disability lasting more than 3 months.
