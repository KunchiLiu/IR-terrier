	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study will be to describe the tolerability of treatment with the optimal dose of LCZ696 (97.2 mg sacubitril / 102.8 mg valsartan bid), over six (6) months, in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in Canada. The study will also describe the overall tolerability, effectiveness and safety of LCZ696 for the management of HFrEF over 12 months of treatment, as well as describe the patterns of LCZ696 up and down dose titrations occurring during the management of patients with HFrEF.</brief_summary>

History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical classes. 9. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases. 10. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test. 11. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during dosing of study treatment. Effective contraception methods are described in the protocol. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
