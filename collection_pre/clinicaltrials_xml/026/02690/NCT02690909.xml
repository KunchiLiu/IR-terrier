	<brief_summary>The ReDy™ System (Renal Dynamics) is a renal denervation device incorporating a variety of ablation features and technical improvements over previously designed systems into a single product. It is intended to treat uncontrolled (drug-resistant) hypertension by RF ablation of the sympathetic nerve network surrounding the renal arteries. This study will be carried out to validate the safety and the efficacy of the ReDy™ Renal Denervation device and to demonstrate that it performs according to its intended use, i.e. the treatment of patients with uncontrolled hypertension.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Patient has established hypertension (diagnosed ≥12 months prior to screening) and is on a guideline based stable drug regimen (≥ 4 weeks), consisting of ≥3 antihypertensive medications of different classes including a diuretic; 2. Office systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg; 3. Patient has (under directly observed therapy) average daytime systolic blood pressure values &gt; 140 mmHg by 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; 4. Patient is ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age at time of consent; 5. Patient must be able and willing to comply with the required followup schedule; 6. Patient must be able and willing to provide written informed consent; Exclusion criteria: 1. Patient has known significant renovascular abnormalities such as renal artery stenosis &gt; 30%; 2. Patient has "Isolated Systolic Hypertension" with a diastolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg; 3. Evidence or history of secondary hypertension, other than sleep apnea syndrome; 4. Patient has a history of prior renal angioplasty, renal denervation, indwelling renal stents, and/or abdominal aortic stent graft placement; 5. Patient has significant valvular heart disease; 6. Patient has known coagulation abnormalities; 7. Patient life expectancy is &lt; 12 months, as estimated by the study Investigator; 8. Patient is participating in another clinical study, which is before its primary endpoint and/or has the potential to impact his/her hypertension management (pharmaceutical / device); 9. Patient is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential and is not using adequate contraceptive methods; 10. Patient has active systemic infection; 11. Patient has small &lt;4.0 mm in diameter, large &gt;6.5 mm in diameter or short &lt;20.0 mm in length, multiple main, or highly tortuous renal arteries; 12. Patient has impaired renal function with an estimated GFR &lt;45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula; 13. Patient had a renal transplant or is awaiting a renal transplant; 14. Patient has a known intolerance for xray contrast agent that cannot be adequately controlled with premedication; 15. Any medical condition as estimated by the Study Investigator that may harm patient or jeopardize study participation, the interpretation of study results or may impede the ability to obtain informed consent (e.g., mental condition);</criteria>
