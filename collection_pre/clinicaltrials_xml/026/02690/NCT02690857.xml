	<brief_summary>Patients with Cystic Fibrosis have increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant systems. Under certain conditions, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake may have a favorable role in reducing redox status. In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, DHA (Pro-Mind) and placebo (sunflower oil) capsules, will be given, daily to 10 patients, 5 mg/kg for 2 weeks then 10 mg/kg for the next 2 weeks. Biomarkers of lipid peroxidation and vitamin E levels will be measured. Plasma and platelet lipid compositions will be determined.</brief_summary>
