	<criteria>Subject is male or female between the ages of 2 and 80 years (inclusive). Subject has a documented history of lesions and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of hypoplasminogenemia Subject has plasminogen activity level â‰¤ 45%. Subject has documented vaccination to hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), or has received the first dose of HAV and HBV vaccine prior to the first dose of investigational drug and is scheduled to receive the second vaccine dose. If subject has documented vaccination more than 1 year before screening but has a negative antibody titer to HAV and/or HBV at screening, subject is required to begin a revaccination series with the first dose of HAV and/or HBV vaccine prior to the first dose of investigational drug and is scheduled to receive the second vaccine dose. No revaccination is required if the documented vaccination took place within 1 year of screening. Subject has a history of anaphylactic reactions to blood or blood products that may interfere with participation in the study in the opinion of the investigator. Subject has uncontrolled hypertension. Subject has clinical or laboratory evidence of an intercurrent infection as evidenced by symptoms including fever, tachycardia, or other systemic signs and symptoms.* Subject is pregnant and/or lactating. Subject has a malignancy, except for basal or squamous cell skin cancer, within 3 years before screening. Subject is a previous organ transplant recipient. Subject is in receipt of exogenous plasminogen (ocular or IV), such as laboratory grade plasminogen, fresh frozen plasma, or Plasminogen (Human) within 2 weeks of the first dose of the investigational drug. Subject has a psychiatric disorder, other mental disorder, or any other medical disorder that impairs the subject's ability to provide informed consent or to comply with the requirements of the study protocol. Subject has evidence of renal dysfunction defined as of &gt; 2 X the upper limit of normal (ULN) in serum creatinine. Subject has evidence of hepatic dysfunction defined as &gt; 3 x ULN in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Subject has participated in another institutional review boardapproved interventional clinical trial of a drug, biologic, or device within 30 days before the first dose of the investigational drug. Subject has a chronic or acute clinically significant intercurrent illness (e.g., cardiac, hepatic, renal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, neoplastic, immunological, and skeletal) that the investigator determines could interfere with the assessments in this study.</criteria>
