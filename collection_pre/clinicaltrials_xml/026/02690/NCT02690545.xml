	<brief_summary>The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration. In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown. The purpose of this research study is to establish a safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to infuse after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and to estimate the number patients whose cancer does not progress for two years after ATLCAR.CD30 administration. This study will also look at other effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on the patient's cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of CD30 CAR for Relapsed/Refractory CD30+ HL and CD30+ NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective (Phase Ib portion of study) To establish a safe dose (ie, number cells/m2) of ATLCAR.CD30 to infuse after lymphodepletion with bendamustine in patients with CD30+ refractory/relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) Primary Objective (Phase II portion of study) To estimate 2 year progression free survival (PFS) after administration of ATLCAR.CD30 in patients with CD30+ refractory/relapsed HL and NHL Secondary Objectives To estimate 2 year overall survival (OS) after administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL in patients with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL To estimate the objective response rate as defined by the Lugano Classification for CAR.CD30 transduced ATL when administered in patients with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL To estimate duration of response after administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL in patients with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL To further describe the adverse events associated with CAR.CD30 transduced ATL when administered in patients with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL To evaluate the safety and efficacy of bendamustine as a lymphodepleting agent prior to infusion of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL To measure the survival of ATLCAR.CD30 in vivo To measure patient-reported symptom, physical function, and health-related quality of life at baseline and over time in patients treated with CAR.CD30 T cells Primary Endpoint (Phase Ib) Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0). Primary Endpoint (Phase II) PFS is defined from day of ATLCAR.CD30 infusion to relapse (in patients with a documented complete response after conditioning chemotherapy) or progression (in patients without complete response after conditioning chemotherapy), or death as a result of any cause per the Lugano classification Secondary Endpoints Overall survival will be measured from the date of administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL to date of death The objective response rate will be defined as the rate of complete responses (CR) + partial responses (PR) as determined by the Lugano classification The duration of response will be defined as time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0) Persistence of CAR.CD30 T cells in vivo will be determined by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry in peripheral blood samples Patient reported symptoms will be measured using selected symptoms from the NCI PRO-CTCAE. OUTLINE Cell Procurement Up to 100 mL per collection (up to 3 collections) of peripheral blood will be obtained from patients for cell procurement. In patients with low (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry less than 200/μl) T-cell count in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes. ATLCAR.CD30 Cells Administration ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be administered as described below 1-4 days (preferably 1-2 days) after lymphodepletion with bendamustine. ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be given by a licensed provider (oncology nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 1-10 minutes through either a peripheral or a central line. The expected volume will be 1-50cc. Patients with a partial response or stable disease at 6 weeks may receive a second infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 if cells are available. Note: Lymphodepletion with bendamustine will occur for two consecutive days and will not be given prior to a second infusion of cells (if applicable). Duration of Therapy Therapy in LCCC 1532 involves 1-2 infusions of ATLCAR.CD30 cells. Treatment with one infusion will be administered unless: - Patient decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR - General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. Duration of Follow-up Patients will be followed for up to 15 years for Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR) evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.</detailed_description>
