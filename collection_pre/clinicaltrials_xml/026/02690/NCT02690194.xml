	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Investigating the Use of Relaxation Prior to Medical Procedures.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Undergoing medical procedures is reported to cause stress and anxiety among many individuals.This can trigger the sympathetic nervous response, including decreased skin temperature, increased pulse, and increased blood pressure. While evolutionary advantageous, this response has deleterious effects on the healing process. Heightened stress levels can also trigger an increased release of cortisol, a naturally produced steroid hormone known to hinder the immune response. In response to high levels of stress, a patient's tolerance for pain decreases and the perceived pain level increases. Relaxation techniques can assist in reducing the stress and anxiety levels of a patient, which allows for lower perceived pain and more rapid healing. Many relaxation techniques exist, including acupuncture, child life intervention, breathing therapy and guided imagery. Buddhify, a mobile application, incorporates breathing therapy and audio-guided imagery into brief relaxation sessions, with the goal of reducing the stress and anxiety levels of the user. This application presents a convenient option for patients to use prior to undergoing a procedure. If proven to be effective, this application could be more widely used to help reduce the stress level, anxiety level and subsequent perceived pain level of patients, ultimately improving their healing reaction.</detailed_description>
