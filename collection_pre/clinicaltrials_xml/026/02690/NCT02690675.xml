	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate the effect of Iron supplement with two different amounts (one in the higher limit and another in the lower limit of the suggested amount) according to the presence of mutations in the HFE gene in the physical, immune and neurobehavioral development in the 6 to 12 moth toddlers. Methodology: Subjects: 340 toddlers coming from Paediatric Serves of Sant Joan Hospital. Methods: At 6 and 12 months it done clinical history, food registry, biochemist determinations: haemoglobin, iron, transferrin, ferritin, reactive C protein and immune response (IL4, IL10, IL6 IFN, IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE). Mutations in the HFE gene: C282Y, H63D, S65D and hepcidin gene. Mental, psychomotor and behavioual development (Bayley Scales of Infant Development 2on Edition: 1993). We evaluate the level of language and communication (MacArthur), regulation and sensory process (Infant Toddler Symptom Checklist), familiar and environment surroundings (Scale Health General Parental Stress Index).</brief_summary>
