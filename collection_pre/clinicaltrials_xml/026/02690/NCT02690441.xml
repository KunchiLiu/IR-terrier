	<brief_summary>Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a severe and debilitating anxiety disorder that is highly prevalent among older adults. Anxiety and GAD is a well-documented risk factor for the development of other severe conditions such as depression and dementia, and effective treatments are called for. However, recommended treatment for GAD has consistently been found to yield blunted response rates for older adults compared to younger patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of exercise-augmented cognitive behaviour therapy for older adults with GAD. Exercise augmented CBT is expected to yield better results than standard CBT in terms of greater reduction of symptoms and increased rates of remission. The investigators will also investigate the effects of treatment on biological, physiological and neuropsychological measures.</brief_summary>
