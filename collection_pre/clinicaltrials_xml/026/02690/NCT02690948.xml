	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib works in treating patients with skin basal cell cancer that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, blocks tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Vismodegib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether pembrolizumab is more effective alone or together with vismodegib in treating skin basal cell cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab With or Without Vismodegib in Treating Metastatic or Unresectable Basal Cell Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of unresectable or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) patients to pembrolizumab monotherapy after disease progression on smoothened inhibitor monotherapy. II. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab plus vismodegib after partial response or stable disease on smoothened inhibitor monotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the nature and severity of adverse events while on pembrolizumab for BCCs. II. Determine the nature and severity of adverse events while on pembrolizumab plus vismodegib for BCCs. III. Determine whether levels of lymphocytic infiltration and programmed cell death ligand (PDL)1 are increased after treatment with pembrolizumab, as well as additional search for immunologic biomarkers for response such as cluster of differentiation (CD)8 density in patients with unresectable or metastatic BCC. IV. Determine whether levels of lymphocytic infiltration and PDL1 are increased after treatment with pembrolizumab plus vismodegib, as well as additional search for immunologic biomarkers for response such as CD8 in patients with unresectable or metastatic BCC. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients experiencing disease progression during previous treatment with vismodegib receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses every 21 days for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients achieving partial response or stable disease during previous treatment with vismodegib may continue to receive vismodegib orally (PO) on days 1-21 per standard of care and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 90 days and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
