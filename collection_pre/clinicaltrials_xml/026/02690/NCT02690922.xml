	<brief_summary>The aim of our study is to improve the major molecular remission(MMR) rate and reduce the cost to treat ph(+) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) by adjusting chemotherapy regimens and the dosage of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). lower the classification of chemotherapy drugs, lower the side effect brought by which this would be a grateful news for the patients once this regimens gain a successful result, which is also the final aim of our efforts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose Chemotherapy Combine With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor to Treat ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators new therapy regimens: The investigators use dexamethasone 10mg/d(d3-d7) as pre-processing therapy, dasatinib 100mg (d1-d84) plus prednisone 60mg/m2 (d1-24), reduce to d32, as inductive treatment after inductive treatment, if the patient get major molecular remission, patient will get to consolidation therapy, that is methotrexate (MTX) 3g/m2 d1, if not, this patient would be excluded from our trail. after consolidation therapy, if the patient have matched bone marrow donor, the investigators will suggest the patient receipting allogens-stem cell transplantation, otherwise, autogens stem cell transplantation can also be considered once the patient have no applicable bone marrow donor. on the other side, if the patient still not get MMR after this two cycle, maybe the patient can try Car-T, or other chemotherapy regimens.</detailed_description>
