	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at whether adding pembrolizumab (keytruda) to the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin will improve shrinkage of the tumor before having a cystectomy, for people with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of Pembrolizumab in Combination With Gemcitabine and Cisplatin as Neoadjuvant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To estimate the proportion of patients with pathological downstaging to &lt;pT2 after neoadjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab when administered prior to and with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with MIBC Hypothesis: The rate of pathologic downstaging to &lt;pT2 will improve compared to historical controls Secondary Objectives To estimate the proportion of patients with pT0 after neoadjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab when administered prior to and with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with MIBC Hypothesis: The rate of pathologic downstaging to pT0 will improve compared to historical controls To estimate event free survival (EFS) Hypothesis: EFS will be improved compared to historical controls To estimate overall survival (OS) Hypothesis: OS will be improved compared to historical controls To estimate the proportion of patients who are alive at 3 years (OS at 3 years) Hypothesis: OS at 3 years will be improved compared to historical controls To characterize the toxicity profile for the combination of pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and cisplatin Hypothesis: Pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and cisplatin will be a safe combination with acceptable toxicity rates Exploratory Objectives To explore the association of biological markers including PD-L1 expression and immune gene expression signatures with pathological downstaging to &lt;pT2, pT0, EFS, and OS To explore associations between BASE47 "basal," "claudin-low," and "luminal" subtypes of MIBC and pathological downstaging to &lt;pT2, pT0, EFS, and OS To characterize the change in phenotype of TILs, including delineation of effector and regulatory T cells, before and after neoadjuvant treatment To define T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire profiles that are associated with pathological downstaging to &lt;pT2, pT0, EFS, and OS First the participant will receive a dose of pembrolizumab alone. Two weeks after this dose, then s/he will receive all 3 study drugs (pembrolizumab, gemcitabine and cisplatin) on the first day of a 3 week "cycle". S/he will then receive 1 or 2 of these drugs on the 8th day of the cycle. The participant will receive the study drugs for 4 cycles for a total of 12 weeks. Participants are followed for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be able to give written IRB approved informed consent and be able to follow protocol requirements. Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale Has histologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma of the bladder; those with mixed histology, including a component of urothelial carcinoma, are eligible. Pure small cell carcinoma, pure adenocarcinoma, and pure squamous cell carcinoma are excluded. Has clinical stage T2T4a N0/X M0 urothelial carcinoma. Clinical T stage is based on the prestudy standard of care transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) sample and imaging studies. Has staging scans with abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI scan and CT scan or xray of the chest within 4 weeks prior to treatment initiation Be a medically appropriate candidate for radical cystectomy as determined by an attending urologist and be planning to receive cystectomy. Has had no prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy for urothelial carcinoma (prior intravesicular chemotherapies are permitted) Patients must have tumor tissue from transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) available for submission that is sufficient for correlative testing, and agree to submission of a paraffin block or 20 formalinfixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) slides of 510 microns in thickness. Patients must also agree to submission of tissue from cystectomy. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the table below; all screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation. Hematological Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or EPO dependency (within 7 days of assessment) Renal Serum creatinine OR Measured or calculateda creatinine clearance (CrCL; GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN (≤ 3 X ULN if Gilbert's Syndrome) OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN Coagulation International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy. If subject receiving anticoagulants, PT or PTT should be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants aCreatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard. Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of pembrolizumab. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. The two birth control methods can be composed of: two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should start using birth control from the screening visit and continue throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide. Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents). Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.

Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
