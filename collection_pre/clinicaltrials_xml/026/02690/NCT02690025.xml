Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 90 years Stable SBS patients with intestinal insufficiency or failure, where the last surgical resection of gut tissue was performed at least 1 year ago A stable PS volume ( &lt; 25% change in volume or energy content) for four weeks prior to randomization for patients requiring PS Wet weight of fecal excretion ≥ 1500 g/day demonstrated during a hospital stay prior to screening or during at least one day of the first baseline balance study. Stable body weight (&lt;5% weight deviance in the three months prior to screening) Patients with known or suspected intestinal strictures of clinical relevance as judged by the Investigator Active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or fistula during the screening period as judged by conventional means of the Investigator. Crohn's disease patients not being in clinical remission for the last 12 weeks prior to randomization Cardiac disease defined as: Decompensated heart failure (NYHA class IIIIV) and/or diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris and/or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to screening History of cancer (except resected cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinoma and except in situ cervical cancer) unless it can be documented that the patient has been in a diseasefree state for at least 5 years (except colon cancer: patients with a history of colon cancer generally have to be excluded) eGFR (by the MDRD formula) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 Clinically meaningful renal disease as judged by the Investigator</criteria>
