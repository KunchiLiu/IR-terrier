	<brief_title>Study to Look at How Effective Briviact is as add-on Treatment for Patients With Epilepsy With Partial Onset Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EP0077 is a 12 months, multicenter, noninterventional study (NIS) conducted at specialized sites in approximately 10 European countries. Patients will be treated according to usual medical diagnostic procedures and therapy; commercially available brivaracetam will be prescribed according to normal clinical practice and the current Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) in Europe for brivaracetam (BRV). The prescription of BRV is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. No additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures are applied to the patients. The primary objective of this study is to determine BRV retention over a 12 month period as a measure of effectiveness in a real world setting. The secondary objective of this study is to assess seizure control with BRV treatment.</detailed_description>
