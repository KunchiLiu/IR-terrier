	<brief_summary>This study employs a modified continual reassessment method (mCRM) design to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PF-05230907, defined as a target toxicity rate of 15% based on treatment emergent thromboembolic and/or ischemic events (TIEs). The mCRM design utilizes Bayesian methodology to continuously learn the dose-toxicity relationship, which is characterized by a parametric model. Subjects with a diagnosis of ICH (determined by computed tomography) will be enrolled in cohorts of 3. The total length of time planned for study participation is approximately 3 months; 6.0 hours for screening, a single dose administration with a 4-day minimum hospital confinement period and follow-up visits through Day 91. Severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. All subjects who receive PF-05230907 are evaluable for TIEs. The determination of MTD using mCRM modeling will be based on TIEs which occur through 7 days post-dose (Day 8).</brief_summary>
