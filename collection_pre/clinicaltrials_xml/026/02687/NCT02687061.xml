	<brief_summary>The project aims to retrieve patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B (cHB) and hepatitis C (cHC) who are lost to follow-up.Data files of the Public Health System and microbiology laboratories will be explored for registered cases of cHB and cHC. Subsequently the investigators will compare the registered cases with the list of known cHB and cHC patients in hospital care. Patients lost to follow up will be informed and approached via either the Public Health Service (PHS) or their primary care physician. Identified patients will be invited for re-evaluation at the regional hepatitis centre (The North Western Hospital, formerly Medical Centre Alkmaar) to assess the current status of their chronic disease. Evaluation will be performed in accordance with (inter-)national guidelines, no extra interventions will be performed. After completion of re-evaluation, a final report will be made and send to both patient and primary care physician with recommendations for further follow-up.</brief_summary>
