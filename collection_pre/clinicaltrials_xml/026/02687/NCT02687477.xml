	<brief_summary>This project is focused on the treatment of severe obstructive sleep apnea with pulmonary artery denervation (PADN). Although it has now been proved that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the primary treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, on the other hand, there is evidence that 25 to 50% of patients can not tolerate CPAP. The investigators previously reported the safety and efficacy of pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) for treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Excessive sympathetic activation play an important role in the occurrence and development of OSA and cause cardiovascular events. It is worth evaluating the feasibility and tolerance of introducing PADN at the severe stage of obstructive sleep apnea. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of PADN in the treatment of severe OSA.</brief_summary>
