	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether vitamin D3 prevents severe asthma attacks in children who have a serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) level &lt;30 ng/ml and who are being treated with inhaled corticosteroids for asthma. Half the participants will receive vitamin D3 at a dose of 4,000 IU/day, and the other half will receive placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D to Prevent Severe Asthma Exacerbations (Vit-D-Kids Asthma)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results from experimental studies, observational studies, and two small trials suggest that vitamin D reduces the risk of severe asthma exacerbations, and that this protective effect may be due to immune modulation of viral illnesses and/or increased response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). On the basis of those findings, the investigators hypothesize that vitamin D reduces the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations in high-risk school-aged children who have a serum vitamin D level &lt;30 ng/ml and who are being treated with ICS for persistent asthma. The investigators further hypothesize that this protective effect results from reduced incidence of common viral illnesses or enhanced response to ICS. These hypotheses will be tested in a 48-week randomized double-masked placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 supplementation to prevent severe asthma exacerbations in 400 children aged 6 to 14 years who have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency (a serum 25(OH)D &lt;30 ng/ml) and experienced a severe exacerbation in the prior year (a marker of high risk for subsequent events), and who (after a run-in period) are well controlled on medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Our primary aim will determine whether vitamin D3 (4,000 IU/day) reduces the risk of severe asthma exacerbations (our primary outcome) in participating children. Secondary aims will determine the efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation in: 1) preventing severe asthma exacerbations due to viral infections, 2) reducing the daily and average cumulative dose of inhaled corticosteroids.</detailed_description>
