	<brief_summary>The incidence of failed intubation in obstetric population is about eight times greater than in the non-obstetric population, as pregnancy is related to significant physiologic changes. The Mallampati classification is an estimate of the tongue size relative to the oral cavity. It is a method widely used to predict difficult airway management, as it is easy to perform and to reproduce. In obstetric population, Mallampati classed 3 and 4 increase likelihood of difficult intubation by 7.6 and 11.3 times, respectively. There are studies demonstrating the increase of Mallampati score during the course of pregnancy and vaginal delivery; the underlying causes being airway edema, intravenous fluid administration, or antidiuretic effects of oxytocin. Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate the modified mallampatti score at several point of time before and after cesarean delivery. Study Type: Observational Cross-sectional study</brief_summary>
