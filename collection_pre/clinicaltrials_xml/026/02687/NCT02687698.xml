	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease concerns some defects in carbohydrates metabolism involved in the progress of the pathology. Ketogenic diet has been largely studied as treatment on drug-resistant epilepsy and other neurologic diseases, but there is little information on the impact of this kind of diet in clinical aspects of Parkinson's disease. The aim of our study is thus to evaluate the effect of a lipid and protein controlled diet on resting energy expenditure, body composition and symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.</brief_summary>
