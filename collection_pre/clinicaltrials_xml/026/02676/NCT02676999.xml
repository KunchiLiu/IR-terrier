	<brief_summary>This project is set to describe by objective measures as the range of motion and weight-bearing ability of the distal radioulnar joint one to five years after primary implantation of a Scheker total distal radioulnar joint prosthesis.The range of motion and stability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) are important outcomes to preserve function, especially the pronation and supination. Unlike other ulnar endoprostheses that replace only the ulnar head, the Scheker prosthesis replaces the ulnar head, resurfaces the lesser sigmoid notch, and is semi-constrained in design.</brief_summary>
