Individuals with a known bleeding diathesis, or any condition that may be associated with a prolonged bleeding time. 8. Individuals with a neutrophil count lower than 1.8 x 10^9/L (applicable to the initial 18 subjects) or lower than 1.0 x 10^9/L (applicable to the additional subjects if approved by DSMB) at screening 9. Individuals with any serious chronic or progressive disease according to judgment of the investigator (e.g., neoplasm, insulin dependent diabetes, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiac, renal or hepatic disease and tuberculosis). 10. Individuals who have any malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder. 11. Individuals with history of allergy to vaccines components or any other allergies deemed by the investigator to increase the risk of an adverse event if they were to participate in the trial. 12.
