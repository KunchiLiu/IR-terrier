	<brief_title>Clinical Comparison of Two Daily Disposable Silicone Hydrogel Soft Contact Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate the performance of the olifilcon B contact lens to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the narafilcon A for regulatory requirement.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject should have normal eyes and use no ocular medications Subject with 1.00 to 10.00 D myopia, less than 2.00 D astigmatism VA correctable to Log MAR 0.1 or better. Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the study. Provide signed and dated informed consent form. Subjects have history of allergies that would contraindicate "normal" contact lens wear. Subjects have other active ocular or systemic disease such as, but not limited to : anterior uveitis (past or present), glaucoma, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, lupus erythematosus, sclerodermas, keratoconus or type II diabetes. Subjects have medications that would contraindicate contact lens wear. Currently pregnant (to the best of the subject's knowledge), is lactating or is planning a pregnancy within the next 3 month. Current drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Any active participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to this study. The presence of clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) anterior segment abnormalities; inflammations such as iritis; or any infection of the eye, lids, or associated structures. A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity), corneal ulcer, corneal infiltrates or fungal infections. A history of papillary conjunctivitis that has interfered with contact lens wear.</criteria>
