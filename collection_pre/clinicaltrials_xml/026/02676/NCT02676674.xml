	<brief_title>Vitamin D Levels Following Topical Application of Vitamin D Ointment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study investigates safety and efficacy of a new topical vitamin D3 compound. The purpose of this Phase 1 trial is to determine whether topical application makes Vitamin D bioavailable to the systemic circulation in sufficient quantities to treat hypovitaminosis D. The study will assess the change in serum 25-hydroxy (25-OH) vitamin D concentrations following 3 doses of 100,000 IU of topical vitamin D3 ointment in 20 volunteers with vitamin D deficiency. Twenty adults with serum 25-OH vitamin D concentrations of &lt; 20 ng/ml will receive 3 doses of 300,000 IU of topical vitamin D once per week for three weeks. Two 0.75 ml applicators of ointment will be applied to each upper arm (150,000 IU per arm) by study staff. Blood will be drawn at baseline prior to the first dose (Day 0) and on Days 7, 14, and 21. Total serum 25-OH vitamin D will be assayed at each draw. Parathyroid hormone, a measure of clinical effects of low vitamin D levels, will be checked at baseline and on day 21. Serum albumin adjusted calcium levels will be checked with each draw to check for possible effects of too much vitamin D absorption. The study will determine whether the topical application of Vitamin D ointment is able to correct existing vitamin D deficiency.</detailed_description>
