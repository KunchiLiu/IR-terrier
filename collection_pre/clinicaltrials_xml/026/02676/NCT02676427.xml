	<brief_summary>The study aims at clarification of venous collapsibility measures with real venous flow measurements during dynamic maneuver testing fluid responsiveness in septic shock patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluid Responsiveness in Septic Shock Evaluated by Caval Ultrasound Doppler Examination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sedated and mechanically ventilated patients in septic shock will be enrolled in the study. A fine catheter with ultrasound doppler probe will be introduced into the central venous catheter already in place in superior vena cava. Doppler signal will be evaluated by console prototype (NILUS Medical) and continuous analysis of blood flow velocity respiratory variation will be performed. These values will be compared to standard hemodynamic monitoring parameters (central venous and arterial pressures) and to parameters acquired by transoesophageal (TOE) and transthoracic echocardiography.</detailed_description>
