	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this 3-phase mixed methods design study is to investigate how presenting content at varying levels of audience specificity (generic, targeted, and tailored) influences organ donor registration behavior among black men using video-based educational programming produced and distributed in partnership with our network of Black Owned Barbershops (BOBs). Investigators have completed a development phase using digital video interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos. This phase of this investigation is a 3 arm randomized control trial (RCT) phase, in which customers will be randomized to receive the generic, targeted, or tailored video programming delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered through registration online or with a mailed in application. The final phase of this investigation will be a failure analysis whereby we will interview a subset of participants who registered or failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain how the programming impacted their decision (Aim 3 - the subject of a future IRB application).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Black men who visit BOBs Participants whose primary language is English Participants who reside locally in NYC for at least four weeks (28 days) in a year Women are excluded from this study, as it is focused on black men who visit BOBs, who are among the most in need for transplants, and least likely to register as organ donors. Women are excluded from this study, as it is focused on black men who visit BOBs, who are among the most in need for transplants, and least likely to register as organ donors. Persons not selfreporting being a black male are excluded. Including other minority groups would preclude conducting this research given its budget and time constraints.
