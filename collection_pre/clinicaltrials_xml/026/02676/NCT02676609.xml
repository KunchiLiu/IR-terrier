	<brief_summary>During this study, we will assess a new smart phone application which aims at helping patients with Type 1 diabetes to compute food carbohydrates and meal insulin doses. Patients, already trained to carbohydrate counting, will be recruited among those who have been using this method daily for at least 6 months. They will complete two one-month study phases, using the application in one phase and counting carbohydrate and insulin doses without the application in the other phase, with randomized order of each phase. Visits are scheduled at the start and at the end of each phase to collect data on glucose control and insulin doses. Questionnaires assessing health-related quality of life and ability of self-management of diabetes will also be filled by patients before and after each study phase.</brief_summary>
