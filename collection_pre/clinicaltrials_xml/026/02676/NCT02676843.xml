	<brief_summary>The study will investigate the ability of a new PET tracer, 18F-AV-1451, to detect depositions of a protein, called tau, in the brains of people with a mutation in the tau gene that causes deposition of the protein, and in people without the mutation. A single 18F-AV-1451 scan will be performed on control subjects without MAPT mutations, presymptomatic mutation carriers, and symptomatic mutation carriers.</brief_summary>
