	<criteria>Diagnosis of endometrial cancer confirmed by histopathological analysis (endometrial biopsy) requiring surgical staging according to FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) recommendations Diagnosis of ovarian cancer confirmed by histopathological analysis after an initial cystectomy or oophorectomy without suspicion of neoplasia thus requiring additional surgical staging according to FIGO recommendations Diagnosis of advanced endometrial cancer based on findings on imaging techniques (CT, MRI and/or PET) Diagnosis of advanced endometrial or ovarian cancer based on intraoperative findings (e.g. peritoneal carcinomatosis at initial laparoscopy) Patients who underwent previous aortic lymphadenectomy Patients who received previous pelvic and/or aortic radiotherapy</criteria>
