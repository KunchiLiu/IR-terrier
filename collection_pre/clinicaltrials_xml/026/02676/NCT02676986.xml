	<brief_summary>This study is being carried out to see if the antiandrogen enzalutamide has antitumour effects in early breast cancer. Enzalutamide blocks the action of androgens on the androgen receptor (AR) and may slow down or stop breast cancers growing. Enzalutamide is approved for the treatment of prostate cancer. The trial will be offered to patients who have just been diagnosed with early breast cancer and who are planned to have surgery in the next few weeks. The treatment will bridge the time between the diagnosis and surgery and will be given for 2- 4 weeks. To assess the effect of the treatment, small samples of breast cancer tissue will be analysed before the start and after treatment. The pre-treatment assessment will be done on archived tissue but patients might require an additional biopsy, if sufficient stored tumour tissue is not available. The end of treatment samples will be taken during surgery, unless the patient will receive medical treatment first instead of surgery which might mean additional biopsies of the breast cancer have to be taken. The trial has two cohorts. The cohort of patients with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer will test if adding enzalutamide to exemestane is better at slowing the growth of breast cancer than exemestane alone. This cohort will recruit 141 evaluable post-menopausal patients with a tumour size of at least 1 cm. The aromatase inhibitor exemestane is approved for the treatment of ER positive breast cancer. Blocking aromatase decreases oestrogens but can increase androgens. Enzalutamide is therefore added to block the action of androgens on the AR. In the second cohort of patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), enzalutamide will be given alone to see if it can slow the growth tumours with androgen receptors. As only approximately 30% of TNBCs express the AR, a pre screening step will be included to test the tumour AR expression, before patients are approached for the ARB trial. The TNBC cohort will comprise 55 patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main 1. Written informed consent prior to admission to this study 2. Female, aged ≥18 years 3. ECOG performance status 0 2 4. Histologically confirmed invasive primary breast cancer 5. Palpable breast tumour of any size, or tumour with an ultrasound or MRI size of at least 1.0 cm 6. Haematologic and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below at the screening visit 1. ANC 1500 cells/μl 2. Platelet count 100000/μl 3. Serum creatinine concentration &lt; 1.5 x ULN 4. Bilirubin level &lt; 1.5 x ULN 5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;3 x ULN Inclusion Criteria unique to the ER+ve cohort: 1. ER+ve tumours defined as ≥1% of tumour cells positive for ER on IHC staining or an IHC score (Allred) of ≥3 2. Postmenopausal defined as: 1. Age 55 years and 1 year or more of amenorrhea 2. Age 55 years and 1 year or more of amenorrhea with LH and/or FSH levels in the postmenopausal range 3. Age 55 with prior hysterectomy but intact ovaries with LH and/or FSH levels in the postmenopausal range 4. Status after bilateral oophorectomy ( 28 days prior to first study treatment) Inclusion Criteria unique to the AR+ve, TNBC cohort: 1. AR positive tumours defined as any nuclear AR staining by IHC (enrolment may be based on local pathology findings; subsequent review of AR expression by central pathology laboratory will be carried out) 2. Triplenegative tumours, i.e. tumour cells are negative for 1. ER with &lt;1% of cells positive on IHC or an IHC score (Allred) of ≤2 2. PR with &lt;1% of tumour cells positive on IHC or an Allred score of ≤2 3. HER2 with 0, 1+ or 2+ intensity on IHC and no evidence of amplification of the HER2 gene on ISH 3. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first dose as possible. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (for example, intrauterine device [IUD], birth control pills unless clinically contraindicated, or barrier device) beginning 2 weeks before the first dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) and for 30 days after the final dose of IMP. 1. Inflammatory breast cancer 2. Treatment with any of the following medications within 4 weeks before the baseline diagnostic biopsy is taken: 1. Oestrogens, including hormone replacement therapy; 2. Androgens (testosterone, dihydroepiandrosterone, etc.); 3. Any approved or investigational agent that blocks androgen synthesis or targets the AR (e.g., abiraterone acetate, ARN509, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, ODM201, TAK448, TAK683, TAK700) 3. Previous systemic or local treatment for the new primary breast cancer currently under investigation (including surgery, radiotherapy, cytotoxic and endocrine treatments); prior treatment for previous breast cancer or other neoplasms is allowed as long as it was completed at least 1 year prior to inclusion into this trial. 4. History of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure; history of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12 months before day 1. 5. Significant cardiovascular disease, such as 1. History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes or coronary angioplasty/stenting/bypass grafting within the past 6 months. 2. Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV or history of congestive heart failure NYHA class III or IV, unless an echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan performed within 3 months before day 1 reveals a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45%; 3. History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes); 6. Hypersensitivity to the active pharmaceutical ingredient or any of the excipients of the IMPs, including Labrasol, butylated hydroxyanisole, and butylated Hydroxytoluene 7. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an IMP, may affect the interpretation of the results, render the patient at high risk from treatment complications or interferes with obtaining informed consent. 8. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with the study protocol. 9. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to study entry.</criteria>
