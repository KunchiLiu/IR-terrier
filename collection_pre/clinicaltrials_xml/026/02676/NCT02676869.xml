Currently receiving antiPD1 therapy with pembrolizumab and after 3 cycles achieved asymptomatic irPD (slowly progressive, not requiring urgent intervention, and stable performance status) or suboptimal response (irSD, irPR) as demonstrated in imaging assessments performed within 6 weeks prior to day 1 of cycle 5 of pembrolizumab. 4. Female or male 18 years of age or above 5. All patients with reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception from time of study entry until at least 4 months after the last administration of study treatment. 6. ECOG performance status 01 7. Expected survival longer than three months 8. Resolution of toxicity associated with prior or current therapy to grade &lt; 2 (except for alopecia and transaminases in case of liver metastases) 9. Evidence of measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 10. Laboratory criteria: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Haemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL or 5.58 mmol/L Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN Total bilirubin &lt; 20 mmol/L, except for familial cholemia (Gilbert's disease) Serum AST (=GOT) and ALT (=GPT) &lt; 3 times the upper limit of normal or &lt; 5 times upper limit of normal if liver metastases are present Exclusion Criteria 1. More than four prior lines of therapies for advanced or metastatic disease. 2. Prior PD1/PDL1 targeted therapy 3. Prior highdose chemotherapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell rescue 4. Currently receiving treatment with another investigational drug, or less than 4 weeks since ending treatment on another investigational drug 5. Currently receiving systemic chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, radiotherapy, or biological cancer therapy (other than pembrolizumab) or less than 4 weeks since completion of these therapies and first dose of study treatment 6. History of irAEs from ipilimumab of CTCAE Grade 4 requiring steroid treatment 7. Known cerebral or leptomeningeal metastases. (Some subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate under specific circumstances) 8. Women who are pregnant or lactating 9. Serious intercurrent infection within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment 10. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled cardiac disease (NYHA IIIIV) within 6 months prior to first dose of study treatment 11. Active acute or chronic infection 12. History or evidence of interstitial lung disease or active noninfectious pneumonitis 13. Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy 14. HIV positivity 15. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C, currently treated with antiviral therapy 16. Life threatening illness unrelated to cancer 17. Previous malignancies within the last three years other than melanoma 18. Any current disorder that would impede the patient's ability to provide informed consent or to comply with the protocol 19. Continuous systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment 20. History or evidence of severe allergic episodes and/or angioedema 21. Any current disorder likely to modify absorption, distribution or elimination of IMP321 22. Alcohol or substance abuse disorder 23. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of IMP321 24. Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements 25. In the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is unsuitable for participation in this study</criteria>
