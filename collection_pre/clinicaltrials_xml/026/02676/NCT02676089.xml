	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the superiority of CHF 5993 200/6/12.5 µg pMDI (fixed combination of extrafine beclometasone dipropionate plus formoterol fumarate plus glycopyrronum bromide) versus CHF 1535 200/6 µg pMDI (fixed combination of extrafine beclometasone dipropionate plus formoterol fumarate) and to compare the effect of CHF 5993 200/6/12.5 µg pMDI vs CHF 5993 200/6/12.5 µg plus open-label Tiotropium 2.5µg, in terms of lung functions parameters and rate of exacerbations, as well as to assess its safety and some health economics outcomes.</brief_summary>
