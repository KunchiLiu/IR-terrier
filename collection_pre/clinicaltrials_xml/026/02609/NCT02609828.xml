	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Tanezumab in Patients With Cancer Pain Due to Bone Metastasis Who Are Taking Background Opioid Therapy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group Phase 3 study in cancer subjects requiring treatment with background opioids for pain due to bone metastasis. Approximately 170 subjects will be randomized to one of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 85 subjects per group). Subjects will receive a total of 3 subcutaneous injections, separated by 8 weeks in addition to background opioids administered throughout the study. Treatment groups will include: 1. Placebo SC (matching tanezumab SC) in addition to background opioid therapy. 2. Tanezumab 20 mg SC in addition to background opioid therapy. The study consists of three periods: Pre-Treatment (up to 37 days), Double-Blind Treatment (24 weeks) and Safety Follow-up (24 weeks).</detailed_description>
