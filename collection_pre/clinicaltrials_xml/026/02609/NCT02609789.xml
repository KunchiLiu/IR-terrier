	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of JNJ-55920839 following single ascending intravenous (IV) dose administration in healthy participants and a single subcutaneous dose in healthy participants and multiple IV dose administrations in participants with mild to moderate Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Participants and Multiple Dose Study of JNJ-55920839 in Participants With Mild to Moderate Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of JNJ-55920839. The study consists of Screening Period of 28 days. The healthy participants will have a 6-day/5-night inpatient period. All Participants will receive study agent on Day 1 and SLE Participants will receive additional doses on Days 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71. The total duration of participation for each participant will be approximately 13 weeks for healthy participants, 22 weeks for participants with SLE. All eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive active agent or placebo. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, single ascending doses of JNJ55920839 or placebo will be administered to sequential cohorts of healthy participants as an IV infusion or as a subcutaneous injection. In Part 2, multiple doses of JNJ-55920839 or placebo will be administered as IV infusions to participants with SLE. Blood samples will be collected for assessment of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters in both part 1 and 2, along with assessment of safety and clinical outcomes. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

Careful consideration should be given to whether the participant has had severe, progressive, or uncontrolled hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic/ cerebral, or psychiatric disease, or current signs and symptoms thereof Participant has a condition that might confound assessments including major surgery, substance abuse or acute illness Participant is a woman of childbearing potential or a woman who is pregnant, or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this study or within 4 months (&gt;=5 halflives) after the last dose of study agent Part B (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus [SLE] ) Participant with history or suspected occurrence of druginduced SLE Participant has active Central nervous system (CNS) lupus or history of severe CNS lupus including but not limited to seizures, psychosis, transverse myelitis, CNS vasculitis and optic neuritis Participant currently has or has had a history of any clinically significant medical illness or medical disorders the investigator considers significant should exclude the Participant, including (but not limited to), neuromuscular disorder, hematological disease, immune deficiency states, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease (including poor peripheral venous access), hepatic or gastrointestinal (GI) disease, neurological or psychiatric disease, ophthalmological disorders, neoplastic disease, renal or urinary tract diseases, or dermatological disease. Careful consideration should be given to whether the Participant has had severe, progressive, or uncontrolled hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic/ cerebral, or psychiatric disease, or current signs and symptoms thereof Participant has had major surgery, (e.g., requiring general anesthesia) within 4 months before screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery planned within 4 weeks prior to study agent administration or during the time the Participant is expected to participate in the study, or within 4 months (&gt;=5 halflives) after the last dose of study agent administration Participant has laboratory findings or biopsy results consistent with severe lupus nephritis</criteria>
