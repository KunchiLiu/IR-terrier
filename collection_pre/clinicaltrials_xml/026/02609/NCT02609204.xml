	<brief_summary>The main goal of the study is to compile a normative database for the Neuro Optic Vision Assessment (NOVATM) Pattern Electroretinogram (PERG) and Flash Electroretinogram (FERG) modules. This normalization intends to be included in a probabilistic analysis protocol to allow NOVATM PERG/FERG users to identify patients with results outside the normal ranges</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study, investigators plan to enroll 50 subjects at Wills Eye Hospital without any eye diseases. Participants will first undergo a complete eye examination to determine if eligible, including visual acuity testing, IOP, and visual field testing. If investigators do not find any eye problems during the exam, participants will then be tested with the Diopsys NOVA™ PERG &amp; FERG testing systems. For both tests, two electrodes are placed on the skin underneath both eyes below the eyelashes. Participants' skin will be cleaned before the electrodes are placed on the head. A small amount of gel will be placed on the skin where the electrodes will be placed and testing will ensue.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Normal volunteers age 18 years and older will be recruited and invited to participate in the study A spherical refraction outside + 5.0 D and cylinder correction outside + 3.0 D. IOP ≥ 22 mm Hg or history of any type of glaucoma in either eye (applanation tonometry). Intraocular surgery in the study eye (except noncomplicated cataract or refractive surgery performed more than 1 year before enrollment). Best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40. Evidence of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, or other vitreoretinal disease in either eye. Evidence of optic nerve, macula and/or retinal nerve fiber layer abnormality in either eye. Evidence of reproducible (false positives, fixation losses and false negatives ≤ 25% with no observable testing artifacts). Standard Automatic Perimetry (SAP) abnormality in either eye, defined as Pattern Standard Deviation significant at p &lt; 5% level, and/or abnormal Glaucoma Hemifield test result, and/or any other pattern of loss which is consistent with a neurologic and/or ocular disease. Current or recent (within the past 30 days) use of an agent (by any administering method) known to affect visual function. Inability to obtain a reliable PERG/FERG test.</criteria>
