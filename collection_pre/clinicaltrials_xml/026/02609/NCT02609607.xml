	<brief_summary>The investigators seek to test whether incorporating the scheduled dosing of a bisacodyl 10 mg rectal suppository every other day improves bowel-related symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis. Patients will be randomized to receive either a placebo suppository or bisacodyl suppository dosed every other day for 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Anorectal Dysfunction in MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from some form of anorectal dysfunction, and these difficulties with bowel function are often ranked as negatively impactful on quality of life as impaired mobility. Despite the significant clinical burden of these symptoms, there remains a paucity of published literature supporting specific therapeutic options to manage anorectal dysfunction in this clinical population. Most bowel regimens rely on either oral laxatives (i.e. PEG-3350) or anti-diarrheal agents (i.e. loperamide). In their study, the investigators propose to establish the efficacy of a bowel regimen that combines both oral agents (as needed; standard care) with scheduled, every other day dosing of a placebo or stimulant laxative rectal suppository -- bisacodyl 10 mg. Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative medication that is available over-the-counter. It works by activating nerves in the rectum to elicit rectal contractions which ultimately leading to defecation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>MS patients with mild to moderately severe disease (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale [MSIS29] physical domain scores &lt;61 or equivalent Extended Disability Severity Score [EDSS] &lt; 6.5) of any age, gender, disease subtype, duration of illness, current use of MS disease modifying therapy, or comorbid medical condition AND who also have anorectal dysfunction (chronic constipation and/or fecal incontinence) are eligible. MS patients with severe disease (MSIS29 physical domain scores greater than 61 or equivalently severe EDSS greater than 6.5), patients with surgically altered anorectal anatomy (i.e. proctectomy/partial colectomy, ostomy creation), active enteric infection (i.e., Clostidium Difficile), or inflammatory bowel disease (i.e. ulcerative proctitis, ulcerative colitis) will also be excluded.</criteria>
