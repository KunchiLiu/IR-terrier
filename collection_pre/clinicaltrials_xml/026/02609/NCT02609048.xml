	<brief_summary>A 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study, to evaluate the effects of two doses of MBX-8025 in subjects with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) and an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Effects of Two Doses of MBX-8025 in Subjects With Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary: To evaluate the effect of MBX-8025 on Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) levels Secondary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MBX-8025 in subjects with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) To evaluate the effects of MBX-8025 on Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) response criteria To evaluate the effects of MBX-8025 on other markers of liver function, lipids, pruritus and Quality of Life (QoL) Exploratory: To evaluate the effect of MBX-8025 on liver imaging and other biochemical markers that may be relevant to the pathophysiology of PBC or the mechanism of action of the drug</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Must have given written informed consent (signed and dated) and any authorizations required by local law 2. 18 to 75 years old (inclusive) 3. Male or female with a diagnosis of PBC, by at least two of the following criteria: History of AP above ULN for at least six months Positive AntiMitochondrial Antibodies (AMA) titers (&gt;1/40 on immunofluorescence or M2 positive by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or positive PBCspecific antinuclear antibodies Documented liver biopsy result consistent with PBC 4. On a stable and recommended dose of UDCA for the past twelve months 5. AP ≥ 1.67 × ULN 6. For females of reproductive potential, use of at least one barrier contraceptive and a second effective birth control method during the study and for at least two weeks after the last dose. For male subjects, use of appropriate contraception (e.g., condoms), so their female partners of reproductive potential do not become pregnant during the study and for at least two weeks after the last dose 1. A medical condition, other than PBC, that in the investigator's opinion would preclude full participation in the study or confound its results (e.g., cancer on active treatment) 2. AST or ALT &gt; 3 × ULN 3. Total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN 4. Autoimmune hepatitis 5. Primary sclerosing cholangitis 6. Known history of alpha1Antitrypsin deficiency 7. Known history of chronic viral hepatitis 8. Creatine kinase above ULN 9. Serum creatinine above ULN 10. For females, pregnancy or breastfeeding 11. Use of colchicine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or systemic steroids in the two months preceding screening 12. Current use of fibrates, including fenofibrates, or simvastatin 13. Use of an experimental treatment for PBC 14. Use of experimental or unapproved immunosuppressant 15. Any other condition(s) that would compromise the safety of the subject or compromise the quality of the clinical study, as judged by the Investigator</criteria>
