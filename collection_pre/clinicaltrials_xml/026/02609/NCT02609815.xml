	<brief_title>Initial Combination of Gemigliptin and Metformin on Microbiota Change</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese type 2 diabetes patients who were not treated with anti-diabetic medication within 6 weeks, were randomly assigned to gemigliptin/metformin or sulphonylurea/metformin. After 24 week treatment, gut microbiota composition change, glucose lowering effect, body weight, and gut hormones were compared between two groups.</detailed_description>
