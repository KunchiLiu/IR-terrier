	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab + Radiation for Locally Adv SCC of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) Not Eligible Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label, phase II trial will enroll 29 subjects in order to evaluate the efficacy of Pembrolizumab, concomitant with and following standard of care definitive radiation for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma head and neck patients who are not good candidates for Cisplatin. Objectives include estimating progression free survival and overall survival, response rates, safety and toxicity, and quality of life in these patients. Correlative studies, based on serial blood collections and tumor samples, may be done under a separate protocol based on availability of archival diagnostic tissue.</detailed_description>

Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Male patients should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the patient to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study. Consent for the use of any residual material from biopsy (archival tissue) and serial blood draws will be required for enrollment.

Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Has a known additional malignancy that is metastatic, progressing or requires active treatment. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease even if resolved; patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atropy would be an exception to this rule. Has clinical or radiologic evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, noninfectious pneumonitis Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
