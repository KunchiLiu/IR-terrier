	<brief_summary>Crystalloid solutions modify acid-base equilibrium according to their electrolyte composition. Moreover, it has been suggested that these alterations are generated by the difference between the solution strong ion difference (SID) and the plasma bicarbonate level. An increased risk of acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy has been associated to the infusion of chloride rich crystalloids. This study aims to compare, in patients with acute respiratory failure undergoing ECMO support, the effects on acid-base status and renal function of crystalloids commonly employed for circuit priming to a balanced solution created with a SID equal to patients' bicarbonate level.</brief_summary>
