	<brief_summary>The disorder of oral language development is defined by the delay in language acquisition in children who possess efficient auditory acuity and normal non verbal intellect. The diversity of language developement disorders depends either in the expressive level or in the receptive level leading to divers syndromes and symptoms. These syndromes and symptoms are regrouped under the name of STOL (Specific Troubles of Oral Language). In the current project the visual exploitation and learning capability of children presenting a STOL condition will be compared to patients with a normal development. The investigator's hypothesis is as follows: STOL patients for whom the STOL disorder is reduced between 4 and 7 years of age will present a better performance at verbal memorisation, compared to patients with a persistent STOL condition after the age of 6.</brief_summary>
