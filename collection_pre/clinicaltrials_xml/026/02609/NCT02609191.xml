	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to validate the measurement characteristics of a new bone densitometer, the Stratos DR: - Via cross calibration to the results of body composition (BC) measurement results to those of a reference device (the "Discover A" by Hologic) in terms of body fat percentage, lean mass percentage of total body mass and for different subregions (left and right arms, left and right sides, lumbar and thoracic spine, pelvis, left and right legs, head, android area, gynecoid area, visceral region). - And by the evaluation of the reproducibility of the BC measurement results in terms of fat mass and lean mass.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objective of this study is to cross calibrate the measures of bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) from the Stratos DR against those of the Discovery A on the whole body and its subregions.</detailed_description>
