	<brief_summary>To prospectively evaluate the utility of genomic expression data as a tool to better characterize the tumors of individual patients, and to understand how genomic information from individual patients undergoing routine clinical testing can be used in population-level analysis to improve treatment and outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decipher Genomics Resource Information Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational study involving the release of genome-wide expression data allowing participating institutions to pair these data with clinical treatment and outcome data for patients in whom Decipher testing was performed. Through these collaborations, the GRID database population will be used to characterize the genomics of cancer and discover new gene expression signatures that may be useful for expanding the current understanding of the biology of the disease.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Decipher PostOp Clinical Indications Patient must have achieved initial PSA nadir (defined as undetectable PSA of ≤0.1 ng/mL) within 46 weeks, and Pathological stage T2 disease with a positive surgical margin, or Pathological stage T3 disease (e.g., extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, bladder neck invasion), or High Preoperative PSA (e.g., PSA ≥20 ng/mL), or High Gleason grade disease (e.g., Gleason 7 to 10 or Tertiary Gleason pattern 5), or Perineural, lymphovascular invasion, or Lymph node involvement, or Rising PSA or Biochemical Recurrence Decipher Biopsy Clinical Indications • Any patient diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and assessed as being very low, low, intermediate or high risk by NCCN guidelines: 1. Very low risk: T1c, Gleason score ≤ 6, PSA &lt; 10ng/mL, fewer than 3 prostate biopsy cores positive, 50% cancer in any core, PSA density &lt;0.15 ng/mL/g 2. Low risk: T1T2a, Gleason score ≤ 6, PSA &lt; 10ng/mL 3. Intermediate risk: T2bT2c, Gleason score 7, or PSA 1020 ng/mL 4. High risk: T3a, or Gleason score 810, or PSA &gt; 20 ng/mL 1. Diagnosed with metastatic disease (M1) 2. Metastatic Disease (M+) prior to surgery 3. For salvage setting patients: Metastatic Disease (M+) at PSA rise 4. Received any neoadjuvant prostate cancer treatment before radical prostatectomy 5. Required patient clinical data is not available for evaluation of eligibility criteria 6. Any other medical condition that the treating physician,study investigators or designee determines should exclude the subject from the study</criteria>
