	<brief_summary>This project is a randomized trial of two strategies to treat persons with genotype 1 HCV who currently inject drugs (PWIDs) with a once daily regime of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (LDV-SOF) for 8 weeks. The study will enroll 30 participants and will assess the feasibility and acceptability of treating active PWIDs for HCV with LDV-SOF by modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) versus unobserved dosing, with motivational interviewing based adherence support; and assess through in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews, the challenges with time intensity required for mDOT and unobserved dosing interventions, and identify key factors affecting treatment adherence.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. ≥18 years of age; 2. 2 consecutive positive HCV RNA tests at least 6 months after estimated date of infection; 3. HCV genotype 1; 4. HCV RNA &lt;6 million copies by Roche TaqMan Assay 5. No evidence of hepatic cirrhosis (as determined by two indices: Fib4&lt;3.25—an accurate test for detecting cirrhosis based on age, AST, ALT and platelets [sensitivity/specificity 76100/8291%], confirmed by the fibrosiscirrhosis index (FCI)&lt;1.25 based on ALT, bilirubin, albumin and platelets [sensitivity/specificity 86/100%]); 6. Drug injection in past 30 days by selfreport and physical exam evidence of injection drug use (e.g. track marks), 7. injected with others in past 12 months by selfreport; 8. Lab values within acceptable range (platelets&gt;50,000, creatinine clearance by CockroftGault&gt;30mL/min, hemoglobin &gt;10g/dL, INR&lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless stable on anticoagulant regimen or known hemophilia, AST/ALT&lt;10 x ULN); 9. Able to speak English; 10. No plans to leave San Francisco area for at least 9 months and either lives or works in San Francisco, or travels to San Francisco at least weekly; 11. for women of childbearing age, pregnancy test negative, not actively nursing, and agree to use birth control during treatment (although LDVSOF has a "B" rating, consistent with no known evidence of harm, treatment is not urgent for these patients so we will err on the side of caution). 1. HIV+ by rapid test or pooled viral load; 2. HBV surface antigen +; 3. Nondefinitive HCV genotype results; 4. Previously received treatment for HCV (interferon, ribavirin, or DAA); 5. Taking medications that affect pharmacokinetics of LDVSOF (protonpump inhibitors, anticonvulsants [phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine], rifamycins, rosuvastatin, herbs [St. John's wort, silymarin, echinacea]); 6. History of any of the following: 1. Current gastrointestinal disorder or postoperative condition that could interfere with the absorption of the study drug 2. History of hepatic decompensation (i.e., ascites, encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage) 3. History of solid organ or bone marrow transplantation. 4. Current treatment for cancer 7. Chronic liver disease for non HCV reason, except iron overload (e.g., Wilson's disease, alfa 1 antitrypsin deficiency, cholangitis); 8. Use of any prohibited concomitant medications as described in Section 5.2 within 21 days of the Day 1 visit; and 9. Known hypersensitivity to LDV, SOF, the metabolites, or formulation excipients. 10. No other conditions that preclude study involvement as determined by PI.</criteria>
