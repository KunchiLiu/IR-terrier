	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a pre-operative regimen of the study drug, IRX-2, a human cell-derived biologic with multiple active cytokine components, plus a single dose of cyclophosphamide, followed by 21 days of indomethacin, zinc-containing multivitamins, and omeprazole is active in treatment of oral cavity cancer. The regimen is intended to stimulate an immune response against the cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IRX-2 Regimen in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II, III, or IVA Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the activity and safety of the IRX Regimen in participants with newly diagnosed, untreated, surgically resectable squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Regimen 1: IRX-2 + cyclophosphamide + indomethacin + zinc + omeprazole, or Regimen 2: cyclophosphamide + indomethacin + zinc + omeprazole. The primary study hypothesis is that the Regimen 1 with IRX-2 prolongs event-free survival and overall survival when compared to Regimen 2 without IRX-2. Subjects will be randomized to either Regimen 1 or Regimen 2 on a 2:1 basis and treated prior to surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) Stage II, III, or IVA squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity (excluding lip) 2. Disease surgically resectable with curative intent 3. Hematological function: hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dL; lymphocyte count &gt;500 x 109/mL; neutrophil count &gt;1500 x 109/mL; platelet count &gt;100,000 x 109/mL 4. Hepatic function: serum albumin &gt;3.0 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) &lt;3x the upper limits of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase &lt;2x the ULN 5. Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.4x the ULN 6. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/minute (Appendix 3) 7. At least 18 years of age 8. Willing and able to give informed consent and adhere to protocol therapy 9. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;=70% 10. Able and willing to use a medically acceptable form of pregnancy prevention 11. Negative urine/serum pregnancy test, if applicable 1. Prior surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy other than biopsy or emergency procedure required for supportive care of this oral cavity cancer. 2. Any medical contraindications or previous therapy that would preclude treatment with either IRX 2 Regimen 1 or 2 or the surgery, reconstruction or adjuvant therapy required to treat the oral tumor appropriately 3. Clinical status of either subject or tumor such that administration of 21 day neoadjuvant IRX2 Regimen 1 or 2 before surgery would be medically inappropriate 4. Tumor of the oropharynx 5. Other clinical issues that would make participation in this clinical trial inappropriate.</criteria>
