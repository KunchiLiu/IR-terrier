	<brief_summary>Exercise is effective at reducing pain while improving physical function. However we do not know if exercise can boost resilience in the workplace, to allow people with osteoarthritis to work as long as they desire. Previous research shows that exercise holds the most promise for helping people enjoy their work because it reduces sick time, reduces pain, and improves productivity. However, little work has examined the effect of exercise for people with arthritis in the workplace. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether exercise improves resilience in the workplace, mobility, fitness, strength, and pain in comparison to no exercise in those with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resilience for Older Workers With OA Through Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Canadian workforce is aging. The most prevalent age group is 50-54 years and most of these Canadians will aim to continue working over the next 10 years. However, the impact of arthritis on aging Canadians compromises their ability to continue working. By 2031, over 2 million Canadians aged 45 to 64 years will have arthritis. We aim to boost the ability of older adults with the most common arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), to engage in the workforce for as long as they desire. Identifying strategies to promote productivity among older workers with knee and hip OA will be of great public health significance in the coming decades. However, we face two challenges. First, obesity among sedentary workers is a risk for worsening knee and hip OA. Second, large occupational loads on the knee and hip worsen OA. Exercise has the most promise in addressing these challenges because it reduces pain and sick time, and improves mental health. Thus, there is a call for studies examining exercise for the aging worker with knee and hip OA. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of an OA-specific leg strengthening exercise program, delivered within the workplace, on mobility, pain, physical capacity, and resilience among older workers with knee or hip OA.</detailed_description>
