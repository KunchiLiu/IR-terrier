	<brief_summary>Latent myofascial trigger points (LMTRP) which impair neuromuscular performance occur in both, patients and asymptomatic subjects. As evidence suggests that LMTRP can transform into active trigger points, therapy seems warranted. Besides other modalities, self-massage using foam rollers (self-myofascial release) has been applied as a treatment. However, there is no data on the efficacy of this method concerning LMTRP. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the effects of different forms of self-myofascial release on LMTRP pain. Healthy patients with LMTRP in the calf are randomly allocated to one of three groups: 1) 90s static compression of the most sensitive LMTRP by means of the foam roll, 2) dynamic self-myofascial release rolling back and forth on the calf muscles for 90s using a foam roller, 3) placebo laser acupuncture of the most sensitive LMTRP. All subjects participate in a familiarization session with the foam roller one week prior to treatments. As an outcome, pressure pain threshold is assessed with an algometer. The investigators hypothesize, that static compression can reduce pressure pain of LMTRP more effective than dynamic self-myofascial release. The investigators further expect that placebo treatment will be the least effective method.</brief_summary>
