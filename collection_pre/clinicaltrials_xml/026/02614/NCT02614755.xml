	<brief_title>An Observational Study of Lumosity in Seniors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 200 prospective users currently will be provided free 6-month premium access Lumosity accounts. Participants will be provided with an account activation code and instructed on how to sign up for Lumosity with their email address. They will be subject to the Lumosity Terms of Service and follow the typical user experience. Upon creating an account, users would be asked to complete a short demographic survey that includes questions on gender, education, occupation, years since retirement, health, computer familiarity, and perceptions of brain training. Those who sign up will have immediate access to the Lumosity training system and the entire suite of Lumosity games. In addition, they will be invited, via email, to take the Brain Performance Test one week after the initial sign-up and then again 12 weeks later. Approximately every 8 weeks, users will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about their experience with Lumosity. This questionnaire will be accessed via email. Participants will be asked to train 5 days a week for 20-30 minutes per day, but are free to play as much or a little as they choose. Community associates at the sites will be encouraged to host group training sessions, giving the seniors a chance to gather and complete their training together, share their experiences, and get any help they may need. In addition, sites will have the option of hosting 1-2 focus groups with participants and researchers from Lumos Labs. The focus groups will be an opportunity to give and receive direct feedback about Lumosity, and get any questions answered by the researchers.</detailed_description>
