	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) With Mitomycin C Used During Surgery for Treatment of Locally Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) with Mitomycin C used during surgery for treatment of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma is effective in the treatment of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma. The Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) is expected to be an effective treatment with minimal side effects, it has already provided clear benefits in terms of overall survival in patients with advanced cancer. This is an attractive option for the healthcare professionals who face daily to peritoneal recurrence after performing complex surgeries, however its application is difficult due to the cost and resources increase. This leads to the necessity of administering the treatment within a clinical trials and in order to obtain a significant power this clinical trials will be multicenter and it will be performed in several Oncological surgery Units highly specialised and with extensive experience in colorectal carcinoma.</detailed_description>
