	<brief_title>Urinary Incontinence Amongst Women With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-centre study will consist of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel group design and include two intervention groups and one control group. Recruitment and data collection will occur simultaneously at the Ã˜HT and St. Olav's Hospital in Trondheim. All participants will complete an initial four week general group exercise class (1 hour once a week) prior to randomisation. This intervention will focus on strength exercises (lower limb and upper limb), endurance training, balance training and thorax mobilising exercises. All participants will be examined and complete questionnaires at two occasions; after the initial four weeks general exercise/before intervention, and at 16 weeks post-randomisation. Participants will be randomised to either Intervention group A (pelvic floor muscle training group), Intervention group B (cough-suppression group) or a control group who will receive brief written information about pelvic floor muscle training and cough-suppression, but no other form of regular follow-up or intervention throughout the intervention period.</detailed_description>
