	<brief_title>Imatinib's Effect on the Suppression of Malaria Parasites in Patients With Uncomplicated Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An exploratory study to examine the efficacy and safety of imatinib mesylate on the suppression of parasitemia in patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In vitro studies of P. falciparum parasitized erythrocytes demonstrate that inhibitors of the protein tyrosine kinase SYK prevent malaria parasite egress from infected red blood cells and thereby eliminate the parasitemia. Although no potent syk kinase inhibitors are currently approved for human use, a bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib mesylate (GleevecÂ®)) that also exhibits weaker (15-fold) inhibition of syk tyrosine kinase, has been FDA-approved for treatment of a number of human malignancies including chronic myelogenous leukemia and GIST. Because imatinib can be taken daily for many years without significant toxicity, it can be used to obtain a preliminary indication of whether inhibition of erythrocyte syk kinase can suppress parasitemia in patients with P. falciparum malaria. If anti-malaria activity is observed with imatinib, resources will be committed to developing an inexpensive, more potent syk kinase inhibitor for dedicated treatment of malaria.</detailed_description>
