	<brief_summary>This was a prospective, single center, open label, randomized study evaluating the biological effect of squalamine lactate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% combined with intravitreous ranibizumab in patients with macular edema secondary to branch, hemi-central and central retinal vein occlusion (BRVO, HRVO, CRVO).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Squalamine Lactate for the Treatment of Macular Edema Related to Retinal Vein Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At baseline, all eyes underwent ETDRS visual acuity measurements at 4 meters, a complete ophthalmological evaluation, SD-OCT imaging of the macula, and fluorescein angiographic assessment of capillary perfusion in the macula and peripheral fundus. All eyes received an initial 10 week mandatory loading period of topical squalamine therapy. All eyes received mandatory intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.5mg at the conclusions of weeks 2 and 6. At the conclusion of week 10, eyes were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue squalamine drops bid or discontinue squalamine drops in the study eye. All eyes were examined every 4 weeks through the week 38 endpoint and were eligible to receive additional as needed ranibizumab 0.5mg injections starting at the conclusion of week 10 and every 4 weeks thereafter through week 34 depending upon prespecified visual acuity and OCT retreatment criteria. Any eye with a decrease of 5 or more ETDRS letters or increase in CST on OCT of 50uM or more from their best previous measurements automatically received an additional ranibizumab 0.5mg injection beginning at the conclusion of week 10. Eyes randomized to continue squalamine drops did so through the week 38 endpoint. SD-OCT measurements of the macula were obtained at every study visit. Fluorescein angiograms were performed on the study eye at baseline, weeks 10 and 38. Safety endpoints included all adverse events spontaneously reported, elicited or observed were documented by the investigators at any visit.</detailed_description>
