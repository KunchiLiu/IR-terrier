	<brief_summary>An increasing number of clinical studies on SD-OCT of ocular pathologies and potential new clinical applications has recently been published in the peer-reviewed literature. However, the successful use of SD-OCT in routine clinical use depends upon the diagnostic sensitivity, biometric accuracy and reliability of the SD-OCT machines. This prospective, comparative, observational study aims to evaluate the imaging quality and diagnostic performance of two commercially available SD-OCT machines for both the anterior and posterior segment of the eye.</brief_summary>
