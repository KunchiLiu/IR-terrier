	<brief_summary>The objective of this research is to determine if the addition of the Clear Guide ONE, a Computer Assisted Instrument Guidance (CAIG) system, provides improvement over existing ultrasound guided, needle-based procedures for peripheral nerve blocks. The ultrasound can visualize the targeted vessel or nerve, but the addition of the CAIG may help the clinician better guide the needle to the target.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study will be a randomized, single-blinded control trial. The clinicians cannot be blinded, but the person questioning the patient post-op to determine success rate will be blinded. There will be two randomized groups of patients: control and test. The control group will receive the procedure with traditional methods and equipment currently in use at Cooper University. The test group will receive the same procedure utilizing existing ultrasound equipment with the supplemental CAIG system.</detailed_description>
