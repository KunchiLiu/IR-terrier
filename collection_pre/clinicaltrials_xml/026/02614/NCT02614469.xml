	<brief_title>A Food-Drug Interaction Study of Serum Urate After Oral Inosine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighteen (18) eligible healthy male subjects will be randomly assigned to two groups with 9 subjects per group to receive a single oral dose of 1000 mg inosine with or without food on day 1 after an overnight fast. Subjects who receive inosine with food on day 1 will receive a second dose of inosine without food on day 8 after an overnight fast. Subjects who receive inosine without food on day 1 after an overnight fast will receive a second dose of inosine with food on day 8 after an overnight fast. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic before dinner on days 0 and 7, the days before dosing, and will stay in the clinic for 48-h post-dose. During the clinic stay, blood samples will be taken for urate measurements.</detailed_description>
