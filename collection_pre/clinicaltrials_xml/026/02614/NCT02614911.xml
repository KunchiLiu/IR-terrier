	<brief_summary>This study has been set up in order to characterize phenotypes and genotypes of patients with early onset enteropathies. In that goal, Investigators will collect biological samples (mainly blood) of patients suffering from early onset enteropathies and their healthy relatives.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization of Phenotype and Genotype of Early Onset Enteropathies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study specifically aims at the genetic analysis of early onset enteropathies with the goal in mind to delineate human pathways necessary to maintain intestinal homeostasis despite the considerable density of microbes colonizing the distal part of the human intestine.</detailed_description>
