	<brief_summary>A wealth of research has demonstrated that they way in which the investigators recall our personal, autobiographical memories is influential in the course of depression. Biases in the recall of autobiographical memory occur in the midst of a depressive episode, and are shown to prolong symptoms, however these biases also remain when depression remits, and may predispose the individual towards relapse. A novel cognitive intervention, MemFlex, aims to train individuals to be flexible in their retrieval of autobiographical memories, and thereby reduce depressive relapse. Changes in memory bias may also have an effect on intermediate processes that increase risk of depression, such as rumination, impaired problem solving, and cognitive avoidance. This feasibility trial compares the effects of MemFlex and Psychoeducation in their ability to reduce memory bias and intermediate cognitive risk factors, and thereby depressive relapse, in individuals remitted from Major Depressive Disorder. Clinical outcome and process measures will be assessed immediately following completion of the intervention, at 6 months post-intervention, and at 12 months post-intervention. If encouraging, the results of this pilot trial may provide a foundation for a later phase trial.</brief_summary>
