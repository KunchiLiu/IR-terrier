	<brief_summary>This is a Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of SFX-01 in Subarachnoid Haemorrhage, with exploratory evaluations of efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SFX01 After Subarachnoid Haemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group design comparing SFX-01 (300 mg) taken orally as capsules or as a suspension via a nasogastric tube (NG) twice-daily for up to 28 days versus placebo in 90 patients who have had SAH and present within 48 hours of ictus. The treatment group will receive SFX-01 in order to improve outcome and reduce the long-term complications of SAH such as Delayed Cerebral Ischaemia, as reflected by Trans-Cranial Doppler (TCD) readings. The objective is to demonstrate safety and search for signals of efficacy in patients that have had SAH. A sub-study will be conducted in up to 12 patients where an External Ventricular Drain (EVD) fitted; serial CSF samples will be taken pre- &amp; post-dose on two occasions to determine pharmacokinetics of Sulforaphane in CSF in comparison with plasma pharmacokinetics. Sub-study patients will undergo all other procedures (with the exception of lumbar puncture). Treatment duration is up to 28 days; follow up duration is 28 days, three and six months. The planned trial period is 24 months.</detailed_description>
