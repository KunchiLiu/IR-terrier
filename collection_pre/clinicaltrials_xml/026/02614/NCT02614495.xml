	<brief_summary>A multi-center , opened, Phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of Sulfatinib 300 mg Sulfatinib in advanced Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma ( MTC) and iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Sulfatinib in Treating Advanced Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma and Iodine-refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study adopt Simon's two-stage designs method. In the first stage, When the first 12 patients enrolled complete therapy of Cycle 1, investigators and sponsors will analyze safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data, to determine whether the dose is suitable for TC and enrollment should be stopped during this period.15 subjects will be enrolled in both subgroups (advanced MTC and iodine-refractory DTC), and more 10 subjects in each subgroups will be enrolled after efficacy assessment in the second stage. Patients receive oral sulfatinib at a dose of 300mg/d within 1 hour after breakfast (once-daily dosing continuously, every 28-day treatment cycle) until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicity, or in the opinion of the investigator, patients were no longer deriving clinical beneﬁt、lost to follow-up、withdrew informed consent form, or sponsors terminated the study, whichever comes first.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Informed consent must be obtained in writing for all subjects before enrollment into the study; 2. Age 18 years or older 3. Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced and/ or metastatic MTC or iodinerefractory DTC (papillary, follicular , Hürthle cell and other variable type carcinoma), losing the surgical indications or can't undertake external radiotherapy 4. Subjects must show evidence of disease progression within 12 months (assessed and confirmed by central radiographic review of CT and/or MRI scans) before initial treatment of this study 5. Subjects must be Irefractory / resistant as defined by at least one of the following: One or more measurable lesions that has progressed by CT and/or MRI scans within 12 months of Iodine131 (131I) therapy; One or more measurable lesions that do not demonstrate 131I uptake on any radioiodine scan ; Cumulative activity of 131I of &gt; 600 millicurie or 22 gigabecquerel (GBS), and independently reviewed radiologic evidence of progression within the previous 12 months before initial treatment of this study 6. At least 6 months of last dose administered prior to study treatment 7. Subjects may have received 0 or 1 prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFRtargeted therapy (for example , patients with MTC have received vandetanib or cabozantinib; patients with DTC have received sorafenib or lenvatinib) or other targeted inhibitors 8. Subjects with DTC, serum thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) concentration should be lower than 0.1 milliunits per litre (mU/L) (or other corresponding units) before enrollment into the study; Subjects with MTC, levels of serum TSH concentration should be in the normal range 9. Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 01 10. Subjects must have measurable lesions meeting the criteria of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 11. The expecting life scan was more than 12 weeks 12. Females or Males of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., a doublebarrier method, condom, a injective or oral contraceptive, an intrauterine device) throughout the entire study period and for 90 days after study drug discontinuation. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal. 1. Absolute neutrophil count 1.5×109/L, or platelet&lt;100 ×109/L, or hemoglobin&lt; 9g/dL 2.

Serum creatinine≥1.5 the upper limit of normal (ULN) , or estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min 5. Subjects having≥2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo 24h urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Subjects with urine protein≥1g/24 h will be ineligible 6. International normalized ratio (INR) ≥1.5 the ULN or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≥1.5 the ULN (For patients requiring anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, a stable INR between 23 is required) 7. Serum potassium, calcium (albuminbound ionic or corrected) or magnesium exceed the normal range with clinical significance 8. Active hypertension (systolic pressure≥140mm Hg, or diastolic pressure ≥90mm Hg) that drugs can't control 9. Gastrointestinal disease or condition that investigators suspect may affect drug absorption, including but not limited to, previously subtotal gastrectomy surgery, active gastric and duodenal ulcers, ulcerative colitis and other digestive disease, gastrointestinal tumor with active bleeding, or other gastrointestinal conditions that may cause bleeding or perforation by investigator's discretion 10. History or presence of a serious hemorrhage (&gt;30 ml within 3 months), hemoptysis (&gt;5 ml blood within 4 weeks) or a thromboembolic event (including transient ischemic attack) within 12 months 11.

Prolongation of QT interval to≥480 ms 13. Active malignancy (except for definitively treated melanoma insitu, basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma insitu of the cervix) within the past 5 years 14. Patients were excluded from the study if they had received antitumor therapies, including but not related to chemotherapy, radial radiation therapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy, or treatment with herb product within 4 weeks prior to initial treatment of this study. TSH suppression therapy is not included 15. Patients receive palliative irradiation for the bone metastasis within 2 weeks prior to before initial treatment of this study 16.
