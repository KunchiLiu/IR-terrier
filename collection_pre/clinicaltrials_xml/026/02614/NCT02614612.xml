	<criteria>Have undergone first alloHSCT from any donor source (matched unrelated donor, sibling, haploidentical) using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood for hematologic malignancies. Recipients of nonmyeloablative and myeloablative transplants are eligible. Clinically suspected Grades IIB to IVD acute GVHD as per modified MNCIBMTR criteria, occurring after alloHSCT with any conditioning regimen and any antiGVHD prophylactic program. Subjects may, but are not required to, have previously received corticosteroids for acute GVHD: Evidence of myeloid engraftment. Use of growth factor supplementation is allowed. Has received more than 1 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Has progressed on more than 2 prior treatment regimens for acute GVHD. Presence of an active uncontrolled infection. Subjects with relapsed primary disease, or subjects who have been treated for relapse after the allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantation (alloHSCT) was performed. Inadequate recovery from toxicity and/or complications from the prior alloHSCT. Any corticosteroid therapy (for indications other than GVHD) at doses &gt; 1 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent within 7 days of randomization. Previously received JAK inhibitor therapy for any indication.</criteria>
