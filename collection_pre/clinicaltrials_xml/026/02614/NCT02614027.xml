	<brief_summary>To evaluate the prevalence of lipodystrophy syndrome in patients receiving currently available antiretroviral drugs, and the prevalence of associated metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected patients with a previous diagnosis of lipodystrophy syndrome, according to the severity of fat accumulation and antiretroviral drug use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence of Lipodystrophy Syndrome and Its Role as Cause of Metabolic Disturbances</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cross-sectional evaluation of two groups of patients: - patients receiving currently available drugs, in order to determine the changes in fat accumulation by successive dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) determinations - patients with previous lipodystrophy syndrome, as evaluated by questionnaire (HOPS) and total body dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), in order to determine the prevalence of hypertension, low high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, glucose disturbance (insulin resistance or diabetes), fat accumulation (waist circumference) and hypertriglyceridemia. The prevalence of Metabolic syndrome will be evaluated according to the different definitions (IDF, NCEP-ATP III, WHO).</detailed_description>
