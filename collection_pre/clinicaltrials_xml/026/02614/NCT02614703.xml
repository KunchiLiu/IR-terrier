	<brief_title>"Acetic Acid Chromoendoscopy in Barrett's Esophagus Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus is often focal and can be missed by nontargeted biopsies alone. In recent years, various advanced endoscopic techniques have been utilized, but with varying success rates. Narrow-band imaging, trimodal imaging, spectral imaging and i-scan are technologies that are manufacturer dependent with limited varying success rates and have financial implications. At our institution, narrow band imaging is routinely utilized as a diagnostic tool for detecting Barrett's esophagus. Acetic acid is a commonly available dye that has been used in the detection of neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. This study is aimed to prove the effectiveness of acetic acid chromoendoscopy in our Barrett's esophagus surveillance population. The goal is to compare the neoplasia yield of acetic acid chromoendoscopy with that of standardized random biopsy protocol. The sensitivity and specificity for neoplasia detection by these two methods will also be analyzed. Investigators plan to conduct this prospective randomized study for a period of one and a half years (beginning August 1, 2015, ending February 29, 2016). Based on data from 2014, we anticipate to enroll approximately 185 patients. All gastroenterologists (with privileges at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance) will participate in this study. Patients will be randomized to either acetic acid chromoendoscopy or current standard of care (standardized random biopsy protocol utilizing narrow band imaging). Random biopsies from both protocols and targeted biopsies (if identified) will be obtained and submitted to pathology department. These will be reviewed independently by two pathologists. Any discordant results will be reviewed by an outside expert pathologist. Statistical data analysis will be performed utilizing Datadesk XL software.</detailed_description>
