	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of buparlisib when given together with ofatumumab or ibrutinib in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Buparlisib and ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ofatumumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving buparlisib or ibrutinib and ofatumumab together may work better in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Buparlisib and Ofatumumab or Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of combined ofatumumab and buparlisib in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have been exposed to ibrutinib (i.e., ibrutinib pre-treated). II. To evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of combined ibrutinib and buparlisib in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have NOT been exposed to ibrutinib (i.e., ibrutinib naïve) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine specific toxicities associated with combined buparlisib and ofatumumab. II. Evaluate for efficacy of buparlisib in combination with ofatumumab in ibrutinib pre-treated patients with CLL/SLL. III. To determine specific toxicities associated with combined buparlisib and ibrutinib. IV. To evaluate for efficacy of buparlisib in combination with ibrutinib in ibrutinib naive patients with CLL/SLL. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of buparlisib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment cohorts. COHORT A (ibrutinib pre-treated): Patients receive buparlisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and ofatumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 during of courses 1-2; and day 1 of courses 4-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. COHORT B (ibrutinib naive): Patients receive buparlisib as in Cohort A and ibrutinib PO on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

there is no minimum dose of ibrutinib; any prior administration will disqualify patients for the ibrutinibnaïve cohort and will require enrollment on the ibrutinib pretreated cohort Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or creatinine clearance &gt;

patients with a history of depression who would otherwise be eligible should be evaluated by a mental health professional prior to enrollment if there is any uncertainty regarding the status of their mental health; Note: for patients with psychotropic treatments ongoing at baseline, the dose and the schedule should not be modified within the previous 6 weeks prior to start of study drug Patient has ≥ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 anxiety Patient has other prior or concurrent malignancy (except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or other adequately treated in situ cancer, early gastric or GI cancer resected completely by endoscopy procedures or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for ≥ 3 years) Patient has a history of noncompliance to medical regimen or inability to grant consent Patient is concurrently using other approved or investigational antineoplastic agent Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test (&gt; 5 milliinternational unit [mIU]/mL); patients with elevated hCG at baseline that is judged to be related to the tumor are eligible if hCG levels do not show the expected doubling when repeated 57 days later, or pregnancy has been ruled out by vaginal ultrasound Patient who is not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study and through the duration as defined below: Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 16 weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a child in this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and through at least 4 weeks after the final dose of study treatment Highly effective contraception is defined as either: Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject; (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception) Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient) Use a combination of the following (both a+b): a. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) b. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository c. Note: hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not allowed as buparlisib decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives Women are considered postmenopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago; for women with therapyinduced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status; NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian suppression Patients with a history of central nervous system involvement by CLL or who have prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) Patients with known hepatitis B or hepatitis C (active or carriers) Patients with diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 Patients who have received oral or IV chemotherapy or targeted anticancer therapy ≤ 2 weeks (4 weeks for nitrosourea, antibodies or mitomycinC) prior to study enrollment; steroids used for anticancer properties must be tapered to 10 mg or less of prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to initiating therapy Patients who have received prior treatment with a panselective PI3K inhibitor are not eligible</criteria>
