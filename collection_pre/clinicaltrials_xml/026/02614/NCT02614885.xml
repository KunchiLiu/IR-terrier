	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Cavitary Radiofrequency Ablation in Excised Mastectomy Breast Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single-center, prospective, open label study of a radiofrequency ablation device. 10 patients who are scheduled to undergo prophylactic mastectomy will be recruited by the clinical investigators at the investigational site in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once the breast tissue is removed, the radiofrequency ablation device will be used on the ex vivo tissue to ablate a lesion around a cavity created in the tissue. The ablation lesion will be characterized. The study period per subject is the time it takes to assess the ablation lesion histologically.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Female 2. At least 18 years of age 3. Scheduled to receive a standard of care prophylactic mastectomy (or prophylactic bilateral mastectomy) 4. The patients' breast(s) to be included in the study are undiseased 5. The patient has adequate breast volume for ex vivo ablation procedure 1. The patient is receiving a skin sparing mastectomy(s) 2. The patient has had previous exposure to chemotherapy or radiation therapy 3. The patient has implants in the breast(s) to be included in the study 4. The patient is currently pregnant or lactating 5. The patient has tissue markers implanted in the breast to be included in the study (unless these can be removed when creating a cavity in the ex vivo breast tissue) 6. The patient has had previous surgery on the breast(s) to be included in the study (unless study investigator determines that this will not affect the validity of data in this study) 7. The patient in participating in any other clinical study of a device or drug that may impact the participant safety of the validity of data acquired in this study</criteria>
