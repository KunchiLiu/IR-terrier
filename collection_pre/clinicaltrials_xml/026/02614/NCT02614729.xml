	<brief_summary>The purpose of the main study is to determine whether the daily consumption of protein-rich meals containing high quality, lean beef products improves appetite control and cognitive function during a weight maintenance diet. The purpose of the sub-study is to determine whether the daily consumption of protein-rich meals containing the same amount of high quality, lean beef products improves appetite control and cognitive function during a modest energy restriction, weight loss diet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Consumption of Beef on Appetite and Cognitive Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two cross-over design studies were completed in overweight, sedentary but otherwise healthy women. For study 1, 17 participants randomly consumed 4 eucaloric diets containing standard-protein (SP; 76±1g protein/d) or high-protein (HP; 126±1g protein/d) for 7 consecutive days/treatment. The SP treatments contained all plant proteins (PLANT) or a combination of beef and plant proteins (BEEF) that were evenly distributed throughout the day (EVEN). The HP treatments were also BEEF provided as EVEN or an uneven distribution (UNEVEN) pattern. For study 2, 17 participants randomly consumed 3 energy restriction (1250 kcal/d) diets containing SP-PLANT (EVEN) and SP-BEEF (EVEN) (both, 48±1g protein/d) or HP-BEEF (EVEN) (123±1g protein/d). During day 6 of each treatment (for both studies), the participants completed a 12-h controlled-feeding, clinical testing day which included repeated appetite, satiety, food cravings, and mood questionnaires; blood sampling; and cognitive function/performance testing. During day 7 of each treatment (for both studies), the participants completed a free-living, ad libitum testing day at home/work to assess ad libitum (voluntary) daily intake and food choice. Each of the 7-day dietary patterns occurred during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, there were 2-3 week washout periods between dietary treatments.</detailed_description>
