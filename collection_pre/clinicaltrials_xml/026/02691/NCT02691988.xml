	<brief_summary>Rationale: Because long-term use of ICS is associated with an increased likelihood of side-effects such as increased risk of pneumonia and loss of bone density, it is important to limit prescription of ICS to patients who have a clear indication for this treatment. In addition, avoiding unnecessary treatment with ICS could reduce the burden that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) puts on healthcare budgets. The recently updated COPD guideline of the Dutch college of General Practitioners (NHG) emphasizes the importance of optimizing medical treatment for COPD patients with only limited room for the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate whether discontinuation of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients without a clear indication for ICS according to current guidelines results in a reduction of ICS use without adverse health effects for the patients involved. Study design: The study is a pragmatic, clustered, parallel group, non-inferiority trial in Dutch general practices with a follow-up of 26 weeks per patient. Study population: 620 COPD patients with confirmed chronic airflow obstruction, aged â‰¥ 40 yrs who use ICS for at least the prior 6 months without a clear indication. Intervention (if applicable): Guided ICS withdrawal in optimised COPD management. All study participants (of both study arms) will receive recommendations on optimal bronchodilator therapy and a personalized action plan to recognize symptom deterioration in an early stage. Main study parameters/endpoints: Number of exacerbation-free weeks. Secondary study parameters: successful cessation of ICS, time to first exacerbation, number of moderate and severe exacerbations, health-related quality of life, health status, and pneumonias. Moreover, information on the process of care and costs will be collected. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Many COPD patients use ICS without a clear indication. Long-term use of ICS is associated with an increased likelihood of side-effects such as increased risk of pneumonia and loss of bone density and should be avoided in those who do not benefit from it. However, there is a small subgroup of COPD patients that have reduced numbers of exacerbations because of their ICS use and it is impossible to identify a priori the patients who this applies too. Therefore, it is important that the ICS discontinuation is guided to detect potential deteriorations early on.</brief_summary>
