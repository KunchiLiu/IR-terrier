	<brief_title>Displacement Between PVC and Silicon DLT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung isolation and differential lung ventilation, resulting in collapse of operative lung and ventilation of non-operating lung (one lung ventilation; OLV) are essential for thoracic surgery in lung, esophagus and thoracic aorta. DLT, consisted of tracheal and bronchial lumens, is commonly used to perform differential lung ventilation. The correct position of each lumen in trachea and main bronchus is essential for successful OLV. However, DLT displacement occurs commonly while patients are changed position from the supine to the lateral. The deleterious consequences of a malpositioned DLT can be substantial, even life-threatening including severe hypoxemia. Considering displacement of DLT during position change and surgical traction, previous studies recommended endobronchial cuff of DLT should be positioned at 0.5cm below the tracheal carina when using left-sided DLT. However, it is based on the data from several research conducted by PVC DLT. These days, Silicon DLT, different in material from PVC DLT, is also widely used in clinical practice. Silicon DLT is different in not only position of ballon but also distance of each lumen. Furthermore,there are no identified studies about the displacement of silicon DLT during patient position change in thoracic surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the movement of silicon DLT during positional change from supine to lateral for finding the proper positioning of DLT. The investigators compare the difference of displacement between PVC DLT and silicon DLT distance during positional change from supine to lateral by fiberotic bronchoscope. And the investigators try to find proper position of PVC and silicon DLT, respectively, to perform safe and successful OLV during thoracic surgery.</detailed_description>
