	<brief_summary>Goal of this study is to measure serum cholinesterase activity in patients with traumatic and/or burns injury admitted to the emergency room by using point-of- care-test system (POCT). Serum cholinesterase activity, measured using POCT system, might play an important role in the early diagnosis and prediction of patient outcome in trauma-induced systemic inflammation.</brief_summary>
