	<brief_summary>Regional anesthesia improves quality of recovery after surgery in many studies. Ultrasound-guided serratus plane block is a novel technique which may be a viable alternative to current regional anesthetic techniques. This randomized, controlled trial is to examine the effects of ultrasound-guided serratus plane block anesthetic on the QoR after breast tumor resection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Serratus Plane Block for the Quality of Recovery After Modified Radical Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 72 subjects (36 patients for each groups) were enrolled in this study. Patients were allocated to either the general anesthesia group (group control) or SPB (serratus plane block) + general anesthesia groups (group SPB) using randomized central computer-generated sequence software (SAS 19.0). The allocation ratio was 1:1 for the two groups. Group assignment was concealed by opaque sticking envelops. The major research content is to evaluate the quality of recovery using 40 questionnaire (QoR-40).</detailed_description>
