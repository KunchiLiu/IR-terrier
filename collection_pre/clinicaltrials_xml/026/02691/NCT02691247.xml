	<brief_summary>This clinical trial will explore the safety and effect of autologous ex vivo expanded polyclonal regulatory T-cells on beta cell function in patients, aged 8 to 17, with recent onset T1DM. Other measures of diabetes severity and the autoimmune response underlying T1DM will also be explored. Eligible subjects will receive a single infusion of CLBS03 (high or low dose) or placebo.</brief_summary>
