	<brief_summary>Intussusception is one of the most frequent causes of acute bowel and second most common cause of acute abdominal pain in pediatric age .95 % of cases are idiopathic, the rest are either due to pathological lead point or post operative. Treatment of intussusception must start with medical resuscitation, then radiological or operative reduction of intussusception. Our surgery team has used hydrocortisone with the medical resuscitation to improve the success rate of pneumatic reduction and decrease the number of reduction trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Hydrocortisone on Improving Outcome of Pneumatic Reduction of Infantile Intussusception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental group will be given single dose IV Hydrocortisone 10 mg/kg with Resuscitation before attempting first trial of pneumatic reduction and the outcome measured. Control group will be given Saline 100 ml IV single injection with Resuscitation before attempting first trial of pneumatic reduction and the outcome measured.</detailed_description>
