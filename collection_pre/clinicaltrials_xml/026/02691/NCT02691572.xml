	<brief_title>Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Versus Wound Infiltration for Postcesarean Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, controlled, double-blind study will be conducted on ASA physical status II parturients with full-term singleton pregnancy undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Patients will receive either ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block or wound infiltration at the end of surgery. After delivery, all patients will receive standard analgesia (intravenous ketorolac and oral paracetamol) and patient-controlled analgesia with intravenous fentanyl. Total fentanyl consumption at 24 h, pain scores at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h, side effects, and patient satisfaction will be compared between the 2 groups.</detailed_description>
