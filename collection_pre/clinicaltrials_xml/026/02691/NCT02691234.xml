	<brief_summary>Low intensity shockwaves for treating diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) have been in evaluation for the past 5 years. Many researchers showed the effectiveness of Low intensity shockwaves of in accelerating the healing rate of non-ischemic chronic DFUs. Wang et al. showed, the use of Low intensity shockwaves on DFUs, significantly improved topical blood flow perfusion rate, increased cell proliferation and cell activity and decreased cell apoptosis. The present study deals with the effect of low intensity shockwaves on DFUs. Shockwave treatment will be done together with the standard conventional treatment for DFUs, compared to a control group who will receive the same conventional standard of care.</brief_summary>
