	<brief_summary>Diabetes-specific nutritional formulas (DSNFs) are frequently used as part of medical nutrition therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes in order to improve glycemic control and enhance weight reduction. The mechanism through which DSNFs improve postprandial (PP) plasma glucose is not yet known. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of 2 DSNFs versus oatmeal on PP plasma glucose, serum insulin and serum active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), serum free fatty acids (FFA) and serum triglycerides (TG).</brief_summary>
