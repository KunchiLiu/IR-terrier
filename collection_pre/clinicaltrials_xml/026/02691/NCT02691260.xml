	<detailed_description>In this study, community outpatients will participate in an effective, 24-week, low-carbohydrate weight loss program delivered via biweekly group classes. An innovative information technology (IT) solution will collate dietary self-monitoring data (input by patients via a mobile phone dietary application) and weight loss data (input by patients via remote scale). An algorithm will classify participants as achieving adequate or inadequate dietary self-monitoring and weight loss to earn intermittent rewards of varying value in real-time. Participants will be notified of earning rewards via text messaging.</detailed_description>
