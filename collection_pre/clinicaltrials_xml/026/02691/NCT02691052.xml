	<brief_summary>Current studies resulted in a superiority of a combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine vs. gemcitabine mono therapy, but no data are available yet on the quality of life (QoL) under this combination therapy. In the framework of a German multicenter prospective, observational study ('QoliXane'), detailed QoL-data are now collected. QoL development under treatment will be analyzed and data will be compared to existing data of the gemcitabine mono therapy. QoL and course of therapy are collected using the EORTC C30 questionnaires once a month over a 6-month period. Additionally patients are requested to answer a supplementary questionnaire addressing e.g. fears related to QoL deterioration and side effects of chemotherapy. Primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with maintained Global Health Status/QoL at 3 months (10 points threshold). 600 patients shall be enrolled at about 90 study sites in Germany.</brief_summary>
