	<brief_summary>Past literature showed encouraging effects of mycophenolate on dryness symptoms and quality of life in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Mycophenolate also has excellent immunomodulation effects in lupus nephritis. Currently Mycophenolate is only used in lupus nephritis and organ transplant. It is unknown whether low dosage of mycophenolate mofetil could be used to improve ocular dryness and oral dryness in patients with Sjogren's syndrome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sjogren's syndrome is one of the most common autoimmune diseases in Taiwan. It is characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. Although it is well established that Sjogren's syndrome is caused by infiltration and destruction of lacrimal gland and salivary gland by lymphocytic cells, effective treatment of patients' symptoms is lacking. Hydroxychloroquine is the most well-studied medication in Sjogren's syndrome. However, recent clinical trials showed disappointing effects of hydroxychloroquine in Sjogren's syndrome. Thus there is an unmet need to find effective treatment for patient's bothering symptoms. Mycophenolate is a selective inhibitor of inosinemonophosphate dehydrogenase which leads to inhibition of the de novo pathway of nucleotide synthesis. The antiproliferative effect of mycophenolate mainly affects activated T and B lymphocytes because the proliferation of these cells is critically dependent on the de novo purine synthesis compared with other eukaryotic cells. Since these lymphocytes have been suggested to play a pivotal role in the inflammation and immunopathogenesis of Sjogren's syndrome, mycophenolate might be a promising agent in the treatment of Sjogren's syndrome. Past literature showed encouraging effects of mycophenolate on dryness symptoms and quality of life in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Mycophenolate also has excellent immunomodulation effects in lupus nephritis. Currently mycophenolate is only used in lupus nephritis and organ transplant. It is unknown whether low dosage of mycophenolate could be used to improve ocular dryness and oral dryness in patients with Sjogren's syndrome.</detailed_description>
