	<brief_summary>Adaptation of the maternal immune system to accommodate the semi-allogeneic fetus is necessary for pregnancy success. Dysregulation of this immune adaptation is implicated in reproductive disorders as infertility, recurrent miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, and preeclampsia. The mechanisms being responsible for fetal tolerance are not known. Several T cell subsets have been implicated in fetal tolerance. The effects of preeclampsia on memory cells are not known. The main objective of this study is to analyze the effect of preeclampsia on levels of immune cells.</brief_summary>
