	<brief_summary>Amniotic fluid (AF) pH can be affected by the maternal and/or fetal conditions such as PPROM, prematurity or fetal distress. It is known that fetal urine is the major content of AF since 20th gestational week. Besides fetal alveolar fluid (FAF), gastrointestinal tract, umbilical cord and fetal side of placenta are important sources for AF. Bombesin-like peptides, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in fetal urine and leukotriene E(4), lecithin, sphingomyelin, lamellar body in FAF are molecules acting on fetal lung maturation. Varying levels of these molecules relevant to the stage of lung maturation may constitute an association to AF pHTo detect the possible effect of AF pH on neonatal respiratory morbidities 1 milliliters of AF is aspirated during C-section before incision of membranes. pH value of AFs were analyzed by the blood gas machine (Siemens RAPIDLabÂ®1200 Systems) of NICU. Maternal and neonatal demographic features and clinical outcomes, incidences of morbidities such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) are all recorded.</brief_summary>
