Study period-January 2016 to May 2017 Intervention- Subjects will be randomized into 3 groups Group A subjects will receive ω3 PUFA (Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids) (10% Omegavan 100 ml). Group B- will receive ω6 PUFA (Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids) (10% Intralipid 100 ml). Group C -Placebo group Monitoring and assessment- :- The following tests will be done in these patients:- 1. Complete clinical examination. 2. Serum electrolytes- sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate levels 3. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) 4. Serum free fatty acid levels 5. Lipid profile. 6. Arterial ammonia 7. Arterial lactate 8. Blood sugar and serum insulin levels</brief_summary>
