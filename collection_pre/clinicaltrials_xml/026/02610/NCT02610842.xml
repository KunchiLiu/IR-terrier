	<detailed_description>Introduction: Hands are commonly affected in Systemic sclerosis (SS). Skin thickening, Raynaud phenomenon, digital ulcers and cutaneous calcinosis may result in pain, disability and claw deformity. Strategies to improve hand function are recommended since its diagnosis and throughout the treatment. Unfortunately hand care assistance is not often available. The objective of this study was to developed a brief guide about hand care and home-based exercises to be applied in our outpatient clinic.
