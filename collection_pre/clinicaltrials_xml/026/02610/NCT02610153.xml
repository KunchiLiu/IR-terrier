	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study is to assess the predictive factors of poor control of international normalized ratio (INR) to determine the treatment strategies received by patients with a poor control of INR in real-life clinical practice and to explore the effectiveness and safety of these strategies in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who start vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment</brief_summary>
