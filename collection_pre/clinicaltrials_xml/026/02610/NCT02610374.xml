	<detailed_description>This is a randomized clinical trial. Fifty (50) Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive participants, 24 HIV negative controls matched for age and sex, and 24 HIV negative controls from a population at high risk for contracting HIV will be recruited into 3 cohorts. All participants will undergo a 4 week diet modification and will be randomly assigned to receive either an Agrarian diet or a Western-type diet. For the first 2 weeks, food will be provided to the participant, followed by an additional 2 weeks where participants will be provided a diet menu with recipes to prepare themselves. There will be 4 study visits and participation will last for up to 2 months.</detailed_description>
