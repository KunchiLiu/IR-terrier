	<brief_title>Liquid Biopsy in Monitoring the Therapeutic Efficacy of Targeted Therapy in Advanced/Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a single-center, prospective study undertaken in anticipated 100 patients with histologically confirmed HER2 positive advanced/metastatic gastric cancer. Peripheral blood samples of 12.5 mL were collected from the patients for cfDNA and CTCs analysis. The blood samples will be respectively drawn before therapy, at the time that the patients achieve the optimal response and when they suffer progressive disease. The enumeration of CTCs as well as the detection of HER2 expression will be achieved via the integrated subtraction enrichment (SET) and immunostaining-fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) platform. Further, for the geneomic analysis, the enriched single CTC will be isolated for single-cell targeted sequencing. While for cfDNA analysis, extracted DNA from plasma will be directly subjected to targeted sequencing. The correlation of the HER2 status on CTCs and the HER2 amplification in cfDNA to the therapeutic response will be evaluated. Moreover, gene variations associated with resistance in HER2-targeted therapy will be also studied based on the genomic data from sequencing of CTC and cfDNA.</detailed_description>
