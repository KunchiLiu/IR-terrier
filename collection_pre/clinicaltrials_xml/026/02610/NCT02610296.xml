	<brief_title>QPI-1002 for Prevention of Delayed Graft Function in Recipients of an Older Donor Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center trial stratified by donor age and by region to evaluate the reduction in incidence and severity of delayed graft function with kidney allografts from DBD donors who were at least 45 years of age.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Delayed Graft Function</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Has the ability to understand the requirements of the study, is able to provide written informed consent and is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the study protocol. Male or female at least 18 years of age. Has dialysis dependent renal failure initiated at least 2 months prior to transplantation. Is to be a recipient of a transplant from a deceased donor (brain death criteria) ≥ 45 years of age. Based on donor age, the following requirements for the risk of DGF (determined using the Irish DGF risk assessment nomogram) and cold ischemia time (CIT) must be met: Donor age 45 59 years: estimated DGF risk ≥ 20% and estimated CIT ≥ 10 hour Donor age ≥ 60 years: no minimum estimated DGF risk or minimum estimated CIT Is able to comply with the requirement of antibody induction therapy with rabbit polyclonal antithymocyte globulin or antiCD25 (antiIL2R) monoclonal antibodies per center standard of care. Must be uptodate on cancer screening according to sitespecific guidelines and past medical history must be negative for biopsyconfirmed malignancy within 5 years of randomization, with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma in situ or carcinoma of the cervix in situ. Recipient of a live donor kidney or a kidney from a donation after cardiac death (DCD) donor. Recipient of donor kidney preserved with normothermic machine perfusion. Scheduled to undergo multiorgan transplantation. Has a planned transplant of kidneys that are implanted en bloc (dual kidney transplant). Has planned transplant of dual kidneys (from the same donor) transplanted not en bloc. Has lost first kidney transplant due to graft thrombosis. Is scheduled for transplantation of a kidney from a donor who is known to have received an investigational therapy under another IND/CTA for ischemic/reperfusion injury immediately prior to organ recovery. Is scheduled to receive an ABOincompatible donor kidney. Has a positive T or Bcell crossmatch by NIH antiglobulin lymphocytotoxicity method or CDC crossmatch method, if performed. Has a positive T or Bcell flow crossmatch AND donor specific antiHLA antibody (DSA) detected by flow cytometry, Luminex® based antigenspecific antiHLA antibody testing, or by similar methodology, if performed. Has undergone desensitization to remove donor specific antiHLA antibodies prior to transplantation. Has participated in an investigational study within the last 30 days or received an investigational product within 5 halflives of the study drug administration, whichever is longest. Has known allergy to or has participated in a prior study with siRNA. Has a history of HBV (Note: subjects with a serological profile suggestive of clearance, or prior antiviral treatment of a prior HBV infection, may be enrolled with the approval of the Medical Monitor). Has a history of HIV. Recipient of a known HIV positive donor kidney. Is HCVpositive (detectable HCV RNA) (Note: Subjects at least 24 weeks from completion of treatment with an approved antiviral regimen and who remain free of HCV as determined by HCV RNA testing may be enrolled. Subjects who have been cleared of HCV virus after treatment with an unapproved regimen should be approved by the Medical Monitor).</criteria>
