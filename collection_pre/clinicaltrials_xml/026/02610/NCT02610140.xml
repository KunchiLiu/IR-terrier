	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the 15743 study is to assess efficacy and safety of anetumab ravtansine versus vinorelbine in progression free survival in patients with stage IV mesothelin overexpressing malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). 210 eligible patients will be randomized to receive either anetumab ravtansine every three weeks or weekly vinorelbine. Treatment will continue until centrally confirmed disease progression (PD) or until another criterion is met for withdrawal from the study. Patients will enter follow up phase to capture safety and endpoint data as required. Efficacy will be measured by evaluating progression free survival from randomization. Radiological tumor assessments will be performed at defined time points until the patient's disease progresses. Blood samples will be collected for safety, pharmacokinetic and biomarker analysis. Archival or fresh biopsy tissue may also be collected for central pathology review and biomarkers.</brief_summary>
