	<brief_summary>Spasticity is one of the most common disorders in patients with central nervous system diseases such as stroke. Transcranial direct current stimulation stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive tool that can be used to modulate cortical excitability of the leg motor area, and the spinal motor circuits as well. Objective:The objectives of this study is to examine the efficacy of anodal tDCS combined with Biodex balance training on lower limbs spasticity in chronic stroke patients using laboratory and clinical assessments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of tDCS Combined With Balance Training on Lower Limbs Spasticity in Chronic Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded clinical study, hemiplegic chronic stroke patients are randomized to receive active tDCS delivered to lesioned leg motor cortex (CZ) or sham combined with balance training with Biodex balance system. Experimental group receive tDCS stimulation (2mA) for 20 min, 5 sessions in five days paired with 20 min balance training.</detailed_description>
