	<brief_title>Online Yoga for Individuals With Mood Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yoga practitioners view yoga as a way to promote good physical and mental health, rather than as a treatment for poor health. This world view may be appealing to patients, especially those concerned with the stigma of conventional mental health treatment, or with the narrow focus on decreasing symptoms (instead of a broader focus on living to one's full potential) that defines much of conventional mental health treatment. Yoga classes are widely available and relatively inexpensive compared to other depression treatments. Yoga can be practiced at home with the aid of video recordings or books. We propose to examine the acceptability and feasibility of online yoga practice for individuals with depression, mania, or hypomania.</detailed_description>
