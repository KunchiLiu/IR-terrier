	<brief_title>Post-Marketing Non-Interventional Safety Evaluation of Obizur in the Treatment of Bleeding Episodes for Patients With Acquired Hemophilia A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multi-center, uncontrolled, open-label, non-interventional post-marketing safety surveillance study to describe the use of Obizur in patients with acquired hemophilia A (AHA), and secondarily, where data are available, to describe the hemostatic effectiveness and immunogenicity of Obizur. Patients should be enrolled at the earliest possible time point, but within ten days of initiating Obizur to ensure unbiased prospective observation. In addition, in an attempt to collect all safety and utilization data on patients treated with Obizur since Food and Drug Administration approval, Baxalta will conduct a retrospective chart review on persons treated with Obizur prior to the prospective study start date (Retrospective study participants may or may not also participate in the prospective portion of the study).</detailed_description>
