	<brief_title>Improvement of Cell Selection in Reproductive Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is the aim of this trial to use a new computerized selection method, in addition to the current and world-wide used scoring system of fertilized oocytes (zygotes) implemented by Scott in 1998, to determine whether this leads to an increase in pregnancy rates in women undergoing assisted reproductive techniques. If successful this could in the future lead to a reduction in the numbers of embryos required to achieve a pregnancy. Transferring only one embryo means minimizing the incidence of high order multiple pregnancies. Regularly couples gain several fertilized oocytes (zygotes) due to artificial reproductive techniques. As a routine, these cells are archived using pictures and videos for quality and safety reasons in different stages of development. Because it is planned to transfer only one or two developed embryos to the uterus, investigators have to select the zygotes with the highest potential for implantation and pregnancy. The remaining cells are preserved using vitrification. In the study, investigators use in addition to the established Zygote-score (Z-score) by Scott a new selection method for one group of patients: The quality of the zygotes of all patients is classified according to the described Scott system. Patients are randomized to two groups. Group 1 is the control group without any further intervention. If needed for selection, the quality of the zygotes of the patients of group 2 is additionally scored with a new method. The pictures of the cells, already taken for quality and safety reasons, are taken and the cells surface is analysed using a computer algorithm.</detailed_description>
