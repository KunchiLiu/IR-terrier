	<brief_summary>Fruits and vegetables are an important source of many different phytochemicals that may affect health and accurate dietary assessement tools to quantitate dietary intake are essential. This study will evaluate the correlation of dietary carotenoid intake estimated from two common and one novel food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with estimated carotenoid intake from 3 day diet records as well as measured blood and skin concentrations of carotenoids. This study will be conducted in healthy adults. These tools may be effective in estimating the level of these compounds in an average diet.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the relationship between estimated intakes of dietary carotenoids using three different FFQ's and comparing them with estimated carotenoid intake from 3 day diet records and blood and skin measurements. OUTLINE: Participants complete the Willett FFQ, the Fred Hutchinson FFQ, and the newly developed Clinton Carotenoid Assessment Tool (CCAT), in random order over a 3 to 4-month period of time with 4-6 weeks between each visit. Prior to each visit, participants also complete a 3-day diet record, a daily sun exposure diary, and a 3-day activity record. Blood samples are collected for plasma carotenoid assessment and and skin carotenoid content is assessed using a resonance Raman spectroscopy.</detailed_description>
