	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AGS67E given at two dosing schedules (every three weeks or weekly), in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determine a safe dose for future development. In addition, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), the immunogenicity, and the antitumor activity of AGS67E.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Escalating Doses of AGS67E Given as Monotherapy in Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will sequentially evaluate AGS67E given as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion in two different schedules: once every 3 weeks (Q3) and then once weekly for 3 weeks. The dose escalation follows a 3 + 3 design. The Data Review Team may expand any dose level or intermediate dose level that has been deemed safe and resulted in at least one subject with a Composite Complete Remission (CRc). An expansion cohort may enroll up to 15 subjects.</detailed_description>
