	<brief_summary>This research trial studies whole exome sequencing in finding causative variants in germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from patients with peripheral neuropathy receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. Studying samples of germline DNA in the laboratory from patients with peripheral neuropathy receiving paclitaxel for breast cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to peripheral neuropathy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify, using next generation sequencing, rare variants of large effect size that impact the risk of peripheral neuropathy in patients of African and European descent in the clinical trial ECOG-5103 (E5103). OUTLINE: Previously collected germline DNA samples are analyzed via whole exome sequencing.</detailed_description>
