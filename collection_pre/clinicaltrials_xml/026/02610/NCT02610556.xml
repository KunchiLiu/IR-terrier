	<brief_title>Concurrent Docetaxel Plus Cisplatin or Cisplatin Alone With IMRT in High Risk Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent chemotherapy of docetaxel plus cisplatin or cisplatin alone. IMRT is delivered with a total dose of 68 Gy or higher in 33 fractions to the primary tumor. Concurrent chemotherapy in the experimental arm consists of docetaxel 60 mg/m², D1 and cisplatin 25 mg/m², D1-3 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Concurrent chemotherapy in the control arm consists of cisplatin 100 mg/m², D1 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization to the day of death from any cause. Secondary end points include failure-free survival (FFS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and the incidence of grade 3 or higher acute toxicities. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly histologically confirmed nonkeratinizing (WHO 1991) nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Tumor staged as T1N3M0, T23N23M0 or T4N03M0 (the 2010 UICC/AJCC staging system). Pretreatment EBV DNA ≥ 1500 copies/mL. Karnofsky scale (KPS) ≥ 70. Adequate marrow: leucocyte count ≥ 4×10E9/L, hemoglobin ≥ 110g/L and platelet count ≥ 100×10E9/L. Normal liver function test: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin ≤ 1.5×upper limit of normal (ULN) concomitant with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2.5×ULN. Adequate renal function: creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min or creatinine ≤ 1.5×ULN. Patients must give written informed consent. Prior malignancy, except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer. Pregnancy or lactation (consider pregnancy test in women of childbearing age and emphasize effective contraception during the treatment period). History of previous radiotherapy (except for nonmelanomatous skin cancers outside intended radiotherapy volume). Prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery (except diagnostic) to primary tumor or nodes. Any severe intercurrent disease, which may bring unacceptable risk or affect the compliance of the trial, for example, unstable cardiac disease requiring treatment, renal disease, chronic hepatitis, diabetes with poor control (fasting plasma glucose &gt; 1.5×ULN), and emotional disturbance.</criteria>
