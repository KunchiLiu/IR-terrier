	<brief_summary>Arthritis in children is a long-term illness and it can make a child's life very difficult. In children 8-11 years old, the child and their family work together to deal with the problems that arthritis can cause. Learning to cope with and manage the problems that come with arthritis can stop it from getting worse. It is important to create programs that teach children and families how to cope with and manage arthritis. This study will develop and test an online game that helps children learn how to better manage their arthritis. The goal of these studies is to test: (1) how easy to use and acceptable the online game is; and (2) if children who play the game feel less pain, have fewer limitations, and a better quality of life compared to children who do not play the game.</brief_summary>
