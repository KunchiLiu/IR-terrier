	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Versus Single-Agent Azacitidine in Participants With Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (HR MDS), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) and Low-Blast Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to treat people with myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and low-blast acute myelogenous leukemia as a combination treatment with azacitidine. This study will look at the overall survival, event free survival and response to treatment in people who take pevonedistat and azacitidine when compared to people who take single-agent azacitidine. The study will enroll approximately 117 participants. Once enrolled, participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in 28-day treatment cycles: - Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 and azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination - Single-agent azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 All participants will receive azacitidine via intravenous or subcutaneous route. Participants randomized to the combination arm will also receive pevonedistat intravenous infusion. This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 69 months. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy if that occurs sooner. Participants will enter event-free survival follow-up (study visits every 3 months) if their disease has not transformed to AML (for participants with HR MDS or CMML) or progressed (for participants with low-blast AML), and they have not started subsequent therapy. Participants will also enter overall survival follow-up (contacted every 3 months to document subsequent therapies and survival status).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female participants 18 years or older. 2. Morphologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS or nonproliferative CMML (that is, with white blood cells [WBC] &lt;20,000 per microliter [/mcL]) or lowblast AML based on 1 of the following: FrenchAmericanBritish (FAB) Classifications: Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) defined as having 5% to 20% myeloblasts in the bone marrow. CMML with 10% to 19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or 5% to 19% blasts in the blood. OR Worl health organisation (WHO) Classifications: RAEB1 defined as having 5% to 9% myeloblasts in the bone marrow. RAEB2 defined as having 10% to 19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or 5% to 19% blasts in the blood. CMML2 defined as having 10% to 19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or 5% to 19% blasts in the blood. CMML1 (Although CMML1 is defined as having &lt;10% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or &lt;5% blasts in the blood, these participants may enroll only if bone marrow blasts &gt;=5%. WHOdefined AML with 20%30% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and &lt;30% myeloblasts in peripheral blood who are deemed by the investigator to be appropriate for azacitidinebased therapy. 3. For MDS and CMML participants, prognostic risk category, based on the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSSR), of: Very high (&gt;6 points), High (&gt;4.5 6 points), or Intermediate (&gt;3 4.5 points): a participant determined to be in the Intermediate Prognostic Risk Category is only allowable in the setting of &gt;=5% bone marrow myeloblasts. 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2. 5. Clinical laboratory values within the following parameters (repeat within 3 days before the first dose of study drug if laboratory values used for randomization were obtained more than 3 days before the first dose of study drug): Albumin &gt;2.7 g/dL. Total bilirubin &lt;upper limit of normal (ULN) except in participants with Gilbert's syndrome. Participants with Gilbert's syndrome may enroll if direct bilirubin &lt;=1.5*ULN of the direct bilirubin. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;2.5*ULN. Creatinine clearance &gt;=50 milliliter per minutes (mL/min). Hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dL. Participants may be transfused to achieve this value. Elevated indirect bilirubin due to posttransfusion hemolysis is allowed. 6. For CMML participants: WBC count &lt;20,000/mcL before administration of the first dose of study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1; participants must have been off hydroxyurea for at least 1 week prior to WBC count assessment. 7. Ability to undergo the studyrequired bone marrow sample collection procedures. 8. Suitable venous access for the studyrequired blood sampling (that is, including pharmacokinetic (PK) and biomarker sampling). 9. Female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the Screening visit , or Are surgically sterile, or If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together). Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (that is, status postvasectomy), who: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together). 10. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 1.
