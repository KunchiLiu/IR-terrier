	<brief_summary>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial with factorial study design comparing the impact of reactive community-based malaria interventions: 1) presumptive treatment (or TPE, targeted parasite elimination) versus reactive case detection (RACD), and 2) reactive IRS (indoor residual spraying) versus control on the incidence of malaria in Namibia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Targeted Parasite Elimination (TPE) in Namibia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent years, many countries, including Namibia, have experienced reductions in malaria transmission in association with the scale-up of effective interventions and are now moving towards malaria elimination. In malaria control, the goal is to reduce the clinical burden of malaria. In malaria elimination, the aim is to interrupt transmission, and it becomes necessary to address not only symptomatic malaria, but also asymptomatic infections that contribute to transmission. Since malaria transmission is highly geographically heterogeneous, elimination activities should target hot spots, or areas where the risk of future infection is highest. Hence, in the transition from control to elimination, enhanced surveillance and response is necessary to target hot spots with interventions to interrupt transmission. Reactive case detection (RACD), active surveillance in communities around passively detected cases, is a recommended elimination strategy to identify secondary cases and hot spots. However, RACD can be labour-, time-, and cost- intensive, and misses people who are absent during screening or refuse to have their blood drawn. Furthermore, both microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) utilized in RACD have shortcomings, for instance, the suboptimal sensitivity of RDTs for low parasite density and non-falciparum infections. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers markedly improved sensitivity over RDTs but requires hours of processing time, sophisticated technical skills, and expensive equipment. Given these limitations, presumptive treatment may be a more feasible and effective strategy to reduce and interrupt transmission. Targeted Parasite Elimination (TPE), a form of presumptive treatment, has been used successfully in China to overcome some of the weaknesses of RACD. TPE is the coordinated use of vector and parasite control, targeted at the people at highest risk for malaria. In a low transmission setting such as Namibia, only a small proportion of the populations is at high risk of infection, therefore, only a small number of people need to be targeted (perhaps 20-50 people). TPE targets remaining reservoirs of infection in low endemic settings. A TPE approach can include locally implemented presumptive treatment --where people are treated based on their proximity to a malaria case rather than on a test result. TPE is a promising strategy, but evidence does not yet exist to prove its efficacy in Africa. Questions remain about where to target TPE, what drugs to use, and whether drugs should be used alone or in combination with additional vector control. For TPE to be most successful it is necessary to kill parasites in the human as well as the vector population of the target area. However, one challenge of pre-transmission season IRS is that it is difficult to predict where future infections will occur. A reactive approach, in conjunction with the pre-transmission approach, will ensure coverage of effective vector control in the highest risk areas. Further, if there is unknown resistance to the insecticide used during pre-transmission season, the subsequent reactive use of a different, and presumably effective insecticide, will provide better protection. In this study the investigators will utilise a cluster randomized controlled study design to evaluate TPE in response to a passively identified index case and compare it to RACD. The investigators will study each intervention (TPE, RACD) both with and without additional focal insecticide spraying.</detailed_description>

Yet during the actual conduct of this trial we will utilize 5 kg weight as the cutoff, rather than using age. A lower weight cutoff of 5 kg is in accordance with AL's manufacturer (Novartis)'s guidance on supporting pediatric data. 5.
