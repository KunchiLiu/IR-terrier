	<brief_summary>A suitable concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in relation to omega 6 is considered necessary for a good cell function and prevention of various inflammatory processes. Diet and supplementation are the fundamental procedures to achieve the reference values for several years. Athletes are individuals under physical stress and higher tissue restoration, while maintaining adequate diets they show, as the rest of humans, lower than desired levels. In the present study the investigators aims to determine the modification of those levels by the administration of two different doses of a given product, keeping the same model of diet and physical and competition.</brief_summary>
