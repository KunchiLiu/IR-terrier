	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes following a single injection of nSTRIDE Autologous Protein Solution in females with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis. A secondary objective of this study is to document the duration of treatment effect following nSTRIDE injection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>nSTRIDE APS in Females With Primary Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trials have, in general, formally demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of various autologous therapies for the treatment of knee OA. Differences in the processing of autologous therapies can yield substantial differences in the resulting output. Thus, making generalizations regarding the effectiveness across these autologous therapies is more complicated. Each autologous therapy requires independent efficacy evaluation. nSTRIDE APS has been shown to decrease pain, increase function and have a favorable safety profile in a pilot trial. Further, demonstration of the treatment effects in patellofemoral osteoarthritis, an important subset of knee osteoarthritis is lacking. This study will evaluate a population of female patients with patellofemoral osteoarthritis in which treatment with other modalities provides limited/short lived relief with the hope that APS treatment will provide and extend relief to these patients. The study will document the treatment effects and timeline of treatment effects for nSTRIDE APS following a single injection (per symptomatic knee).</detailed_description>
