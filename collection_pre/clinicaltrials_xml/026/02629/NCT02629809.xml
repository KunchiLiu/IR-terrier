	<brief_title>First-line Therapy With Ibrutinib, Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, and Obinutuzumab (GA-101) (iFCG) for Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 4 weeks (28 days). If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drug combination on the following schedule during Cycles 1-3: You will receive obinutuzumab by vein over 4-6 hours on the following days: - on Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 - on Day 1 of Cycles 2-3 You will receive fludarabine by vein over 15 minutes on the following days: - on Days 2-4 of Cycle 1 - on Days 1-3 of Cycles 2-3 You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 30 minutes on the following days: - on Days 2-4 of Cycle 1 - on Days 1-3 of Cycles 2-3 You will also take ibrutinib by mouth with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water every day during Cycles 1-3. You should swallow the capsules whole. Do not break, crush, chew, or dissolve the capsules. If you miss a dose, you can take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day and return to your normal dosing time the next day. Do not take extra ibrutinib to make up for a missed dose. If you are unable to complete 3 cycles treatment with obinutuzumab, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and ibrutinib, you will be able to receive just obinutuzumab and ibrutinib. You will also receive the following drugs to lower the risk of side effects: - You will take allopurinol by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-7 of Cycle 1. - You will take valacyclovir by mouth every day while you are taking ibrutinib and for at least 3 months after your last dose. You will also be given other standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. You will continue taking the study drugs after Cycle 3 on a schedule that is based on the status of the disease: - If at the end of Cycle 3 the results of a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate show the disease has responded completely, you will receive obinutuzumab and ibrutinib on the same schedule described above during Cycles 4-6. If at the end of Cycle 6 there is still no evidence of disease, you will take ibrutinib alone for Cycles 7-12. If at the end of Cycle 6 there is evidence of the disease, you will receive both obinutuzumab and ibrutinib for Cycles 7-12. If at the end of Cycle 12 the disease appears to have responded completely, you will receive no further treatment. If at the end of Cycle 12 there is still evidence of disease, you will receive ibrutinib alone for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. - If at the end of Cycle 3 the results of a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate show evidence of the disease, you will receive obinutuzumab and ibrutinib on the same schedule described above during Cycles 4-12. If at the end of Cycle 12 there is still evidence of the disease, you will receive ibrutinib alone for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If at the end of Cycle 12 the disease appears to have responded completely, you will receive no further treatment. Study Visits: One (1) time each week during Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You may have additional blood draws during Cycle 1 if the doctor thinks it is needed. During Cycle 2: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least every 2 weeks. During Cycle 3: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests every 2 weeks. - You will have an EKG to check your heart function. - You will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to check the status of the disease. - You will have a CT or PET scan with contrast of the neck (if needed), chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease. During Cycles 4-12: - You will have a physical exam 1 time each cycle. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least 1 time every cycle. - You will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to check the status of the disease every 3 cycles. - You will have a CT or PET scan with contrast of the neck (if needed), chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 3 cycles. During Cycles 13 and beyond (as long as you continue taking ibrutinib): - You will have a physical exam every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months after that. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months after that. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to check the status of the disease every 6 months. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT or PET scan with contrast of the neck (if needed), chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 months. Physical exams and blood draws may be done more often if the doctor thinks it is needed. Length of Treatment: You may continue receiving ibrutinib for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. No additional follow-up is required after your last dose of study drug beyond your normal study visits. This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and obinutuzumab are all FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with CLL. The use of these drugs in combination is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the drugs are designed to work. Up to 45 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

If patients have another malignancy that was treated within the last 2 years, such patients can be enrolled, after consultation with the Principal Investigator, if the likelihood of requiring systemic therapy for this other malignancy within 2 years is less than 10%, as determined by an expert in that particular malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center. 8.
