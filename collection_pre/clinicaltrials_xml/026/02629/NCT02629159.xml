	<criteria>Adult male or female, at least 18 years old. Diagnosis of RA for greater than or equal to 3 months. Subjects must have been on oral or parenteral methotrexate (MTX) therapy greater than or equal to 3 months and on a stable prescription of greater than or equal to 15 to 25 mg/week (or greater than or equal to 10 mg/week in subjects intolerant of MTX at doses greater than or equal to 15 mg/week) for greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. In addition all subjects should take a dietary supplement of folic acid or folinic acid throughout the study participation. Meets the following minimum disease activity criteria: greater than or equal to 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and greater than or equal to 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits. At least one of the following at Screening: greater than or equal to 3 bone erosions on xray OR greater than or equal to 1 bone erosion and a positive rheumatoid factor OR greater than or equal to 1 bone erosion and a positive anticyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies. Subjects with prior exposure to only one Biological diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD) (except ADA) may be enrolled (up to 20% of total study population) if they have documented evidence of intolerance to the bDMARD or limited exposure (less than 3 months), but required washout periods need to be satisfied. Except for MTX, subject must have discontinued all conventional synthetic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). Prior exposure to any Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (including but not limited to tofacitinib, baricitinib, and filgotinib). Subjects who have been exposed to adalimumab or who are considered inadequate responders to bDMARD therapy as determined by the Investigator. History of inflammatory joint disease other than RA. History of secondary Sjogren's Syndrome is permitted.</criteria>
