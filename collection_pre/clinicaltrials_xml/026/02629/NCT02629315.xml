	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the number of lymph nodes dissected in rectal cancer specimens following fixation with 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde or Carnoy's solution. Half of the specimens with be fixed in each solution.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carnoy`s Solution Versus Formalin in Rectal Cancer Specimens Following Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation: a Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carnoy's solution is a tissue fixative who has alcohol allowing for fat clearing along with tissue fixation. Previous studies demonstrated this ability and the investigators introduced this for patients with rectal cancer who has undergone preoperative chemoradiaton. This subgroup of patients have a very low lymph node yield.</detailed_description>
