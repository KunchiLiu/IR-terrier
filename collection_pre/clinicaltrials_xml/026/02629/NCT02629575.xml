	<brief_summary>Postmarket surveillance in terms of the safety and efficacy of Sirolimus-eluting Coroflex ISAR Stent for the treatment of "real world" patients with de-novo and restenotic lesions after stand-alone angioplasty in coronary arteries</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coroflex ISAR 2000 Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of elective deployment of the Sirolimus-eluting Coroflex ISAR Stent for the treatment of "real world" de-novo and restenotic lesions after stand-alone angioplasty in coronary arteries of 2.0 mm up to 4.0 mm in diameter and up to 30 mm in length for procedural success and preservation of vessel patency.</detailed_description>
