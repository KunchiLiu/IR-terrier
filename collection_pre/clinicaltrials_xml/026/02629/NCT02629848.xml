	<brief_title>Study of Motesanib (AMG 706) in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for Advanced Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called motesanib. Motesanib is being tested in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin to treat people who have Stage IV or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study will look at progression free survival, overall survival, overall response and safety. The study enrolled 401 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which remained undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Motesanib 125 mg + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin All participants were asked to take 5 X 25 mg motesanib tablets or placebo at the same time each day throughout the study. All participants received treatment with paclitaxel 200 mg/m^2 intravenous (IV) and carboplatin IV on Day 1 of each 3 week Cycle for up to 6 Cycles. After 6 Cycles participants could continue to receive motesanib or placebo alone for up to 36 months. This multi-centre trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study was up to 36 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Urinary protein quantitative value of ≤ 30 mg in urinalysis or ≤ 1+ on dipstick unless total quantitative protein was &lt; 500 mg in a 24hour urine sample. 3. Hepatic function, as follows: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or AST &lt; 5 x ULN if liver metastases were present. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN or ALT &lt; 5 x ULN if liver metastases were present. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2.0 x ULN or ALP &lt; 5 x ULN if liver or bone metastases were present. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN. 4. Coagulation function, as follows: Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1 x ULN. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 x ULN. Ethical: Ability to give written informed consent. General: 1. Able to take oral medications. 2. Able to start protocoldirected therapy within 7 days from the date of randomization. Disease Related: 1. Symptomatic central nervous system metastases. Participants with asymptomatic brain metastases were eligible if definitive therapy had been administered (surgery and/or radiation therapy), there was no planned treatment for brain metastasis, and the participant was clinically stable and off corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization. Participants with asymptomatic brain metastases were also eligible if the participant did not need definitive therapy (surgery and/or radiation therapy) or corticosteroids according to the Investigator's judgement. 2. Palliative radiation therapy: Radiation therapy within 28 days prior to randomization for central (chest). Radiation therapy within 14 days prior to randomization for distant metastatic foci. 3. History of pulmonary hemorrhage or gross hemoptysis (approximately 3 mL of bright red blood or more) within 6 months prior to randomization. Medications: 1. Prior targeted therapies, including but not limited to: • AMG 706, inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (eg, SU5416, SU6668, ZD6474, SU11248, PTK787, AZD2171, AEE788, sorafenib, bevacizumab), or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (eg, panitumumab, cetuximab, gefitinib, erlotinib). 2.
