	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Sensory Stimulation for Person in a Coma or Persistent Vegetative State After Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for approximately 50,000 deaths in the United States each year. About 17% of survivors have a period of "coma". Duration of coma contributes significantly to functional outcomes. Objective: To appraise the evidence of effectiveness of sensory stimulation to improve arousal and alertness for persons in a coma or persistent vegetative state after TBI. Data Sources and Study Eligibility Criteria: Databases searched included Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, OTseeker, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search was limited to outcomes studies in the hierarchy described by Sackett and colleagues (1996), published in English in peer-reviewed journals between 2006 and 2014.</detailed_description>
