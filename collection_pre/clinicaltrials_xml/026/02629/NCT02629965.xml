	<brief_summary>This is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded, active-controlled, 2-way cross over trial to assess the effects of once daily administration of orally inhaled tiotropium + olodaterol FDC or tiotropium (both delivered by the RESPIMAT Inhaler) on pulmonary function (lung hyperinflation), exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance) and physical activities after 6 weeks of treatment in Japanese patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: All patients must sign an informed consent consistent with ICHGCP guidelines prior to participation in the trial, which includes medication washout and restrictions. All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and must meet the following spirometric criteria: Patients must have relatively stable airway obstruction with a postbronchodilator Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &lt; 80% of predicted normal and postbronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 70% at Visit 1. Male or female patients, aged &gt;= 40 years. Patients must be current or exsmokers with a smoking history of more than 10 pack years. Patients who have never smoked cigarettes must be excluded. Patients with score on the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) &gt;= 1. Patients who walk &lt; 400 meters of 6MWT and have a score on the modified Borg &gt;= 4 at the end of 6 minute walk test (6MWT) at Visit 2. Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests (spirometry), to use the physical activity monitor and must be able to complete 6MWT during the study period as required in the protocol. Patients must be able to inhale medication in a competent manner from the RESPIMAT Inhaler and from a metered dose inhaler. Exclusion criteria: Patients with a significant disease other than COPD; a significant disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may put the patient at risk because of participation in the study, influence the results of the study and cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate in the study. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry,urinalysis or creatinine &gt; x2 ULN will be excluded regardless of clinical condition (a repeat laboratory evaluation can be conducted if deemed necessary by the investigator). Patients with a current documented diagnosis of asthma. For patients with allergic rhinitis or atopy, source documentation is required to verify that the patient does not have asthma. Further exclusion criteria apply</criteria>
