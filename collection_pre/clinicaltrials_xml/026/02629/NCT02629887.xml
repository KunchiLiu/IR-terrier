	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized controlled trial to be performed at one center, of term and late preterm infants requiring resuscitation. Prenatal consent will be obtained. At randomization, babies will be resuscitated following Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines and ventilated using the T-piece resuscitator with either a Face Mask (FM) or Non-inflating supraglottic airway. Video will be collected during resuscitation as well as written documentation. Primary outcome will be time to spontaneous breathing, length of resuscitation, and need for endotracheal intubation.</brief_summary>
