	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at identifying the efficacy of Tachosil® for prevention of hemorrhage in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer after undergoing a loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP). 1. Primary endpoint: Bleeding period within two weeks after surgery Frequency of additional treatment due to bleeding within two weeks after surgery 2. Secondary endpoint: Amount of bleeding within two weeks after surgery Infection frequency at external genitals, vagina and cervix within two weeks after surgery, Change in life quality after surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>the Efficacy of Tachosil® for Prevention of Hemorrhage After Loop Electrosurgical Excisional Procedure (LEEP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A loop electrosurgical excisional procedure(LEEP) is a medical technology which is very commonly used in order to treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer stage FIGO IA1, as well as diagnose the disease. Though a loop electrosurgical excisional procedure of cervix is an effective and safe procedure, it may cause discomfort due to bleeding after surgery, and there are many cases in which additional treatment shall be implemented in order to control hemorrhage. Up to now, a number of investigators have made efforts to reduce frequency of bleeding and additional hemostasis treatment after loop electrosurgical excisional procedure of cervix. Among the methods that have been studied so far, there are methods in which albothyl solution, Monsel's solution, Tranexamic acid, Amino-Cerve, or Fibrin glue are applied to the surgical margin of cervix, of which the bleeding has been stopped by using the electrocautery method. However, none of them has been recognized to be effective in reducing the frequency of bleeding and additional hemostasis treatment after loop electrosurgical excisional procedure of cervix. Accordingly, it is required to carry out researches to find new methods. Tachosil, as an absorbable hemostatic surgical patch, is composed of collagen matrix on which coagulation factor, human fibirinogen and human thrombin are coated. It has been proved that Tachosil is an effective and safe styptic in a digestive, hapatobiliary, pulmonary, renal surgery. Unlike the existing styptic, the surgical patch Tachosil has strong adhesion to bleeding points, plugging up bleeding holes, so that it is expected to have a great effect on prevention of bleeding on surgical margin of cervix after loop electrosurgical excisional procedure of cervix. This study is aimed at evaluating if the application of Tachosil is effective for prevention of bleeding after a loop electrosurgical excisional procedure of cervix.</detailed_description>
