	<brief_title>Afatinib in Lung Cancer With EGFR Mutation From Circulating Tumor DNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obtaining Tumor tissue or cytology samples are not always available in some patients with lung cancer. Recently, studies showed that circulating tumor DNA can be used as a suitable substitute for mutation analysis. The sensitivity of EGFR mutation tests using circulating tumor DNA was reported in the range of 65.7% (10) to 75% (11), with high specificity and positive predictive value. In this trial, treatment efficacy of afatinib will be assessed in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations which were detected from circulating tumor DNA.</detailed_description>
