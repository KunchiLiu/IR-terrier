	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine therapy or sargramostim works in treating patients with breast cancer. Vaccines made from peptide or antigen and/or a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express breast cancer. It is not yet known whether nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine or sargramostim is more effective in treating patients with breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nelipepimut-S Plus GM-CSF Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate for nelipepimut-S-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL; cluster of differentiation [CD]8+ T cell) response in vaccinated patients compared to patients receiving GM-CSF (sargramostim) alone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Toxicity profile and frequency of adverse events in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast receiving nelipepimut-S vaccine (nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine) as compared to women receiving GM-CSF alone. II. In vivo immune response to nelipepimut-S determined by delayed type hypersensitivity reaction; III. Immune response to other tumor antigens (epitope spreading). IV. Functional capacity of the immune response to vaccination. V. Determine CTL functional capability using intracellular cytokine assays. VI. Evaluate polyfunctional cytokine responses assessed by multiplex assay. VII. Presence of DCIS at resection. VIII. Difference in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression in the biopsy and the surgical specimen excised post-vaccination. IX. Histologic responses: degree of lymphocyte infiltration determined on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained slides and by immunohistochemistry staining for CD3, CD4 and CD8. X. Histologic responses: proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki67) in DCIS cells (proliferation). XI. Histologic responses: cleaved caspase 3 in DCIS cells (apoptosis). XII. Immune infiltrates in normal tissue maximally distant from the tumor (in mastectomy samples). OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine intradermally (ID) 3 vaccination 2 weeks apart prior to surgery. ARM II: Patients receive sargramostim ID 3 vaccinations 2 weeks apart prior to surgery, and 3 vaccinations 1 months apart post-surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months.</detailed_description>
