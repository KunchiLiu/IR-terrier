	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Triferic (Ferric Pyrophosphate Citrate) Administered Intravenously to Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label, three-period sequential dosing study being conducted primarily to determine the pharmacokinetics of Triferic iron administered intravenously to healthy adults.. Participation will be up to 5 weeks total duration including Screening, Baseline, Treatment Period, and Follow-up. Following Screening, subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1, prior to Baseline (Day 1). During the Treatment Period, subjects will receive two doses of Triferic. Each subject will receive a single 6-mg dose of Triferic administered IV over 3 hours (hr) on one day (Day 2), and a single 35-µg/kg dose of Triferic administered IV push the following day (Day 3). On Day 4, subjects will be discharged from the clinic and will return approximately one week later for their final Follow-up visit.</detailed_description>

The subject must have a body mass index (BMI) of ≤32.0 kg/m2 at Screening and weigh &gt;60.0 kg. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in the study if any of the following criteria apply: 1. The subject has a hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration &lt;13.0 g/dL for men or &lt;12 g/dL for women during Screening. 2. The subject has a total iron binding capacity (TIBC) &lt;250 µg/dL during Screening. 3. The subject has had administration of IV or oral iron supplements (including multivitamins with iron) within 14 days prior to Baseline. 4. Subject has concurrent or recurrent disease (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, malignant, etc.) that could affect the action or disposition of the investigational product utilized in this study, or could affect clinical or laboratory assessments. 5. Subject has a Creactive protein level (CRP) &gt;5 mg/L during Screening, or any rheumatic or autoimmune disease that requires systemic antiinflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy. 6. Subject has an acute illness within 14 days prior to Baseline. 7. Subject has known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to ironcontaining products. 8. Subject has a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the past year. 9. Subject has a positive screen for cotinine or drugs of abuse. 10. Subject is positive for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. 11. Subject uses tobacco in any form (e.g., smoking or chewing) or other nicotinecontaining products in any form (e.g., gum, patch, etc.). Exusers must report that they have stopped using tobacco for at least 30 days prior to Baseline. 12. Subject donated blood or blood products (e.g., plasma or platelets) within 60 days prior to Baseline. 13. Subject participated in an investigational drug study within 30 days prior to Baseline. 14. Subject is pregnant or intends to become pregnant before completing the study. 15. Subject's current medical status, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude participation in the study.</criteria>
