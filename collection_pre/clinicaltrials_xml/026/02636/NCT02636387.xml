	<brief_summary>This study assesses if using the medication desmopressin will decrease nightime bedwetting in children with sickle cell disease. Half of the children will receive placebo and half of the children will receive desmopressin, with the option to prescribe desmopressin as soon as the study is completed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Desmopressin as a Therapy for Bedwetting in Children With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Night time bedwetting is a common complication of sickle cell disease, and affects up to 30 % of children . Desmopressin is an oral medication that increases water reabsorption in the kidneys. Studies have shown that it is effective in decreasing bedwetting episodes in children without sickle cell disease. Chronic sickling episodes causing damage to the kidneys could cause permanent damage and may make this treatment ineffective in sickle cell disease. The investigators designed this trial to definitively answer this question by randomizing the patients to give half of the children placebo and the other half titrated doses of desmopressin. This trial will inform pediatric sickle cell doctors if desmopressin is an appropriate treatment for bed wetting in the investigators patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with Hemoglobin SS, SC, SB0thal or SB+thal 2. Patients with at least two episodes of primary nocturnal enuresis per week or four episodes over the two weeks prior to enrollment. 3. Patients with secondary enuresis who have been evaluated and cleared by a pediatric urologist as not having other etiologies of enuresis (e.g. overactive detrusor activity, a genitourinary anatomic abnormality) 1. Patients with developmental delay or neurologic dysfunction secondary to stroke. 2. Patients with hypertension or underlying renal disease. 3. Patients with genitourinary anatomic abnormalities. Any prior renal ultrasound showing normal genitourinary anatomy is sufficient to clear a patient for the study. 4. Patients with daytime urinary incontinence 5. Patients with glucosuria on urinalysis. 6. Patients with secondary nocturnal enuresis who have not been evaluated by a pediatric urologist to rule out other etiologies of enuresis. 7. Patients who are pregnant. 8. Patients receiving another medicine for nocturnal enuresis (e.g. imipramine).</criteria>
