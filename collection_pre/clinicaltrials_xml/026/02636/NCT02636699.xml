	<criteria>Main 1. Male or female children aged 4 through 11 years; 2. Physiciandiagnosis of peanut allergy or children with a well documented medical history of IgEmediated symptoms after ingestion of peanut and currently following a strict peanutfree diet, but without a physician diagnosis; 3. Peanutspecific IgE level (ImmunoCAP system) &gt;0.7 kU/L; 4. Positive peanut skin prick test (SPT) with a largest wheal diameter: ≥6 mm for children 4 through 5 years of age at Visit 1, ≥8 mm for children 6 years and above at Visit 1; 5. Positive DBPCFC at ≤300 mg peanut protein. Main 1. History of severe anaphylaxis to peanut with any of the following symptoms: hypotension, hypoxia, neurological compromise (collapse, loss of consciousness or incontinence); 2. Generalized dermatologic disease 3. Diagnosis of mast cell disorders, including mastocytosis or uricaria pigmentosa as well as hereditary or idiopathic angioedema; 4. Diagnosis of asthma that fulfills any of the following criteria: Uncontrolled persistent asthma as defined by National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Asthma guidelines 2007 or by Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines 2015, Asthma treated with either a high daily high dose of inhaled corticosteroid or with a combination therapy of a medium or high daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid with a long acting inhaled β2 agonist or with a combination therapy of a high daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid with a long acting inhaled β2 agonist. Asthmatic subjects treated with a medium daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids are eligible. Intermittent asthmatic subjects who require intermittent use of inhaled corticosteroids for rescue are also eligible, Two or more systemic corticosteroid courses for asthma in the past year or 1 oral corticosteroid course for asthma within 3 months prior to Visit 1, or during screening period, Prior intubation/mechanical ventilation for asthma within 1 year prior to Visit 1, or during screening; 5. Receiving βblocking agents, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensinreceptor blockers, calcium channel blockers or tricyclic antidepressant therapy; 6. Received antitumor necrosis factor drugs or antiIgE drugs (such as omalizumab) or any biologic immunomodulatory therapy within 1 year prior to Visit 1, during screening period or during study participation; 7. Use of systemic longacting corticosteroids within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or use of systemic shortacting corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during screening; 8. Prior or concomitant history of any immunotherapy to any food; 9. Receiving or planning to receive any aeroallergen immunotherapy during their participation in the study. Aeroallergen immunotherapy must be discontinued at the time of Visit 1; 10. Any disorder in which epinephrine is contraindicated such as coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or serious ventricular arrhythmias.</criteria>
