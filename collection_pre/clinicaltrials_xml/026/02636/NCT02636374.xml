	<brief_title>Guided Imagery: Reducing Stress and Improving Well-being in Pregnant Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnant adolescents attending a local alternative education program will be subjects of this study. Students will participate in four, 15 minute guided imagery sessions over about a 4-6 week period. They will complete a pregnancy specific stress questionnaire before beginning and after completion of the guided imagery protocol. The students will also complete a short 9-question stress measure before and after each of the individual guided imagery sessions. The specific aims are: 1. to evaluate whether a guided imagery intervention reduces perceived stress in pregnant adolescents; and 2. to evaluate whether a guided imagery intervention enhances well-being in pregnant adolescents. The hypotheses are that the intervention will reduce perceived stress and enhance well-being in these subjects. The purpose of this study is to assess whether employing a guided imagery intervention with pregnant teens and education will reduce perceived stress levels and improve well-being.</detailed_description>
