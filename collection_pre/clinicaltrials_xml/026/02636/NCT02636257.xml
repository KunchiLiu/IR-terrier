	<brief_title>A Comparative Study of Two Endoscopic Operations for Lacrimal Duct Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lacrimal duct obstruction is common among patients with epiphora,which is seriously affect the quality of life. The treatment principle is to restore or rebuild the lacrimal duct drainage channel. The classic operation type is dacryocystorhinostomy(DCR), which is complex for face-section particularly. However, with the development of endoscopy, the investigators prefer to the silicone nasolacrimal intubation under nasal endoscopy, which is more simple and efficient. With endoscopy, the investigators can see anatomical structures clearly and then can perform the operation much more perfectly.Compare to the classic one called DCR, its short and long term therapeutic effects are equal and even better.Therefore,the latter type does do good to both doctors and patients.</detailed_description>
