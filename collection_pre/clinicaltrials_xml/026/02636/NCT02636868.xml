	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant for inhalation administered as an aerosolized dose in two doses to preterm neonates 26 - 32 weeks gestational age who are receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) for Resipiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) compared to neonates receiving nCPAP alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Signed ICF from legally authorized representative 2. 26 0/7 to 32 6/7 completed weeks gestation PMA 3. Successful implementation of noninvasive support or ventilation within 90 minutes after birth 4. Spontaneous breathing 5. Chest radiograph consistent with RDS 6. Within the first 20 hours after birth requires an nCPAP of 5 to 7 cm H2O with an FiO2 of â‰¥ 0.25 (&gt;0.21 for neonates 2628 weeks PMA) to 0.40 that is clinically indicated for at least 30 minutes to maintain SpO2 of 90% to 95%. Transient (&lt;10 minutes) FiO2 excursions outside this range do not reset the 30minute requirement. 1. A heart rate that cannot be stabilized above 100 beats per minute (bpm) within 5 minutes of birth 2. Recurrent episodes of apnea requiring positive pressure ventilation (PPV) administered manually or mechanically through any patient interface 3. A 5 minute Apgar score &lt; 5 4. Major congenital malformation(s) or craniofacial abnormalities that preclude the use of nCPAP, diagnosed antenatally or immediately after birth 5. Clinically significant diseases or conditions other than RDS which could potentially interfere with cardiopulmonary function (e.g. congenital heart disease, hydrops fetalis or congenital infection) 6. A known or suspected chromosomal abnormality or syndrome 7. Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) &gt; 3 weeks 8. Hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors or steroids for hemodynamic support and/or presumed clinical sepsis 9. A need for intubation and/or mechanical ventilation at any time before enrollment into the study 10. The administration (or plan for administration) of any the following: Another investigational agent or investigational medical device Any other surfactant agent Systemic corticosteroids (other than antenatal steroids already received) 11. Presence of air leak (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, subcutaneous emphysema, or definite evidence of pulmonary interstitial emphysema [PIE]) on the baseline chest radiograph</criteria>
