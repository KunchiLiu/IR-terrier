	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of Ca and vitamin D supplementation provided daily throughout Marine Corps recruit training on maintenance of PTH and indices of bone strength in Marine Corps recruits. The investigators hypothesize that Ca+D will prevent elevations in PTH and result in greater increases in indices of bone strength compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation During Marine Corps Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Military recruits undergoing initial military training (IMT) are 17 times more likely to develop stress fractures compared to active duty service members. Up to 800 male and female recruits will be enrolled at the MCRD, Parris Island, SC over two seasons (summer/fall and winter/spring) in order to account for seasonal variation in vitamin D status. Ca (2000 mg/d) and vitamin D (1000 IU/d) will be supplied as either capsules or a fortified food product daily throughout training. This study will provide novel data for the military, medical and scientific communities regarding the relationship between Ca and vitamin D supplementation and biomarkers of immune function, and the requirements for calcium and vitamin D to support bone health during IMT.</detailed_description>
