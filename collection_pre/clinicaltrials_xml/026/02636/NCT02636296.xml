	<brief_title>The Effects of 12 Weeks Pilates-inspired Exercise Training on Functional Performance in Older Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pilates is an exercise system developed over 70 years ago that has been recently received attention due to its beneficial effects on postural stability, coordination, muscle strength and flexibility. The studies published involving Pilates were very different among them regarding intervention period (5, 8, 12 and 24 weeks), frequency (2 and 3 sessions/week) and exercises (mat, mat with accessories, apparatus and others combinations), making meaningful comparison difficult. Furthermore, other important physical features to maintain an independent life at older age, such as cardiorespiratory fitness, were accessed in few studies. So, the effective benefits of Pilates method on physical fitness of community-dwelling older people remain unclear.</detailed_description>
