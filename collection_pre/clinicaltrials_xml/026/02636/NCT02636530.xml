	<brief_summary>Bone responds according to the load placed on it. In this study, investigators want to know if exercise that loads the body in exercises, like walking or jogging (Ground Reaction Forces: GRF), affects bone differently than exercises that load the joints, like weight lifting (Joint Reaction Forces: JRF). Participants will exercise at least 3 times a week for 6 months. Measures of bone strength and mass, muscular strength, and aerobic fitness will be taken at the beginning and the end of the 6 month program. Period blood samples will be taken for future analysis of blood markers.</brief_summary>
