	<criteria>Adult males or females aged 18 years or over Diagnosis of metastatic or advanced CRC, UCC, SCCHN, salivary gland cancer or NSCLC with tumor accessible for biopsy Dose expansion only: Subjects must have at least one measurable site of disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria; this lesion must be outside a previously irradiated area Disease status: Dose escalation phase only: Subject not responding to standard therapy or for whom no standard treatment exists Dose expansion phase: Subject not responding to standard therapy or for whom no standard treatment exists with: CRC No more than four different prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease UCC and SCCHN and salivary gland cancer No more than three different prior treatment regimens in the advanced/metastatic setting with a maximum of two chemotherapycontaining regimens NSCLC Prior treatment regimens must include a platinumbased therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 Predicted life expectancy of 3 months or more Ability to comply with study procedures in the Investigator's opinion Recovered to Grade 1 from the effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior therapy for their malignancies Adequate renal function: Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance using the CockcroftGault formula ≥60 mL/min or measured creatinine clearance Proteinuria: dipstick ≤2+ Adequate hepatic function: Serum bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dL (except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome who may have total bilirubin &lt;3.0 mg/mL) Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Albumin ≥3 g/dL Lipase: 1.5 x ULN. Subjects with lipase &gt;1.5 x ULN may enrol if there are neither clinical or radiographic signs of pancreatitis Amylase: 1.5 x ULN. Subjects with amylase &gt;1.5 x ULN may enrol if there are neither clinical or radiographic signs of pancreatitis Adequate bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥90 g/L Adequate coagulation tests: international normalized ratio ≤1.5 Normal thyroid and pituitary functions For females of childbearing potential (defined as &lt;2 years after last menstruation or not surgically sterile), a negative serum pregnancy test must be documented in the 14 days before the first dose of study treatment For females who are not postmenopausal (24 months of amenorrhea) or surgically sterile (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to use two adequate methods of contraception, during the study treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment For males: agreement to use a barrier method of contraception during the study treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment Subjects must provide written informed consent to participate Willing to consent to tumor biopsies during the study Pregnant or breastfeeding females Known history or evidence of significant immunodeficiency due to underlying illness (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and/or medication (e.g. systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications, including cyclosporine, azathioprine, interferons in the 4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment). Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisolone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of the first dose of study treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement steroid doses are permitted in the absence of autoimmune disease Splenectomy Prior allogeneic or autologous bone marrow or organ transplantation Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease or a syndrome that requires systemic or immunosuppressive agents; subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune disease only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enrol History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, drug induced pneumonitis, evidence of active pneumonia or pneumonitis on computed tomography scan Active infections requiring antibiotics, physician monitoring or recurrent fevers &gt;100.4˚F (38.0˚C) associated with a clinical diagnosis of active infection Active viral disease or positive test for hepatitis B virus using hepatitis B surface antigen test or positive test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) using HCV ribonucleic acid or HCV antibody test indicating acute or chronic infection. Positive test for HIV or AIDS; testing is not required in the absence of history Use of the following antiviral agents: ribavirin, adefovir, lamivudine or cidofovir within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment; or pegylated interferon in the 14 days before the first dose of study treatment Prior treatment with PD1 and programmed death ligand (PDL)1 inhibitors Administration of an investigational drug in the 28 days before the first dose of study treatment Major surgery or treatment with any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologics for cancer or investigational therapy in the 28 days before the first dose of study treatment (subjects with prior cytotoxic or investigational products &lt;3 weeks prior to study treatment might be eligible after discussion between the Investigator and Medical Monitor, if toxicities from the prior treatment have been resolved to NCI CTCAE Grade 1). All toxicities attributed to prior anticancer therapy other than alopecia and fatigue must have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline before the first dose of study treatment. Subjects with toxicities attributed to prior anticancer therapy which are not expected to resolve and result in long lasting sequelae, such as neuropathy after platinum based therapy, are permitted to enrol Other prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for local or organ confined early stage cancer that has been definitively treated with curative intent, does not require ongoing treatment, has no evidence of residual disease and has a negligible risk of recurrence and is therefore unlikely to interfere with the primary and secondary endpoints of the study, including response rate and safety Symptomatic brain metastases or any leptomeningeal metastasis that is symptomatic and/or requires treatment. Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if these have been locally treated (surgery, radiotherapy). There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalent) for at least 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Medical Monitor, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy or interfere with the interpretation of study results Known allergy to enadenotucirev, nivolumab or their excipients Any other medical or psychological condition that would preclude participation in the study or compromise ability to give informed consent Dependence on continuous supplemental oxygen use</criteria>
