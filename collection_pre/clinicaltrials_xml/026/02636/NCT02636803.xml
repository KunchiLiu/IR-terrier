	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to provide data on the efficacy of oxfendazole against Trichuris trichiura at different doses in comparison to the standard single 400 mg dose of albendazole. In addition, the study will provide data on oxfendazole efficacy against other common nematodes encountered in man (Enterobius vermicularis, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenalis, Necator americanus).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy of Oxfendazole Compared to Albendazole in the Treatment of Trichuris Trichiura Infection in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open, comparative study in adult patients with proven intestinal infection with Trichuris trichiura. Patients meeting the study entry criteria will receive either 6mg/kg, or 30 mg/kg of oxfendazole as a single oral dose or 6 mg/kg orally for three days or albendazole 400mg as a single oral dose. Stool samples will be obtained and examined 7, 14 and 21 days after treatment. Two hundred clinically evaluable patients of either gender, 16 - 65 years of age, presenting with proven Trichuris trichiura infection, recruited from one centre, will be included in the study. there will be 15 patients in each treatment group.
