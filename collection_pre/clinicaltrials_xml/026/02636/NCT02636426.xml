	<brief_summary>Sorafenib is an oral anticancer drug and inhibits multiple protein kinases important for tumor growth and metastases, including VEGFR, PDGFR, and RAF kinases. In daily clinical practice it is currently used at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in a continuous schedule. In this phase I study patients will be treated with a new dosing schedule of sorafenib: i.e. a high-dose, pulsatile schedule. The tolerability and safety of this new schedule is examined in exposure escalation cohorts based on a target plasma AUC0-12h (area under the curve). Exposure escalation cohorts are used instead of conventional dose escalation cohorts because the effect of a drug is dependent of its AUC levels and large differences in plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h have previously been shown between patients treated at the same dose level. Using pharmacokinetic monitoring, the sorafenib dose will be adjusted to a target plasma AUC0-12h. The escalation cohorts consist of 3-6 patients per exposure level starting with a target plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h level of 25-50 mg/L/h. After the determination of the maximum tolerated AUC0-12h, 10 additional patients will be entered into an expansion cohort. In the expansion cohort the patients will be treated with a weekly pulse of sorafenib at the maximum tolerated AUC0-12h for further assessment of safety and preliminary exploration of efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Administered Using a High-dose, Pulsatile Regimen: a Phase I Exposure Escalation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Preclinical research showed improved efficacy of sorafenib when given in a high-dose, pulsatile schedule compared with conventional (lower dose) continuous scheduling as a result of higher peak concentrations in the tumor. In this phase I study patients will be treated with high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib in exposure escalation cohorts. Exposure escalations cohorts are based on a target plasma AUC0-12h (area under the curve) and are used instead of conventional dose escalation cohorts because the effect of a drug is dependent of its AUC levels and large differences in plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h have previously been shown between patients treated at the same dose level. Primary Objectives: - To determine the maximum tolerated plasma AUC0-12h of high-dose sorafenib administered in a weekly, pulsatile schedule. - To assess the safety and tolerability of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib. Secondary Objectives: - To determine the pharmacokinetic behaviour of sorafenib and its major active metabolite pyridine N-oxide when administered in a weekly, pulsatile schedule. - To determine a recommended phase II plasma AUC0-12h of high-dose sorafenib in a weekly pulsatile schedule. - Preliminary assessment of the efficacy of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib administered at the maximum tolerated plasma AUC0-12h. - To determine skin and intratumoral concentrations of sorafenib and their correlation with plasma and whole blood concentrations. - To select 1-2 optimal time points from the AUC0-12h data to determine sorafenib exposure using a finger puncture. Study design: A single center, open-label, phase I study of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib administered in exposure escalation cohorts. Study population: Adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease for whom no standard therapy exists. Treatment: Patients will be treated in exposure escalation cohorts with high-dose sorafenib administered in a weekly pulsatile schedule. Using pharmacokinetic monitoring, the sorafenib dose will be adjusted to a target plasma AUC0-12h. The escalation cohorts consist of 3-6 patients per exposure level starting with a target plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h level of 25-50 mg/L/h. After the determination of the maximum tolerated AUC0-12h, 10 additional patients will be entered into an expansion cohort. In the expansion cohort the patients will be treated with a weekly pulse of sorafenib at the maximum tolerated AUC0-12h for further assessment of safety and preliminary exploration of efficacy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histological or cytological documentation of incurable locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancy for which no standard therapy exists. 2. Patients eligible for the expansion cohort must be willing to undergo tumor and skin biopsies, while tumor and skin biopsies are optional for patients enrolled in the escalation cohort. Primary tumor or metastatic site must be accessible for biopsy. Bone metastases are excluded as a biopsy site. 3. Evaluable disease by RECIST version 1.1. criteria (see appendix III; at least 1 target or nontarget lesion for the dose escalation cohorts; at least 1 target lesion the for dose expansion cohorts). 4. Patients must have documented radiographic or clinical progressive disease. 5. Age ≥ 18 years. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 1 (appendix IV). 7. Normal 12lead ECG (clinically insignificant abnormalities permitted), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 50% evaluated by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram. 8. Normal or regulated thyroid function supplementation or blocking drugs permitted. 9. Urine analysis: no clinically significant abnormalities. 10. Albumin higher than 25 g/L. 11. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements to be conducted within 14 days prior to screening: Hemoglobin ≥ 5,6 mmol/L Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,5 x 10*9/l Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10*9/l Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Patients with known Gilbert's disease who have serum bilirubin ≤ 3x ULN may be enrolled. ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN (in case of liver metastases: ≤ 5 times ULN). Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min (based on MDRD). PTINR/PTT &lt; 1.5 x ULN, unless coumarin derivatives are used. Activated partial thromboplastin time &lt; 1.25 x ULN (therapeutic anticoagulation therapy is allowed, if this treatment can be interrupted for a biopsy as judged by the treating physician). 1. Evidence of a significant uncontrolled concomitant disease, such as cardiovascular disease (including stroke, New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening, unstable arrhythmia, clinically significant valvular heart disease and unstable angina); nervous system, pulmonary (including obstructive pulmonary disease and history of symptomatic bronchospasm), renal, hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal disorders; or a serious nonhealing wound or fracture. 2.

Both men and women enrolled in this trial must agree to use adequate barrier birth control measures (e.g., cervical cap, condom, or diaphragm) during the course of the trial. Oral birth control methods alone will not be considered adequate on this study, because of the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between study drug and oral contraceptives. Concomitant use of oral and barrier contraceptives is advised. Contraception is necessary for at least 6 months after receiving the study protein kinase inhibitor. 17. Concomitant medication with drugs having proarrhythmic potential (such as sotalol, haloperidol, flecainide) is not permitted during the study.</criteria>
