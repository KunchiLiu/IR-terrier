	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis is a chronic, multifactorial characterization, which changes in bone alignment, cartilage and structures that provide joint stability appear to be strongly correlated with the origin of this disease.This project will aim to verify the effectiveness of interferential current, short wave and low level laser therapy on an exercise program for mobility and pain in knee osteoarthritis. Blind randomized, placebo controlled. Five groups: exercise group, exercise group + Ultrasound therapy, exercise group + interferential current, exercise group + short-wave diathermy, exercise group + Low level laser therapy. Before and after the trial protocol by the following instruments: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), numerical scale of pain assessment (END), Visual Analogue Scale Fatigue (VAS-F), issue F2.2 Instrument assessment of quality of life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-100) test sitting and standing + numerical rating pain scale, algometry. This project hypothesizes that the inclusion of photothermal and electrical agents in an exercise program will provide an improvement in pain, mobility and knee function in individuals diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
