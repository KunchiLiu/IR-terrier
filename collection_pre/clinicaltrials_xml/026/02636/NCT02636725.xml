	<brief_title>Axitinib and Pembrolizumab in Subjects With Advanced Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma and Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a single-institution, open-label, single-arm phase II study. Since the primary endpoint is survival outcome, progression-free survival (PFS) sample size calculation is based on a single-arm survival design. The investigators will employ early stopping rules for lack of efficacy, based on previously reported historical controls (19% PFS at 3 months) and a large database suggesting that a progression-free rate at 3 months of &gt; 40% correlates with an active drug in the second-line setting for patients with advanced sarcoma. Patients will be treated with twice daily dosing of axitinib alone for the first 7 days, followed by concurrent axitinib administered twice daily at 5 mg orally (PO), plus intravenous administration of pembrolizumab every 21 days. Patients will be assessed every three weeks for toxicity. After the first five patients are enrolled, the investigators will assess safety of the combination. If 2 or fewer patients exhibit dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the investigators will then proceed with intrapatient titration of axitinib dosing at each cycle based on the presence or absence of predefined toxicities. Correlative studies characterizing T-cells in tumor tissue and in peripheral blood will be performed at three timepoints: 1. pre-treatment, 2. on-treatment on cycle 3 day 1, and 3. off-study. Additional exploratory imaging investigations, and assessment of circulating tumor cells are included for all patients. Trial therapy will last until withdrawal of consent, disease progression and/or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.</detailed_description>

Primary tumors of bone including Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma may only be enrolled if there are measurable target lesions occurring in soft tissue and they are refractory to standard of care anthracyclinebased chemotherapy. 7. Any other histology or standard of care therapy not specifically addressed will be reviewed by the principal investigator and pathologist for final determination of eligibility. 8.

(GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl). Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard. Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and Alanine Transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases. Albumin &gt;2.5 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants. 12. Age ≥ 16 years. 13. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 14. Patients must consent and be willing to undergo three core needle biopsies at baseline, prior to starting Cycle 3, and at offstudy. At least one tumor site must be amenable to biopsy in the judgment of the interventional radiologist. 15. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 16. Females of child bearing potential that are sexually active must agree to either practice 2 medically accepted highly effective methods of contraception at the same time or abstain from heterosexual intercourse from the time of signing the informed consent through 120 days after the last dose of study drug. See Appendix G for protocolapproved highly effective methods of contraceptive combinations. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Negative test for pregnancy is required of females of childbearing potential; A female of child bearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1. has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2. has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months or 730 days). Conception while on treatment must be avoided 17.
