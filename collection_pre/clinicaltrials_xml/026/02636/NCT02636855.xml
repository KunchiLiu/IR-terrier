	<brief_summary>This screening study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid or hematologic malignancy. The study will assess a subject's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtype and tumor antigen expression profile. Based on the results, it will be determined if a subject is eligible to be considered for Adaptimmune sponsored clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of genetically changed T cells targeting specific tumor antigens. No treatment intervention will occur as part of this screening study. Upon enrollment, subjects will be required to provide a blood sample for HLA subtype analysis. If the results of the analysis match the HLA-A subtypes noted in the inclusion criteria and do not express the HLA subtypes that are exclusionary for the available interventional clinical trial(s), then the subject will be required to provide either an archival tumor specimen or fresh tumor tissue biopsy. The tumor specimen will be screened at a central laboratory for the expression (protein or gene) of multiple antigens which may include, but are not limited to NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a and MAGE A10. Based upon the results of these diagnostic analyses, if eligible, subjects will be referred to an appropriate available interventional clinical trial(s) at the discretion of the Investigator. Following screening, tumor samples will be retained by Adaptimmune for the purpose of developing and validating in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay(s) for antigen expression profiling which is required for regulatory approval of a new therapeutic product indication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Protocol for Tumor Antigen Expression Profiling and HLA Typing for Eligibility Determination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter screening study will be conducted in order to determine a subject's tumor antigen expression profile and HLA subtype, and subsequent eligibility for Adaptimmune sponsored clinical treatment trials studying the safety and efficacy of autologous genetically modified T-cells engineered with enhanced TCRs targeting specific antigens. No treatment intervention will occur as part of this screening study. Specific Adaptimmune sponsored interventional protocols have been designated to utilize this screening protocol to determine preliminary eligibility. Therefore, details of the available interventional clinical trial(s) (e.g., HLA subtype, tumor antigen, and other eligibility criteria) should be understood before consenting subjects for this screening protocol. For this screening study, subjects with confirmed advanced solid or hematologic malignancy or recurrent disease, as described in the respective Adaptimmune clinical trial protocol(s), will be required to provide a blood sample for diagnostic analysis. The blood sample will be used for HLA subtype analysis. If the results of the analysis match the HLA subtype specified in the available interventional clinical trial(s), then the subject will be required to provide either an archival tumor specimen or fresh tumor tissue biopsy. The tumor specimen will be screened at a central laboratory for the expression (gene or protein) of multiple antigens using Clinical Trial Assays. The Clinical Trial Assays to be used in this protocol have undergone CLIA validation to establish the sensitivity, specificity and performance of the assays. The antigens to be screened may include, but are not limited to the following: NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a and MAGE-A10. Based upon both the tumor antigen expression and the HLA subtype, if eligible, subjects will be referred to appropriate available interventional trial(s) at the discretion of the Investigator. The secondary objective of the study is the collection and analysis of tumor tissue specimens to enable the development and validation of single and/or multiple-marker ('multiplex') IVD assay(s) for antigen expression profiling. It is a regulatory requirement to develop the IVD(s) as a companion diagnostic(s) to accompany a future new indication drug application(s). Therefore all tumor specimens from this study will be retained by Adaptimmune for companion diagnostic validation purposes.</detailed_description>
