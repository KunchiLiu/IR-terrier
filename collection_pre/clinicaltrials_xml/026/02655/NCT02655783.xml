	<brief_title>Use of Normal Saline With or Without Dextrose During Induction of Labor in Nulliparous</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is some controversy regarding intravenous hydration of patients during labor. While the use of a fast flow of hydration appears to be recognized beneficial, the addition of glucose is less well accepted. However studies on exercise physiology clearly demonstrates improved performance of skeletal muscle by increased hydration and carbohydrate replacement during prolonged exercise. This situation is similar to the condition of the uterus in labor especially since it is now established that glucose represents its principal source of energy. However, the effect of an additional carbohydrate intake on the evolution of labor has not been extensively studied until now, and there are several schools of thought on this subject. While some studies show that such glucose addition could reduce the total duration of labor as well as its second stage, others claim that this glucose supplement offers no benefit and may even be harmful to the fetus. It therefore seems imperative to conduct a study to compare the use of hydration with normal saline with or without dextrose during labor, as recommended in current flow (250 cc / h). To our knowledge, this has never been done.</detailed_description>
