	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the in vivo kinematics and range of motion of a single-surgeon clinical series of TKA performed with a fixed-bearing cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty that has a roll-back mechanism and compare it with the kinematic of the normal healthy knee. Patients would be evaluated by fluoroscopic examination during weight bearing activities (lounging, kneeling and stairs climbing).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Patients screened and enrolled in the Physica KR followup clinical study according to all inclusion criteria. (K06 Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0 approved by the Health Research Authority NRES Committee East of England Cambridge East on February 13th 2014 and by the R&amp;D Department of The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital NHS Foundation Trust on March 7th 2014); 2. Patients achieving a ROM ≥ 100° at 6 week followup in the Physica KR clinical trial (K06 Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0); 3. Patients affected by primary or secondary OA before surgery; 4. Patients with an appropriate intial fixation and stability of the knee prosthesis; 5. Patients with undamaged and functional collateral and posterior cruciate ligaments (no ligamentous imbalance or pain); 6. Patients who understand the requirements of the study and are willing and able to comply with activities required for fluoroscopic examination; 7. Patients who have signed the Ethics Committee approved studyspecific Informed Consent Form. 1. Patients excluded from the Physica KR followup clinical study, according to exclusion criteria (K06 Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0 approved by the Health Research Authority NRES Committee East of England Cambridge East on February 13th 2014 and by the R&amp;D Department of The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital NHS Foundation Trust on March 7th 2014); 2. Patients with a ROM &lt; 100° at 6week followup in Physica KR clinical trial (K06 Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0); 3. Patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis; 4. Patients with malalignment or axial malrotation of the knee prosthesis; 5. Patients who had or have planned a surgery on their uninvolved knee within a year; 6. Muscular insufficiency or absence of muscoligamentous supporting structures required for adequate soft tissue balance; 7. Patients who have significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease that may adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery and evaluation; 8. Patients who have neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability to assess the performance of the device; 9. Any psychiatric illness that would prevent comprehension of the details and nature of the study; 10. Participation in any experimental drug/device study within the 6 months prior to the preoperative visit, excluding the Physica KR clinical trial (K06 Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0); 11. Female patients who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy.</criteria>
