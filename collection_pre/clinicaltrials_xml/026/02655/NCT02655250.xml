	<brief_title>Neonatal Microbiome Validity Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to conduct a future study of the gut microbiome in a population living in a rural, low income setting, this validation study will be conducted to verify the validity of our proposed field collection methods for stool and breast milk samples. We will compare the microbial diversity and abundance in the biologic samples using various proposed field collection methods to an immediately frozen sample. The proposed field collection methods are feasible for use in a community-based study in a low income setting with limited access to cold storage.</detailed_description>
