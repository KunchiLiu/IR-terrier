	<brief_title>Maintaining Independence in Everyday Life Among Seniors With Subjective Cognitive Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The planned project explores the effects of several interventions designed to promote independence in everyday life, with older adults who identify cognitive complaints. Evidence suggests that 25-50% of community dwelling older adults report cognitive difficulties, such as reduced memory or concentration, in the absence of any diagnosed condition. Cognitive skills are crucial to living independently. The investigators plan to examine two approaches in a randomized controlled trial. Based on our successful pilot study, the investigators hypothesize that this training which combines education on healthy lifestyles and problem solving training to address everyday life difficulties, will be effective in maximizing and maintaining independence of older adults.</detailed_description>
