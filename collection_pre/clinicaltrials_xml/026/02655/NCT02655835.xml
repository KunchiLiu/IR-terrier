	<brief_summary>Phase 1 will follow 40 subjects and hopes to address whether or not IMMI can increase meditation practice as compared to another meditation program. The study will last six weeks for both the IMMI group (20 subjects) and the Access group (20 subjects). Access groups will receive learning materials and guided meditations, but the implementation will be self-paced. Participants in the IMMI group will receive weekly learning sessions and be required to practice meditation every day. IMMI group participants will also receive a weekly reminder call from a member of the study staff and have access to technical support in the event of trouble with the online program. All subjects will complete online self-report questionnaires that measure quality of life, self-efficacy, mood, sleep, mindfulness, and perceived stress at baseline and at the end of the six-week intervention. Subjects will also be given a questionnaire at the end of the study gauging their satisfaction with the mindfulness program they participated in. Phase 2 will follow 80 subjects and hopes to address whether or not IMMI is acceptable to participants and demographic information about IMMI users. The study will be the same as noted above, but all subjects will be entered in the IMMI program. Differences in recruitment rates, drop out, and patient satisfaction between the IMMI and Access groups will be analyzed. IMMI's ability to change meditation behavior (i.e. increasing time or frequency of meditation sessions), and improve quality of life will be examined as well.</brief_summary>
