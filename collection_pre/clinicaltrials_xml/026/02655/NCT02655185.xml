	<brief_title>Novel Risk Factors of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. Chronic Heart failure (CHF) has become a major clinical and public health problem. Both AF and CHF often co-exist and complicate each other's administration.Several risk factors have been demonstrated to be associated with the risk of AF in Patients with CHF. Lopez et al. found that higher levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and total cholesterol were associated with a lower incidence of AF independently of other risk factors from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Thus the purpose of this study is to determine whether lipid levels are related with incidence of atrial fibrillation in Patients with chronic heart failure. This study maybe provide a novel opinion on the prevention of AF in patients with CHF.</detailed_description>
