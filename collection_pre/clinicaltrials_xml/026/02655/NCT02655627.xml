	<brief_summary>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a disease which is characterized with insulin resistance and exercise has positive effects on glycemic control and cardiovascular disease (CVD) development in these patients. Encouraging physical activity and exercise with using internet-based technology provides; potential to reach more people via comparatively low cost, 24 hour accessibility to services and for clinician, more frequent communication ability with the patient. In literature, there is no study examined exercise training via internet in patients with Type 2 DM. For this reason, considering the lack of the literature, the investigators aimed to compare the effects of internet based combined exercise training on glycemic control, functional capacity and physical activity level with supervised group training in patients with Type 2 DM. The purpose of the study is to provide convenience of rehabilitation access, glycemic control, offer an alternative physiotherapy and rehabilitation service which can help to improve physical activity level and obtain quantitative data for the applicability and contribution of internet based exercise training in patients with Type 2 DM.</brief_summary>
