	<brief_summary>Aims: - evaluate the hydric status through bioimpedance spectroscopy in consecutive acute myocardial infarction patients referred for primary PCI; - assessment of renal artery stenosis incidence through renal angiography in consecutive STEMI patients; - fully characterize the complex hydration, metabolic and endothelial profile of these patients in the attempt to define the role played by dehydration in the complex dynamics of acute myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydration Status Assessment Through Body Composition Monitoring in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gathered data: - descriptive general demographic data; - previous pathologies (ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, heart failure, previous percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting - CABG, known renal disease); - cardiovascular risk factors (age, weight, height, abdominal perimeter, body mass index, smoking, sedentariness, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia); - routine biological data; - metabolic data (obtained from two body composition monitoring evaluations - before and 12 hours after coronary intervention) - body water, body fat tissue; - information regarding primary PCI (less than 12 hours of ischemic symptoms); - coronarographic details, type of used stent, periprocedural specific complications, final TIMI - thrombolysis in myocardial infarction - flow); - echocardiography at admission (LVEF); - renal arteries angiographic details performed in the same time with PCI (two independent operators evaluate stenosis based on a predefined scale); - renal diameters; - measurement of arterial stiffness through Sphigmocore pulsed-wave-velocity (24 hrs post-procedural, 2 velocities: carotid - femoral and carotid - radial); - in-hospital and one month follow-up MACE.</detailed_description>
