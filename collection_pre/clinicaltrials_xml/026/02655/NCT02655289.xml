	<brief_summary>Pain is the most common symptom (ca. 80% of patients) on German Palliative Care units and thus, pain control plays a central role in palliative care. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a complementary treatment option for patients who experience suboptimal pain control. However, the evidence for the efficacy of TENS in cancer patients is not unambiguous. The present study is a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial with a short-term follow-up. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TENS for cancer pain reduction in advanced cancer patients. The secondary aim is the explorative identification of subgroups that benefit or do not benefit from TENS.</brief_summary>
