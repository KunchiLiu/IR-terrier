	<brief_summary>This is a national, multicenter, retrospective, observational post-authorization study (EPA-OD) study. The study will be conducted by reviewing the medical records of patients up to the start of the study. In each case, only data from before the start of the study will be obtained in order to ensure they are retrospective in nature, thus reflecting the regular use of nab-paclitaxel in clinical practice and avoiding interference with the physician's clinical practice. To ensure the observational nature of this study, these data will be collected whenever they are available in the patient's medical record, and so no diagnostic or therapeutic intervention outside regular clinical practice will be used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer in Routine Clinical Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a national, multicenter, retrospective, observational post-authorization study (EPA-OD) study. Investigators will include all consecutive adult patients diagnosed with HER2-negative MBC who have started treatment with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy no further than the third line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease during the past 3 years (2012-2014). These patients must meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria established in this protocol. The primary objective is to describe the effectiveness of nab-paclitaxel in terms of response in early lines of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer in routine clinical practice. This study plans to collect data retrospectively, provided they are available in the patient's medical record and according to routine clinical practice.</detailed_description>
