	<brief_summary>This project will follow babies with ichthyosis over time in order to better understand the natural course of ichthyosis in infants and children and to examine how specific genetic mutations affect clinical characteristics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-center, Prospective Evaluation of Infants and Children With Congenital Ichthyosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that early complications and comorbidities in infants with congenital ichthyosis are genotype-dependent, such that clinical standards of care can be tailored to the genetic diagnoses. Definition of clinical groups based upon phenotype may also provide useful predictors of outcome. Information gained from this study will provide the basis for the development of rational standards of care for the future management of children with congenital ichthyosis.</detailed_description>
