	<brief_title>Short and Long Term Outcomes of Acute Coronary Syndrome in Patients With Non Obstructive Coronary Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study non randomized, opened, controlled. Cardiovascular Magnetic - resonance imaging reveals both ischemic and non-ischemic causes of acute coronary syndrome. Currently, it is the best method for Imaging and damage assessment of myocardial viability in coronary atherosclerosis and noncoronary injuries (V.Yu.Usov 2012). Taking into account the results of previous (D. Kawecki, B. Morawiec, P. Monney, 2015) research, it can be concluded that the introduction of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging into routine practice will change the structure of morbidity among patients with acute coronary syndrome and non obstructive coronary atherosclerosis . The research was conducted on small groups of patients, and therefore further data acquisition is required. It is planned to study 200 patients with acute coronary syndrome. On admission, they will receive the standard treatment of ACS with and without ST elevation. Within 72 hours they will performed diagnostic coronary angiography. If in case of non stenotic atherosclerosis of coronary artery (normal / stenosis &lt; 50%) patients are planned for cardiac contrast MRI, which will identify both ischemic and non-ischemic causes of acute coronary syndrome. At 30 days, 6 months, 12 months the researchers will assess the clinical condition of the patients, perform cardiac ultrasound for the evaluation of myocardial contractile function, evaluate the incidence rate of secondary endpoints</detailed_description>
