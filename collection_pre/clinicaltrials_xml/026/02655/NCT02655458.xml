	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the combination of Elotuzumab in combination with autologous stem cell transplantation and lenalidomide maintenance to see what side effects it may have and how well it works for the treatment of symptomatic multiple myeloma diagnosed and treated with induction therapy in the past year. Induction therapy is the first phase of treatment for multiple myeloma. The goal of induction therapy for multiple myeloma is to reduce the number of plasma cells in the bone marrow and the proteins that the plasma cells produce. Induction therapy is usually given for 3-4 weeks. An autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant is a procedure in which immature "stem cells" are collected and stored for future use. A high dose of chemotherapy is given to the patient to destroy myeloma cells, and the patient's stem cells are replaced. The investigational drug in this program is elotuzumab. Elotuzumab is known as BMS-901608. Elotuzumab is a manufactured protein directed against a target found on multiple myeloma cells. Lenalidomide is currently approved for patients with multiple myeloma. Melphalan and cyclophosphamide, the drugs used during stem cell collection and transplant, are also approved by the U.S. FDA. Melphalan is an FDA-approved chemotherapy for multiple myeloma and is used as high-dose treatment prior to stem cell transplantation. Cyclophosphamide is an FDA-approved chemotherapy that may be used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs to treat multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elotuzumab in Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) and Lenalidomide Maintenance for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1b, open-label, trial investigating elotuzumab and autologous PBMC reconstitution with auto-SCT consolidation therapy and lenalidomide maintenance. Fifteen patients will be enrolled in this study. This study is based on the hypothesis that the addition of Elotuzumab and autologous PBMC reconstitution to standard-of-care auto-SCT and lenalidomide maintenance will be safe and feasible. Furthermore, we hypothesize that Elotuzumab and PBMC reconstitution will target residual myeloma cells, enhance NK cell activation and ADCC, and promote tumor-specific humoral and cellular immune responses against myeloma cells, resulting in long-term maintenance of the minimal residual disease state.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is, in the investigator's opinion, willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements. Subject has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to their future medical care. Target Population Subjects with symptomatic MM by IMWG criteria who are receiving or have completed induction chemotherapy, who have achieved at least a PR on most recent therapy by IMWG criteria, and are eligible for autoSCT for consolidation. A specific induction regimen is not dictated for this protocol, however, the induction regimen must not have contained melphalan (LPAM, Alkeran). Age &gt; 18 years or legal age of consent per local regulations. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2. Documented evidence of newly diagnosed, symptomatic MM, by IMWG criteria within one year of enrollment Prior lenalidomide exposure is permitted only if the subject did not discontinue lenalidomide due to a related, grade ≥ 3 AE. Age and Reproductive Status Men and women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using 2 reliable methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study for a period of at least 30 days before and 90 days after the last dose of investigational product in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. See Section 4.3.3 for the definition of WOCBP and also refer to the Revlimid Risk Management Plan guidelines. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG). The first should be performed within 10 to 14 days and the second within 24 hours prior to the start of the study drug. A prescription for lenalidomide for a female of childbearing potential must not be issued by the prescriber until negative pregnancy tests have been verified by the prescriber. Women must not be breastfeeding. Men must agree to use a latex condom and a second form of birth control during sexual contact with WOCBP, even if they have had a successful vasectomy, and must agree not to donate sperm during study drug therapy and for 90 days after therapy. Subjects must be willing to refrain from blood donations during study drug therapy and for 8 weeks after therapy. Target Disease MGUS, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, or asymptomatic (smoldering) myeloma. Active plasma cell leukemia (defined as either 20% of peripheral white blood cells comprised of plasma/CD138+ cells or an absolute plasma cell count of 2 x 109/L).
