	<detailed_description>A Phase IIa prospective, open-label, multicenter study to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety and tolerability of aztreonam-avibactam (ATM-AVI) for the treatment of complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections (cIAIs) in hospitalized adults</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Provision of informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures. 2. Male or female from 18 to 90 years of age inclusive. 3. Female patients are authorized to participate in this clinical study if criteria concerning pregnancy avoidance stated in the protocol are met 4. Diagnosis of cIAI EITHER: Intraoperative/postoperative enrolment with visual confirmation (presence of pus within the abdominal cavity) of an intraabdominal infection associated with peritonitis. Surgical intervention includes open laparotomy, percutaneous drainage of an abscess, or laparoscopic surgery. Specimens from the surgical intervention must be sent for culture. Patients who undergo a surgical procedure with complete fascial closure are appropriate for the trial. The skin incision may be left open for purposes of wound management as long as complete fascial closure is accomplished. The patient has at least 1 of the following diagnosed during the surgical intervention: 1. Cholecystitis with gangrenous rupture or perforation or progression of the infection beyond the gallbladder wall 2. Diverticular disease with perforation or abscess 3. Appendiceal perforation or periappendiceal abscess 4. Acute gastric or duodenal perforations, only if operated on &gt;24 hours after diagnosis 5. Traumatic perforation of the intestines, only if operated on &gt;12 hours after diagnosis (f) Secondary peritonitis (but not spontaneous bacterial peritonitis associated with cirrhosis and chronic ascites) (g) Intra abdominal abscess (including of liver or spleen provided that there is extension beyond the organ with evidence of intraperitoneal involvement) OR Preoperative enrollment where the following clinical criteria are met with confirmation of infection by surgical intervention within 24 hours of entry: 1. Requirement for surgical intervention, defined per protocol as open laparotomy, percutaneous drainage of an abscess, or laparoscopic surgery 2. Evidence of systemic inflammatory response, with at least one of the following: Fever (defined as body temperature &gt;38°C) or hypothermia with a core body temperature &lt;35°C Elevated white blood cells (&gt;12000 cells/μL) Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure &lt;70 mmHg, or a systolic blood pressure decrease of &gt;40 mmHg Increased heart rate ( &gt;90 bpm) and respiratory rate (&gt;20 breaths/min) Hypoxemia (defined as oxygen saturation &lt; 95% by pulse oximetry) Altered mental status. 3. Physical findings consistent with intraabdominal infection, such as: Abdominal pain and/or tenderness, with or without rebound Localized or diffuse abdominal wall rigidity Abdominal mass. 4. Supportive radiologic imaging findings of intraabdominal infection such as perforated intraperitoneal abscess detected on computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance image, or ultrasound. 5. Specimens from the surgical intervention will be sent for culture for isolation of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. 5. Patients who failed prior antibacterial treatment for their current cIAI can be enrolled but must: Have a known or suspected pathogen causing cIAI that is resistant to the prior therapy while assuming the organism is known to be sensitive to ATMAVI. Require surgical intervention. 6. Patient must have or will have a surgical intervention within 24 hours (before or after) the administration of the first dose of study drug Exclusion criteria: 1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study 2. Patient has been previously enrolled in this study, previously treated with ATMAVI or previously participated in an investigation study containing AVI 3. Patient has participated or intends to participate in any other clinical study that involves the administration of an investigational medication at the time of presentation, during the course of the study, or during the 30 days prior to study start. 4. Patient has a history of serious allergy, hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis), or any serious reaction to aztreonam, carbapenem, monobactam or other βlactam antibiotics, avibactam, nitroimidazoles or metronidazole, or any of the excipients of the respective (investigational) medicinal products to be administered during the study 5. Patient has a diagnosis of abdominal wall abscess; small bowel obstruction or ischemic bowel disease without perforation; traumatic bowel perforation with surgery within 12 hours of diagnosis; perforation of gastroduodenal ulcer with surgery within 24 hours of diagnosis (these are considered situations of peritoneal soiling before infection has become established); another intraabdominal process in which the primary etiology is not likely to be infectious 6. Patient has a simple cholecystitis, gangrenous cholecystitis without rupture, simple appendicitis, acute suppurative cholangitis, infected necrotizing pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess or ischaemic/necrotic intestine without perforation 7. Patient has a cIAI managed by staged abdominal repair (STAR), open abdomen technique or any situation where infection source control is not likely to be achieved or in whom the abdomen is left open, particularly those for whom reoperation is planned, or those unlikely to solely respond to antimicrobial therapy 8. At screening, if it is known the patient has an infection due to a pathogen that is unlikely to respond to ATMAVI plus metronidazole treatment 9. Patient has a rapidly progressive (expected to die in &lt;30 days) or terminal illness, including acute hepatic failure, respiratory failure or septic shock with a high risk of mortality due to other causes than cIAI 10. Patient has received systemic antibacterial agents within the 72 hour period prior to study entry, unless either of the following pertains: 1. Patient has a new infection (not considered a treatment failure) and the following is met: Patient received no more than 24 hours within the 72 hour period prior to study entry 2. Patient is considered to have failed the previous treatment regimen 11. Patient has a concurrent infection that may interfere with the evaluation of clinical cure for the study therapy 12. Patient needs effective concomitant systemic antibacterials (oral, IV, or intramuscular) or antifungals in addition to the investigational product and metronidazole 13. Patient has creatinine clearance ≤50 ml/min. Note: following review of PK and safety data from the first 10 enrolled patients, and the confirmation of a provisional dose schedule, patients with a creatinine clearance of 31 50 mL/min may be included. 14. Patient has had acute hepatitis in the prior 6 months, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis (any ChildPugh class), acute hepatic failure, or acute decompensation of chronic hepatic failure 15. Presence of hepatic disease as indicated by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) at Screening. Patients with AST and/or ALT &gt;3 × ULN and &lt; 5 × ULN are eligible if these elevations are acute, not accompanied by a total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN and documented by the investigator as being directly related to the infectious process being treated 16. Patient has a total bilirubin &gt;3 × ULN, unless isolated hyperbilirubinemia is directly related to the acute infection or due to known Gilbert's disease 17. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt;3 × ULN. Patients with values &gt;3 × ULN and &lt;5 x ULN are eligible if this value is acute and directly related to the infectious process being treated. 18. Patients with an immunocompromising illness 19. Known active Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea 20. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may confound the results of the study or pose additional risks 21. Patient with a do not resuscitate order 22. Patient has an absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/μL 23. Patient has a hematocrit &lt;25% or hemoglobin &lt;8 gm/dL. 24. Patient has a platelet count &lt;75,000/μL. Patients with a platelet as low as 50,000 /μL are permitted if the reduction is historically stable 25. Patient is currently receiving treatment with probenecid. 26. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding or if of child bearing potential, 27. Patient is unlikely to comply with protocol, 28. Patient is currently receiving anticonvulsant therapy to prevent recurrence of a past history of seizures. 29. Patient has a prior liver, pancreas or smallbowel transplant.</criteria>
