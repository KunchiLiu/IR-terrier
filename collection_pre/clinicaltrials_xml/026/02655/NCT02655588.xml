	<brief_title>A Computerized Intervention for Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An interactive multimedia computer-based treatment program was developed to provide an electronic version of problem solving therapy for depression (imbPST). The program was entirely automated and did not require the involvement of a live clinician, even though it was designed to provide a "virtual therapy" experience that feels more like interacting with a person than with a computer. The imbPST program was built to help individuals who did not have access to traditional therapy due the living conditions or individual preferences (e.g. rural, poor and persons desiring privacy or with significant time constraints). This computer-based treatment of depression offered several advantages. It can be used anywhere without a therapist present, and offered a standardized and consistent therapeutic approach. The aim of this study is to reduce symptoms of depression in subjects through the use of a new, electronic Problem Solving Treatment (imbPST). Adult participants with moderate to severe depression symptoms are randomly assigned to either treatment or a wait-list condition. The Beck Depression Inventory-II was used as the primary outcome measure</detailed_description>
