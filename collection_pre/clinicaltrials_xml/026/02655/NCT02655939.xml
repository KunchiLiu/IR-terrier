	<brief_summary>Reflex plus™ is a unique blend of Collagen Hydrolysate with Rosehip extract. The blend contains individual ingredients which have been widely studied for its effectiveness in osteoarthritis(OA). Collagen hydrolysate is accumulated in the cartilage and helps to repair the OA, related cartilaginous changes. Rosehip works in the anti-inflammatory pathway thus reducing the pain and inflammation of the joint. The two open-label studies have showed the effectiveness of the investigational product on OA. The 2 studies did not show any specific safety concern to be considered. The study demonstrated the synergistic effect of CH and Rosehip extract from former in-vitro results in the formulation. The supplement has been manufactured in GMP certified manufacturing units in Germany and India under strict quality control check. Hence, quality of the supplement and batch to batch consistency is well assured.</brief_summary>
