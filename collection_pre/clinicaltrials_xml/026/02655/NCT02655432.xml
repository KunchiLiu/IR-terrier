	<detailed_description>Screening of haitian children between the ages of 3 and 6 years old for amblyogenic risk factors with the use of the Spot photoscreener before and after cycloplegia. The photoscreener results will be compared to the complete ophthalmologic evaluation. The ophthalmologic evaluation includes visual acuity, ocular alignment, slit lamp evaluation, cycloplegic refraction and dilated fundus evaluation. First of all, this will allow evaluation of the performance of the spot photoscreener in the haitian children population.
