	<brief_summary>Alcoholic hepatitis is a syndrome of progressive inflammatory liver injury associated with long-term heavy intake of ethanol. The pathogenesis is not completely understood. Patients who are severely affected present with subacute onset of fever, hepatomegaly, leukocytosis, marked impairment of liver function (e.g., jaundice, coagulopathy), and manifestations of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage). However, milder forms of alcoholic hepatitis often do not cause any symptoms. Alcoholic hepatitis usually persists and progresses to cirrhosis if heavy alcohol use continues. If alcohol use ceases, alcoholic hepatitis resolves slowly over weeks to months, sometimes without permanent sequelae but often with residual cirrhosis. F-652 is a recombinant fusion protein containing human interleukin 22 (IL-22) and human Immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2)-Fc produced in CHO cells in serum-free culture. F-652 under development is intended to treat patients with graft vs host disease (GvHD) after bone marrow transplantation, and acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH), a severe form of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Both GvHD and AAH are diseases with unmet medical need. The current investigational new drug (IND) application is to conduct a phase Ia clinical study in GvHD patients to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile, and biomarkers of F-652 treatment by intravenous infusion (IV). IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines which control bacterial infection, homeostasis, and tissue repair. IL-22 may be used to treat patients with ALD because of its antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-steatotic, anti-microbial, and proliferative effect that have been demonstrated in various experimental systems.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines which control bacterial infection, homeostasis, and tissue repair. IL-22 may be used to treat patients with ALD because of its antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-steatotic, anti-microbial, and proliferative effect that have been demonstrated in various experimental systems. The sponsor has developed F-652, a recombinant human IL-22 IgG2 Fc fusion protein produced in serum-free culture of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. F-652 is able to protect tissue from damage and enhance tissue repair during the inflammation process and infection by activation of STAT3 mediated by the interleukin-22 receptor subunit 1 (IL-22R1) expressed on epithelial cells such as hepatocytes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To participate in this study, patients must meet all of the following criteria: 1. Able to provide written informed consent (either from patient or patient's legally acceptable representative) 2. Male or female patients 21 years of age or older 3. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis defined as: 1. History of heavy alcohol abuse use: &gt;40 g/day in females and &gt;60 g/day in males for a minimum period of 6 months 2. Consumed alcohol within 6 weeks of entry into the study 3. Serum bilirubin &gt; 3mg/dL AND AST &gt;ALT, but less than 500 U/L 4. MELD score between 1128 5. Liver biopsy will be carried out to confirm diagnosis in all patients except those who meet criteria ac and in whom other causes of liver disease have been excluded (viral, drug, autoimmune etc). 4. Women of childbearing potential must utilize appropriate birth control. Patients on steroids and/or pentoxifylline will not be excluded from the study.</criteria>
