	<brief_title>Effect of Liraglutide on Diastolic Dysfunction on Cardiac MRI in Type 2 Diabetes Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: To test if treatment with liraglutide a GLP-1 analogue in 18 weeks improves diastolic performance in type 2 diabetes (DM2) patients with diastolic dysfunction, compared to placebo. Furthermore, analyzing cardiac MRI indices of fibrosis and the effect on myocardial perfusion. The investigators find that especially diastolic dysfunction is of interest, because it is highly overrepresented in DM2 patients and no treatment exists. Glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue could be a possible treatment agent, by increasing the energy level in the myocardium. No previous study has tested the effect of treatment with a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue on diastolic dysfunction. Design: A randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sample size: 40 patients, 20 in each group. The superior inter-study reproducibility results in considerably lower calculated sample sizes (reductions of 55% to 93%) required by cardiac MR compared with echocardiography to show clinically relevant changes. Power calculations show that only 30 patients are needed form our primary outcome, to allow for dropouts the investigators have chosen to include 40 patients. Intervention: After randomization, patients will be treated with placebo or liraglutide (up to 1.8 mg s.c. once daily). Total treatment period will be 18 weeks. A cardiac MRI scan and an echocardiography will be preformed at baseline and after 18 weeks.</detailed_description>
