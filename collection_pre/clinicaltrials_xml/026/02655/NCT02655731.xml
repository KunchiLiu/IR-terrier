	<brief_summary>Aim of the present prospective, single-centre study is to determine the outcome after pure PVI using HeartLight™ in 100 patients with different extents of LA-LVA. The latter will be assessed by an electro-anatomical voltage map using a commercial 3D mapping system (CARTO, Biosense Webster).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HeartLight Guided - Pure Pulmonary Vein Isolation Regardless of Concomitant Atrial Substrate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ablation strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and concomitant atrial substrate (e.g. low-voltage areas; LVA) is a matter of controversy. Results of studies investigating the impact of LVA may have been confounded by PV-to-left-atrial (LA) reconnection due to non-durable ablation. Therefore, the true contribution of LA-LVA to AF recurrences remains unknown. Meanwhile, new ablation technologies such as the HeartLight™ laser balloon (LB) ablation system providing near complete chronic PVI rates have been developed. Aim of the present prospective, single-centre study is to determine the outcome after pure PVI using HeartLight™ in 100 patients with different extents of LA-LVA. The latter will be assessed by an electro-anatomical voltage map using a commercial 3D mapping system (CARTO, Biosense Webster).</detailed_description>
