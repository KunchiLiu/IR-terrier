	<brief_title>Effect of Raltegravir in Patients With Acute Tropical Spastic Paraparesis - Human T-Lymphotropic Virus 1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will the investigators develop in The Tropical Medicine Institute Alexander von Humboldt that is a referral center in Peru for diseases associated to Human T-Lymphotropic Virus 1 Infection (HTLV-1). The Institute has a cohort of around 600 patients currently being followed up and around 20 to 25 new patients are admitted every year with this disease. This is a pilot study of intervention in a group of patients with tropical spastic paraparesis/ myelopathy to evaluate virologic and clinical response of raltegravir plus zidovudine in this group of patients on the follow-up of 48 weeks.</detailed_description>
