	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to employ diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and tractography to investigate differences in connectivity in the rostral dorsal cingulum bundle (CB) in patients with bipolar disorder type I (BDI) compared to matched controls, and to utilize this information to determine if high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the rostral dorsal CB has realistic potential as a therapy for producing mood stabilization in patients with BDI.</brief_summary>
