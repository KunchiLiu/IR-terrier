	<brief_title>A Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Study of TAK-385 40 mg in the Treatment of Pain Symptoms Associated With Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy of TAK-385 40 mg administered orally once daily for 12 weeks compared with placebo in participants having pain symptoms associated with uterine fibroids. Participants must be diagnosed to have uterine fibroids confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound or other methods. Participants must experience pain symptoms associated with uterine fibroids (eg, lower abdominal pain and low back pain). The total number of participants to be randomized under double-blind conditions is 64 (32 participants each for the TAK-385 40 mg group or placebo group).</detailed_description>
