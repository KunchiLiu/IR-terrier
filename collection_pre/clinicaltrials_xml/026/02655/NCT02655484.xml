	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether CO2 rebreathing occurs in healthy subjects or patients with COPD ventilated during exercise assisted by the single-limb circuit with a plateau exhalation valve at a given inspiratory positive airway pressure and a minimal level of expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) and whether there is a potential threshold for predicting CO2 rebreathing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbon Dioxide Rebreathing During Exercise Assisted by Non-invasive Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive ventilation circuit consists of single-limb tubing for inspiration and expiration, including a plateau exhalation valve. As exhaled gases was vented out the plateau exhalation valve at a constant rate, during exercise, with the increase of exhalation flow, single-limb circuit with a plateau exhalation valve might cause carbon dioxide(CO2) rebreathing. Therefore, our aim in the present study was to evaluate whether CO2 rebreathing occurs in COPD patients ventilated during exercise assisted by the single-limb circuit with a plateau exhalation valve and estimate a potential threshold for predicting CO2 rebreathing.</detailed_description>
