	<brief_title>Fronto-limbic Functional Connectivity Via Real-time fMRI Neurofeedback</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the present proof-of-concept study, investigators plan to evaluate whether real-time fMRI neurofeedback training can enable individuals to gain volitional control over their fronto-limbic circuitry. Given that this circuitry has been abundantly implicated in emotional perception and regulation this could facilitate emotional control. Suitable participants will be randomly assigned to two groups i.e. the experiment group and sham group, while the experiment group receives feedback reflecting fronto-limbic activity patterns, the sham group receives random feedback. Both groups will be required to regulate the neural activity during feedback. Subjects receiving real feedback are expected to develop a better emotional control over the training sessions.</detailed_description>
