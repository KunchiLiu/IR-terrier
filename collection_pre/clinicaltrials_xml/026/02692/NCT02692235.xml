	<brief_summary>Research project objectives The primary aims of the current research project are: 1. To investigate the effects of carnitine with leucine supplementation, in comparison to carnitine supplementation alone, on muscle strength and body composition; 2. To use carnitine supplementation as the anti-inflammatory intervention for exploring the relationship between inflammation and associated with aging reduction of skeletal muscle mass; 3. To explore whether nutritional supplementation and resistance training might be combined to produce synergistic effects in prevention of muscle loss during aging; Hypothesis 1. Leucine stimulates carnitine transport into the muscle cells, which improve mitochondrial capacity. Modification in energetic of skeletal muscle affects the body composition and muscle performance; 2. The carnitine supplementation modulates the blood cytokines concentration. Anti-inflammatory intervention delay the reduction of skeletal muscle mass associated with aging; 3. Resistance training combined with nutritional supplementation have more beneficial effect than resistance training alone in prevention of muscle loss during aging;</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project is separated on two studies. Study A: young volunteers (n=40) are supplemented either with carnitine with leucine or carnitine alone for 24 weeks. Before the start, in the mid-point, and after finishing the supplementation the following primary outputs variables are performed: maximal isokinetic knee extensor peak torque (Biodex System 4 Pro), body composition analysis (InBody720), skeletal muscle carnitine concentration, oral glucose tolerance test. Study B: volunteers over 65 years old (n=40) are supplemented either with carnitine or placebo for 24 weeks. Before the start, in the mid-point, and after finishing the supplementation the following primary outputs variables are performed: body composition analysis, blood cytokines and carnitine concentration, blood lipid profile and global physical activity questionnaire.</detailed_description>
