	<brief_summary>Female sexual dysfunction, including sexual arousal disorder, has a significant clinical impact, affecting millions of women in the United States alone. Peripheral nerve stimulation, such as posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and dorsal genital nerve stimulation (DGNS) can modulate neural circuits for bladder and fecal continence. The investigators hypothesize that periodic DGNS and PTNS will modulate autonomic neural circuits and promote improvements in sexual function in women with sexual arousal disorder. Subjects will be randomized to receive one of the stimulation approaches. Subjects will have weekly 30-minute sessions across twelve weeks.</brief_summary>
