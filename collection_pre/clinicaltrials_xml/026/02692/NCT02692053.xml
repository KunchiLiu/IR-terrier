	<brief_summary>Sepsis induces hemostatic disorders due to the exessive or inappropriate activation of inflammation, which could lead either to hypercoagulability or hypocoagulability. It is currently not possible to determine the hemostatic status of a given patient. This instability of hemostatic system is not revealed by classical tests. Thus, a better characterization of hemostatic status could certainly improve patient care. This study aims at characterizing disorders of coagulation and fibrinolysis using "global" tests such as thrombin generation test or coagulolytic test. Furthermore, the association with biological markers of interest (such as microparticles, neutrophil elastase or histones) will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
