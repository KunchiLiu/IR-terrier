	<brief_summary>This study test the agreement and accuracy of Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) and Cardiac Output (CO) obtained by the Android application Capstesia™ against the gold standard : PPV and CO calculated by thermodilution.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement of Pulse Pressure Variation and Cardiac Output by a New Application for Android™ (Captesia™)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulse pressure variation (PPV) remains a good predictor of fluid responsiveness in the OR. However, PPV can be time-consuming to calculate (manual determination), is not always displayed on monitoring screens nor reliable through visual assessment and needs additional devices to be displayed. A new Android application (Captesia) automatically calculates the PPV utilizing a digital photograph of the arterial waveform from the monitor. The application determines the PPV by selecting peaks and troughs of the arterial curve.</detailed_description>
