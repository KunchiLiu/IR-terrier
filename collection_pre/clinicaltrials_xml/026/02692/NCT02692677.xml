	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of JNJ-42756493 in healthy male adult participants after administration of a single oral dose of 12 milligram (mg) of unlabeled JNJ-42756493 admixed with 14C JNJ-42756493.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Absorption, Metabolism, and Routes of Excretion Following Oral Administration of (14C) Radiolabeled JNJ--42756493 to Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single--center, open--label (The researchers and participants know the treatment the participant is receiving) study. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (35 days ), Open-label Treatment Phase (Day 1 up to Day 14 or 28)Í¾ and Follow-up (up to 30 days). Total duration of the study is approximately 79 to 93 days. Plasma and urine will be collected for determination of JNJ-42756493 concentrations. Participants will be primarily evaluated for absorption, the metabolic pathways and the excretion of JNJ-42756493. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
