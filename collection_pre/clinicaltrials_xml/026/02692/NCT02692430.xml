	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to perform a multicentre registry of cirrhotic patients who had been submitted to an imagining technique in recent years (angio-CT scan or abdominal MRI), in order to collect anatomical and clinical information. The main objective will be focused on the study of portosystemic shunts and their relation with portal hypertension. Patient with liver cirrhosis submitted to an abdominal angio-CT scan or a MRI from year 2010 to 2014 will be included in the study. The chosen imaging technique will be angio-CT preferably, but MRI data will also be available. Patients will be identified in every hospital by means of the registry of coded diagnoses and the lists of complementary tests performed. Clinical and radiological data of every patient will be collected. The clinical variables will be obtained from reviewing the patient clinical history. The radiological parameters will be gathered by means of the systematic review of the angio-CT or MRI.</brief_summary>
