	<brief_summary>Neutropenia is the most serious hematologic toxicity of cancer chemotherapy, often limiting the doses and density of chemotherapy that can be tolerated. The degree and duration of neutropenia determine the risk of infection. Myelo001, a small orally bioavailable molecule, has been shown in chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced myelosuppression to stimulate differentiation of peripheral white blood cells (WBC) and bone marrow cells of the leucocytic, lymphocytic, and erythrocytic lineage. The purpose of the MyeloConcept study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Myelo001 in preventing or reducing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and myelosuppression in patients receiving chemotherapy due to breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Phase IIa Study of Myelo001 in Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase IIa study, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, multi-center study. Each breast cancer patient will be randomly assigned into one of two treatment arms receiving either Myelo001 or placebo as a tablet. Investigational medicinal product is taken as supportive care for 23 consecutive days during chemotherapy treatment. Hematologic and safety parameters as well as actual begin and doses of following chemotherapy cycles will be assessed. A single primary variable will be analyzed with test statistics based on frequent absolute neutrophil measurements. Additionally, in a subgroup of patients biomarkers and pharmacokinetics of Myelo001 will be investigated.</detailed_description>
