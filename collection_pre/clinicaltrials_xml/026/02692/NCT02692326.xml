	<brief_summary>The aim of our study is to compare the incidence of PNAC in newborns receiving cyclic versus continuous parenteral nutrition (PN) in those newborns who need prolonged PN. The secondary aims are to compare incidence of sepsis and catheter related sepsis, mean length of hospital stay, mortality, nutritional status at two years of chronological age and predisposing factors to the development of parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis (PNAC) between the two groups, and to evaluate the adverse effects of the method of cycling used. This was a single-center, prospective randomized not blinded study was conducted in a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit from July 2010 to January 2015. Infants with hemodynamic instability until a stable situation, congenital hepatic disease, preterm infants with diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome or persistent ductus arteriosus and lack of authorization from the parents or guardians were excluded.</brief_summary>
