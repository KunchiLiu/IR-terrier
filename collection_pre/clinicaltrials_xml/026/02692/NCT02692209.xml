	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pivotal reader study is to assess the comparative accuracy of Fujifilm FFDM plus DBT versus FFDM alone in the detection of breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-Reader Multi-Case Pivotal Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety and effectiveness of FFDM + DBT are both linked to the ability of radiologists interpreting FFDM + DBT images to accurately diagnose breast cancer. Each study endpoint therefore addresses both safety and effectiveness.</detailed_description>
