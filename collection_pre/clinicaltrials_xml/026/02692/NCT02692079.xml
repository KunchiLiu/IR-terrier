	<brief_summary>This study investigates the effect of titanium-prepared platelet-rich fibrin (T-PRF) treatment on the angiogenic biomarkers in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in infrabony defects of patients with chronic periodontitis. In each patient, the infrabony defect of one side of arch was designated as control group (allograft), while the infrabony defect on the contralateral side of same arch was designated as test group (allograft+T-PRF).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Platelets are the cells initiating the wound healing and also supporting it by secreting various growth factors actively. These growth factors released by platelets act the increase of connective tissue healing, bone regeneration and repair, fibroblast mitogenesis, wound angiogenesis and the activation of macrophages by stimulating cell proliferation signals. Titanium-prepared, platelet-rich fibrin (T-PRF), is a new platelet concentrate, is formed in titanium tubes may be more efficient to activate platelets in comparison with glass tubes.The titanium tubes is utilized to refrain any inverse effects of glass tubes and also silica.</detailed_description>
