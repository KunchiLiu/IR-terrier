	<brief_summary>Background: Gravid diseases are complications in pregnancy. They include gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. These can cause problems with how a fetus grows. Being pregnant with twins can make complications more likely. Research suggests that changes in fetal soft tissue may be the earliest signs of growth problems. These tissue changes are in lean mass, fat mass, and organ size. 3D images might detect these changes earlier than 2D images. This could help manage gravid diseases. The NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons measured fetal growth for four racial groups, Caucasian, African American, Asian, and Hispanic. Fetuses of obese women and women with twins were also measured. 2D and 3D images were taken at various stages of pregnancy. Measurements were taken after birth. Researchers want to expand this study by measuring organ volumes and body composition by racial group and in twins. Objectives: To set standards for body composition and organ volumes by race. To understand the relationship between gravid diseases and changes in fetal body composition and organ volume over the course of pregnancy. To find out whether these are different for twins than for single pregnancies. Eligibility: Women who participated in the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons and Twins. Design: The data will come from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons and Twins. Researchers will review scans taken in the previous study. They will take measurements from the scans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fetal Body Composition and Volumes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) will conduct a research study entitled: "Fetal Body Composition and Volumes Study" to catalog and perform 2 Dimensional (2D) and 3 Dimensional (3D) measurement of the obstetrical ultrasound images in the existing bank of singleton and twin gestations collected from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. The research study aims to augment the singleton Study with organ volumes by racial group and to understand the relationship between gravid diseases and longitudinal changes in fetal body composition (subcutaneous fat, lean mass) and organ measurements (in singletons) over the course of pregnancy, thereby, complementing available data for the Cohort.</detailed_description>
