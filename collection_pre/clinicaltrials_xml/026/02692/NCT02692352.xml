	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to examine the effect of Goal Management Training for patients with executive difficulties after acquired brain injury in a randomized controlled trial. The effect on cognitive functioning will be examined, as will the relationship between treatment effects and lesion location and size. The effect of Goal Management training on regulating emotions, quality of life and coping will be examined. The generalizability of treatment effects across etiologies will be explored by comparing effects in three patient groups; traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular accidents and resected brain tumors. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans and measures of white matter connectivity will be used to establish detailed lesion descriptions. Functional MRI data will provide information on the neural underpinnings of treatment related change. A secondary objective is to expand the Goal Management Training protocol with increased focus on emotional regulation and adherence to homework assignment.</brief_summary>
