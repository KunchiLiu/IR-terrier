	<brief_summary>Epinephrine is the principal physiologic defense against hypoglycemia in type 1 and longer duration type 2 DM. Despite this, it is unknown how epinephrine regulates in-vivo endothelial function and atherothrombotic balance in humans. The specific aim of our study will be to determine the dose response effects of the key ANS counterregulatory hormone epinephrine on endothelial function, fibrinolytic balance and pro-atherogenic inflammatory mechanisms in healthy humans.</brief_summary>
