	<brief_summary>Systemic skeletal muscle atrophy (cachexia) is a typical side effect of chronic heart failure. Patients with cachexia can benefit from transcutaneous electrical neuromuscular stimulation (TENS). It is applied to strengthen the musculature and improve exercise tolerance and quality of life. It is unclear if application of TENS can cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) in patients with Optimizer速 pacemaker systems for improvement of heart failure. This pilot safety study enrolled 6 patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. All patients had an Optimizer速 pacemaker system implanted for a minimum of 6 months, no patients had any ventricular arrhythmic episode 3 months prior to the study, and all were in clinically stable condition and willing to participate in this study. Neuromuscular stimulation was administered via TENS in 4 different modes (HF, LF, Burst, MF) on the right and left musculus trapezius and on both musculi quadriceps femoris. All patients were tested for EMI without or with cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) delivery of the Optimizer速-system respectively.</brief_summary>
