	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Reactogenicity, Safety, and Immunogenicity of the Third Generation Hepatitis B Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Objectives: To explore the most effective dose of the third generation Hepatitis B vaccine through the evaluation of reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity. - Subjects: Adults having anti-HBs antibody titers less than 10 mIU/mL after 3 previous injections of the conventional Hepatitis B vaccine. - Study hypothesis: The third generation Hepatitis B vaccine, containing preS antigens in addition to S antigen, has an ability to elicit faster protection and higher antibody titers than the second generation Hepatitis B vaccine in the subjects.</detailed_description>
