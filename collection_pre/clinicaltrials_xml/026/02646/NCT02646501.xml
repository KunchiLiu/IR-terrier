	<brief_summary>The investigators will compare the effects of PSGB(percutaneous stellate ganglion block) in patients with recurrent sustained VT/VF in spite of appropriate medical therapy and cardio-version/ defibrillation after correction of underlying correctable factors with those without PSGB by prospective randomized trail. PSGB will be performed every 3 days by anesthesiology specialist after cardiologist's request, until the stabilization of VT/VF. We will compare the frequency and episode number of VT/VF, procedure related complication, acute and long-term mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial for Effect of Stellate Ganglion Block in Medically Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent ventricular tachycardia(VT)/ fibrillation(VF) increases mortality, especially in patients with structural heart disease. It has been reported that cardiac sympathectomy reduces VT/VF episodes in patients with complex VT, long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, or myocarditis. However, cardiac sympathectomy operation is hard to conduct in patients with hemodynamically unstable recurrent VT/VF or electrical storm. Therefore, we hypothesized that bed-side percutaneous stellate ganglion block (PSGB) reduces VT/VF episodes and mortality in patients with repetitive VT/VF who are properly managed with optimal medical therapies.</detailed_description>
