	<brief_summary>In an individual cancer patient extensive genetic and phenotypic variation exists between and within tumor lesions. Tumour load in NET patients can be measured with fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalaninepositron emission tomography (18F-DOPA-PET) scan. This aim of the study is to investigate heterogeneity between tumor lesions within patients with intestinal NET by determining the differences in tracer uptake measured on a 18F- DOPA-PET scan retrospectively.</brief_summary>
