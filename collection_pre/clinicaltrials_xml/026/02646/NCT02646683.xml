	<brief_summary>This multi-centre open label study will involve a minimum of 260 patients in 2 cohorts: 130 patients with 'early CD' defined as disease duration &lt; 24 months and no other treatments than corticosteroids and 130 patients with 'late CD' defined as active disease despite treatment with immunosuppressives and anti-TNF. Patients with intolerance to IS and anti-TNF will also be allowed in the latter group. Participants will be treated with 12 months of open label vedolizumab (study medication followed by commercial medication once reimbursement is available) and undergo monitoring of endoscopic, histological and clinical disease parameters. No randomization or blinding will be performed but the study management will ensure that recruitment in either study group is comparable for number and profile of patients (on/off steroids).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Efficacy, of Early Versus Late Use of Vedolizumab in Crohn's Disease: the LOVE-CD Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small bowel and colon. Symptoms commonly include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. There is no known cause or cure for CD. The aim of current CD treatments is to induce and maintain remission, to reduce the need of corticosteroids and avoid resections and fistulas. Treatment options include systemic and/or topical corticosteroids, purine analogues (6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine), anti-TNF antibodies and surgery. In 2013, results from the GEMINI II, phase 3, randomized controlled trial demonstrated the efficacy of vedolizumab (VDZ) in inducing and maintaining remission in adult patients with active CD. VDZ (MLN0002, or MLN02), inhibits the interaction between α4β7 integrin on memory T and B cells and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 expressed on the vascular endothelium of the gut and has been shown to be effective in both inducing and maintaining clinical remission in ulcerative colitis. The ideal positioning of vedolizumab in the therapeutic armamentarium for CD remains unknown. With other (anti-TNF) biologics, outcomes have usually been better if the treatment was started earlier in the disease course and if the patients had not been exposed to prior antibody treatments. Therefore, it appears appropriate and desirable to test the potency of vedolizumab in an earlier phase of CD. Indeed, also with vedolizumab patients previously exposed to biologics appear to have lower success rates with vedolizumab, so a position earlier in the disease course would most likely lead to better outcomes. This is an investigator-initiated open label study of VDZ therapy in 2 distinct populations of CD patients with active disease: 1. patients who have been diagnosed &lt; 2 years ago and who only been exposed to aminosalicylates and corticosteroids and 2. patients who have been exposed to immunomodulators and/or anti-TNF agents in addition to steroids and aminosalicylates.</detailed_description>

Moderately to severely active CD (CDAI 220450) with objective evidence of ulcerations visualized on endoscopy. 7. AntiTNF discontinued for at least 6 weeks GROUP 1 (EARLY CD): 8. Diagnosis of CD &lt; 24 months prior to enrollment 9. Demonstrated failure to respond to topical or systemic corticosteroids or intolerance to corticosteroids or: need for &gt; 2 courses of steroids since diagnosis or: steroid dependency at any dose since diagnosis GROUP 2 (LATE CD) 10. Demonstrated failure to respond to at least 3 months of thiopurines or intolerance to thiopurines and: failure to respond to at least 1 antiTNF or intolerance to antiTNF or loss of response to at least 1 antiTNF. 1. Prior treatment with vedolizumab. 2. Contraindication for endoscopy. 3. History of colonic dysplasia/cancer 4. Presence of stoma 5. Received other biologics within the last 6 weeks of screening 6.

Conditions which in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the study procedures. 11. Received any investigational drug in the past 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer. 12. Positive progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) subjective symptom checklist before enrollment. 13.
