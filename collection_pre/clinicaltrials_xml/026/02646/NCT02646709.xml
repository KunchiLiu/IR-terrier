	<brief_summary>Rocuronium is suitable for rapid induction within 60-90 seconds and its effect last 24-40 minute after single bolus injection. For outpatient surgery with short operation time, low dose rocuronium is frequently used for rapid recovery at the expense of compromised intubating condition. For better intubating condition, ketamine can be used. However, appropriate dose of ketamine with low dose rocuronium is not established yet. This study, 3 different doses of ketamine with low dose rocuronium will be compared for appropriate intubating condition.</brief_summary>
