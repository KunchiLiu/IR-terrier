	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial studies how well nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin works in treating patients with cancer that as has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced cancer) and that has an abnormality in a protein called mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Patients with this mutation are identified by genetic testing. Patients then receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin, which may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the mTOR enzyme, which is needed for cell growth and multiplication. Using treatments that target a patient's specific mutation may be a more effective treatment than the standard of care treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Rapamycin in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer With mTOR Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate efficacy of groups of patients defined by disease type, genomic aberration and treatment regimen. II. To assess the confirmed response rate of nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin (nab-rapamycin) in mTOR aberrant advanced cancers. (Sub-protocol Arm A) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate other clinical outcomes (e.g., progression-free and overall survival) of groups of patients defined by disease type, genomic aberration and treatment regimen. II. To describe the adverse event profile of each regimen. III. To assess the clinical benefit rate of nab-rapamycin in mTOR aberrant advanced cancers. (Sub-protocol Arm A). IV. To estimate progression-free survival (specifically at 6 months) and overall survival of these patients. (Sub-protocol Arm A) V. To estimate the adverse event profile of nab-rapamycin. (Sub-protocol Arm A) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptoms using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core (QLQ-C)30 in groups of patients defined by disease type and/or treatment regimen and to correlative HRQOL/symptoms with genomic markers. II. To assess the rate of individual mTOR pathway aberrations and assess the association between individual mTOR pathway aberrations and clinical outcome both across disease indications and within disease indications. (Sub-protocol Arm A) OUTLINE: Patients receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

Note: During the active monitoring phase of a study (i.e., active treatment), participants must be willing to return to the consenting institution for followup Life expectancy &gt;= 84 days (3 months) Identification of a drug target/targets through molecular profiling performed as a part of routine clinical care and treatment recommendation by the Mayo Clinic Genomics Tumor Board (GTB); NOTE: If profile matches more than 1 treatment arm, final decision for treatment arm assignment to be made by patients treating physician; it will be required for the genomic aberration to be identified through a test in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) workflow; assays used will range from single gene abnormalities (e.g. fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [ERBB2] amplifications) to next generation sequencing based gene panels (Foundation One®) to more comprehensive assays such as whole exome sequencing; the Mayo Clinic GTB will serve as the centralized point of data synthesis to allow for assessment of molecular profiling accomplished through a heterogeneous array of tests Date of Mayo Clinic Genomics Tumor Board review =&lt;
