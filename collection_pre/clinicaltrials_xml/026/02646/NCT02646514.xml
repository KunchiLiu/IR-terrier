	<brief_summary>Malignant obstructive jaundice is a common complication of advanced stage cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer. In biliary stricture by malignancy, biliary drainage with placement of self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) for palliation is the therapy of choice in these patients. When compared to plastic stents, SEMS present a significantly decreased risk of recurrent biliary obstruction. SEMS are also more cost-effective than plastic stents in patients with a life expectancy of longer than 4 months. However, despite their numerous benefits, SEMS become occluded in up to 50 % of patients in the first 6-8 months. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been used to treat malignancies of the liver since the early 1990s. Other studies have investigated its role in diseases of the colon and esophagus. More recently, this technique has been recognized for its potential in palliative treatment of malignant biliary strictures. RFA uses a high-frequency alternating current to generate heat and achieve coagulative necrosis when in contact with tissue. Within the bile duct, RFA appears to be safe and may result in decreased benign epithelial hyperplasia and tumor ingrowth. However, RFA along with placement of SEMS has not been well studied. On the other hand, newly developed RFA catheter (ELRA®) showed the feasibility and safety in south korea, recently. The purpose of this study was to investigate the Efficacy and safety of endobiliary RFA by using a novel RF catheter (ELRA®) on maintaining the patency of endobiliary metal drainage in patients with malignant biliary strictures.</brief_summary>
