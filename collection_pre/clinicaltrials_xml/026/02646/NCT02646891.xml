	<brief_summary>This is is a study of a parenteral trivalent rotavirus vaccine (P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine). The study will examine the safety and immunogenicity of three dose levels of this vaccine in healthy South African adults, toddlers and infants. Progression from one dose level to another and to the next age group population will be based on the assessment of safety information from the lowest dose and older age group. The primary safety hypothesis is that the P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine is safe and well-tolerated. The primary immunogenicity hypothesis is that the trivalent P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine is immunogenic in infant participants and will induce an immune response to at least 2 of the 3 strains in 60% or more of participants in at least one of the study groups.</brief_summary>
