	<brief_title>Reliability Study Using Electrodermal Activity to Measure Sensory Processing in Children With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This methodological research design is a prospective exploratory test-retest design assessing the use of electrodermal activity (EDA) as an index of sensory processing. EDA will be measured using skin conductance response (SCR). The purpose of this study is to investigate if using EDA is a reliable measure over time within the context of response to sensation. Scores from test one and test two of each subject will be correlated to determine reliability of EDA measure. Reliability in this context will establish the utility of EDA as an index of sensory processing. Testing will occur two times within a six week period.</detailed_description>
