	<brief_summary>This study is intended to investigate the effect of candesartan, a blood pressure medication, on cognitive function and thinking skills in those who have early or mild memory difficulties, also called mild cognitive impairment or MCI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Candesartan's Effects on Alzheimer's Disease And Related Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind placebo-control randomized clinical trial that compares candesartan to placebo in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who also have positive Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers. The investigators will assess if blocking the effect of Ang II, a crucial mediator of neuro-vascular injury, using angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) will address shortcomings of current treatment regimens. They will also assess the safety and dose-response of target engagement for treatment with escalating doses of candesartan in this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Mild Cognitive Impairment Evidence for Alzheimer's Disease Intolerance to ARBs Current use of ARBs, ACEI or antihypertensive medication that are used specifically for hypertensive therapy SBP less than 110 or greater than 140 mm Hg/ DBP less than 50 mm Hg or greater than 100 mm Hg; Renal disease (Creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl), hyperkalemia (K&gt;5.5 meq/dl), platelets&lt;50,000/Î¼l, or INR&gt;1.5. Active medical or psychiatric diseases that in the judgment of the investigator would affect the safety of the subject or scientific integrity of the study; Uncontrolled congestive heart failure reflected by poor exercise tolerance and shortness of breath; Diabetes mellitus; History of stroke in the past 3 years; Inability to perform the study procedures including LP, MRI (eg metal implants or cardiac pacemaker), or cognitive assessment; History of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or bleeding diathesis (from disease states or from use of anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin and related products, rivaroxaban or Xarelto, apixaban or Eliquis, edoxaban or Savaysa, dabigatran or Pradaxa ); Women of childbearing potential (nonmenopausal); In those who are unable to demonstrate that they understood the details of the study (ie lack of decisionalcapacity to consent), a study partner/surrogate who can sign on their behalf will be required, otherwise they will be excluded; Current use of Lithium, as candesartan may increase lithium concentration to toxic levels.</criteria>
