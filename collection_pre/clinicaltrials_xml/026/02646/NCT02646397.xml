	<brief_title>Benidipine and Hydrochlorothiazide in Fosinopril Treated Chronic Kidney Disease Patients With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic kidney dysfunction or injury which affected the health over three months were diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD).China has a high prevalence of CKD.The prevalence, awareness, and treatment of hypertension (HTN) in non-dialysis CKD patients were 67.3%,85.8%, and 81.0%, respectively. The renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) have been deeply confirmed to have apparent reno-protective effect in patients with CKD.Co-administration of diuretics and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) with ACEIs or ARBs are the most common combinations. Hydrochlorothiazide plus RASIs are another widely used combination according to the synergetic function of antihypertensive action and offset mutual adverse effects. Until now, no large scale studies have compared the effect of initial treatment with two different combinations of antihypertensive drugs in CKD patients on the progression of kidney disease in China. Studies in the subsets of CKD (diabetes and non-diabetes, micro-albuminuria and macro-albuminuria) are urgently needed.We aimed to conduct a large scale study to compare L/T-type CCB and diuretic on the basis of ACEI in CKD with HTN on renal progression of CKD in China.</detailed_description>
