	<brief_summary>The long-term goal of this research is to improve seizure control among patients with epilepsy, which has the potential to improve quality of life for thousands of people living with epilepsy and reduce health care utilization, social and economic costs, and epilepsy-related mortalities. Participants who are suffering from epilepsy will be randomized to receive usual care (UC), a smartphone-based self-management intervention called Management of Risks in Epilepsy (MORE), or MORE + telephone-based motivational interviewing (MI). Participants will be followed for 3 months.</brief_summary>
