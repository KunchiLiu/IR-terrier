	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of practice facilitation as a quality improvement strategy for implementing the Million Hearts' ABCS treatment guidelines for reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) among high-risk patients who receive care in primary care practices in New York City. The ABCS refer to the following: Aspirin in high-risk individuals (A), Blood pressure control and management (B), Cholesterol management (C), and Smoking cessation (S). The long-term goal is to create a robust infrastructure to disseminate and implement evidence based practice guidelines (EBPG) findings in primary care practices and improve practices' capacity to receive and implement other EBPG findings in the future.</brief_summary>

Similarly, patients with a diagnosis of hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia will have a documented ICD9 code for the targeted risk factor Smokers will be identified by a documented ICD9 code, prescription for a cessation medication in the last 12 months or documentation in the chart (e.g. meaningful use measure) during the last 12 months (see outcome measures)</criteria>
