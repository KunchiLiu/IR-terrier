	<brief_summary>Rocuronium results in burning pain on injection site. It can be reduced by local anesthetics or opioid, but still some patients, especially in children, show withdrawal movement for pain. This might resulted from individual pain sensitivity. Emergence agitation (EA) in children is quite frequent postoperatively and is known to be associated with postoperative pain. If a patient is susceptible to postoperative pain, he or she would have high probability of EA postoperatively. Therefore, the investigators explore the relation of withdrawal movement of rocuronium and EA.</brief_summary>
