	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the use of tolvaptan (commercial name Samsca) when given in addition to intravenous (IV) diuretics early during an episode of acute heart failure. It will be compared to a high dose of IV diuretics alone or the use of metolazone in addition to IV diuretics. The investigators are looking to see if there is improvement in the symptoms and outcomes of persons with acute heart failure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, randomized trial to assess the effects of 30 mg daily of tolvaptan when given concomitantly with home dose of diuretic (Lasix equivalent) intravenously (IV) versus 5mg daily of metolazone given concomitantly with home dose of diuretic (Lasix equivalent) IV, versus 2.5 times home dose of diuretic (Lasix equivalent) IV in participants hospitalized for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF).</detailed_description>
