	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the etonogestrel (ENG) + 17β-estradiol (E2) vaginal ring compared to placebo vaginal ring in the treatment of dysmenorrhea at Treatment Cycle 2. This study will also assess the safety and tolerability of the ENG-E2 vaginal rings over 4 treatment cycles. Primary hypothesis: Relative to the placebo ring, the ENG-E2 vaginal ring results in a greater proportion of participants with a ≥ 3 point reduction in peak pelvic pain score and no increase in the number of rescue pain relief (ibuprofen) tablets taken at Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to baseline.</brief_summary>
