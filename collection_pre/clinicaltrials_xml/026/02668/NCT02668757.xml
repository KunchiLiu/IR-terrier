	<brief_summary>The HeartHab study is a pilot trial in which coronary artery disease patients (n = 15-30) are given the HeartHab application. The HeartHab application is a smarthphone based mobile application that serves as a secondary prevention tool, to support cardiac patients after their phase II cardiac rehabilitation program. During study period (4-6 weeks), participating patients will be asked to use the application. HeartHab includes a module devoted to therapy compliance, one to exercise training prescription and one to risk factor control. HeartHab aims to motivate the patient to improve his/her self-management skills and hence decrease cardiovascular morbidity (and mortality). Motivational aspects and usability data will be collected during study period by means of app logs and/or questionnaires/interviews.</brief_summary>
