	<brief_title>Electromyographic Activity of Preterm Newborns Submitted to Hammock Positioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized clinical trial, according to CONSORT standards, with newborn preterm gestational age &lt;34 weeks and birth weight &lt;1500 g, admitted to the intensive care unit. Newborns will be randomized. Those selected for the control group (CG) will be placed in the incubator following the service routine. Babies in the intervention group (IG), will be positioned supine in a hammock in the incubator, with the appropriate postural adjustments. The evaluation of muscle activity will be carried out through surface electromyography. Evaluations shall be performed immediately before the intervention; immediately after 24 hours of intervention; and within 24 hours without intervention, in order to compare the values before and after the intervention of the two groups, as well as if the effects of the intervention are maintained after its removal.</detailed_description>
