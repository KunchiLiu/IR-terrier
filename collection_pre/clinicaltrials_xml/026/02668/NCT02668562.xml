	<brief_summary>Ticagrelor, a more potent P2Y12 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). It is increasingly used as a first line therapy in ACS. However, more potent P2Y12 inhibition has been associated with increased bleeding. This may be of particular concern for patients with ACS who require coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). In particular, the timing for cessation of ticagrelor before proceeding to CABG is unclear. RAPID TITRATE CABG is a randomized vanguard study to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary safety of a strategy of early versus delayed CABG in ACS patients initially treated with ticagrelor and to identify potential mechanisms underlying benefits or complications of early bypass surgery.</brief_summary>
