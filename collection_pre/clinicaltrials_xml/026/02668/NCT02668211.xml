	<brief_summary>MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this study to investigate the primary stability of its PROFEMUR® Preserve Femoral Components using radiostereometric analysis (RSA). RSA allows precise measurement of micromotion around orthopedic implants and hence, may estimate long-term fixation to bone.</brief_summary>
