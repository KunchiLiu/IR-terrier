	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether adjuvant radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients with positive margins or capsular penetration improves biochemical, overall and/or cancer specific survival and whether adjuvant radiotherapy is reasonably well tolerated when compared to watchful waiting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Radiation Therapy vs. Watchful Waiting Following Radical Prostatectomy in High Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study the investigators will evaluate adjuvant radiation therapy vs. watchful waiting in prostate cancer patients with positive margins or capsular penetration after radical prostatectomy. This is a randomized, open label, multicentre, collaborative study of FinnProstate Group and Finnish Radiation Oncology group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with pT3aN0M0 or pT2N0M0 prostate cancer with a positive margin, gleason score 210, preoperative PSA &lt; 20 ug/l, postoperative PSA &lt;0.5 ug/l after surgery (within 8 weeks), the WHO performance status 02, life expectancy at least 3 months, informed consent obtained. Other simultaneous cancer therapy including systemic endocrine therapy; more than 12 weeks has elapsed since surgery for prostate cancer; metastatic disease (N+ or M1); cancer invasion to the seminal vesicles; any other previous malignancy within the last 5 years except basalioma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; any contraindication to irradiation (severe locoregional infection, prior radiation therapy to the prostate/bladder); any physical or mental condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with patient's ability to comply with scheduled visits.</criteria>
