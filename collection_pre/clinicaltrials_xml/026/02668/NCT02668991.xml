	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine in Participants With Autism Spectrum Disorder and in a Normally Developing Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational study (in which participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes) to evaluate the utility of Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine (JAKE) in measuring clinical symptoms of ASD in children and adults with ASD. The study will consist of 3 cohorts of participants. For Cohort 1 and 2, there will be 14-day Screening phase and 8-week (Cohort 1) or 10 week (Cohort 2) data collection phase extending from Day 0 (Baseline) to Day 56 or Day 70, respectively. For Cohort 3, the study will consist of a screening visit and a single testing visit, which may be combined. Primarily, the usability of JAKE as a system to monitor clinical outcomes in ASD will be assessed. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
