	<brief_summary>Pneumoconiosis is a kind of lung disease due to inhalation of dust such as silica(common named Silicosis), coal and rock dust, characterized by inflammation, coughing, and fibrosis. Currently there is no effective drug treatment. The whole-lung lavage(WLL) can effectively clear the protein-like substances and inhaled dust deposited in the alveoli and bronchioles, as well as the pulmonary alveolar macrophage(PAM) and the resulting induced inflammation, fibrosis induced factor, serve to improve respiratory function, relieve symptoms of efficacy, but can't slow down or reverse the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. By taking large volume whole-lung lavage (WLL) as a conventional therapy, this study intends to observe and evaluate the safety and efficiency of combined large volume WLL with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation for treatment of Pneumoconiosis. Moreover, the immune regulation effect between large volume WLL and combined large volume WLL with MSC transplantation will also be preliminarily investigated and discussed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or female, 1870 years old. 2. Subjects had exposed to dusts with a long history. 3. Subjects with a clear clinical diagnosis to be silicotics or coal miners' pneumoconiosis patients. 4. Subjects with each detected index of pulmonary function test including FVC, FEV1 or MVV had exceeded 70% of the predicated value. 5. Subjects signed informed consent. 1. Women of childbearing age at the stage of pregnancy or lactation, or those without taking effective contraceptive measures. 2. Subjects with syphilis or HIV positive antibody. 3. Subjects with infection aggravated within the past month. 4. Subjects suffering from any of the following pulmonary diseases: active tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, multiple huge bullae, uncontrolled asthma, severe pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, AECOPD, severe and / or extremely severe COPD, etc.. 5. Subjects suffering from other serious diseases, such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cirrhosis, and acute glomerulonephritis. 6. Subjects suffering from other lifethreatening diseases with an estimated lifespan less than 2 years. 7. Subjects with leukopenia (WBC less than 4x109 / L) or agranulocytosis (WBC less than 1.5x109 / L or neutrophils less than 0.5x109 / L) caused by any reason. 8. Subjects with severe renal impairment, serum creatinine&gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. 9. Subjects with liver disease or liver damage: ALT, AST, total bilirubin&gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal 10. Subjects with a history of mental illness or suicide risk, with a history of epilepsy or other central nervous system disorders. 11. Subjects with severe arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, frequent superventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, etc.) or cardiac degree II or above conduction abnormalities displayed via 12lead ECG. 12. Subjects with a history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse. 13. Subjects accepted by any other clinical trials within 3 months before the enrollment. 14. Subjects with poor compliance, difficult to complete the study. 15. Any other conditions that might increase the risk of subjects or interfere with the clinical trial. 16. Subjects accepted large volume wholelung lavage treatment previously.</criteria>
