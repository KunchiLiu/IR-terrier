	<brief_summary>Based on the results of recent randomized controlled trials, current international guidelines recommend the initiation of endovascular treatment within 6 hours of symptom onset for acute ischemic stroke. Endovascular treatment may be beneficial in selected patients beyond 6 hour time window. In particular, treatment response to endovascular therapy may be greatly influenced by pretreatment collateral status. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether MRI-based collateral imaging (the Fast Analysis SysTem for COLLaterals, 'FAST-COLL') is feasible and can predict the response to endovascular treatment in a wide range of patients with acute ischemic stroke .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Acute ischemic stroke Age 20 years and older Disabling stroke defined as a baseline NIHSS &gt; 5 at the time of arrival Onset (lastseenwell) time to endovascular treatment time &lt; 12 hours Confirmed symptomatic intracranial occlusion, based on CT or MR angiography, at one or more of the following locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or M1MCA equivalent (2 or more M2MCAs) Signed informed consent or appropriate signed deferral of consent where approved Baseline noncontrast CT reveals a moderate/large core defined as extensive early ischemic changes of ASPECTS 05 in the territory of symptomatic intracranial occlusion. Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial occlusion is chronic Unable to undergo MRI (contraindicated or poor cooperation) Patient has a severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or followup or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient Pregnant females as determined by positive urine hCG test or lactating females</criteria>
