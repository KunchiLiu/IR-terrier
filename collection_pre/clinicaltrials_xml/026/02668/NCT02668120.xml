	<brief_summary>Background : Chronic histiocytic intervillositis is a rare placental disease linked with poor perinatal outcome. In a recent study, a major antenatal increased alkaline phosphatase was suspected in patients affected by chronic histiocytic intervillositis. This increase may correspond to the release of alkaline phosphatase by the syncytiotrophoblaste prejudiced in this pathology. Aim : To confirm the association between high levels of alkaline phosphatase and the occurrence of chronic histiocytic intervillositis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Single-center study of case-control comparing three groups of patients matched for gestational age at the time of sampling. The case group will be composed of patients who experienced chronic histiocytic intervillositis which an alkaline phosphatase assay is available during pregnancy (retrospective recruitment). Two control groups will be prospectively: The first will include patients whose pregnancy is low risk. The second will consist of pathological pregnancies (IUGR, Preeclampsia and Death In Utero). All patients will have a blood sample with determination of serum alkaline phosphatase activity and examination of the placenta at delivery.</detailed_description>
