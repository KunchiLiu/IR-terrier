	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, counterbalanced crossover design, in which 14 male subjects will complete two experimental trials. Each trial will be separated by a minimum of at least 12 days (range: 12-30 days). The study aims to investigate the effects of low glycogen availability on skeletal muscle molecular response after a concurrent exercise day.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Response After Concurrent Exercise With Low Glycogen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two experimental exercise trials; a low carbohydrate (= LOW) and a high carbohydrate (= HIGH) trial. During both experimental days subjects will complete an continues submaximal cycling bout in the morning followed by a resistance exercise session in the early afternoon. During the LOW trial subjects will receive a low carbohydrate mixed meal, during the HIGH trial subjects will be provided with a high carbohydrate meal. In addition, on both experimental days subjects will receive adequate protein beverages. Lastly, protein will be provided post resistance exercise.</detailed_description>
