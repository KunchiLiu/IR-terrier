	<brief_title>U/S Guided vs. Traditional Palpation for Radial Artery Cannulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arterial catheterization is often performed in critically ill patients for continuous hemodynamic monitoring and blood sampling. However, insertion of radial artery catheter with traditional palpation may be technically challenging, particularly in pediatric patients. There are few published studies on the use of ultrasound guidance for radial-artery catheter placement and mostly they were elective surgery children which received inhalation or deep sedative medication. Recently no setting published in pediatric intensive care unit.</detailed_description>
