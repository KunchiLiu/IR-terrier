	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to study the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injected via kinematic parameters in the treatment of unilateral/bilateral upper extremity tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) tremor. Kinematic assessment tools already developed in past clinical studies will be used in determining injection parameters. The objective is to study the composition of PD tremor using kinematic tools which may contribute to the knowledge of tremor complexity and contribute information that would benefit the development of injection parameters to improve efficacy and optimization of BoNT-A in tremor management. By injecting all bothersome tremulous upper limbs in Parkinson's disease patients, the investigators believe a greater improvement in Quality of Life on more daily tasks can be achieved compared to the investigator's earlier study in unilateral injections (REB#101749), which already showed significant improvement.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>PD individuals diagnosed by UK Brain Bank Criteria with stage H&amp;Y23 disease PD participants who are naïve to PD medications will be grouped into the "De novo" PD group PD participants stable on a low dose of Levodopa or on their PD medications for at least 3 months prior to their study enrolment will be grouped into the "Ldopa" PD group Participants who are botulinum toxin naïve for tremor management Patients will be screened for pregnancy by the physician Individuals with PD will be eligible for the study only if tremor is their primary and most bothersome symptom as determined by clinical exam and patient report denoting tremordominant phenotype Participants must be able to provide informed consent and to complete all study assessment scales and tasks.
