	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence of severe hypoxemia episodes during the intubation procedure with two methods of pre-oxygenation: 1. NIV (Non Invasive Ventilation) 2. HFNC (High-flow nasal canula oxygen therapy)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Pre-oxygenation of NIV and HFNC Therapy for Intubation of ICU Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Clinical randomized, open, multicenter, comparative trial, with parallel groups aimed at evaluating a medical device. Selection of patients admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, requiring endotracheal intubation. Randomized study, inclusion in two groups: NIV or HFNC. Experimental group: NHFC group, preoxygenation by NHFC: oxygen flow rate of 60 L / min and 100% FiO2. Control group: NIV group, preoxygenation by NIV: pressure support set for an exhaled tidal volume of 6-8 ml / kg of ideal body weight, PEEP of 5 cm H2O and FiO2 at 100%. Duration of participation of each patient: 28 days</detailed_description>
