	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of HEMOPATCHâ„¢ Sealing Hemostat in reducing the incidence and duration of air leaks after lung resection compared to standard techniques. Hypothesis: "The routine application of HEMOPATCH Sealing Hemostat on the visceral pleura in lung resection areas, during lung resection procedures, is more EFFICIENT to reduce the incidence and duration of prolonged air leaks as compared to standard surgical measures."</brief_summary>
