	<detailed_description>In the last decade, front-line chemotherapy has been considered a standard therapeutic regimen for the extension of survival time in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (mGC). New evidence suggests that salvage chemo-therapies, as second-line treatments, may have a survival advantage when compared with best supportive care. After failure of second-line chemotherapy, the results of further treatment are poor, yielding response rates of 0% to 5% with no evidence of prolonged survival. Apatinib is a small-molecule VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Had been approved by the CFDA for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, However, this study defines a variety of inclusion/exclusion criteria, efficacy and safety are not well reflect in the real world for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. Therefore, an Open Label, Prospective, Multicentre, Non-interventional Study could evaluate the safety and efficacy of apatinib for Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer in the real world.</detailed_description>
