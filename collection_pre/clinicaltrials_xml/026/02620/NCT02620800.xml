	<brief_title>Study of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), Nab®1-paclitaxel, Bevacizumab, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase 1 portion of the study is an open-label study enrolling subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have not previously received systemic chemotherapy at any time as treatment for pancreatic cancer (including adjuvant chemotherapy), except low dose chemotherapy administered as a radiosensitizer concomitant with radiotherapy and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of metronomic 5-FU in combination with nab-paclitaxel, bevacizumab, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subjects will be enrolled in cohorts of 6 subjects. There will be no dose escalation. Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed in cycle 1. If there is an incidence of ≥2 of 6 subjects experiencing a DLT, the dose will be de-escalated to the next lower dose. Based on the totality of the data, the investigators may advise the Sponsor to evaluate additional subjects at any of the dose levels. Upon Sponsor agreement, if additional subjects are enrolled at any dose level, DLT evaluation will occur at that same ratio (if ≥ 4 of 12 subjects, or ≥ 6 of 18 subjects experience a DLT, the dose will be de-escalated). Approximately 12-24 subjects will be enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study, dependent on the number of dose levels examined and the number of subjects enrolled at each dose level. Safety will continuously be evaluated by incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and severity according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03 (v4.03). The Phase 2 part of the study is to determine if the combination of metronomic 5-FU, nab-paclitaxel, bevacizumab, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin at the RP2D defined in Phase 1 achieves a clinically meaningful improvement in 1 year survival rate over the historical control. Approximately 60 subjects are planned to be enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study. Subjects may remain on treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, physician decision, or death. The anticipated duration of the study (including Phase 1, Phase 2 and follow-up) is approximately 4 years.

Male or female subject is between 18 and 65 years of age at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF). 2. Subject has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 3. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 01. 4. Subject has one or more tumors measurable by CT scan (or (MRI), if allergic to CT contrast media) as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. 5. Subject has the following blood counts / Hemoglobin (Hgb) at screening: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L; Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 (100 × 10^9/L); Hgb ≥ LLN or 10 g/dL. 6.
