	<brief_summary>The researchers hope to learn if yoga complementary therapy would improve health-related quality of life, recovery of urinary continence and erectile function in patients who underwent prostate cancer surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy). We hypothesized that in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, preoperative and postoperative Yoga complementary therapy would improve health- related quality of life (HRQOL), recovery of urinary continence and erectile function. This two-arm, randomized controlled pilot study will compare Yoga intervention to usual care group. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of Yoga complementary therapy on HRQOL in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Yoga therapy will be given to the intervention group three times in a week for 6 weeks prior to surgery and then initiated 3 weeks after the surgery for another 6 weeks. The yoga exercise will be tailored to the participant's comfort level. As an exploratory analysis, we will evaluate pro-inflammatory and immunological markers.</brief_summary>
