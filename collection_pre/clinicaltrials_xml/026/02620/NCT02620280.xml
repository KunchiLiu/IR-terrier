	<brief_summary>This study that aims to evaluate the addition of MPDL3280A (atezolizumab) to carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced triple negative breast cancer. compared to the control arm of carboplatin and abraxane. Half of participants will receive MPDL3280A in combination with carboplatin and abraxane, while the other half will receive only carboplatin and abraxane.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Therapy in TRIPle Negative Breast Cancer With antiPDL1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emerging evidence shows that many breast cancers with triple negative and basal like features have infiltration by mononuclear cells and lymphocytes. Irrespective of the entity of tumor infiltration by mononuclear cells, expression of immune regulatory checkpoints such as PD-1 and its ligand B7-H1 (or PD-L1) negatively affect the results of treatments. These data suggest that a subset of patients have an ongoing immune response within the tumor micro-environment, and that PD-L1 expression is an adaptive method of tumor resistance to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, which in turn are needed for response to chemotherapy. Overall, the data suggests a role for immune regulation of response to chemotherapy, and support the concept that blockade of immune check-points may favor the achievement of durable response by immune mechanisms themselves, and in combination with classical chemotherapy. MPDL3280A (atezolizumab) is a human monoclonal antibody containing an engineered Fc-domain to optimize efficacy and safety that targets PD-L1 and blocks binding of its receptors, including PD-1 and B7.1. Based on these considerations, we plan to conduct a study of the combination of abraxane and carboplatin with or without PDL1-directed antibody in women with locally advanced breast cancer suitable for neoadjuvant therapy with the aim to improve event-free survival</detailed_description>
