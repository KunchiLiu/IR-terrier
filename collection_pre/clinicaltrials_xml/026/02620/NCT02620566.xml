	<brief_summary>To our knowledge there is still no study comparing the local wound infiltration by itself without ilio-inguinal and ilio-hypogastric nerve block and caudal anesthesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate anesthesia and recovery profile in pediatric patients after inguinal hernia repair with caudal block (CB) or local wound infiltration (LWI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Caudal Block vs Local Wound Infiltration for Hernia Repair in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total of 80 children aged 6 month to 7 years of ASA physical status I or II, undergoing unilateral hernia repair will be enroled in the study. One group will receive caudal block (CB) and the other group will receive local wound infiltration (LWI). Group CB will receive 1ml kg 0,25% bupivacaine and group LWI will receive 0,2 ml kg 0,25% bupivacaine. Data taken will than be analyzed and interpreted. Postoperative pain will be assess using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS, 0-10)(8) and the Faces Legs Activity Cry Consolability tool (FLACC, 0-10)(9) at 30 min and 1, 2, and 3 h after operation. The time to first supplemental oral acetaminophen demand (first acetaminophen time) was defined as the time from the end of surgery to the first registration of more than 4 on both CHEOPS and FLACC by the investigator. Twenty-four hours after surgery, reports of delayed side-effects and demands for rescue acetaminophen from the child will be gathered. The investigator, who will be blind to the treatment group, will document these data with the medical records.</detailed_description>
