	<brief_title>Does Use of Topical Lidocaine in EGD Reduce Amount of IV Midazolam and Fentanyl Required and Shorten Recovery Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a double blinded randomized placebo controlled trial Patients between 18 and 89 years old who are scheduled for EGD may be eligible to enroll in the study. Potential subjects will be sought through referral by their treating attending and fellow gastroenterologist, who will be apprised of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients possibly meeting inclusive and exclusive criteria will be approached and discussed the study further with the investigators. Those expressing a desire to participate in the study will be given written informed consent prior to participation. The investigators will enroll patients into the study with a goal of at least 53 patients in each group which is the number of patients our statistician recommended to appropriately power our study. Patients who consent to enroll in the study will be randomized into 2 groups. Group 1: Swish and swallow 10ml of 2% lidocaine solution Group 2: Swish and swallow 10ml of 0.45% sodium chloride solution The patients will then undergo endoscopy for the indication identified in their clinic appointment. Following the procedure, patients will be taken to the recovery area and recovered per clinic protocol. The endoscopist will complete a satisfaction questionnaire. The day following the procedure a nurse will call to check for post-operative complications per clinic protocol. The day following, an investigator will also call to perform a patient satisfaction survey..</detailed_description>
