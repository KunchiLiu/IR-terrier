	<brief_summary>Background: Neurobehavioral functions and quality of life (QoL) are the important outcome measurements after radiotherapy in patients with brain tumors and even head/neck cancers. However, few studies have focused on neurobehavioral functions and QoL after anti-cancer treatment particularly brain radiotherapy for pediatric/adolescent patients with brain tumors. This study thus aims to prospectively evaluate those functions in pediatric or adolescent patients with brain or head/neck tumors in order to provide useful information about their clinical outcomes. Methods: A total of 72 pediatric/adolescent patients, who are diagnosed with brain tumors or head/neck cancers, were prospectively recruited. Neurobehavioral functions will be evaluated using a neuropsychological battery, which includes general cognitive functions, intelligence, memory, executive functions, information processing and emotional/behavioral expressions. The QoL will be evaluated by the health-related QoL questionnaire. All participants will be examined at six phases, which include pre-treatment, 1-month post-treatment, 4-month post-treatment, 1-year post-treatment, 2-year post-treatment and 3-year post-treatment. Expected results: Patients'neurobehavioral functions and QoL will show significant improvement after treatment, and the improvement will not be diminished across each post-treatment phase.</brief_summary>
