	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to discover how 18F-cholineFCH distributes in the body, and see if it can distinguish active histiocytes (tumor) from inflammatory (non- tumor) cells. This tracer has the potential to give the investigators' team more information when trying to identify the tumor cells that are most important to collect with biopsy. In addition, the study will measure levels of 18F-cholineFCH in the biopsy tissue.</brief_summary>
