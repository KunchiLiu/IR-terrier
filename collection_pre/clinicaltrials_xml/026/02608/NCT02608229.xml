	<brief_summary>In light of the central role of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in pancreatic cancer, the investigators propose a phase I study to evaluate the ERK inhibitor BVD-523 at the recommended phase 2 dose in combination with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoint will be maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or RP2D and safety. The secondary endpoints include safety, response rate, biochemical response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The exploratory endpoints include the assessing the impact of BVD-523 on the MEK/ERK pathway and other major pathway pertain to pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). Current use or anticipated need for alternative, holistic, naturopathic, or botanical formulations used for the purpose of cancer treatment. A history of other malignancy with the exception of those treated with curative intent with no evidence of disease for 2 years. Currently receiving any other investigational agents. Known brain metastases or CNS involvement. Significant ascites that require therapeutic paracentesis. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to BVD523, gemcitabine, nabpaclitaxel, or other agents used in the study. Neuropathy ≥ grade 1. History or current evidence/risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy (CSR). History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Concurrent therapy with drugs known to be strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, or strong inducers of CYP3A4 (see Appendix B). Gastrointestinal condition which could impair absorption of BVD523 or inability to ingest BVD523. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry. Known HIVpositivity.</criteria>
