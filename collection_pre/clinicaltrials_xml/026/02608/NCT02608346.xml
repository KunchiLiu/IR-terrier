	<brief_summary>BRCA1 carriers who are at high risk of developing either a relapse and/or a new cancer growth will be included. These patients will be followed up during 30 months (2,5 years) with mutated TP53 mutation detection or during 42 months (3,5 years) with mutated TP53 mutation detection and circulating tumor cells detection (CTC) performed at each hospital visit (for technical reason only patients included at Institut Curie will be proposed to participate to the CTC substudy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Circulating Tumor DNA and Follow-up of BRCA1 Mutation Carriers (CirCa 01)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Patient with no evidence of any invasive tumor mass at inclusion (clinical and, if any, radiological exams) 2. Carriers of known germline BRCA1 deleterious mutation (a personal history of cancer is NOT mandatory). 3. Age ≥ 30 years for patient with personal previous history of cancer 4. Age ≥ 40 years for patient without personal previous history of cancer 5. Patient who a followup visit is scheduled in the including center at least once a year 6. Patient having health care insurance 7. Signed informed consent by patient 1. Patient presenting with invasive tumor masses (e.g. stage IV cancer or localized cancer not yet surgically removed) 2. Carriers of germline BRCA1 variant of unknown significance 3. Carriers of germline BRCA2 deleterious mutation or variant 4. Individuals with a low risk of BRCA1related tumor growth, i.e. women who underwent prophylactic bilateral mastectomy AND adnexectomy. 5. Any medical or other condition that in the Investigator's opinion rendered the patient unsuitable for this study 6. Patient deprived from ability to decide on her own. 7. Patient unable to have a regular follow up for geographical, social or psychological reasons.</criteria>
