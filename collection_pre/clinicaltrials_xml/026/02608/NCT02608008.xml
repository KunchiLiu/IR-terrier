	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of EchoNavigator System Release II During Structural Heart Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EchoNavigator System Release II is a CE certified innovative periinterventional imaging modality used in our clinic of cardiology, pulmonology and angiology during structural heart interventions like transfemoral aortic valve Implantation (TAVI), MitraClip implantation, patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect (ASD) and left atrial appendage (LAA). During this interventions EchoNavigator is able to combine live X-ray Images and 3D Echo guidance to enhance the efficiency of the procedure. Specific periprocedural data parameter, e.g. procedure duration, radiation time, radiation dose, transseptal punction time (e.g.LAA) and contrast agent amount will be collected and analysed. The same data characteristics from the same procedures but without the periinterventional use of the EchoNavigator System Release II will be collected, analysed and compared with the data described above. Both, a retrospective data collection between 2014 - 2016 and a prospective data collection with the same parameter characteristics of n=200 patients will be conducted.</detailed_description>
