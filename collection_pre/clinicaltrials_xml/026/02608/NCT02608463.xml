	<brief_summary>Neuropathic pain is a common pain disorder that is caused by problems in the nervous system. It affects more women than men and commonly occurs in pregnancy. Physicians have little information to guide their treatment of neuropathic pain in pregnancy. The overall goal of this study is to define the course, management, and pregnancy outcomes of neuropathic pain in pregnancy and the acute postpartum period. It is difficult to manage neuropathic pain in pregnancy as treatment options must minimize their risk to the unborn child as they have a direct effect on infant outcomes through their exposure in utero. Thus, other treatments are needed. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be an acceptable alternative to medications. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses a magnetic force to change the way nerves work in the brain. This non-invasive and localized mechanism of action makes it attractive for use in special populations, such as pregnancy. This will be the first study to investigate the use of rTMS in the treatment of neuropathic pain in pregnancy. This study will enroll 60 pregnant subjects between the ages of 18 and 45. Participation in the study will last about 15 months with study visits about once a month. All participants will receive treatment as usual. Subjects diagnosed with neuropathic pain will be offered rTMS as a treatment option.</brief_summary>
