	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to test whether a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, compared with a sulfonylurea, improves time in normal blood glucose range and reduces blood glucose variability. Blood glucose is measured using a continuous glucose monitoring device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring to Assess Glycemia in Chronic Kidney Disease - Changing Glucose Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a proof-of-concept clinical trial testing the effects of linagliptin versus glipizide on glucose variability among people with type 2 diabetes and stage 3-4 CKD. In a cross-over design, each enrolled participant will receive 28 days of each study medication. Study medications will be provided in a randomly assigned order without blinding. The primary study outcome is glucose time in range, measured by blinded continuous glucose monitoring for the last 6 days of each 28-day treatment period. Secondary outcomes include indices of glycemic variability, hypoglycemia, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and albuminuria. The overall goal of this research is to identify safe and effective treatments to control glycemia among patients with diabetes and CKD.</detailed_description>
