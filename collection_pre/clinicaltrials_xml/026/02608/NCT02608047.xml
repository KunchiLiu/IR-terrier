	<brief_title>Studies on the Pathogen, Vector Control and Clinical Treatment of Dengue Fever in Guangzhou</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To study the epidemiological and pathogenic of dengue virus in Guangzhou, which help to reveal the regular prevalent pattern and the natural epidemic focus of dengue fever. To establish dengue virus sequence database of Guangzhou region, research the biological characteristics and molecular characteristics of dengue fever epidemic strains especially in 2014 in Guangzhou region, to determine the source and variation of this epidemic strains , which finally help to reveal the cause of the pandemic. To investigate the serum epidemiology of 7800 large groups of people in 12 county-level cities in Guangzhou by stratified random sampling method. It will enrich the research database of the dengue fever serological antibody level survey of people in Guangzhou. After that the investigators could provide a scientific reference for setting up a risk evaluation and implementation of targeted control measures, and also provide reference for analysis of the epidemic situation in other areas. To study on molecular markers predictive of severe dengue fever and protective immunity after dengue virus infection. The investigators will obtain both serotype-specific and cross-reactive antibodies, which is highly protective neutralizing antibodies. Then the investigators will explore the potential for clinical application about these neutralizing antibodies. The dengue virus were sequenced which caused dengue fever or severe dengue fever in 2014, and do bioinformatics analysis to find the genetic loci which may be responsible for virulence of dengue virus. To sum up the clinical and laboratory data of dengue fever in 2014, to carry out the research on the diagnosis and treatment of dengue fever, to explore the effectiveness, safety and mechanism of Integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment for dengue fever patientsï¼Œto establish of a more perfect system for the diagnosis and treatment of dengue fever in China.</detailed_description>
