	<brief_summary>An observational study to derive clinically relevant and predictive rib fracture classification systems, based on retrospective and prospective cohorts, incorporating assessment of PROMs (Patient Reported Outcome Measures) and healthcare utilisation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sheffield Multiple Rib Fractures Study:</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to derive radiology-based classifications of rib fractures and to test whether such classifications have a value in the prediction of clinical outcomes and patient reported outcome measures. The first aspect of work is to analyse existing radiology investigations (plain chest radiography (CXR) and derive classifications of rib fractures that, in the retrospective cohort of operated and non-operated cases, could have potential value in the guidance of management and prediction of clinical outcomes. The second aspect will be to evaluate the feasibility of collection of Patient Reported Outcome Measures in patients suffering multiple rib fractures, which will be used to assess the impact of the radiological classifications. The indications for surgery will remain according to current clinical practice and the management algorithms that have been developed previously in the department.</detailed_description>
