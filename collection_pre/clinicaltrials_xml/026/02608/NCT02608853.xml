	<criteria>All Cohort Members: Members of each of the cohorts must have at least 12 months of baseline coverage within Humedica prior to the patients' index date (cohort specific index dates are defined below). Within Humedica, baseline coverage will be defined as the date from the earliest observed encounter up to and including the index date. Patients must have at least 1 diagnosis of T2DM (250.X0 or 250.X2) prior to and including the date of the qualifying prescription, no prior diagnosis (inclusive of the index date) of T1DM (250.X1 or 250.X3) and no diagnosis of gestational diabetes within the previous 12 months (inclusive of the index date). Patients will not be eligible for inclusion if they have prior prescriptions for GLP1 analogues (including liraglutide and exenatide) during the interval that would be considered the baseline period Liraglutidelike Cohort: To be eligible for inclusion in the Liraglutidelike Cohort, patients must have at least one qualifying prescription for an OAD. Qualifying OADs will be specified that share similar labelled or unlabelled indications as liraglutide LEADER™like Cohort: To be eligible for inclusion in the LEADERTMlike Cohort, patients must meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Patients will be eligible for inclusion after meeting the overall inclusion and exclusion criteria in addition to the following: Ages 50 and over. HbA1c at least 7% Patients will be excluded from the LEADER™like Cohort if any of the following are observed prior to meeting the inclusion criteria defined above: Calcitonin &gt;= 50ng/L. Baseline DPP4 or pramlintide. Chronic heart failure diagnosis, NYHA Class IV. Acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 14 days prior to initiation. Current continuous renal replacement therapy. Endstage liver disease. Solid organ transplant. Malignant neoplasm</criteria>
