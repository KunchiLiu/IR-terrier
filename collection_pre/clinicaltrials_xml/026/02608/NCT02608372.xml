	<brief_summary>The project is a randomized, 3-way, blinded crossover trial in which 20 healthy, fasted participants consume meals with 30 g of a linear corn starch and 5 g of one of the seaweeds, Laminara digitata or Undaria pinnatifida or a pea protein control. The primary aim is to investigate whether the brown seaweeds affect the postprandial glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC). Stomach emptying, insulin, C-peptide, appetite-regulating hormones (oxyntomodulin, glucagon, GLP-1 and PYY), and specific metabolites from the seaweeds in the urine and plasma as well as subjective satiety are also analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brown Seaweeds Effect on Glucose Tolerance and Appetite Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brown seaweeds may contain bioactive compounds as they contain secondary plant metabolites, including flavonoids and other phenolic compounds as well as carotenoids. Dietary fibre is the major component of brown seaweeds, mainly composed from laminarans, alginates, fucans and cellulose. Several dietary fibers and secondary plant metabolites have been shown to have an impact on health and more specifically on glycemic control. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether two selected brown seaweeds have an effect on the postprandial glucose response to a starch load as well as several secondary measures, including appetite responses. In a controlled crossover trial, 20 healthy fasted participants consumed 5 g of either Laminaria digitata (LD) or Undaria pinnatifida (UP) or 1 g of pea protein (CTR). The volunteers concomitantly ingested 200 mL of a drink with corn starch. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, as well as 20, 40, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after the meal. Differences in glucose, insulin, C-peptide, plasma incretin concentrations, and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were analyzed and appetite was scored by a visual analogue scale and a subsequent ad libitum test meal.</detailed_description>
