	<criteria>Histologically documented advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Phase IIb part (including dose ranging part): Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with measurable or nonmeasurable disease as determined by RECIST v1.1, who have progressed despite standard therapy or are intolerant of standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists and who did not receive prior antiPD1/PDL1 treatment. Phase II part (MBG453 single agent): Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors in the indication in which at least one confirmed PR or CR was seen during the dose escalation phase I part. Patients must have measurable disease as determined by RECIST v1.1, have progressed despite standard therapy or be intolerant to standard therapy. Phase II part (MBG453 in combination PDR001): Patients with advanced/metastatic tumors in the below selected indications, with at least one measurable lesion as determined by RECIST v1.1, who have received standard therapy and are intolerant of standard therapy or have progressed following their last prior therapy.: Melanoma (antiPD1/PDL1 therapy naïve or pretreated) Non small cell lung cancer (antiPD1/PDL1 therapy naïve or pretreated) Renal Cell Carcinoma (antiPD1/PDL1 therapy naïve or pretreated) Must have a site of disease amenable to biopsy, and be a candidate for tumor biopsy according to the treating institution's guidelines. Patient must be willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy at screening/baseline, and during therapy on the study. Presence of symptomatic central nervous system metastases. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies. Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis B Virus or Hepatitis C Virus infection. Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease or any condition that requires systemic steroids. Systemic steroid therapy or any immunosuppressive therapy (≥10mg/day prednisone or equivalent). Use of any vaccines against infectious diseases (e.g. varicella, pneumococcus) within 4 weeks of initiation of study treatment. Pretreatment with antiCTLA4 antibodies in combination with any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathway. Participation in an interventional, investigational nonimmunotherapy study within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment. Prior participation in an interventional, investigational cancer vaccine or immunotherapy study except for an antiPD1/PDL1 study. Other inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
