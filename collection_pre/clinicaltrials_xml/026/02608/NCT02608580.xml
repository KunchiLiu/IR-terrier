	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease is a genetic disease responsible for an abnormal hemoglobin.The anomaly has several consequences: a low hemoglobin rate (chronic anemia), plugs formed by red blood cells in blood vessels (extremely painful vaso-occlusive crises) and greater susceptibility to infections. Patients with this disease should be monitored medically continuously from birth. At adulthood, they will pass from a pediatric medical care system to an adult medical care system.This transition can be experienced with more or less ease, depending on the organization within the pediatric and adult hospitals. This questionnaire aims to assess the quality of the transition between pediatric and adult services.The investigators want to better estimate hospital work and improve the quality of care for this type of patients, throughout their entire medical history.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease is a genetic disease responsible for an abnormal hemoglobin. It particularly affects populations with an African ascent (300 000 African children are born every year with this genetic anomaly). The anomaly has several consequences: a low hemoglobin rate (chronic anemia), plugs formed by red blood cells in blood vessels (extremely painful vaso-occlusive crises) and greater susceptibility to infections. The severity of sickle cell disease is variable among children. Some develop frequent and serious complications, while others don't. A child with sickle cell disease is hospitalized about a week a year in average (for a painful crisis, infection or worsening of anemia). Patients with this disease should be monitored medically continuously from birth. At adulthood, they will pass from a pediatric medical care system to an adult medical care system.This transition can be experienced with more or less ease, depending on the organization within the pediatric and adult hospitals. This questionnaire aims to assess the quality of the transition between pediatric and adult services.The investigators want to better estimate hospital work and improve the quality of care for this type of patients throughout their entire medical history.</detailed_description>
