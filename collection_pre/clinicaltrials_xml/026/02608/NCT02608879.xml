	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a novel oral care protocol on the severity and pain of oral mucositis in patients receiving radiation and/or chemotherapy for head and neck cancers. The secondary objectives are to characterize the microbiome associated with oral mucositis, measure salivary proinflammatory cytokines, and evaluate other clinical indicators of the intervention. Participants will be enrolled prior to beginning radiation and/or chemotherapy, and will be randomized to receive either the oral health protocol or standard of care oral hygiene.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Care Protocol for the Management of Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy-Induced Oral Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis (OM) is one of the most debilitating adverse effects in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy or radiation (RT). Currently, there are no effective therapies or prevention for mucositis, while several clinical studies have suggested that professional oral care could effectively reduce the severity of Radiation Therapy or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Palliative treatment, rather than preventive or curative measures, remains the standard of care. Evidence-based guidelines do not provide consistent recommendations for the prevention, treatment and management of oral mucositis. The investigators hypothesize that a monitored regimen of professional oral hygiene prevents harmful ecological shifts in the oral cavity, improve oral health and reduce the duration and severity of Oral Mucositis in cancer patients, consequently improving their overall quality of life during treatment. Moreover, the investigators hypothesize that the weekly oral hygiene regimen performed by an oral health professional is more effective in treating and preventing mucositis than current standard-of-care treatments. The principal investigator of this project has developed a novel oral care regimen protocol for the treatment of oral mucositis. The "Oral Mucosa Deterging and Periodontal Debridement" (OMDP) protocol consists of a regimen of frequent professional oral prophylaxis including tooth cleaning, tooth polishing and flossing, and the debridement of the periodontium and deterging of the oral mucosa. This is an intervention that is implemented prior to and maintained throughout the entire cycle of the radiation or chemoradiation. Co-adjuvant treatments such as intense fluoride treatments, oral hygiene instructions and palliative mouth-rinses are also part of the protocol. The hypothesis is that repeated professional prophylaxis of the oral cavity would protect the healthy oral tissue against infection and inflammation often associated with severe cases of mucositis, and consequently reduces mucositis incidence and duration. Participants in this study would attend approximately 9 study visits over the course of 16-18 weeks, depending on their specific cancer treatment plan. Study participants will be randomized to receive either the oral health protocol, which they will receive on a weekly basis, or standard of care oral hygiene instructions and tooth brushing, preformed on a bi-weekly basis.</detailed_description>
