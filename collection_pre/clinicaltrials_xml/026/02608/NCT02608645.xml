In this study, within the secondary prevention group patients ( diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, who have had events atherosclerotic cerebrovascular ) , statin use requirement , patients compliance and reaching target LDL-cholesterol levels (according to European guidelines ) will be evaluated. The investigators' aim is to determine the role of education and knowledge in reaching target LDL cholesterol levels in these patients. İn addition , the investigators want to emphasize in high-risk patients who are receiving or not receiving cholesterol-lowering treatment what is their target values , (LDL &lt; 100 mg / dL and high -risk patients with LDL &lt; 70 mg / dL in very high-risk patients ) and to determine what is the rate of patients and to the importance of reaching their target cholesterol levels. İn addition ,to evaluate the patients habits of the using statin dose .After screening , physician treatment decisions and reasons will be documented.</detailed_description>
