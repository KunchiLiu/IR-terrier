	<brief_summary>Cellular immunity can be changed after surgery and anesthesia. Tissue injury by surgical procedures significantly reduces the immune function in proportion to the degree of tissue injury. In addition, the use of opioids as analgesics during the perioperative period depress cellular immunity, in particular the activity of the natural killer (NK) cells. This perioperative immunosuppression may cause deleterious consequences on postoperative outcome in cancer patients. The aim of this study is to confirm the presence or extent of the change of NK cell activity between before and after head and neck surgery. Additionally, investigators will identify the clinical or genetic factors related to the change of NK cell activity.</brief_summary>
