	<brief_title>FLOT vs. FLOT/Ramucirumab for Perioperative Therapy of Gastric or GEJ Cancer (RAMSES)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study including patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach and GEJ scheduled to receive perioperative chemotherapy. The scope of the phase II portion of the trial is to evaluate pathological response rates of either regimen assessed by a centralized pathology and evaluate safety and tolerability. Patients with locally advanced esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (i.e. cT2 any N or any T N-positive) with exclusion of distant metastases will be included in this trial. Patients will be centrally reviewed and then stratified by tumor site (GEJ vs. gastric), histological type (intestinal vs. diffuse/mixed or unknown) and clinical stage (T1/2 vs. T3/4 and/or N+) and randomized 1:1 to receive either FLOT (Arm A) or FLOT/ramucirumab (Arm B). Arm A (FLOT) Patients randomized to Arm A will receive 4 pre-operative cycles (8 weeks) of biweekly FLOT (Docetaxel 50 mg/m² in 250 ml NaCl 0.9%, iv over 1 h; Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² in 500 ml G5%, iv over 2h; Leucovorin 200 mg/m² in 250 ml NaCl 0.9%, iv over 30 min; 5-FU 2600 mg/m², iv over 24 h, q2wk) of the preoperative treatment phase. Surgery in Arm A is planned to occur 4 to 6 weeks after d1 of last FLOT. Patients will receive 4 additional post-operative cycles (8 weeks) of FLOT in the post-operative treatment phase. Post-operative treatment should start 6 to 8 weeks, but at maximum 12 weeks after surgery. Arm B (FLOT/ramucirumab) Patients randomized to Arm B will receive ramucirumab 8mg/kg i.v. over 60 min in combination with the FLOT regimen, which is administered identical to Arm A as described above. Surgery in Arm B is planned to occur 4 to 6 weeks after d1 of last FLOT/ramucirumab dose (but never earlier than 4 weeks after d1 of last FLOT/ramucirumab dose). Patients will receive 4 additional post-operative cycles (8 weeks) of FLOT/ramucirumab in the post-operative treatment phase followed by a total of 16 cycles of ramucirumab as a monotherapy (q2wk), starting 2 weeks after d1 of the last cycle of FLOT/ramucirumab. In both of the arms, tumor assessments (CT or MRI) are performed before randomization and prior to surgery, and then every 3 months thereafter until progression/relapse, death or end of follow-up. A change from CT into MRI in the follow up period is possible at any time. During treatment, clinical visits (blood cell counts, detection of toxicity) occur prior to every treatment dose. Safety of FLOT/ramucirumab will be monitored continuously by careful monitoring of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) reported.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed, resectable adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (AEG IIII) or the stomach (uT2, uT3, uT4, any N category, M0), or any T N+ M0 patient, with the following specifications: 1. Medical and technical operability 2. Participating sites in PETRARCA study: Negative HER2 detection (score IHC HER2 0 or IHC HER2 1+ ); IHC HER2 2+ and negative by FISH, SISH or CISH 2. No preceding cytotoxic or targeted therapy 3. No prior partial or complete tumor resection 4. Female and male patients ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years. Patients in reproductive age must be willing to use adequate contraception during the study and for 7 months after the end of ramucirumab treatment (Appropriate contraception is defined as surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomy), hormonal contraception (implantable, patch, oral), and doublebarrier methods (any double combination of: IUD, male or female condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap)). Female patients with childbearing potential need to have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days before study start. 5. ECOG ≤ 1 6. Exclusion of distant metastasis by CT or MRI of abdomen, pelvis, and thorax, bone scan or MRI (if bone metastases are suspected due to clinical signs). Exclusion of the infiltration of any adjacent organs or structures by CT or MRI. 7. Laparoscopic exclusion of peritoneal carcinomatosis, in case of ascites, peritoneal masses, or if otherwise suspected clinically 8. Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function parameters: 1.

Adequate coagulation function as defined by International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5, and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds above the ULN (unless receiving anticoagulation therapy).
