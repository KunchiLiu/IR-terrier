	<brief_title>A Drug Interaction Study in Healthy Participants to Assess the Effect of Rifampin on the Pharmacokinetics of JNJ-42847922</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, fixed-sequence, single-center, multiple-dose study in 14 healthy adults. All participants will receive a single oral dose of 40 milligram (mg) JNJ-42847922 on 3 separate occasions: Day 1 (JNJ-42847922 alone), Day 5 (JNJ-42847922 with a single dose of rifampin), and Day 12 (JNJ-42847922 in combination with steady-state rifampin). A daily dose of 600 mg (2 * 300 mg) rifampin will be administered from Day 5 through Day 12. Following JNJ-42847922 dosing, serial blood samples will be collected over 48 hours for the evaluation of plasma concentrations of JNJ-42847922 and its metabolites. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
