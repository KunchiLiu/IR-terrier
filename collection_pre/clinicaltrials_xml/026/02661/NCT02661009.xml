	<brief_summary>In this clinical trial, investigators select FFPE and plasma samples of non-small cell lung cancer which are used for quantitative detection of four kinds of EGFR(Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) mutations. By the following two aspects, investigators evaluate the clinical performance of the EGFR quantitative kits. 1. methodology validation: To certify the equivalence between the EGFR quantitative kit and the common used detection methods. 2. analysis of the relationship between the type and proportion of EGFR sensitive mutation and EGFR-TKI benefit.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According to the types of samples and the purpose of the study, the research consists of two groups: plasma and tissue matching group and predicting clinical efficacy group. The samples of the plasma and tissue matching group are the same period plasma and matched FFPE(formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue)samples which will be collected before the first time patients accept any anti-tumor treatment. The samples of predicting clinical efficacy group are FFPE samples which will be collected before the patients receive EGFR-TKI treatment. In addition, the subjects have the complete prognostic follow-up data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Plasma and tissue matching group: 18~80 years old Diagnosis of NSCLC (stage III or IV) which is confirmed by histology or cytology methods. Did not receive any antitumor treatment. Sufficient samples for analysis Female patients of childbearing potential who are nursing or are pregnant. Samples are collected after patients receiving antitumor treatment. The plasma sample hemolysis. Tumor cells are not found in FFPE samples. Incomplete information of subjects predicting clinical efficacy group: 18~80 years old Diagnosis of NSCLC (stage III or IV) which is confirmed by histology or cytology methods. At least one measurable focus With EGFRTKI treatment Complete followup information after EGFRTKI treatment Sufficient samples for analysis FFPE samples are collected after EGFRTKI treatment.
