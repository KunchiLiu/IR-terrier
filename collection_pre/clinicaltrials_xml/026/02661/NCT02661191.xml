	<detailed_description>The first phase of the study consisted of a cross-sectional examination of a cohort of 119 asthmatic patients, who had at least one year regular follow-up in our respiratory clinic, and were not receiving any vitamin D supplementation. In the second phase patients with vitamin D deficiency (25-OH D values below 20 ng/ml), were recruited in a one year longitudinal study, during which they received vitamin D supplementation. The study started and ended in late autumn-winter season when, at our latitude, sun exposure is lowest. Symptoms, spirometry and number of exacerbations were recorded during both study phases.</detailed_description>
