	<brief_title>Novel Interventions for GWVI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: Over 40,000 Veterans who served in the 1991 Gulf War (GW) have a persistent form of chronic multisymptom illness that defines Gulf War Veterans Illness (GWVI). With no existing proven treatments to provide relief to these sufferers, it is critical to find efficacious and acceptable treatments for GWVI. The long-term goal is to develop a safe, readily available, mind-body treatment to reduce pain and other chronic symptoms and enhance wellness in Veterans with GWVI. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese mind-body therapy that has been practiced for centuries. In the last decade, the investigators have demonstrated that Tai Chi can improve both physical health and psychological wellbeing in patients with a variety of chronic conditions. The proposed randomized trial will establish the effectiveness of a Tai Chi mind-body treatment in Veterans with GWVI. One hundred and twenty participants meeting criteria for GWVI will be randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi exercise or a stretching and wellness education group for 12 weeks with a post treatment assessment, and follow-up assessments. The investigators will accomplish the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Evaluate whether the Tai Chi intervention will reduce symptoms of pain in Veterans with GWVI more than the Wellness intervention. The investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to the Tai Chi intervention will show a greater reduction in pain symptoms than those in the Wellness intervention and will maintain changes over a 9-month follow-up period. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate whether the Tai Chi intervention improves fatigue, cognition, quality of life, and physical functioning in GW Veterans with GWVI, as compared to the Wellness intervention. The investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to the Tai Chi intervention will evidence more improvement in fatigue, cognitive functioning, quality of life, and physical functioning than those randomized to the Wellness intervention and will maintain changes over a 9-month follow-up period. Research Design: One hundred and twenty GW Veterans meeting criteria for GWVI will be randomly assigned to either the Tai Chi Condition or the Wellness Condition, half to each condition. Methodology: All participants will receive 12 weeks of the randomly-assigned intervention twice each week. Participants in both conditions will receive assessments at baseline, 12 weeks (post-intervention), 24 weeks (3 months post-intervention) and 48 weeks (9 months post-intervention). Assessments include instruments to measure self-reported pain, fatigue, cognition, quality of life, and physical functioning.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male and female Veterans age 40 years or older Served in the 1991 Gulf War Meets criteria for chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) based on CDC criteria32 characterized by one or more symptoms of at least 6 months duration from at least two of three symptom categories: musculoskeletal pain (muscle pain, joint pain, or stiffness) fatigue moodcognition. One symptom of CMI must be musculoskeletal or joint pain or stiffness of at least 6 months duration (in addition to fatigue or cognitive complaints of the CDC criteria32) Willing to abstain from initiating participation in another formalized exercise program until completion of the study Ability to pass the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ), a 5item measure used to help ensure that it is safe for participants to exercise Not planning to relocate in next 3 months Lacks the capacity to provide consent Diagnosed major medical or neurological disorder, e.g., diabetes neurologic disorder cancer chronic infectious disease or liver disease Or has a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury, which could otherwise explain the health symptoms or interfere with their ability to safely engage in Tai Chi exercises Change in psychotropic or pain medication during the past month This will minimize amount of symptom change due to medication alterations Once enrolled, medication changes are nonetheless expected and will be monitored Regular current Tai Chi, mindfulness, or yoga practice, defined as 15 or more minutes per day at least 3 of 7 days per week for more than one month Veterans with prior experience who do not currently engage in regular practice at this level will be eligible High risk from a mental health perspective as evidenced by having been psychiatrically hospitalized entered into a drug or alcohol detoxification or rehabilitation program, or attempted suicide within the previous 2 years or has current active suicidal ideation Pregnant or breastfeeding or plans to become pregnant within the year Enrollment of pregnant or breastfeeding participants could potentially complicate outcomes, as new symptoms are likely to arise during the course of the intervention that are attributable to the pregnancy or breastfeeding and not the intervention or symptoms related to GWVI</criteria>
