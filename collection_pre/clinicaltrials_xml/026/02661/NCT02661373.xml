	<brief_summary>Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite that is passed to humans when an infected mosquito bites a person. About 3.4 billion people live in areas of the world where malaria is regularly found. In many countries, malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death. Despite this, there are a limited number of drugs, called antimalarials, that can be used to treat malaria and increasing reports of resistance to existing antimalarials.. The purpose of this research study is to test a new experimental antimalarial drug called SJ733 to first assess its safety, tolerability and blood levels in healthy adult volunteers. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: - To assess the preliminary safety and tolerability of escalating doses of antimalarial SJ733 in healthy human volunteers. - To investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of escalating doses of antimalarial SJ733 and its metabolite in healthy human volunteers. - To identify a dose of SJ733 that can be tested in a separate Phase 1b human malaria challenge study. - To assess the preliminary safety and tolerability of SJ733 in healthy adult volunteers after multiple oral dosing. - To assess the pharmacokinetics of SJ733 and its metabolite SJ506 after multiple dosing of SJ733 in healthy adult volunteers. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: - To assess the impact of food intake on the pharmacokinetic profile of antimalarial SJ733.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-in-Human Study of an Oral Plasmodium Falciparum Plasma Membrane Protein Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single site, Phase 1a, first-in-human, oral, primarily single-dose, dose escalation study of (+)-SJ000557733 (SJ733) in healthy adult volunteers. SJ733, is an investigational oral anti-malarial agent is a novel inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum plasma membrane protein (PfATP4). Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled using a leap frog, fixed dose escalation design with an adaptive component where 6 subjects are enrolled per dose cohort. Following successful completion of the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment resulting from the single-dose escalation portion of the study, a three-dose cohort study will be undertaken. It includes once per day oral dosing for 3 consecutive days.</detailed_description>

Employment under the direct supervision of the investigators or study staff. Receipt of any vaccination within 7 days of dosing. Febrile illness within 48 hours of dosing Use of any prescription medication within 14 days prior to study drug administration.

Acetaminophen may be used at doses of ≤ 1 g/day, and ibuprofen may be used at doses of ≤ 1.2 g/day. Consumption of pomegranate, grapefruit or other citrus fruits or their juices within 7 days prior to study drug administration. Use of nicotine containing products from screening to study drug administration. Consumption of alcohol within 24 hours prior to study drug administration. Inclusion Criteria For participants in multidose cohort only: Agrees not to receive any vaccination within 7 days prior to Day 1 and through Day 10.
