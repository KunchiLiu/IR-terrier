	<brief_summary>Primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate non-inferior efficacy of six cycles of BrECADD compared to six cycles of escalated BEACOPP, each followed by radiotherapy to PET-positive residual lesions â‰¥2.5 cm, in terms of progression free survival (efficacy objective). If non-inferior efficacy can be shown, the co-primary objective is to further demonstrate reduced toxicity of the BrECADD treatment compared to the escalated BEACOPP treatment measured by treatment related morbidity (TRMorbidity objective).</brief_summary>
