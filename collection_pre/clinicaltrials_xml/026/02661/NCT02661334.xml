	<brief_title>Measuring Uniformed Servicemembers' Fitness Scores on Creatine Loading and Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare the physical fitness performance—as measured by the Air Force Physical Fitness Test (PFT)—of subjects that, in conjunction with exercise, will take creatine supplementation over a four week period versus those that do not. Based on the literature, there is evidence to support that creatine supplementation may increase available levels of muscle phosphocreatine (PCr), an important energy reservoir that is initially expended with intense muscular contraction and then regenerated during episodes of rest. While mechanistically plausible, the effects of creatine on the specific measures of the PFT (push-ups, sit-ups, 1.5 mile run, and abdominal circumference) have not been evaluated. The target population is Active Duty Air Force (ADAF) service members who perform in the satisfactory (75.0-89.9), but not excellent (≥90.0), category on their PFT. As such, this represents a population with room for improvement that are at risk of, but not currently experiencing, negative impacts on their AF career due to their level of fitness. If short-term creatine supplementation does help to improve PFT scores, trainers, commanders, and unit physicians may wish to consider recommending its use. While generally considered safe, additional data will also be collected to evaluate both the qualitative and quantitative side-effects of creatine supplementation over the study period. If the hypothesis is correct and creatine supplementation is shown to be both effective and safe, additional studies may be warranted to evaluate its impact on ADAF service members who have failed the PFT and/or are at risk of being separated from the AF for unsatisfactory fitness performance. In short, this study has the potential to dramatically affect the recommendations and practices of ADAF service members related to use of creatine supplementation.</detailed_description>
