	<brief_title>Safety Study of Adoptive Transfer of Autologous IKDC-like Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer immunosurveillance in mice and human protects the host from outgrowth of tumor cells. This may establish a sufficient rationale for cancer immunotherapy that aims to control or eradicate tumor by an induction of effective anti-tumor immunity. The interest in developing cancer immunotherapy has intensified by the recent trials results showing durable responses in approximately 20% of patients who received various kinds of immunotherapy including adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells, cancer vaccines, and T cell response checkpoint blockade inhibition. Discoveries to date, natural killer (NK) cell function positively associates with reduction of cancer risk and with better survival of gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients. Interferon-producing killer dendritic cells (IKDCs) are a subpopulation of NK cells discovered in the mouse spleen, which can lyse tumor cells and acquire antigen presentation cell (APC) activity. We found putative IKDCs in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); meanwhile, we also developed a method to expand IKDC-like cells from murine bone marrow and human PBMC ex vivo. The expanded human IKDC-like cells are cytotoxic toward several human leukemia cell lines and are capable to activate allogeneic T cells. For the in vivo anti-tumor activity, we found that two transfers of syngeneic murine IKDC-like cells reduced tumor burden in B16/OVA and B16/F10 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma models, and enhanced interferon (IFN)-γ production by the splenocytes of the tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, six transfers of IKDC-like cell significantly prolonged the survival of mice bearing B16/F10 melanoma. Based on these preclinical results, we hypothesize anti-tumor activity of human IKDC-like cells. We thus propose a phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety of autologous IKDC-like cell therapy in metastatic cancer patients for determination of the maximum tolerated dose, and to monitor the immune parameters in patients before and after the IKDC-like cell transfer to investigate the therapeutic mechanism and biomarkers.</detailed_description>

Patients must have adequate bone marrow function, defined as WBC ≥ 3500/mm3, neutrophil ≥ 1500/mm3, lymphocyte ≥ 1,000/mm3, and platelet ≥ 100,000/mm3. Patients must have adequate liver and renal function, defined as serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 5 times normal, bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times normal range, and creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper normal limit. All patients should have documentation of negative result of penicillin test. Women or men of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent.

Subjects who received IFNγ or GMCSF less than 4 weeks before the start of trial. Subjects who are HIV, HBV, or HCV positive. Patients who have central nervous system metastasis except for those whose CNS disease have been treated with radiotherapy (Diseasefree &gt; 6 months) and/or surgery and have been stable for at least two weeks. Patients who have active acute or chronic infection (at the discretion of the investigator). Pregnant or breastnursing women. Patients who have active cardiac disease requiring therapy for failure, angina, arrhythmia, or infarction within the preceding 6 months (exception: any patient whose cardiac failure is compensated on medications).
