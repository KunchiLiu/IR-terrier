	<brief_title>Long-term Safety Follow-up of Participants Exposed to the Candidate Ebola Vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and/or MVA-BN-Filo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-country, prospective, long-term clinical safety study for collection of serious adverse events and pregnancy outcomes following administration of Ad26.ZEBOV and/or MVA-BN-Filo vaccines among participants who were enrolled in Phase 1, 2 or 3 clinical studies. The safety data will be collected in 3 cohorts; Cohort 1- adult and pediatric participants that received Ad26.ZEBOV and/or MVA-BN-Filo in Phase 1, 2 or 3 clinical studies (adults, adolescents and children), Cohort 2- Female participants who became pregnant with estimated conception within 28 days after vaccination with MVA-BN-Filo or within 3 months after vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV will be followed to the end of their pregnancy for pregnancy outcomes (Cohort 2). After the end of pregnancy, female participants will continue to be followed in Cohort 1. Cohort 3 - children born to female participants exposed to Ad26.ZEBOV and/or MVA-BN-Filo who became pregnant with estimated conception within 28 days after vaccination with MVA-BN-Filo or within 3 months after vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV.
