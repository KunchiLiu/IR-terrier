	<brief_summary>The study will investigate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous interferon alpha -2a to eradicate rhinovirus in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients with hypogammaglobulinemia have persistent rhinovirus infections. Rhinovirus may worsen pulmonary complications. Pegylated interferon alpha with ribavirin appear to effectively clear persistent rhinovirus infections in hypogammaglobulinemia patients. Patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia and confirmed respiratory rhinovirus infection will be randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive either - Group 1: subcutaneous pIFNÎ±2a - Group 2: subcutaneous placebo Subjects will have scheduled study visits at 1-week and at 2-month after entry to study. In addition, possible bacterial infections will be treated with antibiotics. Each patient will be followed with weekly nasal surveillance samples for 2 months and a symptom diary. Blood draws take place at study entry, 1-week and 2-month time-points.</brief_summary>
