	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the REDAPT™ Revision Femoral System modular stem cumulative revision rate at 5 years. The secondary purpose of this study is to provide 10 years of safety and performance data on the REDAPT™ Revision Femoral System modular stem in terms of radiographic and clinical outcomes. At least 132 subjects are expected to be enrolled in the study at up to 10 clinical study sites around the world. A Clinical Study Report (CSR) will be completed at years 5 and 10.</detailed_description>
