	<brief_summary>Phase II: Primary Objectives: -To determine the effectiveness of dasatinib (Sprycel) with radiotherapy (RT) and 6 weeks of concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) administered at 75 mg/m^2/day followed by adjuvant temozolomide with concurrent dasatinib in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) as measured by overall survival. Secondary Objectives: - To determine the efficacy of this treatment as measured by radiographic response (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP). - To characterize the safety profile of dasatinib (Sprycel) in combination with RT and concomitant TMZ in patients with newly-diagnosed GBM. - To characterize the safety profile of dasatinib (Sprycel) in combination with adjuvant TMZ in patients with GBM after RT. Exploratory Objectives: -To correlate tumor genotype, tumor expression of dasatinib target proteins (e.g. Src, EphA2, c-kit and PDGFR), and PTEN levels with response to therapy with dasatinib and temozolomide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Plus Radiation Therapy/Temozolomide in Newly-Diagnosed Glioblastoma: Phase II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PHASE II (Study did not progress from Phase I) The Study Drugs: Dasatinib is designed to change the function of certain genes. By changing the function of these genes, it may prevent cancer from growing and spreading. It is also designed to block or lower the activity of one or more tumor-causing proteins responsible for the uncontrolled growth of tumor cells, which may result in shrinking or stopping tumor growth. Temozolomide is designed to kill cancer cells by damaging DNA (the genetic material of cells). The damaged DNA may cause tumor cell death. PHASE II Study Drug Administration Study Groups: If found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be assigned to a dose level of dasatinib based on when joined study. Up to 2 dose levels of dasatinib will be tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of dasatinib given in combination with temozolomide is found. All the groups will take the same dose level of temozolomide for the entire study. The amount of study drugs received may change if participant experiences side effects. If at any time participant experiences any intolerable side effects, tell the study doctor right away. Study Drug Administration: During Radiation: As a part of standard of care, participant will receive radiation therapy Monday-Friday for a total of 30 radiation treatments (about 6 weeks). Every day while participants are receiving radiation, they will take the temozolomide by mouth once a day for up to a maximum of 7 weeks. They should swallow temozolomide whole, one right after the other, without chewing them. If vomit while taking temozolomide, participant cannot take more capsules before the next scheduled dose. They should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after eating) with 1 cup (about 8 oz.) of water. Every day while receiving radiation, take dasatinib by mouth 1 time a day for up to a maximum of 7 weeks. Participant should take dasatinib without food (1 hour before or 2 hours after eating), with at least 1 cup (8 oz.) of water. After Radiation: After the radiation therapy ends, every day, participant will continually take dasatinib by mouth 1 time a day. They will not take temozolomide for about 4 weeks after the radiation therapy ends. After 4 weeks, they will begin taking temozolomide 1 time a day, by mouth, on Days 1-5 of each 28 day study cycle. Study Visits: Four (4) weeks after the end of radiation, then every 4 weeks after that, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - They will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs. - They will have a neurological exam. - They will have a performance status evaluation. - They will be asked about any drugs they may be taking and if they have experienced any side effects. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check blood's ability to clot normally. Every week for the first 6 weeks, then every 4 weeks after that, they will be asked if have experienced any side effects. If they are taking an anti-seizure drug, every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks and then every 4 weeks after that, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the levels of anti-seizure drug in blood. At Week 6, then before each cycle after radiation for the first 6 cycles, they will have an ECG. Every week for the first 6 weeks, then on Days 1 and 22 of every cycle after radiation, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. Four (4) weeks after the end of radiation, then every 8 weeks after that, they will have an MRI scan to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: They may continue taking temozolomide for up to 12 cycles. They may continue taking dasatinib for as long as benefitting. they will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or experience intolerable side effects. End-of-Study Visit: After going off study, they will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - Complete medical history will be recorded. - They will have a physical exam. - They will have a performance status evaluation. - They will be asked about any drugs they may be taking and if they have experienced any side effects. - They will have a neurological exam. - Blood (about 3 1/2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests and to check blood's ability to clot normally. - If they are taking an anti-seizure drug, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the level of anti-seizure drug in blood. Long-Term Follow-up visit: After the end-of-study visit, the study team/staff will contact participants by telephone every 3 months to check how participants are doing. Each phone call will take about 5 minutes. This is an investigational study. Temozolomide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of brain tumors. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of some types of leukemia, but it is experimental for use in brain tumors. In addition, the combination of temozolomide and dasatinib is experimental for use in brain tumors. At this time, the combination is only being used in research. Up to 72 participants will take part in this study. Up to 72 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
