	<brief_title>The Effect of Selected Fibres and Flours in Flat Bread on Post-prandial Blood Glucose Responses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was a double-blind, randomised, balanced incomplete block design exploratory study of efficacy, with 11 active treatments compared to a control product in 42 healthy subjects to see if a mix of active ingredients (viscous fibres and flours) lowered the post-prandial glucose (PPG) response in capillary blood (finger prick) over a two and three hours period, relative to the control product. Every subject received the control and 4 out of the 11 treatments on five separate test days.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 20 and ≤ 25.0 kg/m2. Apparently healthy: no medical conditions which might affect study measurements (as judged by the study physician). A fasting blood glucose value between 3.5 5.6 mmol/litre at screening (measured by finger prick). Use of medication which interferes with study measurements (as judged by the study physician). Reported dietary habits: medically prescribed diet, slimming diet, not used to eat 3 meals a day, vegetarian. Reported weight loss/gain (&gt;10%) in the last six month before the study</criteria>
