	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an internet-based self help program concerning satisfaction with the treatment and their life, depression and anxiety. Both study groups get access to the internet-based self-help program. The intervention group receives additional feedback to their progress in the program from an online therapist. The investigators hypothesize that (1) at least 75% of the patients in the intervention group are "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the self-help program, (2) 50% of the patients in the intervention group work with all eight units and (3) patients of the intervention group have a higher emotional competence than the patients of the control group at the end of the self-help program.</brief_summary>
