	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial of the feasibility and utility of implementing a smartphone application (MVN) to maintain compliance with a Heart Healthy lifestyle after discharge from a cardiac outpatient rehabilitation program. Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: usual care (control: UC) or Movn mobile application (intervention: MVN). This study will improve and strengthen data collection from this at-risk patient population by recording baseline clinical and psycho social measures while gaining insight into self-reporting of physical activity and frequency between the UC and MVN groups.</brief_summary>
