	<brief_summary>Non-adherence to medications can lead to sub-optimal treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In order to improve disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) adherence, the investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial to test out an intervention to improve medications adherence among low adherers. This intervention involves the use of a musculoskeletal ultrasound program which allows RA patients to visualize their joint inflammation and damage real time while treatment adherence is simultaneously reinforced. In doing so, the investigators hope to improve patients' understanding of their joint disease and motivate the participants to adhere to their medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Program to Improve Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs Adherence in Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in the Singapore General Hospital. Eligible RA subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be screened using a medication adherence measure questionnaire. Thereafter 132 patients who are low adherers on the questionnaire will then be recruited and randomized (in a 1:1 ratio) to either (a) intervention arm (with musculoskeletal US program) or (b) control arm (without musculoskeletal US program), and followed up over a period of about 6 month.</detailed_description>
