	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of disulfiram when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with a solid tumor that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and to compare whether disulfiram and gemcitabine hydrochloride may reduce tumor induced muscle loss. Weight loss occurs in pancreatic cancer patients and is common in a multitude of other cancers. Patients with metastatic cancer and weight loss sometimes are not able to receive treatment due to physical weakness or debility. Disulfiram is a potential inhibitor of muscle degradation and may reduce tumor induced muscle wasting. Disulfiram may also help gemcitabine hydrochloride work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet know whether giving gemcitabine hydrochloride with or without disulfiram is a better treatment for unresectable solid tumors or metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disulfiram and Gemcitabine Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Unresectable Solid Tumors or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of disulfiram and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in unresectable solid tumor cancer patients (Cohort 1). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the adverse event profile associated with this combination of disulfiram and gemcitabine (Cohort 2). II. To describe changes in muscle area at the L3 level from baseline to 28 to 35 days of treatment with disulfiram/gemcitabine and with placebo/gemcitabine (Cohort 2). III. To describe changes in fist-grip strength from baseline to 28 to 35 days of treatment with disulfiram/gemcitabine and with placebo/gemcitabine (Cohort 2). IV. To describe overall survival of pancreas cancer patients who disulfiram/gemcitabine or placebo/gemcitabine (Cohort 2). V. To estimate the response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria around 1 month post-treatment in patients who receive disulfiram/gemcitabine and placebo/gemcitabine (Cohort 2). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the effect of disulfiram and gemcitabine on the ubiquitin proteasome and autophagy pathways within muscle, as assessed by means of muscle biopsies performed at baseline and after 28 to 35 days of treatment (Cohort 2). OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of disulfiram. COHORT I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and disulfiram orally (PO) on days 1-28 or days 1-35. COHORT II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and disulfiram PO every other day or daily on days 1-28 or days 1-35. ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and placebo PO every other day or daily on days 1-28 or days 1-35. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
