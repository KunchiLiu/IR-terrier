	<brief_summary>Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Auto-HSCT) is an effective alternative to allogeneic HSCT for low-risk and intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) without HLA-matched donors. At present, the best conditioning regimen for AML undergoing auto-HSCT remains in discussion. In this study, the safety and efficacy of IDA+BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in low-risk and intermediate-risk AML undergoing auto-HSCT are evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Auto-HSCT is an effective alternative to allogeneic HSCT for low-risk and intermediate-risk AML without HLA-matched donors. BUCY conditioning regimen is the standard myeloablative regimen for AML undergoing auto-HSCT. However, auto-HSCT appears to have higher relapse rate but lower transplant-related mortality, compared with allo-HSCT. To reduce the relapse rate, IDA is added in the conditioning regimen. In this study, the safety and efficacy of IDA+BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in low-risk and intermediate-risk AML patients undergoing auto-HSCT are evaluated.</detailed_description>
