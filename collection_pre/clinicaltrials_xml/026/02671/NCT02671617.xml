	<brief_summary>This randomized control trial will determine the effect of short term high intensity interval training (HIIT) on physical fitness, in an elderly patient group with active cancer, prior to surgical resection. Half of the recruited patients will act as a control group and the other half will undergo a HIIT protocol.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to achieve similar and in some studies better improvements in aerobic fitness versus more traditional endurance based exercise over the same time period. HIIT has also been shown to produce these improvements over a shorter timescale than other methods, in the region of 2-6 weeks. One widely reported barrier to exercise is time availability, HIIT training may be a favorable option to increase fitness as the total time spent exercising is significantly less than other methods. HIIT induces improvements in cardiovascular parameters in healthy elderly subjects, investigators aim to investigate whether these improvements can be matched in patients with cancer and further elucidate the mechanisms behind improvements seen with this type of training.</detailed_description>
