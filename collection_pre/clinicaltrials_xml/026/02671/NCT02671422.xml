	<brief_summary>At present there are no approved predictive tumour- or serum-derived biomarkers guiding usage of anti-angiogenic therapies in patients with adenocarcinoma of NSCLC.The objective of this NIS is to examine whether genetic/genomic markers (alone or combined with clinical covariates) could be used to predict OS in NSCLC patients eligible for treatment with Vargatef®. The investigations in this study are exploratory in nature and considered to be hypothesis generating. The results from these investigations may help to expand our understanding of the disease and the response to Vargatef®.</brief_summary>
