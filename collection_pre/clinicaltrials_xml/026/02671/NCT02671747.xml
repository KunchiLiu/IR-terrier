	<detailed_description>The pilot study will use mixed methods to compare pre- and post-workshop data about urinary and bowel incontinence symptoms and care-seeking from workshop participants as well as information about workshop acceptability from workshop participants and community partners. The study is expected to last 6 months from initial IRB approval through data analysis and workshop revision. This research will provide preliminary data for a larger test of this workshop in four diverse Wisconsin Communities, followed by a randomized, controlled trial and subsequent dissemination research study.</detailed_description>
