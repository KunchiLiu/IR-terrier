	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of 3 months of malaria chemoprevention post-discharge using dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DHA-P) in children under 5 years of age admitted with severe anemia. One half will receive monthly DHA-P and the other half placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-discharge Malaria Chemoprevention(PMC) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children hospitalized with severe anemia in Africa are at high risk of readmission or death within 6 months after discharge. No strategy specifically addresses this post-discharge period. In Malawi, 3 months of post-discharge malaria chemoprevention with monthly 3-day treatment courses of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in children with severe malarial anemia prevented 31% of deaths and readmissions. This study is a confirmatory efficacy trial in Kenya and Uganda to determine the efficacy and safety of malaria chemoprevention post-discharge. We hypothesize that an additional three months of malaria chemoprevention with monthly 3-day treatment courses with DHA-piperaquine (each providing about 4 weeks of post-treatment prophylaxis) provided during the post-discharge period to children recently admitted with severe anemia is superior to reduce all-cause readmission and mortality rates by 6 months compared with 2 weeks of post-treatment prophylaxis provided by the single course of oral AL when given as part of the standard in-hospital care around the time of discharge.</detailed_description>
