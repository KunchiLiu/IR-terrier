	<brief_title>Evaluating the Effect of Fumaria Parviflora L. in Uremic Pruritus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uremic Pruritus is still a common complication in end-stage renal disease patients. The pathogenesis of Uremic Pruritus is unknown, therefore treatments are ineffective. According to several studies Uremic Pruritus is not an isolated skin disease. It seems to be a systemic inflammatory disease with a deranged balance of T helper cell differentiation. In this study investigators considered to evaluate effect of Fumaria Parviflora L. in uremic pruritus by a double blind placebo control clinical trial. It is hypothesized that oral Fumaria Parviflora L. may minimize uremic pruritus by decreasing serum Interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) and high-sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP).</detailed_description>
