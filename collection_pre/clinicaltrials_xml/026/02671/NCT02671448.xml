	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators plan to see what happens when a person receives care in the home setting. They want to find out if caring for a patient who has been treated with an ASCT in the home setting is feasible. They want to find out what effects good and/or bad this will have on the patient's recovery and treatment after ASCT. Studies in other institutions have shown that providing care in the home setting after ASCT is safe, increases patient satisfaction, and can decrease the risk of infection. It is our hope that this new approach of providing care in the home setting will prove to be a feasible and safe option for patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK).</brief_summary>
