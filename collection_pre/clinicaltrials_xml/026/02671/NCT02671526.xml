	<brief_summary>This study is a validation study to document the acceptability of the revised Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Remediation (PACR) program to patients with HIV-associated Neurocognitive Dysfunction (HAND). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of the revised PACR program on the cognitive abilities (e.g., attention, executive function), functional status and quality of life of individuals diagnosed with HAND. The secondary objective of the study is to collect relevant data to support a pre-investigational device exemption (IDE) submission to the FDA required before the pivotal randomized, controlled trial planned for Phase II.</brief_summary>
