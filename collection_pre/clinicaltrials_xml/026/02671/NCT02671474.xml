	<brief_summary>A single-center prospective interventional trial. Patients implanted with a sutureless bioprosthetic aortic valve at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden from 2012 will be eligible. 4-dimensional volume-rendered computed tomography (CT) of the heart will be performed. The aim of the CT is to assess valve leaflet motion. Results of the CT examination, preoperative clinical characteristics, and postoperative clinical data will be registered. Data will be collected prospectively and retrospectively. Informed consent will be obtained from patients meeting the inclusion criteria before the initiation of any study-specific procedures.</brief_summary>
