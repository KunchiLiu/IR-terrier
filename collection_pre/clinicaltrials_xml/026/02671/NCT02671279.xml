	<detailed_description>The study will include 14 patients planned for bariatric surgery with BMI 40-46. The patients will be admitted to hospital 8 days prior to planned surgery and conduct a diet based mostly on fluids (yogurt, soups). Estimated daily calorie intake will be 400-600 kcal. At the day of admission and at day 7 a number of tests will be performed including blood tests, urine test and biometric measurement and a biopsy of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Weight will be measured every morning for the study period. During the operation fatty tissue samples will be taken subcutaneous and from the omentum major. This study is planned as a control group to another study where blood tests and subcutanous adipose tissue was sampled before and 6 days after bariatric surgery. The main aim of this study is to compare changes in adipose tissue and blood samples for patients before and 6 days after surgery to before and 6 days after a low-calorie diet.</detailed_description>
