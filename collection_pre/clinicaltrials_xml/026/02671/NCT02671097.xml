Incompletely cured preexisting diseases for which it can be assumed that the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the study drugs will not be normal. Febrile illness within 1 week before the first study drug administration. A medical history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (e.g. family history of Long QT interval in electrocardiogram Syndrome) or other arrhythmias. History of myopathia after treatment with statins. History of rhabdomyolysis or myopathia. Medical history of any type of psychiatric disorder, especially mood disorders including medical history with suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts.
