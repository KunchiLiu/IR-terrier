	<brief_title>Oxytocin Administration in BDD and OCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the development of efficacious pharmacologic and psychological treatments body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), treatment outcome data suggest that there is still considerable room for improvement. A closer examination of biological mechanisms underlying psychopathology may help uncover mechanisms to target during intervention and thereby provide a novel approach to treatment. Given that the neuropeptide, oxytocin, is involved in the regulation of a variety of social and cognitive dimensions, including emotion recognition and social attentional processing, there are direct implications regarding its role in the development of such deficits among individuals with BDD. The current study therefore aims to investigate the effect of oxytocin administration on social cognitive impairments in BDD and a related disorder, OCD. Twenty treatment-seeking male and female outpatients with BDD, 20 individuals with OCD, and 20 healthy participants will be assigned to receive an oxytocin and placebo nasal spray one week apart. During each visit, subjects will complete a series of tasks to measure emotion recognition, attentional biases, interpretive biases, and trust behavior. Importantly, these findings may show that a single administration of oxytocin may alter social cognitive processes thought to maintain BDD, and ultimately inform treatments for BDD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Treatmentseeking adult males and females ≥ 18 years of age Meets DSMIV criteria for principal BDD (for BDD group) or principal OCD (for OCD group), as determined by Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIV (SCID) diagnostic interview For females only: must be taking lowdose oral contraceptive pills, as defined by monophasic pills containing &lt;50 mcg ethinyl estradiol For healthy volunteers only: does not meet current DSMIV diagnosis of any Axis I disorder Participants in the BDD group will be excluded if they have a comorbid diagnosis of OCD and participants in the OCD group will be excluded if they have a comorbid diagnosis of BDD. Current diagnosis of schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, substance abuse or substance dependence. All other Axis I comorbidities will be permitted to foster the accrual of a clinically relevant sample. Significant nasal pathology (e.g., atrophic rhinitis, history of hypophysectomy, recurrent nosebleeds) Smokers who smoke ≥ 15 cigarettes daily Serious medical illnesses Active homicidal or suicidal ideation Concurrent use of psychotropic medications Steroid or hormone use (except lowdose oral contraceptive pills for females, which is allowed) For females only: positive urine pregnancy test and use of high dose estrogen/progestin pills (low dose estrogen/progestin oral contraceptives will be allowed due to stability of hormone levels during active phase) For healthy volunteers only: any current DSMIV Axis I disorder</criteria>
