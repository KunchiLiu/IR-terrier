	<brief_summary>This is a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study. Consecutive patients, operated in six University Hospitals in Sweden will be recruited following major surgical procedure. The length of patient recruitment period will be 12 weeks. The length of follow up will be 360 days . The objectives are to determine the postoperative morbidity (during the hospital stay), the survival (0-360 days), to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes and to identify risk factors that may potentially be influenced by any intervention in the future.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, prospective, observational study. Length of patient recruitment is 12 weeks, the length of observation is 360 postoperative days. The expected number of patients is 1000. Subject population: Men and women 1. aged ≥ 18 years AND 2. are classified by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System (ASA) ≥ 3 AND 3. are scheduled for elective or emergency surgical procedure classified as major OR major/complex by Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT) Not eligible surgical procedures: - organ transplantation - immediate trauma - breast - ear, nose throat - central nervous system - cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, - face, mouth, salivary, thyroidea - skin, subcutaneous tissue - endoscopic gastrointestinal - lack of Swedish identity number Patient characteristics will be prospectively collected from medical records: age, gender, co-morbidities, medical history, physical activity, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and neurological function; routine laboratory findings; type, complexity, urgency of surgery, incision localization and malignancy; lowest intraoperative systolic blood pressure, heart rate. The outcomes are the postoperative complications (POMS) classified by the Clavien-Dindo classification tool (during hospital stay), and mortality , use of medications, hospital admissions (0-360 days) and new occurrence in different disease related national quality registries.</detailed_description>
