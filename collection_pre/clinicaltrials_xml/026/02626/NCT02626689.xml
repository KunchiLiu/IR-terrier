	<brief_summary>This is a multi-site, prospective, observational study implemented in β-thalassemia treatment centers from 5 countries (Italy, Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, and Thailand). Approximately one to two study sites will be identified per country and approximately 20 β-thalassemia subjects will be enrolled per country (10 transfusion dependent (TD) and 10 Non-transfusion dependent (NTD) with a total of approximately 100 subjects. This study will not interfere with or influence the routine clinical management of β-thalassemia patients. Outcomes of interest will be collected prospectively for up to 6 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For the transfusion dependent (TD) subjects: 1. Male or female, &gt;18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document (ICF); 2. Documented diagnosis of βthalassemia or hemoglobin E/ βthalassemia; 3. TD defined as: ≥6 Red Blood Cells (RBC) units in the 24 weeks prior to study participation and no transfusion free period for ≥35 days during that period; and 4. Performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 to 1. For the nontransfusion dependent (NTD) subpopulation 1. Male or female, &gt;18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document (ICF). 2. Documented diagnosis of βthalassemia or hemoglobin E/ βthalassemia 3. NTD defined as: 0 to 5 RBC units received during the 24week period prior to study participation (not including RBC transfusions units administered for elective surgery); 4. Most recent hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL (hemoglobin values ≤ 21 days posttransfusion will be excluded) 5. Performance status: ECOG score of 0 to 1. For TD Subpopulation: 1. A diagnosis of hemoglobin S/βthalassemia; 2. Any significant psychiatric or medical conditions not related to thalassemia that would prevent the subject from participating in the study; 3. Inability to read or understand the local official languages; or 4. Participated in another clinical trial (interventional) &lt;30 days prior to study participation For NTD Subpopulation: 1. Received RBC transfusion ≤ 8 weeks prior to study enrollment; 2. A diagnosis of hemoglobin S/βthalassemia; 3. Any significant psychiatric or medical conditions not related to thalassemia that would prevent the subject from participating in the study; 4. Inability to read or understand the local official languages; or 5. Participated in another clinical trial (interventional) &lt;30 days prior to study participation.</criteria>
