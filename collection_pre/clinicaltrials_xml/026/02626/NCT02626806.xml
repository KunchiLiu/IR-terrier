	<brief_summary>1. To compare hs-TnT levels after a cardiac stress test in patients with vs. patients without CAD 2. To assess the level of post-exercise hs-TnT predicting CAD (using ROC-analysis) 3. To determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of this exercise-induced hsTopT level in predicting CAD, either alone or in relation to traditional patient-related and exercise test-related metrics</brief_summary>
