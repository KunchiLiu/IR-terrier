	<brief_summary>Persistent pain and joint stiffness after surgery may interfere with recovery and adversely affect quality of life in up to 40% of patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty. There is growing evidence that inflammation as well as other medical and psychological factors may be associated with osteoarthritis severity, progression, and associated pain severity. This study aims to identify clinical, biological, and psychological factors that contribute to and predict the development of these complications. Identification of such factors may allow us to target preventative measures to the patients at highest risk of persistent postoperative pain and joint stiffness.</brief_summary>
