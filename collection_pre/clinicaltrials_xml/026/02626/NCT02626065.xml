	<brief_summary>This is an open mono-centric prospective non-randomized study in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies (Nivolumab). The aim of the study is to identify the immune cells modulations differences between patients who present a complete, partial or stable response and patients who have non-response to the therapy in order to establish an improving response rate strategy.</brief_summary>
