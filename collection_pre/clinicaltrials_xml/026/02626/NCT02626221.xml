	<brief_summary>This is a non-interventional, multi-country, Latin American study utilizing a prospective single-cohort design. Eligible CU patients will be enrolled in the study and will be followed for 24 months (Â± 6 weeks). In accordance with the observational nature of the study, there will be no interventions or interference with the routine care of the patient which will be based solely on the clinical judgment of the treating physician. However, with respect to the frequency and schedule of assessments, the schedule included in Table 7-1 will be recommended. The selection of the treatment for CU will be clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study, and will be made at the discretion of the treating physician in accordance with standard medical practice, the investigator's clinical judgment, and global urticarial guidelines. In order to prevent selection bias, investigators should offer enrollment to all consecutive patients meeting study criteria, likely to be available for the full duration of the follow-up period of 24 months, and willing to participate in the study. The overall objective of the study is to evaluate in real-life the CU disease burden, the current treatment patterns and the use of health care resources in patients refractory to H1-antihistamine treatment</brief_summary>
