	<brief_summary>High saturated fat acids diets are associated with elevated blood pressure which is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. For this reason, a change of diet is recommended to manage blood pressure and prevent cardiovascular complications. To achieve this nutritional goal, a high-carbohydrate diet or high-monounsaturated fat diet can be advised in the replacement of a saturated fat diet. Previous meta-analysis of Garg (1998) cited randomized articles with inconsistent blood pressure lowering after consumption of a high-monounsaturated-fat diet compared with a high-carbohydrate diet only in type 2 diabetes patients. Moreover, another meta-analysis of Shah et al. (2007) showed slightly high blood pressure on diets rich in carbohydrates than diets rich in cis-monounsaturated fat after randomized and nonrandomized articles. For this reason, a new meta-analysis of a randomized clinical trial will be performed to clarify the effects of high-carbohydrate or high-monounsaturated fat diets on blood pressure. Results from this meta-analysis will help health professionals take important decisions on patient diet and minimize cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>
