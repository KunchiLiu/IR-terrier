	<brief_title>Validation of Structured Light Plethysmography - Health and Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that SLP may be a useful tool to differentiate between different respiratory diseases. To further examine differences in disease and health, and between diseases SLP measurements will be recorded in a range of diagnostic conditions that effect breathing and in healthy normal subjects. This is a non-randomised observational study to validate Structured Light Plethysmography in two groups of participants: those with Respiratory condition such as COPD and a normal healthy group. Neither group will receive any clinical intervention. SLP data capture and spirometry (as part of the patients clinical care) will be performed by the patients. The data collected from this study will allow examination of different breathing patterns between patients with different diseases, to compare breathing patterns in patients to those in healthy individuals, and to compare breathing patterns within a healthy population.</detailed_description>
