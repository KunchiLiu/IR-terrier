	<detailed_description>Sera will be obtained from 500 women undergoing IVF at five time periods: cycle Day 2, post HCG, Day 24, Day 28, and/or Day 35.Aliquots of sera will be tested by commercial ELISA kits for concentrations of immune modulators suggestive to be predictive of IVF outcome, such as cytokines (interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon), neurotrophins (BDNF), protease inhibitors (HE4) and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP). The results will be correlated with IVF outcomes.</detailed_description>
