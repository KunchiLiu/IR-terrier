	<brief_title>A Prospective Study on Sunitinib as First Line Therapy for Advanced/Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma in Asian Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sunitinib 50mg daily on 4/2 dose schedule has been established as standard of care (SOC) for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, Asian patients in real world experienced grade III/IV adverse events much more than expected. This multi-national, phase II, single arm study is going to explore more on the safety/efficacy and relevant biomarkers on sunitinib 2/1 dose schedule in Asian people with advanced RCC.</detailed_description>
