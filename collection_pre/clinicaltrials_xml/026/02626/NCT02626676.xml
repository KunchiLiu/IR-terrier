	<brief_summary>Background: In Chronic Kidney Disease patients, it is crucial to begin treatment as soon as possible in order to minimize the complication-related risks. Encouraging patients to adhere to their treatment plans is a great challenge for health care professionals. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a nutrition educational programme on the hyperphosphatemia using the transtheoretical model of eating behavior. Subjects and Methods: A prospective Interventional study is being conducted in a dialysis centre with 180 stage 5D Chronic Kidney Disease patients who exhibit phosphate serum levels &gt; 5.5 mg/dL. The educational intervention consists of lectures and group dynamics sessions performed during dialysis sessions. Anthropometric, clinical, demographic and laboratory parameters (serum phosphorus concentration will be evaluated and the transtheoretical model of eating behavior (TMFB) will be applied pre- and post-intervention.</brief_summary>

The educational intervention consists of lectures and group dynamics sessions performed during dialysis sessions. Anthropometric (weight, height, body mass index), clinical, demographic (sex, age, time on dialysis programme, literacy/schooling) and laboratory parameters (phosphate serum levels) will be evaluated and the transtheoretical model of eating behavior (TMFB) will be applied pre- and post-intervention. Reduction of phosphate serum levels and positive/negative behavioral changes will be the evaluated outcomes. Statistical Analyses will be carried out in order to compare the effect of educational programme on phosphate serum levels and on the behaviour changes.</detailed_description>
