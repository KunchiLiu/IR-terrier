	<detailed_description>This project aims to investigate the effects of 12 months supplementation with a mix of Vitamin A + Long chain n-3 PUFA vs placebo to consume daily on human cognitive functions. Food supplement and placebo will be provided as capsules matched for appearance. The study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, parallel-groups (2 arms) placebo-controlled. Two groups, each of 180 volunteers, are recruited. One group of volunteers will consume the Vitamin A + Long chain n-3 PUFA mix while the other one will consume the placebo product. Each volunteer will be seen for 5 visits at the investigational site. Baseline and the last follow-up visit will include cognitive assessment with the CANTAB battery. CANTAB tests will cover several aspects of memory: visio-spatial learning and episodic memory, visio-spatial working memory, frontal executive functions, but also word-based semantic memory. Moreover, psychological and mood components will be evaluated (mnesic complaint, depression, fatigue). Physical activity will also be recorded. Finally, biological parameters will be assessed (lipid profile, glycemia, CRP, thyroid stimulating hormone, transthyretin, plasma level of vitamin A and D as well as retinol binding protein and lipidic profile).</detailed_description>
