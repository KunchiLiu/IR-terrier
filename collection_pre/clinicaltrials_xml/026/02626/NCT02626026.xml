	<brief_summary>This study will consist of two parts: Part A will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GS-4059 in healthy participants. Part B will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the effect of GS-4059 on disease-specific clinical markers and outcomes in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</brief_summary>

Male and female individuals of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse must agree to use protocol specified method(s) of contraception Must, in the opinion of the investigator, be in good health based upon medical history and physical examination, including vital signs Screening laboratory evaluations (hematology including reticulocytes, fasting lipids, chemistry, and urinalysis) must fall within the normal range of the local laboratory's reference ranges unless the results have been determined by the investigator to have no clinical significance Have either a normal 12lead ECG or one with abnormalities that are considered clinically insignificant by the investigator in consultation with the Sponsor Part B Diagnosis of RA (according to the 1987 ACR classification criteria OR a score of ≥ 6 as defined by the ACR/European League Against Rheumatism Classification and Diagnostic Criteria for RA) Individuals must have taken methotrexate (MTX) 7.5 to 25 mg/week continuously for at least 12 weeks, with at least 6 weeks of stable dose prior to first study drug dose and throughout study duration. Individuals must be receiving folic or folinic acid supplementation at a stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to Day 1 dosing and throughout study duration Individuals are allowed to remain on antimalarial therapy, with at least 8 weeks of stable dose prior to first study drug dose Use of oral corticosteroids of no more than 10 mg prednisone or its equivalent per day is allowed if dose is stable for at least 28 days prior to first study drug dose Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other analgesics (including aspirin ≤ 100 mg daily) are allowed if doses are stable for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug Estimated creatinine clearance (CLCr) ≥ 60 mL/min (using the CockcroftGault method) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at the screening evaluation White blood cells (WBC), neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and platelet count ≥ 0.75 x lower limit of normal (LLN) A negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative pregnancy test on the Day 1 visit prior to the first dose of study drug for female individual of child bearing potential. Male and female individuals of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse must agree to use protocol specified method(s) of contraception Exclusion Criteria Part A Pregnant or lactating individuals Have any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness (including depression) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with individual's treatment, assessment, or compliance with the protocol.

Pregnant or lactating females Previous treatment with Bcell depleting agents (eg, rituximab) within 12 months of treatment Prior treatment with any commercially available or investigational Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor Diagnosis of diabetes, history of impaired glucose tolerance test, history of abnormal HgA1c, or history of impaired fasting glucose Current treatment with any other disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than MTX and hydroxychloroquine, unless appropriate wash out Current treatment with any biologic agent, unless appropriate wash out Any laboratory abnormality or condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the individual or impair the assessment of study results History of or current inflammatory joint disease, other than RA Active significant systemic involvement secondary to RA such as vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis or Felty's syndrome History of or current autoimmune or rheumatic disorders, other than RA RA functional class 4 or other uncontrolled medical conditions History of ongoing, chronic or recurrent infections or recent serious or lifethreatening infection Presence of any condition that could, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the individual's ability to participate in the study, such as history of substance abuse, alcoholism, or a psychiatric condition</criteria>
