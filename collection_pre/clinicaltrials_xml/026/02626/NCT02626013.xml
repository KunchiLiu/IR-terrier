	<brief_summary>This non-interventional study aims at assessing the impact of nab-paclitaxel on the clinical outcomes and the health-related QoL (HRQoL) of this heavily burdened and difficult-to-treat population. Notably, the data generated in the context of this study will serve as complementary evidence to that of the tightly and strictly controlled pre-registration clinical trial setting, which is of essential importance especially in patient populations with diseases of complex and heterogeneous biology, such as breast cancer.</brief_summary>
