	<brief_summary>Most recently, the Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS) approach combined with single-port technology has allowed that pelvic surgery can be laparoendocopically performed from both its abdominal and perineal aspects.Previously, a strong negative association between medium- and long-term survival and male gender with narrow pelvis have been reported. TAMIS has a significant potantial for improving the quality of the surgical resection of rectal tumors in men with visceral obesity and narrow pelvis. This group of patients have also a high rate of conversion to open surgery. Focusing on improvement in intraoperative conditions and surgical techniques rather than routine conventional procedures may be the way to go concerning favorable short- and long-term outcomes. The selection of adequate surgical approach to the high-risk patients with visceral obesity and a bulky mesentery may prevent or limit the risk for anastomotic leakage and improve oncologic margin clearence. This is a prospective observational feasability study of the TAMIS-procedure.</brief_summary>
