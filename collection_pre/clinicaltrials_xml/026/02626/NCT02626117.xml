	<brief_summary>The concept of laser deepithelialization to retard epithelial migration has enabled new attachment formation in periodontal pockets. Based on this hypothesis, that laser deepithelialization during root coverage procedures will enhance clinical outcome, a split mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was planned to compare the clinical outcome of Coronally advanced flap (CAF) + subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) alone and in combination with laser de-epithelialization in the treatment of gingival recession.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser De-epithelialization for Epithelial Exclusion in Root Coverage Procedure: a Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successful treatment of recession defects to obtain new attachment and prevent repair by long junctional epithelium continues to present a serious therapeutic challenge. The concept of laser deepithelialization to retard epithelial migration has enabled new attachment formation in periodontal pockets. Based on this hypothesis, that laser deepithelialization during root coverage procedures will enhance clinical outcome, a split mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was planned to compare the clinical outcome of Coronally advanced flap (CAF) + subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) alone and in combination with laser de-epithelialization in the treatment of gingival recession. METHOD: In a split-mouth study, 20 patients presenting at least one pair of bilaterally symmetrical Miller's Class I and Class II buccal gingival recessions will be selected. Control site will receive coronally advanced flap with connective tissue graft and test site will receive laser deepithelialization as an adjunct to coronally advanced flap with connective tissue graft. Gingival recession depth (GRD), Gingival recession width (GRW), Probing depth (PD), Clinical attachment level (CAL), Keratinized tissue width (KTW), Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Gingival bleeding index (GBI) will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after treatment. The root coverage outcomes were also assessed by photogrammetric analysis.</detailed_description>
