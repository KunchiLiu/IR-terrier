	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether copanlisib in combination with standard immunochemotherapy (rituximab in combination with bendamustine [R-B] and rituximab in combination with a 4 drug combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone/prednisolone [R-CHOP]) is effective and safe compared with placebo in combination with standard immunochemotherapy (R-B or R-CHOP) in patients with relapsed iNHL who have received at least one, but at most three, lines of treatment, including rituximab and alkylating agents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Copanlisib in Combination With Standard Immunochemotherapy in Relapsed Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (iNHL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients should be in need of and fit for immunochemotherapy and should not be resistant to rituximab (resistance defined as lack of response, or progression within 6 months of the last course of treatment with a rituximab containing regimen). This study will be composed of two parts: Safety run-in and phase III part. The purpose of the safety run-in part of this study is to assess whether the drug being tested (copanlisib) in combination with standard immunochemotherapy (R-B or R-CHOP) is safe and at what dose level of the study drug (copanlisib - 45mg or 60 mg) patients are able to tolerate the study treatment combination. In addition to finding a safe and tolerable dose level for the phase III part of the study, efficacy will also be evaluated for patients that stay on the study treatment during the safety run-in. The phase III part of the study will start when the recommended dose of copanlisib in combination with R-CHOP and R-B has been defined and confirmed by sponsor, principal investigator and Data Monitoring Committee. A maximum of 24 patients will take part in the safety run-in part of this study. In the phase III part approximately 676 patients will be randomly assigned to blinded treatment arms of copanlisib plus R-B or R-CHOP or placebo plus R-B or R-CHOP.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of CD20 positive iNHL with histological subtype limited to: Follicular lymphoma G123a Small lymphocytic lymphoma with absolute lymphocyte count &lt;5x10E9/L at study entry Lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM) Marginal zone lymphoma (splenic, nodal, or extranodal) Patients must have relapsed after at least 1 but at most 3 prior lines of therapy, including rituximab and alkylating agents. A previous regimen is defined as one of the following: at least 2 months of singleagent therapy; at least 2 consecutive cyclesof polychemotherapy; autologous transplant; radioimmunotherapy. Previous exposure to other PI3Ki is acceptable provided there is no resistance. NonWM must have at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion (that has not been previously irradiated) according to the Lugano Classification. Patients affected by WM who do not have at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion in the baseline radiologic assessment must have measurable disease, defined as presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) paraprotein with a minimum IgM level ≥ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and positive immunofixation test. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 Life expectancy of at least 3 months Availability of fresh tumor tissue and/or archival tumor tissue at Screening Adequate baseline laboratory values collected within 7 days of starting the study treatment Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% Exclusion Criteria Histologically confirmed diagnosis of follicular lymphoma grade 3b or transformed disease, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Patients positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg or HBcAb) will be eligible if they are negative for HBVDNA, these patients should receive prophylactic antiviral therapy. Patients positive for antiHCV antibody will be eligible if they are negative for HCVRNA.
