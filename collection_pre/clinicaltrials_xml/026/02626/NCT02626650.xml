	<brief_title>Recent Experiences With Concussions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>College athletes will be recruited to complete a voluntary online survey that will take approximately 10 minutes. In this survey, they will answer a series of questions related to the concussion symptoms they have experienced in their recent sports season, their opinions related to concussions and concussion treatment, and demographics. Of interest, participants will indicate what concussion symptoms they have recently experienced in one of four formats, to which they will be randomly assigned. Participants will either *check the symptoms they have experienced, *check the symptoms they have not experienced, *uncheck the symptoms they have experienced, or *uncheck the symptoms they have not experienced. It is believed that an alternative method of reporting symptoms that requires participants to indicate the symptoms they have not experienced will lead them to report having experienced a greater number of symptoms, based on past research regarding inclusion vs. exclusion modes of thought.</detailed_description>
