Participation in any other investigational study or use of any other investigational agents within 30 days prior to study entry 8. History of allergic reactions attributed to Noni or other compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Noni, or the inactive components present in Noni capsules. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or any psychological, familial, sociological or other concomitant condition that would not allow adequate compliance with the study protocol</criteria>
