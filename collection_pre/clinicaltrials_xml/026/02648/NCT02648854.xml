	<brief_title>Investigate the Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of CKD-395 in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To healthy male subjects of 16, following treatments are administered dosing in each period and wash-out period is a minimum of 7 days. Group 1: CKD-395 0.5/1000mg 1T(Fasting) / CKD-395 0.5/1000mg 1T(Fed) Group 2: CKD-395 0.5/1000mg 1T(Fed) / CKD-395 0.5/1000mg 1T(Fasting) Pharmacokinetic blood samples are collected up to 48hrs. Investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of CKD-395</detailed_description>
