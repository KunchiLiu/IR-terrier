	<brief_summary>This study will be looking at whether combining cyclophosphamide, pembrolizumab (an antibody that blocks negative signals to T cells), GVAX (pancreatic cancer vaccine), and SBRT (focused radiation) is effective (anti-tumor activity) and safe in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
