	<brief_summary>The aim of the study was to describe the relationship between the intensity of a standardized tetanic stimulation and the associated reflex pupillary dilation in patients under ketamine sedation. After an intravenous bolus of 1 mg/kg of ketamine, tetanic stimulations were performed every minute at increasing intensities of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 milliamps (similar to the stimulations of neuromuscular blocking agents monitoring). Pupillary diameter was measured before and after each stimulation.</brief_summary>
