	<brief_summary>This project intends to investigate children with idiopathic and cryptogenic localization related epilepsies, using a longitudinal assessment of structural and functional MRI data, in relation to neuropsychological evaluation. The rationale is primarily based on: 1) the frequent observation of selective cognitive dysfunctions in such children, the pathophysiology of which remains largely uncertain; 2) the recent major advances in the MRI investigation of brain maturation showing striking age and region dependant patterns. The primary hypothesis is that some children with localization related epilepsies suffer from altered maturation in the epileptic brain regions, and that this abnormal maturation affects their cognitive abilities. 100 children with localization related epilepsies and 100 matched controls will be prospectively enrolled during the first two years of the disease (for patients) and benefit from a comprehensive phenotypic and neuropsychological evaluation once a year for 5 years. The brain maturation of these children will be longitudinally assessed using structural and functional MRI, and correlated with neuropsychological data. Investigators hope to demonstrate that children with localization related epilepsies and cognitive dysfunctions suffer from an abnormal brain maturation in regions underlying the epileptic activity and the altered cognitive processes. The finding could partly bridge the gap between these two abnormalities and help better understand their interaction and respective dynamic. Once validated, the study of regional brain maturation in children with epilepsy might be further used as a reliable surrogate marker or predictor of associated cognitive dysfunction.</brief_summary>
