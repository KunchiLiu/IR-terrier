	<brief_summary>This is the first study to test Sym015 in humans. The primary purpose of this study is to see if Sym015 is safe and effective for patients with advanced solid tumors who do not have other available treatment options.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sym015 (Anti-MET) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the first part of the study (Part 1, dose-escalation), Sym015 will be evaluated for safety and tolerability. Additionally, the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. Sym015 will be given at different dose levels on an every second week (Q2W) dosing schedule. Each patient will be given one fixed dose level. In the second part of the study (Part 2, dose-expansion), two "Basket Cohorts" will be tested to see if Sym015 is effective in patients with solid tumors with a specific genetic abnormality called MET-amplification: - Q2W Basket Cohort: Sym015 at the RP2D on a Q2W dosing schedule. - Q3W Basket Cohort: Sym015 at the highest safe dose tested in Part 1 on an every third week (Q3W) dosing schedule.</detailed_description>
