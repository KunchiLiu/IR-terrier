	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Nivolumab and Valproate in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have the potential to treat a wide range of diverse cancers. Of particular interest to researchers is the PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction, a major pathway that many cancers hijack in order to suppress immune control. Anti-PD-1 antibodies such as nivolumab show a strong potential to treat many types of cancers including glioblastoma, the most common and most lethal brain cancer. This study will examine a means of further focusing immune response on glioblastoma by combining stereotactic "gamma knife" radiosurgery with nivolumab. The rationale behind this intervention is that the radiation therapy will enhance immune response rate by providing additional tumor antigens from dying cells. Additionally, a study from investigators at Johns Hopkins indicates that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may boost the anti-cancer efficacy of PD-1 antibodies like nivolumab. Valproate, a class I HDAC inhibitor, will be used concurrently with nivolumab with the goal of enhancing the effects of both the nivolumab and the radiotherapy.</detailed_description>
