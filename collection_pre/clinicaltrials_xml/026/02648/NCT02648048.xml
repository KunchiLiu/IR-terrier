	<criteria>Have a diagnosis of IPF 5 years from time of screening, confirmed at baseline Tolerated dose of pirfenidone 16022403 mg once daily (QD) for a minimum of 24 weeks required prior to and during screening Greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent (%) and &lt;=100% of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) at screening Stable baseline lung function as evidenced by a difference of less than (&lt;) 10% in absolute FVC measurements (in liters) between screening and Day 1/Visit 2 prior to enrollment &gt;=30% and &lt;=90% of predicted diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide at screening Agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception Male participants must agree not to donate semen during the study and for at least 2 months (or as per local requirements) after the last dose of vismodegib Agree not to donate blood or blood products during the study and for at least 9 months (or as per local requirements) after the last dose of study treatment Prior treatment with vismodegib or any Hhpathway inhibitor Evidence of other known causes of interstitial lung disease Hospitalization due to an exacerbation of IPF within 4 weeks prior to or during screening Lung transplant expected within 6 months of screening Evidence of clinically significant lung disease other than IPF Postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second/FVC ratio &lt;0.7 at screening Any clinically significant medical disease (other than IPF) that is associated with an expected survival of &lt;6 months, likely to require a change in therapy during the study Class IV New York Heart Association chronic heart failure or historical evidence of left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35% Known current malignancy or current evaluation for a potential malignancy Known immunodeficiency, including, but not limited to, human immunodeficiency virus infection Evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis or known liver cirrhosis Creatinine clearance &lt;30 milliliter per minute, calculated using the CockcroftGault formula</criteria>
