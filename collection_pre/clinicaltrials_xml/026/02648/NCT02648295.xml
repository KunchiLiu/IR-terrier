	<brief_summary>Blood management is an important part of successful total joint replacement. Loss of blood and transfusion can lead to poor outcomes for patients. The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) has become a standard component to many blood management programs. It is used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss during surgery and in various medical conditions such as excessive bleeding or hemorrhage. A normal body process prevents blood clots that occur naturally from growing and causing problems. When this process becomes overactive it can result in excessive bleeding, leading to increased blood transfusions. The proposed study seeks to evaluate the relationship between TXA and thromboelastogram (TEG) results.</brief_summary>
