	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the benefit of two cognitive therapies in severe sleepwalking/ sleep terrors: relaxation vs. relaxation plus hypnosis. This is a monocentric, double-blind controlled study. 75 patients (aged more than 15 yo) with severe sleepwalking (defined as at least one epsidoe per week and at least two awakenings in stage N3 on video polysomngraphy) will be included. All patients will have a visit 1 for diagnosis including a medical interview, a video polysomnography, questionnaires on sleepwalking (PADSS and systematized interview), sleep quality (PSQI, MEQ) and sleepiness (Epworth scale) and suggestibility scale. 25 patients will be randomized to the relaxation group, 25 patients to the hypnosis plus relaxation group, while the 25 non-randomized patients will be non-treated controls. Randomized patients will receive the therapy on day 1, and be monitored during the subsequent night. They will have a weekly therapy for 4 additional sessions and be monitored again on Month 1, as well as they will complete the sleep and sleepwalking questionnaires. They will also complete the questionnaire by phone on Month 3. The non-randomized controls will complete the questionnaire on month 1, with no therapeutical intervention between Day 1 and Month 1. The main outcome will be the frequency of sleepwalking episodes, as assessed by the PADSS-B. Secondary outcomes include the changes in other subitems of teh PADSS, of the N3 awakenings in v-PSG between night 1 and Night 2 (short term effect) and Night 1 and Night 28 (long term effect), as well as changes in sleep quality and sleepiness scales. A comparison of spectral EEG, as well as respiration, eye movements, muscle tone and heart rate during rest, hypnosis trance, relaxation and sleepwalking episodes is also scheduled.</brief_summary>
