	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability of ASLAN001 in Combination With Cisplatin and 5-FU or Cisplatin With Capecitabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, Phase I, dose escalation study of ASLAN001 given in combination with Regimen A or Regimen B, in patients with metastatic solid tumors, eligible to receive the cisplatin/5-fluorouracil or cisplatin/capecitabine regimen. If the study medication is considered to be above the MTD, that is, if ≥ 2 DLTs are observed in one cohort, next cohort will receive ASLAN001 dose de-escalation in combination with chemotherapy. Dose of ASLAN001 starts from 400mg BID; then, dose escalation to 500mg BID or dose de-escalation to 300mg BID will depend on DLTs observed in cohort. Regimen A: Depends on preferred medical practice, Cohort 1A will receive ASLAN001 400 mg BID in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV infusion and 5 fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day IV infusion for 5 days every 3 weeks; or will receive ASLAN001 400 mg BID in combination with Cisplatin 35 mg/m2 24-hour infusion for day 1 and day 8, 5-fluorouracil 2,000 mg/m2 and Leucovorin 300mg/m2 24-hour infusion for day 1, day 8 and day 15 every 4 weeks. Regimen B: Cohort 1B will receive ASLAN001 400 mg BID in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV infusion and oral capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 BID for 14 days every 3 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female patients 20 years of age or older at the time written informed consent is obtained. 2. Regimen A: Patients with metastatic solid tumors eligible for treatment with cisplatin and 5fluorouracil. The standard dose and schedule of cisplatin and 5fluorouracil will be according to the preference of investigators and institutions. Regimen B: Patients with metastatic solid tumors eligible for treatment with cisplatin in combination with capecitabine. 3. Patients with a partial gastrectomy may be allowed to participate in the study as long as they can take oral medications and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria. 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 5. Adequate organ and hematological function as evidenced by the following laboratory studies within 14 days prior to enrolment: Hematological function, as follows: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL. Coagulation function, as follows: Partial thromboplastin time or activated partial thromboplastin time ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) per institutional laboratory normal range. International normalized ratio ≤ 1.5. Renal function, as follows: • Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min as calculated by CockcroftGault formula. Hepatic function, as follows: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN. AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present). 1. Patients with persistent gastric outlet obstruction, complete dysphagia or feeding jejunostomy. 2. Patients receiving proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists for established, symptomatic gastro duodenal ulceration or gastroesophageal reflux disease. 3. Patients with unresolved toxicities of grade 2 or more from prior anticancer therapies. 4. Untreated or symptomatic central nervous system metastases. Patients with a history of brain metastases are eligible if definitive therapy has been administered (surgery and/or radiation therapy), there is no planned treatment for brain metastases, and the patient is clinically stable and is off corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment. 5. Major surgical procedures within 28 days prior to enrolment. 6. Clinically significant cardiovascular diseases that are symptomatic or uncontrolled. 7. Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, or hepatitis B surface antigen. 8. Pregnant or breastfeeding females. 9. Patients who have hearing impairment, due to the potential for ototoxicity of cisplatin.</criteria>
