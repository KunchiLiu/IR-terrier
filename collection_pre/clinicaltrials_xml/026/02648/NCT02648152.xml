	<brief_title>Polarstem Cementless Hip Stem</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this multicenter clinical observation is to validate short-, mid-, and long-term outcome (efficacy and safety) of the POLARSTEM™. Efficacy evaluations: - Evaluation of function, range of motion (ROM) and pain as assessed by Harris Hip Score, Hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) [7, 8], an extension of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). - Radiographic changes as defined by radiolucent lines, osteolysis, hypo- and hypertrophy, implant loosening or migration Safety evaluations: - Intra- and perioperative device-related adverse events (AE) and complications up to discharge - Postoperative AE up to 10 years</detailed_description>
