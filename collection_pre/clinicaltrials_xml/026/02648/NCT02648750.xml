	<brief_title>Stroke Self-Management Delivered by Rehabilitation Assistants Within an Early Supported Discharge Service</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supporting self-management post-stroke is a key priority in healthcare policy, but not yet embedded into the provision of stroke rehabilitation. Barriers to implementation include time and resource. The feasibility of using the Bridges Stroke Self-Management Programme within an Early Supported Discharge Service and delivery by Rehabilitation Assistants is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate key trial parameters to inform the protocol of a future definitive trial into the effectiveness of Bridges delivered by rehabilitation assistants within an Early Supported Discharge Service.</detailed_description>
