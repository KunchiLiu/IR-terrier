	<brief_title>Integrated Care for Patients With High Risk Substance Use and Psychiatric Disorder With Chronic Direct Acting Antiviral Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and aims: Approval of direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapies in 2011 initiated a new era of more effective treatments for hepatitis C (HCV). The impact of more effective therapies on patient access to treatment is unknown. Integrated Care (IC) involving patient case management may overcome barriers to treatment access imposed by psychiatric and substance use disorders (SUD). Methods: Prospective, randomized trial at a single medical center. Patients with HCV at risk for active psychiatric and SUD between Jan 2012 and Jan 2013 were recruited and randomized to IC or Usual Care (UC). A mid-level mental health practitioner was placed in the IC clinic and provided brief mental health care and case management.</detailed_description>
