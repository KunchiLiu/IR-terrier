	<brief_title>Validation of DNA Methylation Biomarkers for Oral Cancer Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, investigators plan to recruit 40~50 patients who had, or currently has oral cancer. The study procedures are as below: - After the Informed Consent Form is signed, swab from the lesion site and normal site to obtain oral epithelial cells. - Collect tissue from the tumor site and the non-cancerous matched site from the surgery or the tissue bank. - Collect oral swab from the lesion site and the normal site when patients return to the clinic for a regular follow-up. Specimens will be collected for DNA methylation testing, and the results will be compared with patient's clinical diagnosis. It is expected that the relationship between DNA methylation, oral cancer, and the recurrence of oral cancer will be found.</detailed_description>
