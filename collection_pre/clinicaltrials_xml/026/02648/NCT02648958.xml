	<brief_summary>Ischemia reperfusion injury causes the release of free oxygen radicals. The selective alpha2-receptor agonist, dexmedetomidine, has an inhibitory effect on inflammatory responses during ischemic injury. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on inflammatory responses during ischemia-reperfusion injury in skeletal muscle.</brief_summary>
