	<brief_summary>Faced with the current obesity epidemic, new avenues of research into effective weight loss must be developed. Among the possible actions on obesity, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown in several studies to be effective in treating epilepsy or depression, at the same time inducing weight loss in those patients. Vagus nerve stimulation has also shown to be effective on weight loss in experimental animal studies. Vagus nerve stimulation has never been attempted in obese patients awaiting bariatric surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to demonstrate the benefit of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation in obese subjects awaiting surgery. Secondary objectives include, among others, the risk factors related to obesity, systemic micro-inflammation, insulin and lipid profile.</detailed_description>
