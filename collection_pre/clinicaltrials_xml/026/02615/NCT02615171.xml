	<brief_title>RELAX: A Mobile Application Suite Targeting Obesity and Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity and stress are highly comorbid and both increase risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Stress is associated with disinhibited eating, junk food consumption and low consumption of produce and whole grains. Both stress and stress-induced eating are not only associated with obesity but also predict worst outcomes in lifestyle interventions. Stress and stress-induced eating should be targeted in interventions to maximize weight loss; however, this makes for a very intensive intervention. Technology could be leveraged to reduce intervention burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop and test the feasibility and proof-of-concept of RELAX Application Suite (AS), a mobile-, cloud- and web-based companion to a lifestyle intervention that addresses stress. RELAX-AS will be designed to reduce clinical visit time by identifying for the clinician the patient's behavior and stress patterns that account for the greatest deviations in energy balance. Investigators have created an app for diet and exercise self-monitoring. The RELAX-AS will build upon previous work to create a comprehensive weight loss and stress reduction application suite. RELAX-AS will include RELAX-app and RELAX-web. RELAX-app is a patient-facing mobile application that will be linked to the Microsoft Health Vault, a cloud-based platform that allows for secure access of health data online. RELAX-app will include self-monitoring (diet, exercise, stress, stress-induced eating); automated feedback via easy-to-interpret visual displays and feedback reports on the amount, timing, context, and relationship between target behaviors; and self-guided stress management features that are prompted when stress ratings are elevated. To minimize burden, investigators will incorporate barcode scanners for diet recording, GPS for exercise tracking, visual analogue scales for stress ratings, and provide brief stress reduction strategies. RELAX-web is a web-based application for clinicians to access the patient's information in the form of easily digestible visual displays and feedback reports to increase the efficiency of their counseling. In traditional counseling much time is spent reviewing paper self-monitoring records and soliciting information from the patient about factors impacting their adherence (e.g., stress and stress eating). The purpose of RELAX-web is to reduce the clinic time needed to deliver care. The goal is to use RELAX-AS to create an intervention delivery model that reduces both weight and stress. The investigators propose a 3-year study to develop and test usability, feasibility, and acceptability. This work is in preparation for a 2-arm efficacy trial comparing RELAX-AS with a brief lifestyle intervention to a brief lifestyle intervention alone on weight, stress, and stress eating.</detailed_description>
