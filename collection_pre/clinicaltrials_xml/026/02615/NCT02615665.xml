	<brief_summary>The long-term outcome of patients resected for colorectal liver metastases (CLM) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CHT) depends by several tumoral and non-tumoral factors, such as the immune response to the tumor and to the CHT. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the pathological and immunological response in patients undergoing liver resection for CLM after CHT in regards to the long-term outcome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The immunoreactivity to CD3+ and NKp46+ cells inside the tumor, at the border between the tumor and the normal liver, and inside the normal liver will be tested by computer-assisted image analyses in patients undergoing liver resection for CLM between 2005 and 2013 preoperatively treated with oxaliplatin or irinotecan with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab. The survival will be assessed in relation to several prognostic factors and to that immunoreactivity.</detailed_description>
