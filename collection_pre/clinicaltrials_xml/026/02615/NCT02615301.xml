	<brief_summary>The aims of this study were to investigate how intake of tailor-made salmon affected bone biomarkers, nutritional status, as well as body composition and bone mineral density. The 122 healthy postmenopausal women included in this 12 weeks intervention study were randomized into four groups: three salmon groups (with three different vitamin D3/vitamin K1 combinations) and one tablet group (vitamin D and Calcium).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Intake of Salmon and Bone Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suboptimal vitamin D status is common among humans, and might have a negative impact on bone health. Fatty fish, including Atlantic salmon, is an important dietary vitamin D source. However, due to a considerable change in fish feed composition, the contribution of vitamin D from salmon fillet has been reduced. The aims were to investigate how intake of tailor-made salmon affected bone biomarkers, nutritional status (vitamin D, omega-3), as well as body composition and bone mineral density (BMD). The 122 healthy postmenopausal women (median 55 years) included in this 12 weeks intervention study were randomized into four groups: three salmon groups (150 grams/two times/week) and one tablet group (800IU vitamin D and 1000 mg Calcium/day). The salmon groups also received calcium supplements (1000 mg/d). The salmon had three different vitamin D3/vitamin K1 combinations: high D3 + high K1, low D3 + high K1, or high D3 + low K1.</detailed_description>
