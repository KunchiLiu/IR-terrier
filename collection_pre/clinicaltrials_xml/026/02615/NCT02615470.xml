	<brief_title>Enhancing a Sustainable Pharmacy-based Immunization Program in Two States</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community pharmacies are in a unique position and have potential to help increase immunization rates, especially among those who do not visit their primary care provider regularly. This study seeks to increase the level of pharmacy-based immunization delivery. The study intervention is designed to increase the current level of pharmacy-based immunization delivery and foster practice change to sustain the intervention effect. Our intervention combines evidence-based strategies for improving immunization coverage and strategies to overcome system barriers to increase sustainability of the intervention over time. The study will focus on pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccination services. Specific aims include: 1. To compare the change in the number of pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccinations administered in pharmacy from the corresponding 6-month period prior to the intervention to the 6-month intervention period between intervention pharmacies and the control pharmacies. The pre-intervention period will correspond to the intervention period. 2. To compare the extent of immunization activity implementation during the intervention period between intervention pharmacies and control pharmacies. 3. To compare the level of sustainability of immunization services over the period of 6 months after the intervention period ends between the intervention group and the control group. 4. To explore facilitators and barriers to implementing immunization services. 5. To explore factors affecting patient acceptance of pharmacist's vaccine recommendations within the intervention pharmacies.</detailed_description>
