	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of Perineal Ultrasound in Thr Delivery Room to Improve the Diagnosis of OASIS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In countries where there is high prevalence of doing episiotomy in primiparous women, the incidence of sustained obstetric anal sphincter injuries is increasing. When the tear extend beyond the external anal sphincter its called 'OASIS' that might lead to either immediate of delayed anal incontinence. Anal incontinence is associated with significant medical, hygiene and social problems. Use of perineal ultrasound as a bedside test immediately after vaginal delivery could improve the diagnosis and determining the degree of these perineal traumas. This increased detection could lead to improved primary repair of the external and internal anal sphincter resulting in reduced rates of anal incontinence and improved quality of life for women</detailed_description>
