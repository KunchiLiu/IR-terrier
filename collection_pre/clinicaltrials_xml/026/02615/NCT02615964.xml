	<brief_summary>Patients presenting to UIC rheumatology clinic with Raynaud's disorder and scleroderma will be asked to participate. 10 hands of patients with both Raynaud's disorder and scleroderma will be studied. This research study is being done to better understand Raynaud's disease and to assess the role of blood flow measurement in diagnosing the disorder, specifically, through data collected by an MRI procedure called NOVA FLOW. NOVA is a blood flow measurement software system owned by the study's sponsor, VasSol, Inc.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nova Cold Hands Raynaud's Disorder, a Disease Which Results in Decreased Blood Flow to the Hands and Feet.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to obtain volumetric flow data on 10 hands of patients with Raynaud's disorder and scleroderma at UIC rheumatology clinic and compare these results with previously established volumetric flow data for non-Raynaud's patients. Through this analysis, the invstigators will be able to better understand and correlate subjective and objective measures of both disease presentation and progression. Collection of cross sectional data will allow us to better address the following questions Is it possible to more precisely diagnose patients with Raynaud's disorder based on NOVA analysis as well as clinical findings Is it possible to stratify patients with Raynaud's disorder into categories which may allow: i. Prediction of disease course and prognosis ii. Prediction of response to specific treatment modalities (vasodilators vs anti-coagulation vs surgical or chemical denervation) The investigators propose to collect measurements of disease severity as well as functional assessment of patients Raynaud's and scleroderma in order to address the following questions c. Does NOVA flow and volume data correlate with measures of Raynaud's and scleroderma disease severity index d. Does NOVA flow and volume data correlate with OT assessment of hand functionality.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusionary criteria for this study will be patients with a diagnosis of Raynaud's disease and scleroderma (per ACR criteria for the diagnosis for systemic sclerosis) and age between 1885. Exclusion criteria for Raynaud's patients will include history of botox injection to the hands within 6 months, nonEnglish speaking patients and those unable to understand informed consent, and the presence of confounding medical conditions preventing the patient from full participation.</criteria>
