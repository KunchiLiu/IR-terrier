	<brief_title>Neurofeedback-enhanced Mindfulness Meditation in Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty subjects in total will participate in this study. Subjects will be randomized to focused-attention meditation training with or without the neurofeedback device, MUSE. Subjects will be asked to practice ~10 min of daily meditation for 6-8 weeks. Neuropsychological testing will be performed at the beginning of the study and after six weeks of training. At this time point, those randomized to the non-MUSE group will be given a device and asked to train for an additional two weeks. At the conclusion of the study, all subjects will also undergo a brief telephone or in-person exit interview regarding their experiences using the MUSE device. Primary endpoint: change in Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory Secondary endpoints: change in the following: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV Digit Span and Symbol-Digit Coding, Trail-Making Test, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised, percentage of EEG activity associated with alpha, beta, or theta activity.</detailed_description>
