	<brief_title>Development of Novel Designed Force Plate for Measuring the Balance Ability for the Elders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many studies using force plates to examine the elders' balance ability for fall prevention. However, few studies compare the reliability differences among age in postural sway measurements even though many studies find significantly greater postural sway in the elder population than compared to the younger cohort. Investigation of this age difference is important for choosing variables to represent their postural sway improvement in order to determine the intervention outcome.</detailed_description>
