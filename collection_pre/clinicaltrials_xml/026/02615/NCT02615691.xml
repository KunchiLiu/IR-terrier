	<criteria>1. Participant is &lt; 6 years old at the time of screening 2. Participant is previously untreated or minimally treated 3. Participant has severe hemophilia A (Factor VIII (FVIII) &lt; 1%) 4. Participant is immune competent with a CD4+ count &gt; 200 cells/mm^3 5. Parent or legally authorized representative is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol Additional inclusion criteria for Part B (Immune tolerance induction (ITI)) 1. Parent or legal representative has/have voluntarily provided signed informed consent for ITI portion 2. Participant has a confirmed inhibitor titer (≥ 0.6 Bethesda unit (BU)) and requires ITI therapy 1. Participant has detectable FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥ 0.6 BU) 2. Participant has a history of FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥ 0.6) at any time prior to screening 3. Participant has been diagnosed with an inherited or acquired hemostatic defect other than hemophilia A 4. Participant has been previously treated with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, any type of FVIII concentrate other than ADVATE or BAX 855 or was administered ADVATE or BAX 855 for &gt; 3 EDs at any time prior to screening 5. Participant has received any kind of bloodtransfusion such as packed red blood cells (PRBC), platelets or plasma at any time prior to screening 6. The participant's weight is &lt; 5 kg 7. Participant's platelet count is &lt; 100,000/mL 8. Participant has known hypersensitivity towards mouse or hamster proteins, PEG or Tween 80 9. Participant has severe chronic hepatic dysfunction in his medical history or at the time of screening 10. Participant has severe renal impairment 11. Participant has current or recent (&lt; 30 days) use of other PEGylated drugs prior to study participation or is scheduled to use such drugs during study participation 12. Participant is scheduled to receive during the course of the study a systemic immunomodulating drug other than antiretroviral chemotherapy 13. Participant has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational device during the course of this study 14. Parent or legally authorized representative has a medical, psychiatric, or cognitive illness or recreational drug/alcohol use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect subject safety or compliance 15. Parent, legally authorized representative or participant are a member of the team conducting this study or is in a dependent relationship with one of the study team members Additional exclusion criteria for Part B (ITI) 1. Spontaneous disappearance of the inhibitor prior to ITI 2. FVIII inhibitor titer ≥ 0.6 BU is not confirmed by a second new blood sample and determined at the central laboratory 3. Inability or unwillingness to comply with the protocol</criteria>
