	<detailed_description>Biliary strictures in the absence of a mass are a clinical challenge, as current accepted means of sampling provide suboptimal accuracy. Both biliary brushings for cytology and fluoroscopically-directed biopsies produce highly-variable results. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration has also been employed with variable results. An additional modality, using a single-operator cholangioscope during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to obtain cholangioscopically-directed biopsies offers promise in increasing the yield of sampling. Initial observational studies have shown an improved diagnostic yield, but the technique has not been tested in a randomized, medical effectiveness study to better characterize its actual clinical impact. We aim to compare the technique of biopsy-on-biopsy derived sampling via single-operator cholangioscopy with standard fluoroscopically-directed biopsies and brushings in a pilot study. We also aim to perform a medical effectiveness study on the early use of single-operator cholangioscopically (SOC) in the evaluation of undiagnosed biliary strictures.</detailed_description>
