	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib/IIa, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and clinical activity of oral GSK2636771 in combination with intravenous (IV) paclitaxel in two independent subject populations: subjects with PTEN-deficient, advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. This study will be conducted in two phases: the Dose Escalation Phase and the Dose Expansion Phase. The Dose Escalation Phase (Phase Ib) is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of GSK2636771 administered in combination with paclitaxel. The Dose Expansion Phase (Phase IIa) will further evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the RP2D as determined in the Dose Escalation Phase.</brief_summary>
