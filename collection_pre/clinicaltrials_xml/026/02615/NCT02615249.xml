	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Metal Panel Allergens: Dose Response Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 48-hour application (approximate) of investigational allergen panels, excipient controls and corresponding reference allergens will be applied to the skin of human subjects to test for potential positive allergic responses. Test sites will be evaluated at 3-4, 7-8, 10-14 and 19-23 days after application. Ascending allergen dosages will be randomized within each panel into three different configurations which will be randomly assigned to subjects as they enter the study. The investigators and subjects will be aware of the allergens and the patch test doses but will not be aware of the location of individual allergens within each panel.</detailed_description>
