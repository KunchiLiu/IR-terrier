	<brief_summary>Researchers of the three collaborating universities implement a pilot observational study in "Gilgel Gibe Field Research Center", a health and demographic surveillance system run by the Jimma University, Ethiopia. In this setting, the investigators plan to study risk factors in young men for the development of common mental disorders and psychotic symptoms and the stability of distinct symptoms of mental disorders in the community. The investigators will explore in particular the impact of lifestyle on mental health in young men, including the traditional habit of chewing khat leaves, which contain amphetamine-like cathinone. Furthermore, the investigators want to demonstrate the reliability and validity of assessments performed by trained local interviewers.</brief_summary>
