	<brief_summary>This study will assess the effects of the Erigo applied as part of the early mobilization program in the Trauma ICU at the University of Kentucky. It is our hypothesis, that with the Erigo, critically ill patients will tolerate verticalization and mobilization earlier and safely resulting in improved outcomes measured by increased mobility and strength on ICU discharge, decreased requirements for mechanical ventilation, reduced complication rates and decreased ICU and hospital LOS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of the Erigo Machine on Functional Recovery in ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The "Erigo" by Hocoma is a combination of tilt table with a robotic stepper device allowing for cyclic leg loading. Erigo now also includes Functional Electrical Stimulation to optimize active neuromuscular stimulation. It allows for protected gradual verticalization and mobilization based on patient tolerance and progress. It has been shown to improve orthostatic tolerance, cerebral blood flow and muscle strength. Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial will compare two groups. The patients that meet inclusion criteria will be randomized into either the treatment group or a control group. General ICU mobility guidelines consist of scaled activity related to the patients' stability. The control group will get the general ICU mobility treatments and the treatment group will have one mobility treatment replaced with the Erigo treatment.</detailed_description>
