	<brief_summary>Perioperative administration of steroids has been demonstrated to reduce systemic inflammatory response in infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. However, data on effects of steroids on clinical outcomes are lacking. Hence the hypothesis of the present study: intraoperative administration of dexamethasone reduces complication rates and improves clinical outcomes in infants undergoing repair of congenital heart defects under cardiopulmonary bypass.</brief_summary>
