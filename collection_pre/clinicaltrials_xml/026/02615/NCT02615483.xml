	<brief_title>Lumbar Spinal Fusion - Web-based Platform Targeting Anxiety and Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will seek to reduce pre- and postoperative anxiety, depression and functional impairments using alternative cognitive and educative methods, targeting the underlying factors for development of anxiety and depression. It is known that there is a rationale behind using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in order to reduce pre- and postoperatively anxiety and depression. The main assumption within CBT is that patientsÂ´ perceptions create their thoughts and beliefs, which influence their feelings and subsequently their behaviour. The features of WP in this study will seek in several ways to exceed this expected behaviour modification. The preliminary choices of features on the WP are made in order to prevent catastrophic images and thereby reduce anxiety and depression. The WP will offer patients non-catastrophic images through animated information mirroring the course of treatment, which will aim to influence their beliefs, feelings and their behaviour. To examine the effect of the WP versus conventional information and course of rehabilitation, on patients` degree of anxiety and depression, a randomized controlled trial will be preformed. A total of 114 patients scheduled for elective instrumented LSF will be included and randomly assigned to the control group or to the intervention group receiving access to the WP.</detailed_description>
