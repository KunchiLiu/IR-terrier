	<brief_title>Pilot Feasibility of Rice Bran Supplementation in Nicaraguan Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rice bran is a globally accessible, underutilized food ingredient with an array of beneficial nutrients (e.g. phytochemicals and prebiotics) that promote health and potentially prevent diseases. The investigators will determine if dietary rice bran intake can modulate the infant gut microbiome and metabolome to promote gut immunity for the benefit of preventing diarrheal diseases that increase risk for malnutrition and stunting. The investigators hope to learn about the feasibility of dietary supplementation of heat-stabilized rice bran in weaning children living in regions with increased susceptibility to diarrhea and malnutrition, and whether or not rice bran consumption can modulate the stool microbiome and metabolome.</detailed_description>
