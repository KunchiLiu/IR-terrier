	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of monitoring patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) after a hospitalization for COPD exacerbation or pneumonia. The patients are randomized to receive either standard treatment and follow up, or standard treatment and follow up, plus tele monitoring of key clinical parameters and symptoms for six months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tele Health Monitoring Service for Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Telemedicine is a relatively new approach for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disease. Telemedicine, for monitoring disease exacerbation, is the focus area of our research. The patient monitoring offers the possibility of early initiation of treatment of patients who has evidence of COPD exacerbation or pulmonary infection. The self-monitoring of potential exacerbation is started after a hospitalization, and is done by the patient on a daily (not on weekends) basis initially. After one month the monitoring is made at least three times weekly during the rest of the intervention period of six months. With the help of the monitoring equipment, the patient answers a short series of health related questions, and makes simple measurements of oxygen saturation, heart rate, lung function and weight. Data is sent to the hospital, and here the staff can assess the data and respond to them the same day, with a phone call to the patient, if the patient's condition has changed. The selected telemonitoring-equipment, consists of a monitoring systems for the assessment of key clinical parameters and symptoms. All patients, in the intervention group as well as in the control group, are trained in the use of a standardized self-treatment plan. It is expected that the monitoring of symptoms and signs will support patient empowerment. The investigation is planned to assess the clinical and economic effects of the intervention.</detailed_description>
