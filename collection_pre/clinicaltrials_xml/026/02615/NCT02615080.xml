	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase 2 trial evaluating CRD007 administered orally b.i.d for 14 weeks for the treatment of asthma. CRD007 will be given as add on to a background of commonly used controller medication, i.e. inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with or without long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA). By gradually reducing the background controller medication, the efficacy and safety of CRD007 will be evaluated on top of several dose levels of this medication.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present trial will include subjects with diagnosed asthma. The trial involves a total of 11 visits (Visit 1-2 are screening visits, visit 3 randomisation visit, visits 4-10 treatment visits and visit 11 follow-up visit).
