	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that toddlers with parents who are randomized to a parenting intervention and toddlers with parents who are randomized to the maternal intervention focused on maternal diet and physical activity will be more likely to have weight status within normal and to consume a healthy diet and engage in physical activity than toddlers with parents in a placebo (safety) intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Toddler Overweight Prevention Study Among Low-Income Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Overweight is a serious public health problem which can begin in early childhood. Factors which contribute to overweight include: overfeeding, excessive intakes of fat and sugar; frequent sedentary activities (i.e. television watching). Overweight, defined as a BMI &gt; 95th percentile, in early childhood has reached epidemic proportions with 14% of 2-5 year olds overweight and 26.2% "at risk of overweight," defined as a BMI &gt; 85th percentile (Ogden et al., 2006). Dietary and physical activity patterns established early in life track over time, making the first few years of life an ideal time to help families establish healthy eating and physical activity behaviors and avoid overweight. This project works to identify techniques that could prevent overweight. Purpose of Study: The investigators are collaborating with the Anne Arundel County, MD WIC Program and the University of Maryland's Pediatric Ambulatory Center to implement strategies that will prevent overweight among toddlers. The project focuses on the dietary, physical activity, and growth patterns of WIC toddlers. The investigators are conducting a 3-cell randomized trial consisting of: 1) a maternal intervention focusing on healthy diet and physical activity patterns for mothers; 2) a toddler parenting intervention focusing on parenting, limit setting, and development strategies; and 3) an intervention on child safety. The interventions are implemented over 3 months, with 8 sessions. The investigators hypothesize that altering maternal behavior will have a positive impact on the growth and development of the toddler by preventing behaviors that lead to overweight among children. The parenting intervention will improve parenting skills by offering information on proper approaches to feeding, discipline and educational play. The investigators will compare the growth patterns of toddlers whose mothers were randomized to the maternal and parenting interventions with those in the safety intervention. This study design allows us to examine the mechanisms linking the interventions to improvements in diet, physical activity, and growth. In addition, the investigators will conduct the safety promotion intervention for the attention control group, considering the high risk of unintentional injuries among the toddlers from low-income families. The investigators also hypothesize that the safety promotion intervention will reduce the safety problems of the toddlers' homes. The underlying mechanisms will be examined, if there is a significant intervention effect.</detailed_description>
