	<brief_summary>In this study, we use positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain mechanisms that contribute to physical exercise-induced reward. We examine whether acute physical exercise releases endogenous opioids in the brain, and whether it modulates brain responses to viewing appetizing foods. Unraveling these mechanism are instrumental from a public health perspective, given the undisputed positive health effects of physical exercise.</brief_summary>
