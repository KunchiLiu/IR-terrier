	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with the combination of alpha-type-1-polarized dendritic cell (αDC1) vaccines and tumor-selective chemokine modulation (CKM) will promote the infiltration of vaccination-induced CD8+ CTLs to tumor lesions and subsequently tumor regression with improved patient survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Type-1 Polarized Dendritic Cell (αDC1) Vaccine in Combination With Tumor-Selective Chemokine Modulation (Interferon-α2b, Rintatolimod, and Celecoxib) in Subjects With Chemo-Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastatic colorectal cancer is a major health concern in the United States, and the second leading cause of death due to cancer. The purpose of this trial is to see if the combination of the study vaccine and drugs in patients with this disease can prevent the growth of cancer and prevent new tumors from growing. The study drugs are a combination of celecoxib (Celebrex®), Interferon-α2b (IFN), and rintatolimod (Ampligen®), or CKM.</detailed_description>
