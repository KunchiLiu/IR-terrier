	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to allow evaluation of long-term clinical effect and safety outcome of treatment with AP-CD/LD, as well as to allow patients to benefit from extended treatment duration with AP-CD/LD after they have successfully completed the Phase 3 core study IN 11 004 ('core study', a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled Phase 3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of AP CD/LD versus IR CD/LD in fluctuating PD patients).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of AP-CD/LD in Fluctuating Parkinson's Disease Patients Who Completed IN 11 004</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a multi-center, global, open-label study in adult suffering from fluctuating Parkinson's disease subjects who have successfully completed the core study IN 11 004. After signing informed consent and meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, eligible subjects will be enrolled into a 12-month open-label extension and receive the AP-CD/LD as needed. Efficacy and safety will be assessed throughout the study period.</detailed_description>
