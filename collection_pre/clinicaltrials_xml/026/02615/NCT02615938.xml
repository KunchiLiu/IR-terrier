	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquin (HCQ) in Pediatric Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an explorative, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled investigation of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in pediatric ILD. The treatments are organized in START and STOP blocks, which can be initiated in sequence, as needed by the subjects. Each patient can participate in each block only once. In the START block subjects are randomized to parallel-groups, then the placebo group is switched to active drug. In the STOP block, subjects on HCQ are randomized into parallel-groups treated with placebo or HCQ to investigate the withdrawal of HCQ for assessment of its efficacy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Patients should be clinically stable during baseline (between Visit 1 and 2) for inclusion into the study 1. To determine this, attending physicians can use SpO2 in room air for patients on room air or on O2supplement; the absolute difference on SpO2 is expected not to be ≥ 5% between Visit 1 and 2. For patients on respiratory support, the summary key parameters should not change ≥ 20% between Visit 1 and 2 and 2. No major changes in other medications between Visit 1 and 2 2. Mature newborn ≥ 37 weeks of gestation, age ≥ 3 wks or infants and children (till age 18 y) or previously preterm (≤ 37 weeks of gestation) babies or children and adults of all ages if chILD genetically diagnosed (see inclusion criterion 3.) 3. Diagnosis of chronic (≥ 3 wks of duration) diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD = chILD), defined in at least one of the following ways: 1. chILD genetically diagnosed Surfactant dysfunction disorders including patients with disease causing mutations in SFTPC, SFTPB, ABCA3, TTF1 (Nkx21), further extremely rare entities. In this case, also previously preterm (≤ 37 weeks of gestation) babies or children and adults of all ages can be included into the study. 2. chILD histologically diagnosed Chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI) Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) Lipoid pneumonitis Cholesterol pneumonia Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) PAP after the exclusion of mutations in GMCSFRa/b and GMCSF autoantibodies Microvasculopathy Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia Diffuse Alveolar Damage and Acute Interstitial Pneumonia Acute Fibrinous and Organizing Pneumonia Respiratory BronchiolitisInterstitial Lung Disease Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) Sarcoidosis Follicular bronchitis/bronchiolitis/Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) unless associated with immunodeficiency Giant cell interstitial pneumonia (GIP) Storage disease with primary pulmonary involvement (e.g. Niemann Pick) Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (cellular interstitial pneumonitis, histiocytoid pneumonia) Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) HermanskyPudlak Syndrome Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (if not suitable for Stop EAA study of the chILDconsortium) Other histology diagnosing chILD 3. chILD clinically diagnosed Unclear RDS in the mature newborn, after the exclusion as far as possible of infectious, lung structural, vascular and all other known causes of chILD; the presence of radiological evidence of chILD; and the presence of either tachypnoea, dyspnoea or oxygen requirement, or need of mechanical ventilation. Idiopathic pulmonary haemorrhage (haemosiderosis) 4. Start block: no HCQ treatment in the last 12 weeks Stop block: stable HCQ treatment for at least the last 12 weeks 5. Ability of subject or/and legal representatives to understand character and individual consequences of clinical trial. 6. Signed and dated informed consent of the subject (if subject has the ability) and the representatives (of underaged children) must be available before start of any specific trial procedures. Exclusion criteria: chILD primarily related to developmental disorders chILD primarily related to growth abnormalities reflecting deficient alveolarisation chILD related to chronic aspiration chILD related to immunodeficiency chILD related to abnormalities in lung vessel structure chILD related to organ transplantation/organ rejection/GvHD chILD related to recurrent infections Acute severe infectious exacerbations Known hypersensitivity to HCQ, or other ingredients of the tablets (lactosemonohydrate, povidone, maize starch, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, macrogol or titanium dioxide (E 171), silicon dioxide or mannitol), to sucroseoctaacetate or sodium saccharine. Proven retinopathy or maculopathy Glucose6phosphatedehydrogenase deficiency resulting in favism or hemolytic anemia Myasthenia gravis Hematopoetic disorders Pregnancy and lactation (Women with childbearing potential have to practice a medically accepted contraception during trial and till three months after the end of the treatment with HCQ, and a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) should be existent before trial. Reliable contraception are systematic contraceptives (oral, implant, injection). Women that are sterile by surgery can participate in the trial). Participation in other clinical trials during the present clinical trial or not beyond the time of 4 halflives of the medication used, at least one week. Hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucosegalactosemalabsorption Renal insufficiency at screening, defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients age 3 to 8 weeks &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients ≥ 8 weeks of age (KDIGO guideline 2012, K/DOQI guideline 2002) Liver disease, gastrointestinal disorder, haematological disorder, epilepsy or other neurological disorder, psoriasis, porphyria at the discretion of the treating physician Simultaneous prescription of other potentially nephrotoxic or hepatotoxic medication at the discretion of the treating physician</criteria>
