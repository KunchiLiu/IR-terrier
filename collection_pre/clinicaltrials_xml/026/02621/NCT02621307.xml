	<brief_title>Effect of Salba &amp; Flax on Postprandial Glycemia and Subjective Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary fibre has been implicated in improving many risk factors associated with Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). However, on average, Norther Americans consume less than half of the recommended amount set by health agencies. It has been proposed that the health benefits of dietary fibre may be attritbuted to rheological characteristics such as viscosity. Salvia hispanica L (Salba) and Flax are nutritionally similar. The primary objective of this research trial is to study the effects of Salba and Flax on postprandial glycemia and appetite in healthy individuals.</detailed_description>
