	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting African American prostate cancer survivors to a 12 week physical activity intervention study of three arms (aerobics, resistance training, and usual care) through physician referral and community advertisement strategies. In addition, the investigators will investigate the acceptance rate of the intervention and gather preliminary results on the effect of exercise on African American men's urinary and sexual functions. These data can then be used to refine the intervention and its implementation model, and to inform the submission of a larger grant to the National Institutes of Health.</brief_summary>
