	<brief_summary>Chlorogenic acid has demonstrated promising effects in the treatment of glycemic control, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin secretion, among others. The above mentioned findings show that Chlorogenic acid has an excellent potential for the control of glucose as well as insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Chlorogenic Acid on Patients With Impaired Glucose Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 30 patients with a diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance in accordance with the American Diabetes Association criteria. The patients received 400 mg capsules of Chlorogenic acid or placebo, three times daily 1/ 2 hour before meals for 90 days. Before and after intervention the investigators evaluated: 2 hours plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, fasting glucose and blood pressure body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, very-low-density lipoprotein, creatinine, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Were calculated: Areas under the curve of glucose and insulin were calculated with de Trapezoidal formula. Total insulin secretion was evaluated with the Insulinogenic index and the insulin sensitivity was estimated using the Matsuda index.</detailed_description>
