	<brief_summary>Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MEN) is a common problem in children, affecting 7-10% of all 7 year olds. MEN is often leading to psychosocial problems because of its burden and stigmatism. The only available medical treatment option is the vasopressin analogum Desmopressin®. However, according to the literature, only one third of patients shows a good treatment response, defined as more than 90% of reduced bed wetting. Furthermore, treatment with Desmopressin® may lead to psychosocial problems, high costs and potentially dangerous side effects like water intoxication and hypertension. Copeptin, mirroring arginine vasopressin (AVP), has been shown to be significantly lower in patients with MEN compared to controls and lower in patients with severe bed wetting compared to patients with only slight bed wetting.</brief_summary>
