	<brief_summary>As explained in detail in a recently published hypothesis article (Hladik F. A new hypothesis on HIV cure. F1000Research, 4:77 (2015)), the investigators hypothesize that NRTI drugs may reduce the likelihood of HIV eradication by promoting the survival of cells with integrated provirus. In this study, the investigators will test whether daily oral use of two NTRI drugs, tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada Pill), induces changes in the upper and lower gut mucosa that are congruent with supporting this hypothesis.</brief_summary>
