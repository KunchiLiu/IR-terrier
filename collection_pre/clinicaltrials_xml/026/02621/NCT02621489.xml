	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to use Exenatide long-acting release (LAR) [Bydureon] to minimize vascular remodeling and neointima formation after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and to accelerate stent endothelialisation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects on Re-endothelialisation With Bydureon Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exenatide LAR will be given as a once-weekly (s.c.) dose of Bydureon (2 mg) add on to Insulin in combination with Metformin. If patients are Insulin na√Øve (both groups) an initial dose of 10U (s.c.) at bedtime will be started, and further up-titrated to achieve a fP-glucose levels at 6 mmol/l. Standard care for post myocardial infarction will be given after PCI. Primary objectives: To test whether Bydureon, add on to Insulin Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) + Metformin, is superior vs. Insulin NPH + Metformin alone, in covered stent struts Secondary objectives: To test whether Bydureon, add on to Insulin NPH + Metformin, is superior vs. Insulin NPH + Metformin alone: in cardiac and endothelial functions</detailed_description>
