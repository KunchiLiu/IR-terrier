The aim of the study is to describe the immunogenicity and safety of the quadrivalent cell culture-derived influenza vaccine compared to the trivalent egg-derived influenza vaccine among subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine in Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects are randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to NBP607-QIV versus Agrippal S1. To assess the immunogenicity, antibody levels are evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition(HI) assay from sera obtained at pre-vaccination and 28 days post-vaccination. To assess the safety, solicited adverse events for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited adverse events for 28 days post-vaccination are assessed and reported. The serious adverse events are collected during 6 months post-vaccination.</detailed_description>
