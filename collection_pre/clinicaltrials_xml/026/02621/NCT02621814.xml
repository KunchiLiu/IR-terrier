	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Friso Formula-fed With Low Glycation and Aggregation Protein About Infant's Growth Rate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Sample size：Referring to previous studies and Classic statistics textbook, sample size will be 100 cases in each group, half males and half females. Considering Lost losing follow-up and exit, the actual sample size will be 120 cases in each group, 30 cases(15baby boy, 15baby girl) in each hospital. 2. Data records 2.1 Original records: Subjects' follow-up care cards are original files in this clinical trial in duplicate. One copy should be saved in hospital. Original records shall be traceable. Each researcher must strictly follow the principle of GCP. It must be ensured that he will record any observation and discovery into follow-up care card and case report form (CRF).It must be ensured that all data are no difference, not getting optional change. When he make any correction, he must not change the original record, only add description and explain the reason, correction need to be signed and dated. Case report form (CRF): In triplicate, it will be de delivered to sponsor, main institution of clinical research and participating institution of clinical research .Following the principle of GCP, subjects' name should not appear for In order to ensure their privacy. Subjects' name must be filled in the initials. All of the project will be marked × in □. If some inspection items are not examined for some reason, it should be filled in: not examined. If the specific formula dosage is unknown, it should be filled in: unknown. When filled in the numbers, it should be filled in □. If left side is empty, it should be filled by 0.No null term or missing item. Researchers must ensure that all data must be consistent with the original record. If digit is not enough, it should be filled on right side. If left side is empty, it should be filled by 0.No null term or missing item. Researchers must ensure that all data must be consistent with the original record. If modifying, he should draw a horizontal line in the middle of the original record text, sidenote modified, and then sign the names of the modifier and the date. He must not smear or cover original record. Data of subjects' guardian: It should be recorded, according to the design and definition of observational data table project. Extremum principles: The data, deviated significantly or outside the acceptable range clinically, must be verified. Clinical doctors must make the necessary instructions. Data registration and preservation: Every time after the visit, researchers should record the required information into the case report timely. After the end of each subjects' observed period, researchers should accurately record relevant information formed of data into CRF from original data within 7 days. CRF, informed consent and other data should be examined and signed by project leader，then saved into archive office of institution. If the problem is found, researcher should Timely deal with it and record. 2.2 Data monitoring Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Evidence-Based Pediatrics (CJEBP) will be in charge of data monitoring of the clinical trial. During the trial, CJEBP will investigate to 8 research centers for their quality of practice at least once, without any announcement. The monitoring objects include doctors, nurses and guardians of the objects enrolled in this trial. 2.2.1 Monitoring to the doctor: the quality of explaining of research to objects' guardian and whether they sign the papered notice; Random of distribution; the accurate measurement of body length, weight and head-circumference; judgement of gut intolerance; record of stool frequency; the pictures of stools and eye secretions. 2.2.2 Monitoring to the nurses: the accurate of the measuring equipment; the correctness of the measuring method; the rightness of data recording (mean of 2 measurements); the management of trial formula (reception time, check lot number, distribution objects, date and signature, recovery objects, date, quantity of formula and signature) 2.2.3 Investigator's responsibility: random inspection 1-2 hospitals, including whether mixed feeding or mixed with other brand formula; the usage of trial formula; regularly follow-up; to take photo of fresh stools and eye secretions. 2.3 Data management 2.3.1 According to the project of the CRF，administrator will establish WeChat client, test and modify this client, and entry data ensuring the accuracy of this client. Each researcher in each hospital uploads the measured data to administrator by WeChat client on that day when he completes one case observation and measurement. In order to ensure the accuracy of the data. Administrator should compare data uploaded by WeChat client with original CRF .Subjects' guardians will upload photos of stool character and Eye secretion to administrator by WeChat client at 3 point of follow-up time. 2.3.2 Generation and correction of doubt, quality control (QC) and database shutdown: After completing data input and proofreading, data managers will verify the reliability, integrity and accuracy of data in accordance with the requirements of clinical trial scheme. If he find lack of content or logic contradiction or fill in wrong or uncertainty of data, clinical arbitrator will send it to clinical trial center In the form of data question table(DQF).Researchers will answer to questions as soon as possible and return it. Data administrator will modify, confirm and correct data according to researcher's answer. After solving all of problems, Quality control person will check the quality of database according to QC plan. Then he will close the database after check clear. 2.3.3 Data check lock and transmit blindly: Data administrator submit data management reports, and request meeting instance about data-check blindly attending by principal investigator, statistical analyst, data managers, arbitrator, and sponsors. Checking data blindly, signing blindly data-check resolution after meeting, lock in the database; locked data will be analyzed by person of statistical analysis. 3. Statistic analysis 3.1 Analysis sets 3.1.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS): It Includes randomly into all group and taken once experimental formula at least and one follow-up record at least. The lack of primary outcome endpoint will be evaluated by last observation carry forward (LOCF). FAS: Crowd used to analysis of primary and secondary efficacy indicators. 3.1.2 Per Protocol Set (PPS): It includes all of cases conformed to the trial plan, good compliance, not use other formula during the period of trial, completeness in CRF and content. The missing cases that treatment time reaches certain time during the period of trial can enter into PPS data set. Missing data will be transferred by worst observation carried forward (WOCF).After completion of the trial, data set will be determined blindly. Crowd used to analysis of primary and secondary efficacy indicators. 3.2 statistical analysis plan 3.2.1 General principle: All of the statistical test must be two-sided test .P&lt;0.05 is considered to be statistically significant difference for all tests. Mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, 25% and 75% quintile are used for statistical description of measurement data. Count data or level data is described by frequency. SAS 9.1.3 statistical software is used for statistical analysis. 3.2.2 Analysis of missing cases lists the cases into group, falling off and completed. Analysis sets of case number, loss rate and comparison between groups should be analyzed by chi square test or Fisher's exact probability method. 3.2.3 Effectiveness evaluation: Normal distribution was tested for measurement index (the growth rate of height, body weight and head circumference, stool frequency at the end of 4, 8 and 12 weeks after feeding) . If data accord with normal distribution, the difference between the experimental group and the control group will be calculated by t test, otherwise by t' test. If the data do not conform to the normal distribution, the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used. Test level is a =0.05 (bilateral). The count data (constipation and Eye secretions at the end of 4, 8 and 12 weeks after feeding) will be expressed as the number of cases and the percentage. If the percentage was below 5% or the number of case was less than 30, Fisher exact probability method will be used, otherwise chi square test will be used. Test level is a =0.05 (bilateral). 4. Quality control Standardized operation procedures should be established in all of research process. 4.1 Qualification of research institution: Research institution must be community health service centers qualified for baby healthy check-up. 4.2 Qualification of researcher: The researchers need GCP training and work under the guidance of senior professionals. 4.3 Test quality control measures: ①Before the start of clinical trials, researchers (including paramedics) must receive training for measurement of height, weight and head circumference; ②checking measurement bed before measurement; ③researcher must compare scale on plastic flexible rule with that on standard steel rule and change plastic flexible if error&gt;0.1cm.③The pictures of the feces and eyes will be scored by 2 specialists under the condition of unknowing the group. ④The specialist must be responsible for experimental formula, counter locked, storage at room temperature away from light. The remaining experimental formula will be stored separately, registering number. At the end of trial, the remaining experimental formula will be sent back to sponsor.⑤Monitor: Monitor will be appointed by sponsor, ensuring subjects' interests during period of trial. Trial record and data report must be true, accurate, complete and correct, ensuring that trial must comply with both approved plan and Relevant laws.</detailed_description>
