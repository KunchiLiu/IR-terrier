	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind Phase III clinical trial. The aim of the study is to describe the immunogenicity and safety of the trivalent cell culture-derived influenza vaccine compared to the trivalent egg-derived influenza vaccine among subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Egg-derived Influenza Vaccine and Cell Culture-derived Influenza Vaccine in Healthy Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects are randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to NBP607-QIV versus Agrippal S1. To assess the immunogenicity, antibody levels are evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition(HI) assay from sera obtained at pre-vaccination and 28 days post-vaccination. To assess the safety, solicited adverse events for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited adverse events for 28 days post-vaccination are assessed and reported. The serious adverse events are collected during 6 months post-vaccination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy children and adolescents aged 6 months to 18 years. Those who was born after normal pregnancy period(37 weeks) for aged 6 months to 2 years. Those whose legally acceptable representative have given written consent to participate in the study and comply with all study requirements. Subjects who are hypersensitive to any component of vaccine, i.e., eggs, chicken or chicken products. Subjects with immune deficiency disorder. History of GuillainBarre syndrome. Thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorder contraindicating intramuscular vaccination. Subjects who experienced fever within 72 hours before vaccination or with the febrile disease(exceeding 38.0â„ƒ) on screening day or with any acute respiratory infection. Subjects who had received immunosuppressant or immunemodifying drug within 3 months before screening. Subjects who had received blood products or immunoglobulin within 3 months before screening. Subjects who had received influenza vaccination within 6 months prior to the screening. Subjects who had received other vaccination within a month before screening, or those who had another vaccination scheduled within a month after study vaccination. Subjects who had participated in other clinical trial within 4 weeks prior to study vaccination. Subjects who had done blood donation within a week prior to study vaccination or planned blood donation within 7 months after study vaccination. Subjects with clinically significant chronic disease or malignant cancer. Pregnant women, breastfeeding women. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study.</criteria>
