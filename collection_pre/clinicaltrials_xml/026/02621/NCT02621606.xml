	<brief_summary>The purpose of this open-label, 3-part study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of [11C]MK-6884 as a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agent for quantifying muscarinic 4 (M4) positive allosteric modulator (PAM) receptor density in brain regions of interest. The study will enroll healthy participants (Parts I and II) and participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD)(Part III). The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the average intra-subject test-retest (T-RT) variability of tracer uptake in brain regions of interest is ≤20%.</brief_summary>
