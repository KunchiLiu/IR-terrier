	<brief_summary>The investigators have shown that a single dose of ultraviolet irradiation (as found in sunlight) will lower blood pressure for around one hour. They are now testing whether daily UVA for two weeks will produce a sustained fall in BP in patients with high blood pressure. They will also measure the effect of daily UVA on other cardiovascular risk factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Daily Ultraviolet Therapy to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological studies suggest that sunlight reduces all cause mortality, and particularly cardiovascular mortality. The investigators have previously shown vasodilatation and a transient fall in blood pressure following irradiation of human volunteers with 2 standard erythemal doses of UVA radiation. This was independent of vitamin D and temperature rise and correlated with a nitric oxide synthase independent mobilisation of NO stores from the skin to the systemic circulation. In this randomised, sham-controlled, cross-over double blind study, they will measure whether twice daily UVA administration can produce a sustained fall in BP and other cardiovascular risk factors in a cohort of pre-hypertensive patients.</detailed_description>
