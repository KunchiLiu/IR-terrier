	<criteria>Acute (less than 1 week in duration) severe pain necessitating use of IV opioids in the judgement of the treating attending physician Use of other opioids or tramadol within past 24 hours: to avoid introducing assembly bias related to recent opioid use, since this may affect baseline levels of pain and need for analgesics. Prior adverse reaction to hydromorphone, morphine, or acetaminophen. Chronic pain syndrome: frequently recurrent or daily pain for at least 3 months results in modulation of pain perception which is thought to be due to downregulation of pain receptors. Examples of chronic pain syndromes include sickle cell anemia, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and peripheral neuropathies. Alcohol intoxication: the presence of alcohol intoxication as judged by the treating physician may alter pain perception. SBP &lt;100 mm Hg: Opioids can produce peripheral vasodilation that may result in orthostatic hypotension. HR &lt; 60/min: Opioids can cause bradycardia. Oxygen saturation &lt; 95% on room air: For this study, oxygen saturation must be 95% or above on room air in order to be enrolled. Use of MAO inhibitors in past 30 days: MAO inhibitors have been reported to intensify the effects of at least one opioid drug causing anxiety, confusion and significant respiratory depression or coma.
