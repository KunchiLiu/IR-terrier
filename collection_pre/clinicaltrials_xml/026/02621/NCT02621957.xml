	<brief_summary>This study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of pravastatin with and without concomitant GDC-0810 administration in healthy female subjects of non-childbearing potential. During Period 1 (Day -1 to Day 4) PK parameters of pravastatin will be determined in the absence of GDC-0810. During Period 2 (Days 5-28) PK parameters of pravastatin will be determined in the presence of GDC-0810.</brief_summary>
