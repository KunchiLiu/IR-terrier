	<brief_summary>It is a prospective and multi-center clinical research in China to compare the efficacy, safety and related impact factors between TACE alone and TACE combined with synchronous multi-point MWA/RFA for large and huge liver cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TACE Combined With Synchronous Radiofrequency /Microwave Ablation to Treat Large and Huge Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is an open random prospective phase III clinical trial conducted by Principal Investigator Professor Jian-Hua Wang. Investigators in twenty-five hospitals in China participate in. Patients with unresectable large HCC (&gt;5cm in diameter) and huge HCC (&gt;=10cm in diameter) are enrolled. The investigators propose to recruitment 280 patients who are randomly assigned into the combined group (treated with TACE and synchronous ablation) and the control group (treated with TACE alone) according to the proportion of 1:1, which means 140 patients in each group. The criteria of inclusion and exclusion, and the methods of lab tests, imaging modality and treatment procedures are the same.</detailed_description>
