	<brief_summary>The overall goals of this renewal are to replicate the findings of Seamos Saludables in Latina women, increase the effectiveness of the intervention, and measure intervention-related changes in clinical biomarkers. We will enhance the existing intervention by incorporating participant feedback (desire for greater interactivity and accountability), further targeting Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) constructs that were not influenced overall by the original intervention yet improved amongst our most successful participants (social support, outcome expectancies), and responding to changing trends and technology use in Latinos. We will conduct a clinical trial among Latina women in California randomized to either 1) the original Seamos Saludables tailored print only intervention or 2) a theory and text messaging-enhanced interactive technology based version of the Seamos Saludables intervention. We will also measure changes in cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers (e.g., HbA1c, and LDL) to assess potential clinical impact of the intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Culturally and Linguistically Adapted Physical Activity Intervention for Latinas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Latinos are the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the U.S., and report substantial and widening health disparities. Prevalence of type II diabetes is 60-100% higher in Latinos than in non-Latino Whites, and incidence in Latinos is projected to increase by 500% by 20503. The largest disparities are projected for Latino women (Latinas). Rates of overweight and obesity are 23% and 37% higher in Latinas than in White women respectively, and have grown faster in Mexican American women, by far the largest subgroup of Latinas, than in White women during the past decade. Given that Latinos are projected to comprise nearly one-third of the US population by 2050, this signifies a pressing public health concern in terms of costs, diminished quality of life, and lost life years. Interventions are therefore needed that are not only linguistically adapted for this population but address their specific barriers. "Mediated" intervention delivery approaches (e.g., mail, phone, or web delivered) that emphasize home-based, lifestyle activities show larger effect sizes than face-to-face approaches, are more cost-effective, are likely more sustainable, and may be particularly appropriate for Latinas, as they reduce the burden of time, childcare, and transportation, barriers commonly cited by Latinas. Thus in the previously funded parent grant (R01NR011295) we responded to PAR-07-379, "Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities," by modifying an existing print-based mail-delivered PA intervention and adapting it specifically for Latinas in the North Eastern U.S. with low acculturation, literacy, and socioeconomic status (SES), and testing the modified intervention in a randomized controlled trial (N=266). Participants in the PA intervention arm showed significantly greater increases in at least moderate intensity activity, increasing from 1.87 min/week at baseline to 73.36 min/week at 6 months (vs. 3.02 min/week to 32.98 min/week in a contact control group). However, this is still well below the national guidelines of 150 minutes per week. This intervention therefore shows potential in promoting initial PA adoption, yet enhancements are needed to further help people achieve levels of PA that will prevent disease and reduce health disparities. The objectives of this renewal are to 1) enhance the intervention to achieve greater increases in PA, 2) assess its potential clinical impact by measuring changes in biomarkers, and 3) increase its generalizability by replicating it in Latina women, all of which would further the goal of designing an innovative behavioral intervention to promote health and prevent illness in diverse populations.</detailed_description>
