	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to investigate the feasibility of a hybrid procedure removal of the atrial fibrillation. This is a single procedure for both surgical epicardial by minimally invasive route (Thoracoscopy) without even flow controlled and supplemented if necessary by extra corporeal intracavitary route at the same time. This faster procedure combined with complete lesions have a higher success rate and less frequent re-hospitalizations of patients.</brief_summary>
