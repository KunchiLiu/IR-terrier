	<brief_summary>TetraGraph is a newly developed EMG-based (electromyograph), quantitative, battery-powered neuromuscular monitoring system intended for daily clinical use. The primary aim of this clinical investigation is to examine the applicability (ease of use, equipment need, etc.), repeatability (precision or internal consistency) and performance (signal quality, accuracy of outcome, voltage of stimulation output before and during a stimulus) and tolerability of the Tetragraph device in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurostimulation and Electromyographs Assessment of th TetraGraph in Healthy (Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint will be assessment of the ability of the TetraGraph prototype to deliver neuro-stimulation, and assessment of the ability to acquire muscle action potentials and record these evoked responses on the SD-card. The study will be performed on healthy volunteers - 10 male and 10 female. Testing will be done at two separate stimulation/recording sites: ulnar nerve stimulation/abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle recording; and ulnar nerve stimulation/adductor pollices (AP) muscle recording. The side of testing (RIGHT vs. LEFT hand) will be determined a priori and randomly by the principal investigator, such that 10 volunteers each will be tested on the RIGHT and 10 on the LEFT hands. At each stimulating/recording site two stimulation protocols (single twitch stimulation and train-of-four stimulation) will be performed with growing current intensity (10-60 mA (milliAmps), in a 10 mA step-up fashion). Volunteers will rate the tolerability of each stimulation protocols on a visual analogue scale. EMG data will be recorded on the SD card and evaluated off-line.</detailed_description>
