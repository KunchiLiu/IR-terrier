	<brief_summary>This study uses a bone labeled calcium tracer methodology to compare the dose response effect of blueberry consumption on calcium retention and bone loss. Post menopausal women will receive food or beverage products containing freeze dried blueberries over a 50 day period equivalent to low (0.75 cups), medium (1.5 cups), and high (3 cups) of fresh berries. The hypothesis is that the polyphenolic content of higher doses of blueberries will reduce calcium loss from bones.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Blueberries on Bone Turnover</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be dosed with Ca-41, a rare long lived radioisotope. After equilibration in the bone tissues (150 days) subjects will be assigned to one of six randomization schemes all of which begin (day 0) with a 50 day baseline period during which 24 h urine will be collected every 10 days. Following the baseline period subjects will be randomized to one of three doses of blueberries equivalent to 0.75 (low), 1.5 (medium), and 3 cups (high) of blueberries per day. In a crossover design each participant will complete three 50 d intervention phases(low, medium, high dose of berries) in randomized order, each followed by a 50 day washout phase. Each dose will be provided as freeze dried blueberry powder in 2-4 food products or beverages per day. The dose response effect of continuous blueberry consumption over a 50 day period on bone resorption in healthy post-menopausal women will be studied by measuring the loss of Ca41 in the urine using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry..</detailed_description>
