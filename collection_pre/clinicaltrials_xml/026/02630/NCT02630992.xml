	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety profile of amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium containing a reduced concentration of clavulanate potassium, 600 mg/21.5 mg/5 mL (a ratio of 28:1), administered at 90/3.2 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days. Investigators will focus on the proportion of subjects who develop protocol-defined diarrhea and proportion who develop diaper dermatitis that occasions the prescription of antifungal medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Clavulanate Formulation of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate in Children 6-23 Months With Acute Otitis Media</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium has been shown to be efficacious in eradicating causative pathogens in acute otitis media (AOM) with resulting high clinical cure rates at end-of-treatment (85%). However, relatively high rates (~25%) of clinically significant diarrhea have been reported, the occurrence of which has been directly related to the clavulanate potassium component of the drug combination. A reduced concentration of clavulanate potassium in the drug formulation would be expected to have an improved safety profile regarding the occurrence of diarrhea. This study will examine whether the concentration of the clavulanate potassium component of amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium could be reduced in the treatment of children 6 months through 23 months of age diagnosed with AOM using stringent criteria. A total of 75 participants (n=75) with AOM will receive amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium (600 mg/21.5 mg/5 mL; 28:1) administered at 90/3.2 mg/kg in two divided doses for 10 days. The primary outcome measure will be rates of clinically significant diarrhea and diaper dermatitis. These rates will be compared with the rate observed in our previous studies of AOM in children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium (600 mg/42.9 mg/5 mL; 14:1) administered at 90/6.4 mg/kg in two divided doses for 10 days. A subset of this group will have pharmacokinetic studies performed. Each participant that agrees will have a single blood draw (n=50). Investigators will analyze amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in the blood samples using validated methods.</detailed_description>
