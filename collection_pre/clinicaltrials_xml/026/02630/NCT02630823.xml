	<brief_summary>Due to the high expression of PD-L1 in endometrial cancers as well as in ovarian cancers which are molecularly similar to uterine serous cancers, using pembrolizumab should be beneficial in this patient population. Since the investigators are able to get a pre-treatment research- related endometrial biopsy as well as the surgical specimen post two cycles of pembrolizumab, the investigators will be able to evaluate the mechanism of action of this drug on the endometrial cancer tumor environment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of FIGO grade 3 endometrioid cancer, serous, clear cell, or mixed high grade endometrial cancer with confirmation on researchrelated endometrial biopsy. Radiographically confirmed endometrial adenocarcinoma of stages IIIIV requiring adjuvant therapy. If stage III disease is suspected, there should be multiple pelvic and/or lymph nodes involved. Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;10 mm with CT scan, as &gt;20 mm by chest xray, or &gt;10 mm with calipers by clinical exam by RECIST 1.1. Treatment plan must include primary site biopsy followed by resection of the primary tumor site and any metastatic sites at time of surgery. At least 18 years of age. GOG performance status ≤ 2 Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ IULN for patients with total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x IULN AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x IULN (or ≤ 5 x IULN for patients with liver metastases) Albumin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR creatinine clearance by CockcroftGault ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x IULN INR or PT ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as INR or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants aPTT ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as INR or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 methods of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of preoperative study participation and until definitive hysterectomy/bilateral salpingooophorectomy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). FIGO grade 1 or 2 endometrioid cancer. Radiographic imaging demonstrating uterine cancer that is probably stage I or II. Prior treatment for endometrial cancer. Prior treatment with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 agent. Prior anticancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to first dose of MK3475 or has not recovered (i.e., to ≤ grade 1 or baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of MK3475 or has not recovered (i.e., to ≤ grade 1 or baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Note, subjects with ≤ grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note, if a subject received major surgery, she must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of MK3475. A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only. Known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of MK3475 and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of MK3475. Currently receiving any other investigational agents or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of MK3475. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MK3475 or other agents used in the study. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring systemic therapy, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, immunosuppression, autoimmune conditions, underlying pulmonary disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of study entry. Known active hepatitis B (e.g. HBsAg reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g. HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected). Known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies). Known history of active TB.</criteria>
