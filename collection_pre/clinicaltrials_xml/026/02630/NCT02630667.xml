	<brief_title>The Acute Effects Fortified Nutritional Supplementation on Childhood Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular breakfast consumption is linked to improved cognitive performance in school-aged children. However, the acute benefits of defined nutrient consumption on brain and cognitive health are not well understood, particularly in preadolescent children. One factor that may relate to brain health and learning in children is the contribution of carbohydrates to the digestion rate of a meal (and associated effects on post-prandial glycemia). The effects of differentially absorbed carbohydrates on brain and cognition are unknown, especially when ingested via a fortified nutritional beverage providing a balanced array of nutrients. The aim of this study is to investigate the acute, transient effect of nutrient supplementation with varied carbohydrate systems in preadolescent children (i.e., 9-10 years). Participants will be randomized to receive one of three treatment nutritional formulations containing carbohydrates with varying absorption rates along with a non-caloric placebo. Participants will perform a cognitive battery in the fasted condition, shortly after treatment ingestion, and an hour after ingestion. Group differences in performance will be contrasted to assess the effects of different carbohydrate types on children's cognitive function following an overnight fast. Findings from this study will inform our understanding of the macronutrient profile of breakfast that may potentially improve children's cognitive performance in the morning.</detailed_description>
