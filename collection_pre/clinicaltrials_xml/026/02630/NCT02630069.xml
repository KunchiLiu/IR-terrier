	<detailed_description>This study is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline (CDP-choline) in amphetamine-type stimulants-using adolescents. Multi-level assessments will be performed to determine whether CDP-choline administration with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), compared to placebo administration with CBT, will 1) repair ATS-induced neural cell damage of the target brain regions, 2) improve cognitive deficits and normalize the relevant target neural circuits, and then 3) reduce ATS-taking behaviors in ATS-using adolescents.</detailed_description>
