	<brief_title>A4250, an IBAT Inhibitor in Pediatric Cholestasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aims of this Phase II exploratory study in patients treated with A4250 due to cholestasis induced pruritus are to: - Assess the safety and tolerability of A4250, orally administered first as a single dose and then during a four week treatment period, as determined by the occurrence of treatment-emergent SAEs - Explore changes in serum total bile acids after a four week treatment period Secondary safety aims include assessment of the safety and tolerability of A4250, orally administered first as a single dose and then during a four week treatment period, as determined by the occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs and changes in safety parameters including laboratory tests and vital signs Secondary efficacy aims are to: - Demonstrate the efficacy of A4250, orally administered during a four week treatment period, on liver biochemistry variables and on pruritus parameters - Evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of A4250 orally administered first as a single dose and then after a four week treatment period - Evaluate changes in VAS-itching score after a four week treatment period</detailed_description>
