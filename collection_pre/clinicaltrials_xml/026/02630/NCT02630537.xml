	<brief_summary>Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and in particular T cells play a critical role in the rejection of transplanted organs. Thus, in transplant recipients a life-long and individualized immunosuppressive medication is required to avoid graft rejection. However, a too weak suppression of CMI causes acute and chronic graft damage leading to transplant loss, whereas a too potent suppression of CMI supports opportunistic infections and reactivation of persistent viruses. One of the biggest challenges in the field of transplantation is to provide a personalized immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy based on reliable assessment and monitoring of CMI. This could lead to a reduction of graft rejections and virus reactivations in transplant recipients. With the development of both assays T-Track® CMV and T-Track® EBV, Lophius Biosciences GmbH has implemented its novel proprietary T-activation technology for an improved assessment of the functionality of CMI in cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and/or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seropositive individuals. In contrast to other existing systems the Lophius assays open up the opportunity to characterize the functionality of CMI as an entire network. The planned clinical multicenter study aims to verify the suitability of the two assays for a reliable assessment of the functionality of CMI. Hemodialysis patients have been identified as an appropriate patient cohort for investigating the clinical sensitivity of the Lophius assays as these patients closely resemble kidney transplant recipients prior to an immunosuppressive therapy. The determination of the functional CMI in the course of an immunosuppressive treatment may in future enable physicians to optimize the individual immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy in transplant recipients to reduce the risk of rejection as well as virus reactivations and associated diseases.</brief_summary>
