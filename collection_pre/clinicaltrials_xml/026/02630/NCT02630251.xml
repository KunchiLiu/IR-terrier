	<brief_summary>The study drug, GSK2820151, is a Bromodomain (BRD) and Extra-Terminal (BET) inhibitor arising from a distinct structural class. GSK2820151 potently inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in animal models. This first time in human (FTIH), open-label, dose escalation study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of GSK2820151 in subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. The objective is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GSK2820151 in subjects 18 years or older with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. Eligible subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors will be enrolled in the dosing cohorts until MTD is established. All subjects will receive study drug. Subjects may continue treatment in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The duration of study will depend on recruitment rates and the timing of subjects' duration on study (withdrawal rates due to toxicity or progression). It is anticipated that approximately 30 to 50 subjects will be enrolled.</brief_summary>

At time of enrollment, subjects either refuse standard curative or palliative therapy, are not candidates for standard curative or palliative therapy, have a disease for which no noninvestigational therapy exists, OR have progressed on prior therapy (up to three lines of prior cytotoxic agents are permitted). Subjects with solid tumors, with the exception of castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC), must demonstrate measurable disease, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. All prior treatment related toxicities must be National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE) v4.03 &lt;=Grade 1 (except alopecia [permissible at any Grade] and peripheral neuropathy [which must be &lt;= Grade 2]) at the time of treatment allocation.

A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation, hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or documented bilateral tubal oophorectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 units (U)/mL and estradiol &lt;40 picograms (pg)/mL (&lt;140 picomoles (pmol)/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 7 months after the last dose of study medication. Negative serum pregnancy test &lt;=7 days prior to first study drug dose. Female subjects who are lactating must discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study treatment and must refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 5 halflives of GSK2820151 or at least 28 days (whichever is longer) following the last dose of study treatment. Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must agree to use one of the methods of contraception specified. This method must be used from the time of the first dose of study medication until 16 weeks after the last dose of study medication. In addition, male subjects whose partners are or become pregnant on study medication must continue to use condoms for 7 days after stopping study medication Primary malignancy of the central nervous system or malignancies related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or solid organ transplant. More than three prior lines of cytotoxic therapy. Recent prior therapy, defined as follows: 1) Any investigational or Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved anticancer drug within 14 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of GSK2820151. Any nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 42 days prior to the first dose of GSK2820151. Prior therapy with monoclonal antibodies is permitted so long as 14 days have elapsed since therapy and all therapyrelated toxicity has resolved to Grade 1 or less. Note that an investigational drug is defined as a drug without an approved oncologic indication. 2) Any radiotherapy within 14 days or major surgery within 28 days prior to the first dose of GSK2820151. 3) Antiandrogen therapies for prostate cancer, such as bicalutamide, must be stopped 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Secondline hormone therapies such as enzalutamide, abiraterone, or orteronel should be stopped 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Subjects with prostate cancer should remain on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or antagonists. Subjects with prostate cancer may also remain on lowdose prednisone or prednisolone (up to 10 milligrams [mg]/day) and still be eligible for this study. 4) In addition, any therapyrelated toxicity must have resolved to Grade 1 or less, with the exception of alopecia (acceptable at any Grade) and peripheral neuropathy (which must be Grade 2 or less prior to enrollment). Therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin, heparin) must be discontinued and coagulation parameters must be normalized prior to the first dose of GSK2820151.
