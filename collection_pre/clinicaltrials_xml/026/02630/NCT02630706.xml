	<brief_summary>This is a study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of ertugliflozin to metformin monotherapy in Asian participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitis (T2DM) who have inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The primary hypothesis is that the mean reduction from baseline in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) for both 15 mg and 5 mg ertugliflozin is greater than for placebo.</brief_summary>
