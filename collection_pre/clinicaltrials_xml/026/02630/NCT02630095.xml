	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect and safety of anticoagulation after endoscopic therapy in cirrhotic patients with portal vein thrombosis and to explore its effect on long-term rebleeding rate and mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Anticoagulation in Cirrhotic Patients With Portal Vein Thrombosis：A Multicenter RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of cirrhotic patients with PVT (portal vein thrombosis) is clearly recommended in guideline now. Several published studies has confirm the effect and safety of anticoagulation therapy in cirrhotic patients with PVT.The present studies are most observation studies with small sample size and low quality. The investigators need more high-quality research such as randomized controlled trials. This is a Zelen-designed multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients will randomly enter into two groups:the anticoagulation group or the control group and then the investigator will make sure wether their are fond of the group and make decision by themselves. The recanalization rate and complications will be analyzed</detailed_description>
