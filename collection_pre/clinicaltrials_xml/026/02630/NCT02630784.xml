	<brief_summary>VNI Versus is a clinical, prospective, randomized, cross over study, aiming to compare two mechanical ventilators during non-invasive ventilation for patient suffering from respiratory acidosis. This study will compare a dedicated ventilator for Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) functioning with a turbine and with vented mask (exhalation by a calibrated leak) and a dedicated ventilator for Intensive Care Unit (ICU), functioning with non-vented masks and an exhalation valve. Patient will be randomized before the first NIV session lasting 2 hours. After a two hours wash-out, a second NIV treatment will be delivered with the other ventilator for duration of 2 hours. Arterial blood samples will be collected at the beginning and the end of each session of NIV. A transcutaneous captor of dioxide carbon pressure (PCO2) will also be used for patient monitoring.</brief_summary>
