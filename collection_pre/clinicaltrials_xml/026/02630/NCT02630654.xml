	<brief_summary>This exploratory study aims to evaluate the diagnostic, prognostic and response predictive value of a multi biomarker strategy in patients with Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (GEP NETs) originating from the midgut or pancreas. Using a recently developed methodology enabling the evaluation of 92 concomitant cancer biomarkers will provide an interesting approach to solve this question (Lundberg et al 2011).</brief_summary>
