	<brief_summary>This is a small-scale pilot clinical study of the Rapamycin-Eluting Coronary Stent System of Microport for the first time to assess the preliminary safety and feasibility used in the human body. And provide evidence for subsequent large-scale, multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trials, then provide the basis for the formal application of the product in China.</brief_summary>
