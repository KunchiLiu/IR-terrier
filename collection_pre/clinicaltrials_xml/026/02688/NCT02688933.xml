	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate that morning injection of Toujeo compared to Lantus will provide better glycemic control evaluated by Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Secondary Objective: To demonstrate that treatment with Toujeo compared to Lantus will provide: - Lower incidence rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia; - Better glucose control coverage during the last hours of CGM before next basal-insulin dosing; - Less variability in CGM profile.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of the Morning Injection of Toujeo Versus Lantus in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The maximum study duration per patient will be approximately 20 weeks that will consist of a 4-week screening and training period including a 1-2 week CGM performance (allow for re-training), a 14-week open-label, comparative treatment period allowing for dose titration in both basal and meal-time insulin, a 1-2 week blinded CGM collection with fixed dose of Toujeo and Lantus, and a 2 day post treatment follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Adult patients (male and female) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt;18 years or &gt;70 years. Fasting cpeptide ≥0.3 nmol/L as per source document or central lab test at Visit 1. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤ 6.5 % or ≥ 10.0% via central lab test at Visit 1. Patients who experienced none of episode of documented symptomatic and/or severe hypoglycemia (as per the American Diabetes Association [ADA] classification) during the past month prior to screening. Patients who experienced &gt;1 episode of severe hypoglycemia resulting in coma/seizures during the last 12 months before screening. Patients receiving less than 1 year treatment with basal plus mealtime insulin. Using any basal insulins other than longacting insulin analogs (ie, Lantus, Toujeo, Levemir, and Tresiba) in the past 3 months before screening. Requiring &gt;80 U/day basal insulin analogs or not on stable dose (±20% total dose) within 30 days prior to screening. Using fewer than 2 injections of rapidacting insulin analog per day within 30 days prior to screening. Using human regular insulin as mealtime insulin within 30 days prior to screening. Using an insulin pump during the last 6 months before screening. History of unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy or any other rapidly progressive diabetic retinopathy or macular edema likely to require treatment (e.g., laser, surgical treatment, or injectable drugs) during the study period. Pregnant or breastfeeding women or planning pregnancy during the duration of the study. Use of any other investigational drug(s) within 1 month or 5 halflives, whichever is longer prior to screening. Inappropriate CGM use during screening period evidenced by failure to obtain a minimum of 4 days of usable records by the end of screening. Noncompliance with selfmonitored plasma glucose (SMPG) performance evidenced by failure to demonstrate at least 5 days of 5 point SMPG records by the end of screening. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
