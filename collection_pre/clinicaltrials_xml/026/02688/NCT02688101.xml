	<brief_title>Dose-finding and Pharmacokinetic Study of DpC, Administered Orally to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study of DpC administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in two parts. In the first phase successive cohorts of patients (3+3) will receive escalating doses of DpC until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. MTD is based on tolerability observed during the first 28 days of treatment. The second part of the study involves treatment of expansion cohorts (10-15 patients each) in specific indications to confirm the tolerability of treatment at the recommended phase 2 dose and schedule and evaluate evidence of anti-tumor activity.</detailed_description>
