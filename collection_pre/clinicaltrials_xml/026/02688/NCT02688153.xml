	<brief_title>EDWARDS INTUITY Valve System CADENCE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized study comparing the cross-clamp time (XCT) and cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPBT) of the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system with any commercially available stented aortic bioprosthesis, in patients with logistic EuroSCORE 1 ≥ 8 undergoing elective surgical aortic valve replacement surgery with concomitant coronary bypass grafts. Additionally, the aim is to gather sufficient data to quantify the effect size of short term patient benefit outcomes previously identified from literature and finally to explore additional healthcare resource utilization or health economic endpoints.</detailed_description>
