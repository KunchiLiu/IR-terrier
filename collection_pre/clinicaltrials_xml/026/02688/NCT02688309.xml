	<brief_summary>This study will examine potential factors in the aqueous humor that may contribute to the development or progression of macular edema or fibrosis (due to any underlying disease) in patients suffering from these conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pro-permeability and Pro-fibrosis Factors in the Aqueous of Patients With Retinal Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the correlation of pro-permeability and pro-fibrosis factor levels and downstream receptor/signaling molecule activation with disease activity in patients with macular edema or fibrosis secondary to any underlying disease. 120 patients will be enrolled from both the clinic and OR, with the latter patients undergoing surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with PVR, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment without PVR, macular pucker, or macular hole. Clinic patients must be receiving an intraocular injection of a steroid as part of standard of care for macular edema or progressive fibrosis. Surgical patients will receive an anterior chamber (AC) tap at the beginning of surgery, while clinic patients will receive an AC tap prior to the intraocular injection of steroid with a second AC tap at a follow-up visit 6 +/- 2 weeks after the first injection. The aqueous sample will then be analyzed by measuring the levels of various pro-permeability and pro-fibrosis factors and/or their downstream receptor/signaling molecule activation. We will also determine the correlation between reductions in foveal thickness or improvements in visual acuity with changes in the aqueous levels of pro-permeability and pro-fibrosis factors from baseline to week 6 in the clinic group.</detailed_description>
