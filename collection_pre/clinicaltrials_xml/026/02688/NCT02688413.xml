	<brief_summary>Randomised controlled multi-centered study using MindMotionPRO, an immersive virtual reality based system for upper limb motor rehabilitation in early post-stroke patients. The study aims to evaluate the ability of MindMotionPRO technology to increase the rehabilitation dose. Effectiveness will be evaluated by validated rehabilitation performance scales. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by the resource utilization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the MindMotionPRO for Early Post-stroke Upper-limb Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the study is to show that MindMotionPRO is a tool that allows a patient to increase the amount of rehabilitation therapy performed. This study will measure the rehabilitation dose, as measured by the duration of the rehabilitation session and the number of exercises performed by the patient. The study hypothesis is that patients in the MindMotionPRO group will spend more time performing rehabilitation exercises than in the Self-Directed Prescribed exercises group. The effectiveness of the MindMotionPRO versus Self-Directed Prescribed Exercises will also be measured, based on the change in rehabilitation performance measures. The cost-effectiveness will be measured by the resource utilization, as defined by the time spent by the therapist providing the rehabilitation session.</detailed_description>
