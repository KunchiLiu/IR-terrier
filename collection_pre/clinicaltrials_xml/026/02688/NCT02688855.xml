	<criteria>Subject is diagnosed with an unstable, closed, isolated fracture of the ankle and underwent operative stabilization with plate(s) and/or screws (Weber Ankle Fracture Classification B and C) Subject has an open fracture Subject has any additional fractures of another bone besides the ankle fracture that is to be treated in the study including the contralateral ankle Surgical stabilization was definitively performed with an external fixation system Surgical stabilization was performed in such a manner that it will result in a fusion of the ankle joint Malreduced Ankle as described by Phillips, et al 1985 JBJS Surgical procedure included the use of osteoinductive materials in addition to rigid fixation BMI â‰¥ 40 kg/m2</criteria>
