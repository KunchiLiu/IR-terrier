	<brief_summary>This research trial studies quality of life after bladder-preservation chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemo-radiotherapy) in patients with bladder cancer that has spread into or through the muscle layer of the bladder (muscle-invasive bladder cancer). Bladder-preservation chemo-radiotherapy is a standard treatment for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, however, chemo-radiotherapy may cause urinary tract, bowel, and sexual late side effects that negatively affect patients' quality of life. Studying quality-of-life in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer after chemo-radiotherapy may help identify the long-term side effects of treatment and may help plan the best treatment in the future and improve patients' quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life After Bladder-Preservation Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Patients With Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study health-related quality of life (HRQoL, or QOL) for patients undergoing protocol-based bladder-preservation chemo-radiation. OUTLINE: Patients complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-Bladder Cancer Muscle Invasive (BLM-C30) at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter after completion of chemo-radiotherapy.</detailed_description>
