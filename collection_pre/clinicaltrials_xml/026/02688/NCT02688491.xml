	<brief_summary>Whether patients with stage III clear cell renal cell carcinoma(ccRCC) should receive adjuvant targeted therapy or not is still on debate. The investigators invented a assay consisting of 5 CpGs: cg00396667（PITX1）, cg18815943 （FOXE3）, cg03890877（TWF2）, cg07611000 （EHBP1L1）and cg14391855（RIN1）that was successfully categorise patients with stage III clear cell renal cell carcinoma into high-risk and low-risk groups with Harzard Ratio(HR) of 4.93. Here the investigators randomly assign assay-defined high risk patients of locally advanced ccRCC into adjuvant targeted therapy group and observation group.Disease free survival and overall survival are the end points of observation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A CpG-methylation-based Assay for Stratifying Stage III Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma of Receiving Adjuvant Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators' CpG-methylation-based assay contains 5 CpGs: cg00396667（PITX1）, cg18815943 （FOXE3）, cg03890877（TWF2）, cg07611000 （EHBP1L1）and cg14391855（RIN1）. The investigators evaluate the CpG methylation status of surgical specimens using pyrosequencing and calculate their risk score[risk score=(0.0066×PITX1)+(0.0034×FOXE3)－(0.027×TWF2) －(0.018×EHBP1L1)－(0.03×RIN1)], risk score ≥－0.1 as assay-defined high risk status and risk score＜－0.1 as assay-defined low risk status. The investigators randomly assign assay-defined high risk patients of stage III ccRCC into intervention group and control group. The intervention group should receive adjuvant targeted therapy while the control group deserve observation. Primary endpoint is the disease free survival and overall survival.</detailed_description>
