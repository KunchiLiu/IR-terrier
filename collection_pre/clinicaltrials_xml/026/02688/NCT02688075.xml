	<brief_title>An Observational Study to Assess the Canagliflozin Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a Usual Clinical Practice in Canada</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, non-interventional, nation-wide, multicenter (more than one study site) study to evaluate the treatment of T2DM with canagliflozin in a usual clinical practice in Canada. Approximately 535 participants will be enrolled into this study. The planned study duration for each participant will be 12 months [plus or minus (+/-) 4 weeks], including 4 study visits in accordance with the usual clinical practice: enrollment and visits at 3, 6 and 12 months (+/- 4 weeks). Participants will primarily be observed for effectiveness, safety and PRO over an observational period of 12 months.</detailed_description>
