	<brief_summary>This is an interventional study in which patients with a history of habitual snoring will use the low-pressure CPAP device at home for about 2 weeks. This study is designed to document the adherence of the snorer, the acceptance and comfort of the therapy, and bed partners' subjective report of improvement in sleep quality, and/or reduction or elimination of snoring. Study outcomes will consist of an assessment of the nightly usage time, and questionnaires that the snorer and the bed-partner have to complete before the start of the study, after two night's treatment, and at the end of the study period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an interventional study in which patients with a history of habitual snoring use the Cloud9™ Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) device that delivers a low level of continuous nasal air pressure between 2 cm H2O and 4 cm H2O, for about two weeks at their home. This study is designed to document the adherence of the snorer, the acceptance and comfort of the therapy, and bed partners' subjective report of improvement in sleep quality, and/or reduction or elimination of snoring. Study Procedures Baseline Assessment: The study begins with a baseline assessment to determine whether each participant meets the entry criteria for the study. After consent, participant snorers will have a history and physical exam to confirm entry criteria and answer a questionnaire (Hopkins Sleep Survey) to assess their sleepiness. In a second step, snoring participants who meet the entry criteria will receive a full night polysomnogram (PSG) to confirm snoring and to rule out sleep apnea or any other sleep related disorder. Participants who already performed a full night PSG as a part of the earlier sleep lab study for the Cloud9 device (Treatment of Snoring Trial) do not have to be re-screened, if the earlier PSG is not older than 24 months, and the participant's body mass index (BMI) remains within 3 kg/m2 of its original value. Run-In: The device will be given to participants who meet study entry criteria as assessed through History and Physical Exam (H&amp;P) and PSG. During this visit, the snoring and bed partner will be asked to complete questionnaires and will be introduced to the device. Snoring participants will be instructed to use the device as much as possible for 2 nights. Usage data will be recorded by the device and read when returned to the study site on the third day. Post Run-In Visit: During this visit, snoring participants and their partners will be administered questionnaires. Usage data from the device and the usage diary will be read for compliance (defined as 4 hours per night for 70% of time). A study team member will also take this time to discuss any issues or questions the participants may have. Home-Trial: Participants who are found to be sufficiently compliant at run-in will be asked to use the device at home for an additional 2 weeks. Snoring participants will receive a compliance call on the day after night 1 of the home trial. Additionally, snoring participants will receive a compliance call after week 1 to assess the user experience with the device. Final Visit: At the end of the 2 weeks, participants will return the device to the sleep lab. Usage data from the device and the usage diary will be read for compliance. Snoring participants and their bed partners will also complete a final set of questionnaires. For each participant, there will be one visit (in the sleep lab), to assess and quantify their snoring frequency and severity. Every participant meeting the initial entry criteria will have this baseline study. For those participants with evidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on the baseline study, the duration of the study will be one night only. Snoring intensity will be assessed on the first baseline night of the study. Participants will be required to demonstrate a snoring intensity that exceeds 45 decibels (dBA) for &gt; 5% or 40 dBA &gt; 10% of the sleep time on the baseline night of the study before proceeding with the home treatment nights. For those participants without significant snoring, the study duration will be one night only. For those participants who already performed and passed the initial study night (see Baseline Assessment above), the full PSG night is not required. The investigators anticipate that it will take approximately 12 months to enroll a maximum of 50 participants for the home test. The investigators may stop enrollment earlier if the investigators demonstrate sufficient power and effect at lower numbers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age. 2. Patient is willing and able to provide written Informed Consent utilizing a Patient Information and Consent form that has been reviewed and approved by a governing Institutional Review Board (IRB). 3. Patient has a bed partner willing to participate in the study 4. Patient has a history of habitual snoring (almost every night or every night) as determined by a bedpartner; bedpartner subjectively reports that snoring is a considerable burden for her/him. 5. Patient has been prescreened and demonstrates an Epworth Questionnaire (an assessment of daytime sleepiness; high number = greater sleepiness) score of less than 11, no history of witnessed apneas or nocturnal gasping/choking episodes and a BMI ≤ 35, or subjects with a BMI &gt;35 who have no significant sleep apnea already documented on an overnight sleep study. (For subjects recruited from the previous inSleep protocol, the BMI must be in a range of ±3 kg/m2 of the earlier recorded value) 1. Patient has been diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma, emphysema or chronic bronchitis. 2. Patient has a history of heart disease, heart attack or stroke. 3. Patient has uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension. 4. Patient has been diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), defined as ApneaHypopnea Index (AHI) ≥ 15. Hypopnea is defined as a discernible reduction in flow that is associated with a greater than or equal to 4% desaturation. 5. Pregnancy of the snoring participant, by selfreport. If there is any doubt concerning status, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. 6. Patient is currently participating in another clinical study for which followup is ongoing.</criteria>
