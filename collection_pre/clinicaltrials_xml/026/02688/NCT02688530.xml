	<brief_summary>For surgery involving the shoulder, anesthesiologists will often inject local anesthetic numbing medication near nerves supplying the shoulder in what is called a "supraclavicular nerve block". These nerve blocks cause numbness and weakness in the shoulder leading to relaxation of the joint which is helpful to the surgeon and allowing for painless surgery without general anesthesia. After surgery, pain relief is sustained for the duration of the nerve block. The primary purpose of this study is to clarify the duration of pain control provided by supraclavicular blocks when supplemented with varying doses of the steroid anti-inflammatory dexamethasone when given through the intravenous line (IV). IV dexamethasone is commonly used for both nausea prevention and block prolongation, but a detailed study of the effect of varying doses of this medication on duration of pain relief and weakness from the block has not been studied. The study investigators seek to identify what association, if any, is noted between IV dexamethasone doses and changes in blood glucose levels after shoulder surgery with regional anesthesia and sedation. Finally, the study investigators will collect data on side-effects and postoperative complications, if any, in patients receiving a range of doses of IV dexamethasone.</brief_summary>
