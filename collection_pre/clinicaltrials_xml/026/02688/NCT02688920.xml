	<brief_summary>This observational study is conducted to determine how the duodenal layer thicknesses (mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis) vary with several factors in patients with and without type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraluminal Imaging of Duodenal Layer Morphometry in Patients With and Without Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives 1. To assess duodenal layer (mucosa, submucosa and muscularis) thickness differences between patients with and without type 2 diabetes using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). 2. To assess duodenal layer thickness differences between patients with type 2 diabetes. 3. To assess duodenal layer thickness differences as a function of measurement location along the length of the duodenum. 4. To compare measurements obtained by endoscopic ultrasound, to those obtained by optical coherence tomography.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is already scheduled for upper endoscopy with ultrasound or OCT, such as those with Barrett's esophagus. Patient is willing to sign an informed consent form. Patient is not a candidate for endoscopy, EUS, or OCT, such as those with strictures, inflammatory disease or previous anastomosis of the esophagus or duodenum.</criteria>
