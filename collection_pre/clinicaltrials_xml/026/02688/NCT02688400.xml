	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the most frequent cause of knee pain after the age of 50 years. OA is a joint disease characterised by articular cartilage loss associated with structural changes in the cartilage and adjacent structures. The main symptoms are pain and functional disability. The goals of OA therapy are to decrease pain and maintain or improve joint function. There is evidence that diacerein has both a symptomatic and a structural effect on cartilage, and clinical studies suggest that diacerein therapy significantly decreases OA symptoms when compared to placebo. Diacerein has been shown to inhibit interleukine-1 (IL-1β), and down-regulated IL-1β stimulated secretion of metalloproteinases and aggrecanases, and thereby prevent breakdown of cartilage by these enzymes. Diacerein has no effect on the synthesis of prostaglandins, and therefore no effect on the upper intestinal tract. The purpose of this phase III-IV international, multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled study is to determine the efficacy and safety of diacerein vs. celecoxib on symptoms after 6 months of treatment, and on structural changes after 2 years of treatment in knee OA patients as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</brief_summary>

Criteria related to individual characteristics of the patient Patients with secondary knee OA; Patients with known hypersensitivity to Diacerein or to anthraquinonecontaining product, hypersensitivity to Celecoxib, who have demonstrated allergictype reactions to sulphonamides, experienced asthma, urticaria or allergictype reactions after taking sulphonamides, aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid [ASA]), lactose, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], acetaminophen or paracetamol; Patients with a known history of diarrhoea, more particularly if 65 years of age and older; Patients with active malignancy of any type or history of a malignancy within the last five years other than basal cell carcinoma; Patients with other bone and articular diseases (antecedents and/or current signs) such as; chondrocalcinosis, Paget's disease of the ipsilateral limb to the target knee, rheumatoid arthritis, aseptic osteonecrosis, gout, septic arthritis, ochronosis, acromegaly, haemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, osteochondromatosis, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, mixed connective tissue disease, collagen vascular disease, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease; Pain in other parts of the body greater than the knee pain that could interfere with the evaluation of the index joint; Patients with fibromyalgia; Patients with isolated knee lateral compartment OA defined by joint space loss in the lateral compartment only; Patients with Class IV functional capacity using the American Rheumatism Association criteria; Patients who have had surgery in any lower limb or arthroscopy, aspiration or lavage in any lower limb joint within 180 days of the Inclusion Visit (Visit 2); Patients who have had meniscal surgery on the study knee; Patients who have undergone total knee replacement in the contralateral knee within 180 days prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1); Patients with comorbid conditions or joint deformity that restrict knee function; Patients with a history of heart attack or stroke, or who have had serious diseases of the heart such as congestive heart failure (functional classes IIIV of the New York Heart Association [NYHA]); Patients who have significant risk factors for heart attack or stroke will be assessed carefully. Risk factors for heart attack and stroke include high blood pressure (treated or untreated), high cholesterol, diabetes and smoking. The global risk assessment will be assessed using the American Heart Association (AHA) assessment of cardiovascular (CV) risk tables. Patients with high risk of CV events, according to the tables, will be excluded; Patients with any significant diseases or conditions, including emotional or psychiatric disorders and substance abuse that, in the opinion of the Investigator, are likely to alter appreciation of OA symptoms or the patient's ability to complete the study; Patients with a history of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to the patient; Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus defined as Haemoglobin A1c level &gt;8%; Patients with poorly controlled hypertension (sustained Systolic Blood Pressure of &gt; 150 mmHg or Diastolic Blood Pressure &gt; 95 mmHg); Patients with any active acute or chronic infections requiring antimicrobial therapy, or serious viral (e.g., hepatitis, herpes zoster, HIV positivity) or fungal infections; Patients with a history of recurrent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) ulceration or active inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), a significant coagulation defect, or any other condition, which in the Investigator's opinion might preclude the chronic use of Celecoxib or Diacerein. Patients may, at the Investigator's discretion, take a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or antacids daily as required, with a 2 hour period between intake of study medication and intake of PPI or antacid; Patients who have been diagnosed as having or have been treated for esophageal, gastric, pyloric channel, or duodenal ulceration within 30 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication; Patients with chronic liver or kidney disease, as defined by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 times ULN, at the Screening Visit (Visit 1); Patients who have a history of intolerance to acetaminophen or paracetamol, opioids or opioid combinations such that it is felt that an adequate nonantiinflammatory rescue analgesic regimen cannot be safely prescribed; Patients who have a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the last 3 years; Patients receiving any investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is greater) prior to the Inclusion Visit (Visit 2); Patients who plan surgery during the study; Female patients who are breastfeeding; Patients with the impossibility of taking part in the total duration of the study and attending the visits; Patients unable to give an informed consent; Patients who do not respect the acetaminophen or paracetamol washout period of 48 hours or the NSAID washout period of 1 week before the Inclusion Visit (Visit 2).
