	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cells (DC) combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells treatment patients with Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Experimental adopted recombinant adenovirus-code MUC1 and Survivin transfected DC, which are used for DC-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our previously preclinical research with DC combined with CIK cells, the investigators plan to perform the clinical trial.</brief_summary>
