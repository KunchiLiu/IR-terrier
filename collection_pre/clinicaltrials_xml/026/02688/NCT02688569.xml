	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled clinical trial will examine the effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-) in patients with comorbid chronic widespread pain (CWP) and insomnia. Specific Aims: 1. To examine the clinical and health characteristics, including sleep, pain, fatigue, cognitive abilities, and cardiovascular health in patients with comorbid CWP and insomnia. 2. To examine changes in the primary clinical outcomes, including chronic pain, complaints of poor sleep, and fatigue compared to the waitlist control (WLC). 3. To examine changes in the secondary clinical outcomes, including mood, daytime functioning, cognitive functioning, and cardiovascular health compared WLC. 4. To examine the mechanistic variables, including arousal (heart rate variability, HRV), CS (thermal response) and neural plasticity (brain function and structure) - compared to WLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep and Pain Intervention for Chronic Widespread Pain Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled clinical trial will examine the effects of CBT in patients with chronic widespread pain and insomnia. Sample will include 20 patients ([18]-65 years) who satisfy criteria for chronic widespread pain and insomnia. Participants will be randomly assigned to CBT or waitlist control. All participants randomized to the cognitive-behavioral interventions will receive 4 treatment sessions (~50 minutes each). Baseline, posttreatment, [&amp; 3-mo.] follow-up assessments will include measures of sleep, pain, thermal pain response, heart rate variability, brain structure and functions, affect, cognitive functioning, cardiovascular health, and substance use.</detailed_description>
