	<brief_summary>This protocol is a molecular screening protocol only. No drug intervention study will be included in this protocol. Based on the molecular profiling, patients may be eligible for drug intervention study of SUKSES trial. This procedure can be performed during or after the first-line treatment. DNA will be extracted from the archived or fresh tissue and blood. NGS-based cancer panel and Nanostring CNV will be tested with DNA from tissue and/or blood. Immunohistochemistry and FISH will be done by pathologists using archived or fresh tissue. Tumor tissues (fresh or archival) will be analyzed using NGS-based cancer panel, nanostring CNV, immunohistochemistry and/or FISH. Specific methods of each molecular tests will be defined with standard laboratory manual developed by pathologists.</brief_summary>
