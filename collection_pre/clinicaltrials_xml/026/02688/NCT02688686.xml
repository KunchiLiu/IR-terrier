	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cells(DC) vaccine combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer with bone metastases. Experimental DC was transfected Ad5 vector coding mRNAs including suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1, MUC1 and Survivin,are used for DC-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our previously preclinical study with DC vaccine combined with CIK cells, the investigators plan to perform the clinical trial.</brief_summary>
