	<brief_summary>Shoulder problems cause substantial disability in daily living, work, leisure activity, and exercise. The presence of shoulder problem such as rotator cuff pathology reported was highly predictive of impaired health-related quality of life. Many tests were used for physical examination of the shoulder. The reliability and validity of the tests have been studied before. However, a systemic review concluded that there was conflicting evidence in reliability of each or combined tests. Functional examination of the shoulder by Cyriax is composed of a series of tests to evaluate a shoulder problem. It includes three arm elevation, three tests for glenohumeral joints, and six resisted tests. As far as the investigators know, correlation of Cyriax functional examination with the ultrasonographic findings has never been reported before. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the clinical diagnosis by Cyriax's functional examination with ultrasound findings in patients with shoulder pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between Cyriax's Functional Examination and Ultrasound Examination in Patients With Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two groups with fifty patients in each group. First group is patients who have unilateral or bilateral shoulder pain from the outpatient clinic of Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital. The other group is control group who has no shoulder problems. Both groups will receive Cyriax's functional examination of the shoulder after history taking, and will be examined by shoulder ultrasound in one week.</detailed_description>
