	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to compare a snack with ingredients (whole grains and dietary fiber) to slow carbohydrate digestion to a similar control snack without such ingredients and evaluate the effect of the snack on glycemic response and subjective satiety. The test product will be compared with a control product as well as white bread in a randomized, controlled, crossover trial including 20 healthy males or females between the ages of 18 and 70 and having a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 30 kg/m2. Following an overnight fast, participants will be given each of the study products in a random order at least a week apart. Glucose and insulin will be measured before product consumption and over a period of four hours. Visual analog scales to measure subjective satiety will also be administered over a period of four hours.</brief_summary>
