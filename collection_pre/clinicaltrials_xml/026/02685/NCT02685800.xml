	<brief_summary>Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) are widely used in couples with fertility problems. However, despite ART treatment options have evolved over time, the implantation rate remains rather low. A possible role for inherited and acquired thrombophilias has been invoked, especially in women with previous implantation failures. However, several factors could play a role in these conditions. A potential benefit of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in improving ART outcomes, independently of the presence of thrombophilia, has been recently suggested. This register is designed in order to better define all possible variables influencing ART outcome and improve clinical management of women with previous implantation failures. During this study the investigators will collect and evaluate clinical data regarding the first cycle in women with previous ART failures.</brief_summary>
