	<brief_summary>The objective of this research study is to better understand patterns of recovery after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). The study will evaluate how pain, activity and cognitive (i.e., thinking style) responses determine patterns of recovery, and the study will evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin versus placebo for improving recovery after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting, Understanding and Speeding Recovery After TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a two-site, longitudinal, double-blind, randomized clinical intervention study to examine three specific aims: Aim 1: Characterize the dynamic pain experience, activity, and cognitive response after TKA and determine patterns of recovery in these domains Aim 2: Test whether gabapentin alters time course of recovery after TKA in a manner dependent on its interaction with pre-drug pupil diameter and preferred style in the catastrophizing-optimism dimension Aim 3: Test whether gabapentin increases pupil diameter in patients undergoing TKA who are on high dose opioids preoperatively and to examine whether opioid use moderates the associations in Aim 1 Primary Hypothesis: Novel variance beyond established associations in recovery from pain following TKA surgery is accounted for by the interaction between pupil diameter and Cognitive-Affective (C-A) state, and this interaction predicts efficacy of gabapentin to speed recovery. Key secondary hypotheses: Disability, impulsivity, and attentional deficits recover after TKA surgery follow a log of time pattern, and are predicted by C-A state and its interaction with pupil diameter. Gabapentin increases resting pupil diameter in patients scheduled for TKA who are receiving high doses of opioids.</detailed_description>
