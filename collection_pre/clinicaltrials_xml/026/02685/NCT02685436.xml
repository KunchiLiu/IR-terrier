	<brief_summary>Wheezy infants were tested for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) using combined multiple channel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH), esophagogastroduodenoscope (EGD), lipid laden macrophage index and BAL pepsin. Wheezy infants with abnormal MII-pH or reflux esophagitis were given domperidone and omeprazole then re-evaluated for symptoms control and exacerbations recurrence.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Wheezy infants were tested for gastro-esophageal reflux disease using combined MII-pH, EGD, LLMI and BAL pepsin. Wheezy infants with abnormal MII-pH or reflux esophagitis were given domperidone and omeprazole for 12 weeks then re-evaluated for symptoms control and wheeze exacerbations recurrence.</detailed_description>
