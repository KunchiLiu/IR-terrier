	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, cross-over study. The aim of this study is to compare the post-prandial glycaemic variability after pure protein meal following with an administration of square-wave bolus of meal-insulin or without any meal-insulin bolus on the other day. Prolonged post-prandial glycaemic variability will be identified using the self-monitoring of blood glucose (10-point curve) and CGMS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Requirement for Pure-protein Meal in Children With Type 1 Diabetes on Insulin Pumps.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The square-wave bolus (for meals rich in fat and/or protein) is evenly delivered over several hours as programmed by the patient. The required insulin dose will be calculated based on patient's insulin-exchange ratio. Pure protein meal will be given 3 hours after a first breakfast. To provide the minimal impact of the previous breakfast, all patients will receive up to 120 kcal of carbohydrates and &lt;100 kcal from protein and fat for the first breakfast (without any extended bolus) Patients receive a standardized pure protein meal at a second breakfast time. Meal insulin will be given as a square bolus or no meal -insulin will be given at all. The 5h post-meal glucose excursions will be recorded by self-blood glucose measurements (SMBG) (every 30 minutes) and continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). The intervention is taking part under in-patient clinical conditions.</detailed_description>
