	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of deep breathing manoeuvres on inter ventricular interdependency physiology. By providing further insight in this basic physiology we want to add more comprehensive data in favor or not of constrictive pericarditis diagnostic criteria currently used in cardiovascular magnetic resonance.</brief_summary>
