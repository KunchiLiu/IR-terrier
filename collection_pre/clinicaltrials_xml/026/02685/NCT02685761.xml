	<brief_summary>It is the purpose of this study to evaluate the relationship between a low transverse, vertical midline, and supra-panicular high transverse skin incisions and the rate of wound complications in women with a BMI of 40 or greater undergoing a cesarean section for delivery. So far, the choice of incision for the morbidly obese is based only on case reports. No randomized controlled trials have been done up to date comparing these methods. It is our hope that a high transverse incision will have all of the benefits of a low transverse skin incision, with the added benefit of better exposure offered by a vertical midline incision, without the added increased risk of subjecting the woman to a vertical hysterotomy.</brief_summary>
