	<brief_summary>As combat women soldiers are required to more intensive daily activity the investigators believe that the impact of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea and its clinical consequence (as characterized by, anemia iron deficiency and reduced quality of life)) on personal performance will be more significant in combat women soldiers compared to non-combat women soldiers. Using cohorts from the same environment will enable the investigators to better study the effect of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea eliminating other uncontrolled factors, such as nutrition. The study does not include any intervention.</brief_summary>
