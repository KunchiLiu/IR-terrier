	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamic Study of Mongersen in Patients With Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be screened to provide 20 enrolled subjects who complete 12 weeks of mongersen (GED-0301) 160 mg daily (QD) treatment as open-label therapy. The study will consist of 4 periods: - Screening Period - up to 4 weeks - Induction Period - 12 weeks (Week 0 Visit through Week 12 Visit) Maintenance Period - 88 weeks (after Week 12 Visit through Week - 100 Visit) - Follow-up Period - 4 weeks (ie, no Investigational Product (IP) taken Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment from this study prior to Week 100 will have an Early Termination Visit and also enter the 4-week Follow-up Period. At the Screening Visit, all subjects who meet the entrance criteria will be eligible to enter the study. The number of subjects with previous exposure to Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α) blockers is targeted to be approximately 40% (ie, approximately86 subjects)</detailed_description>
