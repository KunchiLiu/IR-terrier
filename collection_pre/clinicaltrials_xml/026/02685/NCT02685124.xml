	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of intake of two orange juice varieties in healthy adults. The participants will receive "Bahia" orange juice, "Cara-Cara" orange juice or a isocaloric control drink in a cross-over study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolomic Approach to Evaluate the Effect of Orange Juice Intake in Healthy Humans (METABORANGE).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The consumption of fruits and vegetables is linked to a decrease in the incidence of chronic diseases. Citrus fruits represent the main source of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, vitamin C and carotenoids in the brazilian diet. Unlike the "Bahia", the "Cara Cara" variety which is a spontaneous mutation of "Washington navel" orange is characterized by a bright red pulp due to high levels of lycopene. This difference in the chemical composition may lead to a different biological activity and then a greater protective effect on health. Since the biological effects generated from a food intake are the result of the interaction of various nutrients with different metabolic pathways, the investigators will apply the metabolomic approach to investigate the complex relationships between fruit intake, bioactive compounds and human metabolism. The investigators will propose to describe the metabolic pathways affected by orange juice intake and to identify biomarkers that can be used in nutritional interventions.</detailed_description>
