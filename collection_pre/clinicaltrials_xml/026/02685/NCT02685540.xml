	<brief_title>Death Rate in Anesthesia: A Study in a Tertiary Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Death rate in anesthesia is one of the most valuable methods to assess the safety of anesthesia practice among different types of patients. Most of the studies of death rate in anesthesia are retrospective. Although retrospective studies suffer many draw backs in their design and results, but they are still common method to evaluate the safety of anesthesia practice for surgical patients. In the investigators study, the investigators will review the death rate in anesthesia whether regional or general over the past five years from 2010 to 2014, by examining the patients records from the hospital database. The cause of death will be grouped into: totally anesthesia related, partially anesthesia related, surgery related or patient condition related. The records and files of dead patients will be examined by committee from the researchers to estimate the cause of death. The end point of the investigators study will be anesthesia death rate inside the hospital.</detailed_description>
