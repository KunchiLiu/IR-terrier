	<brief_summary>To date no targeted agents are available to treat TNBC. Therefore chemotherapy is the only treatment option. TNBC often has a high amount of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. Stimulating the immune cells of TNBC might therefore be an option for these patients to increase the pathological complete response. pCR is highly correlated with outcome in TNBC. Therefore the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to chemotherapy might be an additional option for these patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To date no targeted agents are available to treat TNBC. Therefore chemotherapy is the only treatment option. TNBC often has a high amount of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. Stimulating the immune cells of TNBC might therefore be an option for these patients to increase the pathological complete response. pCR is highly correlated with outcome in TNBC. Therefore the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to chemotherapy might be an additional option for these patients. The primary objective therefore is to compare the pathological complete response (pCR= ypT0 ypN0) rates of neoadjuvant treatment of sequential, nab-Paclitaxel followed by EC +/- the PD-L1 antibody MEDI4736 in patients with early triple negative breast cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent for all study according to local regulatory requirements prior to beginning specific protocol procedures. Complete baseline documentation must be sent to GBG Forschungs GmbH. Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by core biopsy. Fineneedle aspiration alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not allowed. In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint. Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of &gt;=2 cm or a sonographical size of &gt;=1 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions, preferably by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation can be used as measurable lesion. Patients must be in the following stages of disease: cT1b cT4ad irrespective of nodal involvement. In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should be measured. Triple negative disease with centrally confirmed ER negative/PR negative/HER2 negative, and centrally confirmed Ki67 value. ER/PR negative is defined as &lt;1% stained cells and HER2negative is defined as either IHC 0/1+ or IHC 2+ and insitu hybridisation (ISH) of either ratio &lt;2.0 or less than 6 copies of HER2 per tumor cell. Stromal TILs will be evaluated in three groups: no immune infiltrate (010% stromal TILs) intermediate immune infiltrate (1159% stromal TILs), LPBC 60100% stromal TILs. PDL1 status and other predefined markers will be prospectively assessed during the study. Formalinfixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the GBG central pathology laboratory prior to randomization. Age &gt;=18 years. ECOG Performance status 01. Normal cardiac function must be confirmed by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or shortening fraction) within 3 months prior to randomization. Results must be above the normal limit of the institution. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all women of childbearing potential. Female subjects must either be of nonreproductive potential (ie, postmenopausal by history: &gt;=60 years old and no menses for &gt;=1 year without an alternative medical cause; OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry. Complete staging workup within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must have had bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound (21 days), breast MRI (optional), chest Xray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan done. In case of positive bone scan, bone Xray is mandatory. Other tests may be performed as clinically indicated. Patients must be available and compliant for central diagnostics, treatment and followup. Laboratory requirements: Hematology, Hepatic function, Renal Function, Thyroid function Prior chemotherapy for any malignancy. Prior radiation therapy for breast cancer. Pregnant or lactating patients. Patients of childbearing potential must implement adequate nonhormonal contraceptive measures (barrier methods, intrauterine contraceptive devices, sterilization) during study treatment. Inadequate general condition (not fit for dosedense, doseintensified anthracyclinetaxanetargeted agentsbased chemotherapy). Previous malignant disease being diseasefree for less than 5 years (except CIS of the cervix and nonmelanomatous skin cancer). Known or suspected congestive heart failure (&gt;NYHA I) and / or coronary heart disease, angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication, previous history of myocardial infarction, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, uncontrolled or poorly controlled arterial hypertension (i.e. BP &gt;140 / 90 mm Hg under treatment with two antihypertensive drugs), rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment, clinically significant valvular heart disease. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) â‰¥470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) using Bazett's Correction Active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) History of primary immunodeficiency History of allogeneic organ transplant Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active bleeding diatheses including any subject known to have evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Known history of previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry or within 30 days of receiving MEDI4736 Autoimmune disease and conditions (i.e. inflammatory bowel disease) History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including psychotic disorders, dementia or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results Preexisting motor or sensory neuropathy of a severity &gt;= grade 2 by NCICTC criteria v 4.0. Currently active infection. Incomplete wound healing or unhealed bone fracture. Definite contraindications for the use of corticosteroids Known hypersensitivity reaction to one of the compounds or incorporated substances used in this protocol; Concurrent treatment with: chronic corticosteroids prior to study entry with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or equivalent corticosteroid. other immunosuppressive medication (e.g. low dose MTX) sex hormones (including hormonal contraception) prior treatment must be stopped before study entry. other experimental drugs or any other anticancer therapy. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational, not marketed drug within 30 days prior to study entry. Any previous treatment with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor, including MEDI4736 Male patients.</criteria>
