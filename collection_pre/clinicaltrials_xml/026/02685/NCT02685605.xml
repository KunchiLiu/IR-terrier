	<brief_summary>INTRAGO II resembles a multicentric, prospective, randomized, 2-arm, open-label clinical phase III trial which tests if the median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) can be improved by the addition of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) to standard radiochemotherapy.</brief_summary>
