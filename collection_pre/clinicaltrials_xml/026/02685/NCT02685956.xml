	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of the Sentosa SA HSV1/2 Qualitative PCR Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will utilize residual samples from male and female patients with signs and symptoms of oral or genital HSV infections. Genital samples will include internal and external genital lesions such as those collected from lesions of the anus, buttocks, vagina, labia, or penis. Oral samples will include those collected from lip, gum, and mouth lesions. For concordance testing, the sample size is based on historical study design and estimates of the expected prevalence of HSV1 and/or HSV2 in the population enrolled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sample was taken from a lesion from an internal or external oral or genital site. Sample was submitted to a clinical laboratory for the purpose of testing for the presence of HSV1 or HSV2. The following information about the patient from which the sample was taken is available: presumptive diagnosis or signs and symptoms causing assay requisition; site of lesion; age at time of sample collection or date of birth, and sex. Sample was collected in universal viral transport media, using a plastic shaft swab made of either polyester, cotton, rayon or Dacron. There is sufficient residual sample to perform both test and reference assays. Sample leaked during shipment or storage prior to assay. Sample has undergone more than 1 freezethaw cycle before testing; Sample eluent is not clear after centrifugation (refer to section 6.3.1). Sample ID is missing or ambiguous. Sample is collected using alginate calcium swab. Sample handling and storage requirement in section 5.4 not followed</criteria>
