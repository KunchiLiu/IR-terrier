	<brief_title>A Study of Durvalumab in Combination With Lenalidomide With and Without Dexamethasone in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dose-finding phase will determine recommended dose (RD) for durvalumab in combination with lenalidomide (LEN) with and without dexamethasone (dex) in a 28-day treatment cycle. Three treatment Cohorts (A, B, and C) will be enrolled in parallel: - Cohort A: durvalumab + LEN +dex on high risk Transplant non-eligible (TNE) Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) subjects; - Cohort B: durvalumab + LEN +dex (Dex for up to 12 cycles) on ≥ 65 years old TNE NDMM subjects who are not high risk; - Cohort C: durvalumab + LEN as maintenance on post-transplant high risk NDMM subjects; Based on experience with durvalumab for other indications, the initial dose of durvalumab will be 1500 mg for each treatment cohort. The dose of durvalumab might be de-escalated to 750 mg level. The dose of LEN will be 25 mg (adjustable per the CrCl) value on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day treatment cycle for subjects on Cohort A and B. The dose of LEN will be 10 mg on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day treatment cycle for subjects on Cohort C. The dose of dex will be 40 mg/day (for subjects ≤ 75 years old) or 20 mg/day (for subjects &gt; 75 years old) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle for Cohort A and Cohort B (for up to 12 cycles). Initially, 6 subjects will be enrolled into each cohort and each will receive 1500 mg durvalumab. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period will be the first treatment cycle. - If ≤ 1 of the 6 initial subjects experience a DLT within the first cycle, then the doseexpansion phase may be initiated with durvalumab 1500 mg as the recommended dose (RD); - If 2 or more of the 6 initial subjects experience a DLT within the first cycle, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been exceeded and de-escalation to durvalumab 750 mg level after review of safety and PK/Pd of the initial 6 subjects by the DRT Any of the cohorts may be removed from the study based on emerging PK, Pd, efficacy or safety data. Dose de-escalation will only occur after review of safety (DLT) and possibly PK/Pd data by the Dose Review Team ( DRT). Note: In the US, two treatment arms (A and B) will be enrolled in parallel. Cohort C will enroll upon completion of at least 4 cycles of follow-up for safety assessment of Cohorts A and B.</detailed_description>
