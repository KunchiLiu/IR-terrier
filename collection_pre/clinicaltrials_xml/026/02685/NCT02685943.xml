	<brief_summary>Although suicide risk is highly prevalent among the patient population in mental health care, remarkably little research exists on effective treatments. Among a small set of novel approaches, CAMS is particularly promising. The investigators compare CAMS to TAU in a randomized controlled trial at four departments in Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, hypothesizing CAMS to be the superior approach. Primary outcome measures are suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, with secondary outcome measures including general symptoms of mental health problems. Changes in the outcome measures are compared between the two groups from baseline to 6 and 12 months after patients are included in the study. The study has the potential to impact the science of treating suicidal individuals and it could benefit the general public by establishing CAMS as an effective clinical approach for rapidly reducing suicide risk.</brief_summary>
