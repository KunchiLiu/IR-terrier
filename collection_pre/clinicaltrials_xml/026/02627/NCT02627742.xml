	<brief_title>Evaluation of The MetaNeb® System to Reduce Postoperative Pulmonary Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative pulmonary complications (PPC) are associated with significant excess morbidity, mortality and healthcare expenditure. Although PPCs are an incompletely understood multifactorial syndrome, atelectasis is recognized as a critical component. A variety of strategies have been shown to reduce the risk for development of post-operative atelectasis including lung expansion (LE) therapies. Well-designed studies are needed to distinguish which LE approach has the greatest potential to optimize patient care, clinical outcomes and cost savings. Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) devices have been in use for more than 25 years and are used widely in the acute care, post-surgical, and homecare setting. Such devices provide both LE and airway clearance therapy (ACT) for patients with obstructive and/or restrictive lung diseases and conditions. The MetaNeb® System is an LE expansion modality that incorporates all the physiological effects of IPV while providing additional therapeutic advantages intended primarily to more effectively treat or prevent pulmonary atelectasis. The study will be conducted in two stages. In Stage I of the study, a retrospective review of medical records for post-surgical patients, who received STANDARD THERAPY as defined by current hospital and respiratory care department policies and procedures will be performed. In Stage II, a CHANGE IN PRACTICE will be made and patients will receive standard care with the addition of therapy with The MetaNeb® System. Demographic, clinical &amp; outcome data will be collected for eligible patients during the two stages of the study. Study staff will collect data from the medical records, following a protocol determined schedule.</detailed_description>
