	<brief_summary>Periodontal Diseases are considered the sixth complication of Diabetes Mellitus (DM). This close relationship between both diseases is characterized by mutual influence. The presence of DM might impair prognosis of diverse dental treatments due to its inflammatory nature, negative influence on wound healing, on bone biology, and the establishment of infections. Consequently, knowledge of new dental therapies and the biology of dental treatments for chronic periodontitis in diabetic patients can enhance quality of life and make these treatments more adequate for this common profile of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Adjunct Photodynamic Therapy in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become a global epidemic. Its complications can have a significant impact on quality of life, longevity, and costs in public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2030, 439 million people will suffer from diabetes, around 10% of the world adult population (WHO, 2011). Periodontal Diseases are considered the sixth complication of DM. This close relationship between both diseases is characterized by mutual influence. Thus, an appropriate control of periodontal disease may facilitate the DM control, improving quality of life on diabetes patients. Besides that, the presence of DM might impair prognosis of diverse dental treatments due to its inflammatory nature, negative influence on wound healing, on bone biology, and the establishment of infections. Consequently, knowledge of new dental therapies and the biology of dental treatments for chronic periodontitis in diabetic patients can enhance quality of life and make these treatments more adequate for this common profile of patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy as adjunct to full-mouth debridement for the treatment of periodontitis in type 2 diabetic patients through a split-mouth randomized triple-blind clinical trial.</detailed_description>
