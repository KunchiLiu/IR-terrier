	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Huaier (Trametes robiniophila Murr) is a traditional Chinese medicine, which has been widely used in China for many years. The investigators have found that Huaier could exert synergistic effects with Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide, and Paclitaxel on breast cancer cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective when given together with Huaier in the neoadjuvant setting . PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of treatment with Huaier Granule in managing locally advanced breast cancers with synergistic action of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
