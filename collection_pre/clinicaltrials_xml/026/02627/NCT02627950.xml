	<brief_summary>The current prospective, randomized, controlled MonAMI trial aims to systematically examine the effects of morphine on the platelet inhibitory effects of the orally administered platelet inhibitor ticagrelor in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In addition, the potential positive or negative effects of MCP in combination with morphine on platelet inhibition will be studied.</brief_summary>
