	<brief_title>Nu-Mask Intraoral Airway Device Versus Conventional Bag Valve Mask Ventilation Crossover Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study comprised a randomized crossover trial of adult United States Army combat medic volunteers participating in a cadaver laboratory as part of their training. The study took place in Bulverde, TX. Participants were randomized to perform cadaver ventilation first using either the novel Nu-MaskR intraoral device or conventional bag valve mask. A one handed seal technique was used to simulate single operator ventilation. Participants were responsible for mask placement while a ventilator delivered 10 breaths each with a standardized tidal volume of 750 ml. After a 5-minute washout period, they performed ventilation using the alternative device. The primary outcome measure was air leak as calculated by subtracting tidal volume received from tidal volume delivered as measured by the ventilator.</detailed_description>
