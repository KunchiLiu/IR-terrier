	<brief_title>A Study on Assessment of STELARA and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibitor Therapies in Participants With Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, observational, cohort study to collect data on adult participants who have a confirmed diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and are starting STELARA or TNFi as a first, second, or third line of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) therapy. Approximately 1,400 participants will be enrolled into this study, with 700 participants who are receiving STELARA at study entry and 700 participants who are receiving a TNFi therapy at study entry. Recruitment into the study will continue for 2 years, with a 3-year follow-up period. For each participant, the follow-up period will continue for a maximum of 3 years (36 months) after inclusion into the study. Participants will primarily be assessed for parameters of treatment retention, clinical response, effectiveness and safety over an observational period of 36 months.</detailed_description>
