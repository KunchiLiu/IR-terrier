	<brief_summary>Many cardiologists are convinced that early surgery in asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) saves lives. However there is currently no direct evidence for this and most recommendations from the ESC/ EACTS or ACC/ AHA in this field are supported by Level-B or C evidence. Therefore, the investigators designed a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate whether early surgery improves mortality and morbidity of patients with asymptomatic severe AS and low operative risk.</brief_summary>
