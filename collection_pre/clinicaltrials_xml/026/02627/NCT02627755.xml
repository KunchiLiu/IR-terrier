	<brief_summary>The use in a combined way of two systems of intubation (Glidescope + aScope) would condition an increase in the success rate of endotracheal intubation maneuver compared to conventional isolated Glidescope use in patients with clinical criteria of difficult airway.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GlideScope® vs GlideScope® + aScope® for Managing Difficult Airways.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide, up to 600 patients are estimated to die annually as a result of the complications that occur during tracheal intubation The GlideScope® (videolaryngoscope) is used for endotracheal intubation in patients with difficult airway predictors, in this patients overall success intubation rate is 96%. but success intubation rate at first attempt is only 86%. Despite this positive rates, due to high comorbidity when intubation fails, both failure rates (inverse of success rate) are impermissible. 14% failure at the first attempt intubation as well as 4% overall intubation failure. in this study the investigators try to show that new procedure associating aScope® (disposable fiberscope) together with GlideScope® increases the success intubation rate of both ( overall and first attempt).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients programed for general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation required that presents one or both criteria of difficult airway predictors: criteria 1: Arne test &gt;10 (Arne J,1998) criteria 2: Ratio between neck circumference and thyromental distance &gt; 4. (Kim WH, 2011) Patients with mouth opening which does not allow the introduction of video laryngoscope. Patients with indication of flexible fiberoptic intubation with awake patient.</criteria>
