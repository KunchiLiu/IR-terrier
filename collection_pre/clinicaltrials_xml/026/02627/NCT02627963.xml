	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-national, multi-center, parallel-arm study comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment with tivozanib or sorafenib. Subjects will be stratified by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk category (favorable; intermediate; poor) and prior therapy (two prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR TKI); a prior checkpoint inhibitor [programmed cell death -1 protein (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD1-L) inhibitor] plus a prior VEGFR TKI; a prior VEGFR TKI plus any other systemic agent). All subjects will be evaluated for progression free survival, overall survival, objective response rate, and the duration of response as well as safety and tolerability. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis are also included in study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 years or older Subjects with metastatic RCC who have failed 2 or 3 prior systemic regimens, one of which includes a VEGFR TKI other than sorafenib or tivozanib. Histologically or cytologically confirmed RCC with a clear cell component (subjects with pure papillary cell tumor or other nonclear cell histologies, including collecting duct, medullary, chromophobe, and unclassified RCC are excluded). Measurable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria Version 1.1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Life expectancy â‰¥ 3 months. Prior treatment with sorafenib or tivozanib. More than 3 prior regimens for metastatic RCC. Known central nervous system (CNS) metastases other than stable, treated brain metastases. Subjects with previously treated brain metastasis will be allowed if the brain metastasis has been stable by neuroimaging without steroid treatment for at least 3 months following prior treatment (radiotherapy or surgery). Significant hematologic, gastrointestinal, thromboembolic, vascular, bleeding, or coagulation disorders. Significant serum chemistry abnormalities Significant cardiovascular disease, including: Active clinically symptomatic left ventricular failure,uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction, severe angina, or unstable angina within 6 months prior to administration of first dose of study drug, history of serious ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic medications. Inadequate recovery from any prior surgical procedure or major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to administration of first dose of study drug. Currently active second primary malignancy.</criteria>
