	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Ponatinib and Nilotinib in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 2 starting doses of ponatinib as a treatment for CP-CML compared to nilotinib. Eligible patients must have chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML), be resistant to first-line imatinib treatment and have received no other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have CPCML and are resistant to firstline imatinib treatment. 2. Be male or female ≥18 years old. 3. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 4. Have adequate renal function as defined by the following criterion: • Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) for institution. 5.

Have previously been treated with any antiCML therapy other than hydroxyurea, including interferon, cytarabine, immunotherapy, or any cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational therapy. 3. Underwent autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. 4. Are in CCyR or MMR. 5. Have clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, specifically including, but not restricted to: Any history of myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack (TIA) Any history of peripheral vascular infarction, including visceral infarction Any history of a revascularization procedure, including vascular surgery or the placement of a stent History of venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis, superficial venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism, within 6 months prior to enrollment Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV) within 6 months prior to enrollment or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 45% or less than the institutional lower limit of normal (whichever is higher) within 6 months prior to enrollment.</criteria>
