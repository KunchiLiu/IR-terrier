	<brief_summary>Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of complex fractionated atrial electrocardiograms (CFAEs) guided ablation to pulmonary vein isolation based ablation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Hypothesis: CFAE guided ablation will increase atrial fibrillation free survival compared to a PVI guided ablation. Patient population: Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation will be randomized based on a 2:1 ratio into one of two study arms: - CFAE guided ablation: CFAE mapping and ablation during AF aimed at restoring sinus rhythm during ablation, according to methods by Nademanee9. PVI will be checked before and after ablation using a mapping catheter - PVI guided ablation: wide antral pulmonary vein isolation during mapping catheter control of pulmonary vein signals</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CFAEs Guided Ablation Versus PVI in Persistent AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: A prospective, multicenter, randomized unblinded clinical study. Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of complex fractionated atrial electrocardiograms (CFAEs) guided ablation to pulmonary vein isolation based ablation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Hypothesis: CFAE guided ablation will increase atrial fibrillation free survival compared to a PVI guided ablation. Enrollment: 120 patients will be enrolled in this study in 2:1 CFAE vs PVI group randomisation Clinical Sites: International (including non EU-countries), Multicenter study. Patient population: Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (defined as atrial fibrillation which is sustained beyond 7 days but no more than one year, or lasting less than 7 days but necessitating pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, but lasting longer than 48 hours) should be documented either on 12-lead ECG, transtelephonic monitoring (TTM), ambulatory holter monitoring (HM) or telemetry strip and a physician's note showing continuous AF. Furthermore patients who have failed at least one antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) (Class I or III) as evidenced by recurrent symptomatic AF or intolerable side effects of the AAD. Eligible patients who sign the study informed consent form will be randomized based on a 2:1 ratio into one of two study arms: - CFAE guided ablation: CFAE mapping and ablation during AF aimed at restoring sinus rhythm during ablation, according to methods by Nademanee9. PVI will be checked before and after ablation using a mapping catheter - PVI guided ablation: wide antral pulmonary vein isolation during mapping catheter control of pulmonary vein signals Primary Endpoint: Freedom from recorded atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia recurrences (&gt;30 seconds) without the use of AADs through 18 months follow-up, post-blanking, on either a 12 lead ECG on visits or on 24 hour holter monitoring or on symptom driven event monitoring. Additional risks: No additional risks are anticipated for patients enrolled in this study compared to patients undergoing ablation of symptomatic AF outside of the study, because the same catheter is used as in patients outside the study, and both methods (PVI and CFAE) are part of daily practice. Although none reported in the literature so far, CFAE ablation may cause more extensive lesions than other ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation, especially in the posterior wall. This in turn may cause pericardial effusion, myocardial rupture and atrio-esophageal fistula. All of these are potentially life threatening. However, energy settings are changed according to myocardial wall size and pressure recordings, in order to prevent these complications. Furthermore, also in the group of wide antral ablation, the posterior wall is targeted, possibly resulting in the same events. For prevention of posterior wall injury, temperature monitoring in the oesofagus may be used. Thrombus formation is a complication that can occur with any ablation technique. Thrombi may dislodge and embolize, causing a stroke, myocardial infarction or other ischemic event. Therefore, it is required that activated clotting time (ACT) is kept above 300 seconds. This should be monitored every 30 minutes, and heparin should be administered depending on the outcome. The operator is responsible for maintaining an adequate ACT. Radiation exposure during the fluoroscopic imaging of the catheters may result in an increase in the lifetime risk of developing a fatal malignancy (0.1%) or a genetic defect in offspring (0.002%). Potential Benefit: The direct benefit for patients undergoing ablation is the potential elimination of AF episodes. It is furthermore expected that quality of life will improve and less frequent hospitalization will be needed. Whether further morbidity as cerebral vascular events are prevented is subject to discussion. The information gained from the conduct of this study may benefit patients with AF by improving future treatment modalities.</detailed_description>
