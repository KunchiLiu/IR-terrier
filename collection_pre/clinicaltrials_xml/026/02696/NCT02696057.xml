	<brief_title>The Effect of Manual Therapy and Exercise in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>113 patients participating in the study were divided into two groups. The patients in the physiotherapy group were instructed to perform special spinal stabilization exercises, while the patients in the manual therapy group were instructed to perform soft tissue mobilizations, muscle-energy techniques, joint mobilizations and/or manipulation methods depending on the nature of their lower back pain problems. Both groups were offered stabilization, strengthening, stretching, balance and exercise trainings as well as recommendations as to the daily life activities in line with the requirements of each individual. The severity of the pain suffered by the individuals was evaluated through a Visual Analog Scale. Oswestry Disability Index and Short Form-36 (SF-36) Scale were made respectively with respect to the functional condition and life quality. Assessments were repeated before and after the treatment.</detailed_description>
