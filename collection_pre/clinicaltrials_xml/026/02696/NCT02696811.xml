	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that certain compounds inside vegetables can reduce the risk of cancer. Carrots in particular have an association with reduced incidence of colorectal, bladder and breast cancer. Compounds in carrots, called polyacetylenes, have been studied in isolated cells that have shown a reduction in cancer cells as well as inflammatory markers which have been associated with an increased risk of cancer. These polyacetylenes have not been well studied in the human body and it is unclear whether they are able to affect the biomarkers of health (disease) including DNA damage and inflammatory markers. The aim of this research project is to determine whether eating a portion of white carrots every day for 6 weeks can lead to a reduction in DNA damage and inflammatory markers compared to a control period of 6 weeks consuming a polyacetylene-free diet and a control food of a high fibre oat biscuit.</brief_summary>
