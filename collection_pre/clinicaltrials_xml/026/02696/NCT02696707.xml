	<brief_summary>Several large adjuvant trastuzumab trials have demonstrated improved overall survival, in participants with early stage breast cancer, with a 33% decrease in risk of death. However, retrospective analyses of participant outcomes in these trials have demonstrated increased risk of cardiotoxicity (i.e damage to the heart) in a small number of patients (4-8%). At this time, investigators are unable to predict which participants are at increased risk of cardiac-related treatment complications. Currently all patients receive regular cardiac imaging throughout their one year of trastuzumab treatment. At this time, the optimal monitoring schedule for trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity remains unknown, and several published consensus guidelines are currently in use as "standard of care.</brief_summary>
