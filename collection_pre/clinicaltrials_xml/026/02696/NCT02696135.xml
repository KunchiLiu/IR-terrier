	<brief_title>The Chinese Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Study(CHCS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators' research group determined the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in China via epidemiologic investigation was performed in 8080 adults from nine communities across nine provinces in China from October 2001 to February 2002, and started to investigate the Genotype-phenotype correlations by then. The investigators not only found out the hot mutations in Chinese and new related gene which were different from other races, but also uncovered the presence of multiple rare variants in sarcomere genes is a risk factor for malignant outcomes in HCM. The investigators intent to observe and refining the clinical and genetic feature in Chinese patients of HCM and reveal the risk factors for prediction model of prognosis.</detailed_description>
