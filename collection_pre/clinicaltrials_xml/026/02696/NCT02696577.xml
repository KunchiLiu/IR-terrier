	<brief_summary>Intrauterine growth restriction is a common and complex obstetric problem. Intrauterine growth restriction is noted to affect approximately 10-15 % of pregnant women. Intrauterine growth restriction is diagnosed antenatal; however, some of these fetuses, especially if unscreened during pregnancy, may be detected only in the neonatal period. It is very important for obstetricians and perinatologists to identify growth restricted fetuses, because this fetal condition is associated with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. Omega 3 is composed of polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond at the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain. The fatty acids have two ends, the carboxylic acid end, which is considered the beginning of the chain, thus "alpha", and the methyl end, which is considered the "tail" of the chain, thus "omega." Omega3 improve fetal wellbeing by two mechanisms: Firstly, maternal and docosahexaenoic acid supplementation during pregnancy and lactation normalizes intrauterine growth restriction induced changes in adipose deposition and visceral PPARÎ³ expression. Secondly, maternal docosahexaenoic acid supplementation increases serum adiponectin, as well as adipose expression of adiponectin and adiponectin receptors. Novel findings suggest that maternal docosahexaenoic acid supplementation normalize adipose dysfunction and promote adiponectin-induced improvements in metabolic function in intrauterine growth restriction</brief_summary>
