	<criteria>Male or female subjects aged ≥18 years Histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic solid cancers known to express mesothelin on the tumor cell surface (e.g. predominantly epithelial [&gt;=50% tumor component] pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, epithelial ovarian cancer [including the fallopian tube or primary peritoneal], adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, triplenegative adenocarcinoma of the breast, nonsmallcell adenocarcinoma of the lung, endometrial cancer, serous uterine cancer, gastric cancer [including the gastroesophageal junction], colon cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, thymic carcinoma, etc.). Subjects with resected primary cancers who have documented metastases or local recurrence are eligible. Subjects must have no standard therapy available, or have actively refused standard therapy Subjects must meet the criteria for one of the 4 treatment groups: Group A: Adequate hepatic and renal function (controls) Group B: Mild hepatic impairment, i.e. Grade A according to the ChildPugh Classification (total score of 5 or 6) and adequate renal function Group C: Moderate hepatic impairment, i.e. Grade B according to the ChildPugh Classification (total score of 7, 8 or 9) and adequate renal function Group D: Moderate renal impairment, i.e. eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) &lt;60 and ≥30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and hepatic function better than, or equal to mild impairment according to the ChildPugh Classification (total score ≤6) Adequate bone marrow function Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0 or 1 (control and mild hepatic impairment groups), or 02 (moderate hepatic impairment and moderate renal impairment groups) Previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from the cancer being evaluated in this study, except cervical carcinoma in situ, treated basal cell carcinoma, superficial noninvasive bladder tumors or any previous cancer curatively treated &gt;3 years before the start of anetumab ravtansine New or progressive brain or meningeal or spinal metastases Gilbert's syndrome or other benign congenital hyperbilirubinemia or other benign congenital hyperbilirubinemia are not eligible for the mild or moderate hepatic impairment or moderate renal impairment groups. CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade ≥2 bleeding within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine Uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or hypertension. QTc interval &gt;480 ms, heart rate ≥100 bpm or ≤45 bpm, LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) &lt;50% Corneal epitheliopathy or any eye disorder that may predispose the subjects to druginduced corneal epitheliopathy Systemic anticancer therapy (except topical or intracavitary treatments with negligible absorption in systemic circulation) within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine, or within 5 halflives of the anticancer agent before the start of anetumab ravtansine, whichever is longer. Mitomycin C or nitrosoureas must be excluded within 6 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine. Radiotherapy within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine Use of drugs with known renal or hepatic toxicity within 2 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine until the EoT (end of treatment) visit Use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers within 2 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine until the EoT visit Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding</criteria>
