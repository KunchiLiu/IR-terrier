	<brief_summary>This is the Phase 3 of a 3 phase study to determine the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of a health microinsurance scheme in improving health equity and clinical outcomes for private primary care (PPC) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This two-arm, pre-post, quasi-experimental trial consisted of utilizing a HMI scheme (experimental clinic) and normal OOP payments (control clinic) for 6 months. The HMI scheme enabled subscribed households to access a defined benefit package at a selected PPC for treatment and follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of A Health Microinsurance Scheme for Private Primary Care in Malaysia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a quasi-experimental study designed to determine the effectiveness of a community health microinsurance scheme (HMI) in private primary care clinics in Malaysia via a pre-post study of an experimental and control clinic. A proposed HMI scheme, whose price and benefit package have been defined through the earlier Phases 1 and 2, will be accessible to subscribed households at the experimental clinic, while the control clinic has subscribed patients paying as per normal practise, which is by Out-Of-Pocket payment. The HMI scheme enabled subscribers to visit the selected clinic chosen for any form of primary care diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Both the clinics are located in the Jalan Ipoh area, a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, and have common sociodemographic characteristics. A pre-intervention questionnaire will aim to capture health seeking behaviour, delay in seeking medical care, monthly health expenditure and improvements in clinical outcome (assessed by clinical test results). After six months, a post-intervention questionnaire is administered again to the respondents which then allows assessment of the outcome variables.</detailed_description>
