	<brief_summary>Systematic, Comprehensive, One-to-One Training (SCOOT) for Scooter Skills, is a novel, community-based, client-centred intervention where skills training is incorporated into social activities that users want to perform. The trainer also offers problem solving strategies to help manage environmental barriers and to promote social participation. This intervention is different from customary scooter training in that customary training is often very limited and focuses on learning discrete skills outside of the user's normal environment. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of conducting a mixed-methods, rater-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) for new scooter users, which will evaluate the efficacy of SCOOT. We anticipate that the feasibility outcomes will be strong enough to support the conduct of a subsequent multi-site trial with a sufficient sample size to enable us to quantify definitive outcomes such as adverse events (e.g., injuries and abandonment).</brief_summary>
