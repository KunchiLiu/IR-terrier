	<brief_summary>There are 2 parts to this research study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion). The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of nivolumab that can be given either with radiation therapy alone or in combination with radiation and ipilimumab, in patients with NSCLC. The goal of Part 2 of this study is to learn if the dose of nivolumab found in Part 1 when given with radiation therapy and ipilimumab can help to control the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Nivolumab With Radiation or Nivolumab and Ipilimumab With Radiation for the Treatment of Intracranial Metastases From Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups and Therapy: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study part (to learn which dose level of nivolumab you will receive) and to 1 of 2 study arms (to learn which treatment combination you will receive). This is done because no one knows if one study part is the same, better, or worse than the other. - If you are enrolled in Arm A, you will receive nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour every 2 weeks and radiation therapy. - If you are enrolled in Arm B, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over about 90 minutes every 6 weeks, nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour every 2 weeks, and radiation therapy. The study doctor will decide which type of radiation therapy (either stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] or whole brain radiation therapy [WBRT]) you will receive. If you receive SRS therapy, you will receive it 1 time. If you receive WBRT therapy, you will receive it 1 time each day for 10 days. If you are enrolled in Part 1 of the study, the dose of nivolumab you receive will depend on when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the highest dose of nivolumab. If intolerable side effects are seen, the next group of participants will receive a lower dose. If you are enrolled in Part 2 of the study, the dose of nivolumab you receive will depend on the results seen in Part 1. The study doctor will tell you the dose of nivolumab you will receive. All participants will receive the same dose of ipilimumab and radiation therapy. Study Visits: Right before your first treatment and then over 2 weeks (+/- 3 days) after that: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. About 1 month after you have received radiation: - You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. - You will complete the neurocognitive exam. Length of Study: You may continue to receive the study drug(s) unless the disease gets worse, if you have intolerable side effects, or if you are unable to follow study directions. You will only receive radiation therapy during the beginning of the study, either 1 time or for up to 10 days. If the disease appears to be getting worse or the tumors appear to be getting larger, you may still be able to receive the study drug if you and your doctor decide it is in your best interest. Sometimes the disease appears to get worse but the study drug is actually working. However, there are risks of continuing to receive the study drug(s) because the disease may actually be getting worse. You are still at risk for side effects due to the study drug(s). This could also delay starting other treatments. The disease may get worse to the point that you are no longer able to receive other treatments. The study doctor will discuss this option with you. Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed follow-up. Follow-Up: About 30 days after your last dose of study drug(s), you will have a physical exam. Long-Term Follow-Up: Every 12 weeks for up to 1 year: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. - You will complete the neurocognitive exam. If the follow-up is done at another hospital, the information about your medical history, physical exam, routine blood tests, and imaging scans will be sent to MD Anderson for review. If you cannot come to MD Anderson for your follow up visits, the study team may call you every 12 weeks to ask how you are doing. Each call should last about 10 minutes. This is an investigational study. Both WBRT and SRS radiation are FDA approved for local control of metastatic and primary tumors. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma and NSCLC. Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma. It is considered investigational to use radiation therapy, nivolumab, and ipilimumab to treat NSCLC. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 80 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

We will allow prior radiation to other sites, with no washout period, prior to study entry as long as the high dose regions of the prior and proposed radiation fields do not overlap. In patients where the prior high dose area would overlap with the high dose area of the intended radiation, a 4 month washout period will be required. The safety of such treatment will be at discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. 14. Prior CNS radiation is allowed as long as cumulative radiation doses do not exceed tolerance of critical structures as judged by the treating radiation oncologist. 1.
