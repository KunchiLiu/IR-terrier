	<brief_title>A Study of IBRF Disorders of Consciousness Advanced Care/MultiModal Care Protocol in Severe Disorders of Consciousness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there are no empirically validated, evidence-based pharmacological interventions for the treatment of Severe Disorders of Consciousness (SDOC). In addition, it is unclear why poly-pharmacological interventions, while more common in the treatment of other disorders (e.g., cancer, chronic pain), have not been embraced for the treatment SDOC; some of the lone agents used in treatment of SDOC patients are not "indicated" for combined treatment. In addition, the treatment of SDOC traditionally employs the use of single or small combinations of pharmacological agents, with no single pharmacological agent being identified as efficacious or effective. As such, a poly-pharmacological intervention may, inherently, involve pharmacological interactions that were not anticipated by the drug manufacturers or prescribing physicians. The purpose of this study is to document the safety of the IBRF ACP/MCP and to establish its efficacy for those SDOC patients successfully completing treatment. The IBRF ACP/MCP employs a poly-pharmacological approach aimed at studying arousal states and outcomes in SDOC patients beyond those rates documented in literature.</detailed_description>
