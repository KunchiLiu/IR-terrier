	<criteria>Inclusion: Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study. Male and female patients &gt;18 years of age. Patients must weigh between 50kg and 140 kg to participate in the study. Patients with a cardiac ejection fraction of ≤ 45% as assessed within the last 6 months. For PA catheter cohorts, patients who are planned to have a clinically indicated pulmonary artery catheter in place prior to randomization. At baseline, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will be assessed in the sitting position after the subject has rested for at least five minutes. Key Exclusion: Presence of impaired renal function as indicated by clinically significant abnormal creatinine values (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m^2 calculated using the MDRD equation). Patients with values of AST or ALT &gt;100 U/L measured within the last 3 months before randomization. Chronic infection with Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV). A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test excludes a patient. Patients with a positive Hepatitis C antibody test should have HCV RNA levels measured. Patients with positive (detectable) HCV RNA should be excluded. Patients with a history of chronic hepatitis of any noncardiac etiology. History of any active, clinically significant cardiac tachyarrhythmia, such as recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response within the last year. Anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation should be managed per usual clinical practice for patients undergoing right heart catheterization. Patients admitted to an inpatient setting for acute decompensated heart failure within the last 30 days. Patients who have received an intravenous infusion of a cardiac inotrope (e.g.,dobutamine or milrinone) in the last 24 hours prior to randomization. Patients with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of &lt;10 mm Hg at baseline. Patients with any change in their dose of their ACE, ARB, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or βblocker within the last 2 weeks. The total weekly dose of diuretic cannot change by more than 20% within the last week. Patients with known significant valvular heart disease, including any of the following: Severe aortic stenosis (Aortic Valve Area &lt; 1.0 cm^2 or peak gradient &gt; 50 mmHg as determined by echocardiography) Severe mitral stenosis Patients with history of acute coronary syndrome within the last 60 days as determined by both clinical and enzymatic criteria. For PA catheter cohorts, patients with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of &lt;10 mm Hg at baseline. For echocardiographic cohorts, patients with an estimated central venous pressure of &lt;5mm Hg on baseline echocardiogram as determined by inferior vena cava criteria.</criteria>
