	<brief_summary>Polyacetylenes, compounds found naturally in carrots, have shown promising anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory actions in vitro but have not been tested in vivo. To determine whether the polyacetylenes could have an effect in vivo, this study aims to determine whether they are detectible in human biofluids after the consumption of a portion of carrots and whether a difference is seen between a large and small portion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Volunteers will collect urine samples 24 hours prior to the 'test' day and a stool sample either the night before or the morning of the test session. They will have fasted blood taken before eating a portion of carrots with bread and butter. Further blood samples will be taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours. All urine and all stool samples (after 4 hours) will be collected up to 48 hours after the carrot dose. They volunteers will attend two test sessions and will be randomised to receive high and low doses of carrot. At least a week will separate testing sessions.</detailed_description>
