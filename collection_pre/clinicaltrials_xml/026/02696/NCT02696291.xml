	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics of UV-4B Solution Administered Orally as Multiple Ascending Doses to Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of UV-4B oral solution when administered to healthy subjects TID for 7 days. Three cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 active, 2 placebo) are planned and up to 2 additional cohorts may be added pending safety review of the initial cohorts. Safety review will occur after each cohort. Safety is evaluated through Day 15 on the basis of adverse event (AE) monitoring, clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), vital signs, physical examinations (PE), electrocardiograms (ECG), and fecal occult blood testing. Blood samples are collected at specified intervals up to Day 10 for pharmacokinetic assessment.</detailed_description>
