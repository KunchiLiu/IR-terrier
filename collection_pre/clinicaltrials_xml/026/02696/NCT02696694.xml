	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the impact of serum progesterone concentrations on the day of embryo transfer in egg donation cycles under hormonal replacement therapy. As secondary outcomes, the investigators will investigate if endometrial volume measured by three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound on the day of embryo transfer is related with progesterone levels and with chances of pregnancy.</brief_summary>
