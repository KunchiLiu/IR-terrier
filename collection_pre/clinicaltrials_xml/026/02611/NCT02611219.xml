	<brief_summary>The purpose of this feasibility study is to test the potential for successful implementation of an intervention designed to study the effect of six hours out of bed time on the overall level of deconditioning in pediatric stem cell transplant (SCT) patients. Previous research has demonstrated that deconditioning occurs rapidly over the course of the hospitalization post-transplant and can negatively impact quality of life. By encouraging patients to be out of bed for six hours each day, it is anticipated that patients will experience less deconditioning than those patients who previously had no established minimum time out of the bed.</brief_summary>
