	<brief_summary>Retromolar Intubation is a successful option for intubation in patients with an existing retromolar gap in the case that the conventional method fails. Therefore the investigators want to test if the retromolar gap is essential for performing the retromolar intubation technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retromolar Route Access With and Without A Retromolar Gap</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For successful endotracheal intubation an optimal visualisation of the vocal cords is essential. A study comparing retromolar and conventional laryngoscopy showed in patients with an existing retromolar gap, that the retromolar technique is superior for endotracheal intubation especially in patients with a failed 'conventional' intubation attempt. The aim of the following study is to test if a retromolar gap at the right mandible is necessary for the successful performance of the retromolar laryngoscopy technique. Therefore, 20 patients with and 20 patients without a retromolar gap will be investigated. The anesthesiologist will visually determine the view of the vocal cords and score it according to Cormack &amp; Lehane. For an improved view a backward, upward, right-ward pressure (BURP) will be performed, if needed, and scored again. Finally, endotracheal intubation will be performed by the 'conventional' intubation method. If, however, intubation is not possible, then the retromolar technique will be used. In the case that both methods fail, then any (other) intubation method will (can) be used.</detailed_description>
