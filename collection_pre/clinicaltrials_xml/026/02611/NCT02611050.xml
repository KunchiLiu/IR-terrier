	<brief_title>Treatment Decisions for Multi-vessel CAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-vessel coronary artery disease can be treated through percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, or medical therapy. Treatments have risk benefit tradeoffs, making patient preference integral to the treatment decision. The Multi-vessel Coronary Artery Disease Option Grid patient decision aid was developed to improve the decision making process for patients and clinicians. Objectives: 1. Evaluate The Multi-vessel Coronary Artery Disease Option Grid impact on patient treatment decisional conflict, knowledge, and shared decision making. The randomized controlled trial will compare validated and standardized measures of patient decisional conflict, shared decision making, and condition specific treatment knowledge between Option Grid and usual care patients. The investigators hypothesize Option Grid patients will have improvements in patient decisional conflict, shared decision making, and knowledge compared to usual care patients. Baseline feasibility enrollment at each site prior to randomization will be used to identify current treatment patterns, and prepare intervention delivery and fidelity. Registry data will be used to identify patient treatment received and compared between Option Grid and usual care arms. 2. Examine the physician and patient process of and factors influencing Multi-vessel Coronary Artery Disease Option Grid use. Semi-structured interviews and process evaluations will be used to describe Option Grid use and experience and identify factors that are associated with beneficial Option Grid use.</detailed_description>
