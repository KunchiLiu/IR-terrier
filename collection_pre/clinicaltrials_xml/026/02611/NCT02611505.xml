	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of Hepatic Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Intranasally Administered Esketamine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a parallel group, single-center, single-dose, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), study to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single 28 milligram (mg) dose of esketamine in both participants with varying stages of hepatic impairment and healthy participants. The participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups (8 participants per group) based on hepatic impairment which will be classified during Screening. Cohort 1 (participants with moderate hepatic impairment), Cohort 2 (participants with mild hepatic impairment), and Cohort 3 (participants with normal hepatic function and no evidence of liver damage). Participants will self-administer a single dose of intranasal Esketamine 28 mg. The total duration of the study from Screening through Follow-up, is approximately 34 to 38 days. Blood and urine samples for assessment of Esketamine pharmacokinetics will be collected for up to 60 hours after study drug administration. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
