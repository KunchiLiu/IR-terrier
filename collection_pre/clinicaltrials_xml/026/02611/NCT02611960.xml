	<brief_summary>This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus standard of care (SOC) treatment (capecitabine, gemcitabine, or docetaxel) for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or Investigator's choice of standard treatment. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab treatment prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) when compared to SOC treatment.</brief_summary>
