	<brief_summary>Veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan have high rates of co-morbid PTSD symptoms and hazardous substance use (HSU). Evidence-based treatments for these problems are available in VA specialty clinics, but multiple barriers lead to low utilization of these treatments. Novel treatment approaches are needed. Previous research supports that 1) primary care-mental health integration (PC-MHI) services are associated with increased treatment engagement, 2) technology-based interventions are well accepted by Veterans and are more effective when delivered with professional support, and 3) Veteran peer services are associated with improved treatment engagement, patient motivation, and overall functioning. This study will add a Peer-Support component to an existing Web-based Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) for PTSD and HSU called Moving Forward. Preliminary data analyses from our NIAAA-funded trial indicate that participants who used Moving Forward more had larger reductions in PTSD symptoms. Qualitative feedback supports that Veterans want interpersonal interactions while receiving treatment and need help engaging in the treatment more fully. Therefore, this pilot study will investigate if adding peer support to Moving Forward improves patients outcomes. A randomized controlled trial (N=30) comparing Moving Forward to Peer-Supported Moving Forward will be conducted. The peer support component will consist of semi-structured brief sessions conducted weekly for the 12 weeks of study treatment by a VA-certified peer support specialist. Peers will receive study-specific training and weekly supervision from clinicians that are part of the study staff. Primary outcomes will include process outcomes (treatment engagement, patient satisfaction) and clinical outcomes (PTSD symptoms, alcohol and substance use, quality of life).</brief_summary>
