	<brief_summary>Cytokine adsorption using the cytosorb adsorber is currently investigated to reduce the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The adsorber is frequently used in series with continuous renal replacement therapy. Up to date, no data on the removal of antibiotic drugs during combined renal replacement therapy and cytokine adsorptive therapy is available. Therefore, we want to investigate - whether and to what extent antibiotic drugs (piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem/cilastatin) are removed during combined continuous renal replacement therapy and cytosorb adsorption in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock</brief_summary>
