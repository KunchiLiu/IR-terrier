	<brief_summary>There is a theoretical possibility of a complete suppression of HIV viral replication, subject to the use of highly active associations of more than 25 antiretroviral drugs currently available and good treatment adherence. But a key question remains: whether it can persist viral replication low noise HAART, since several arguments suggest a subclinical escape of the virus to HAART at least in some individuals. The technique proposed in this research consists of the detection and quantification of the linear viral cDNA intra cytoplasmic, as persistent novo infection marker in order to highlight the subclinical replication active in treatment of HIV-1 and consider an optimized therapeutic management of patients. Main objective : Comparing the frequency of patients infected with HIV and treated effectively (HIV viral load undetectable plasma with conventional methods) having the HIV DNA into the cytoplasm of their CD4 + T cells from peripheral blood, as cellular infection marker novo persistent, among patients with a therapeutic regimen contains or not the viral integrase inhibitor raltegravir. Secondary objectives - To evaluate the frequency of patients infected with HIV and treated effectively with the HIV DNA into the cytoplasm of their CD4 + T cells from peripheral blood - Evaluate the causes of persistent infection in de novo virological responders to treatment with ART: presence of the HIV genome encoding strains resistant to treatment ART ongoing noncompliance to treatment, type of antiretroviral therapy, CD4 nadir , pretreatment level of plasma HIV RNA, total duration of ART - Assess the impact of persistent novo infection virological responders: cell activation CD4 + and CD8 +, lack of immunological treatment response, changes in lymphocyte ratio T naïve / memory cells cells, the presence of transient increase viremia, residual viremia levels - Identify virological responders may benefit from treatment intensification</brief_summary>

As part of this research, three additional blood tubes (7 ml EDTA tube) will be collected, totaling 21 ml at the time of blood sampling carried out during two consultations scheduled as part of the usual care the pathology of HIV patients in the Service of MIT. These consultations will be conducted at baseline and a further 3 to 6 months from the date of inclusion.</detailed_description>
