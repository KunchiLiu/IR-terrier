	<brief_summary>Functional dyspepsia is a very common disorder of great challenge to clinical management. A therapeutic targets is up-regulation of visceral pain threshold. The transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel therapy that pursues these properties, besides its safety and easy adherence. There is a great need of new treatments for functional dyspepsia. There is no current study evaluating tDCS for this disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of tDCS for the Treatment of Functional Dyspepsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional dyspepsia is a high prevalent disease with substantial costs to health system. There are many available treatments, but disappointing results are reported in clinical trials. TDCS is a noninvasive, secure and painless technique of brain stimulation. It is delivered by a battery-operated device that transfers low intensity electrical current to all surface of the brain. Then there is a modulation of cortical excitability and influence on central neurological functions. It has been reported its efficacy for the treatment of many diseases such as depression and chronic pain. Impairment of central mechanisms of interpretation and threshold of pain are related to functional dyspepsia. Therefore, tDCS may benefit dyspeptic patients. This study is a double blind randomized controled trial to test tDCS effectiveness on functional dyspepsia. Seventy functional dyspeptic patients will be enrolled, being randomized to either tDCS or sham tDCS.</detailed_description>
