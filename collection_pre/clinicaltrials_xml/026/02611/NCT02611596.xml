	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to compare subjects at high risk for silent myocardial ischemia in the placebo group to subjects at high risk for silent myocardial ischemia in the ranolazine group to determine if ranolazine can be used as a treatment to decrease silent myocardial ischemia (SMI). Subjects at high risk for silent myocardial ischemia are defined in this protocol as diabetics with stable ischemic heart disease. This study will look at the impact ranolazine treatment has on biomarkers that have been shown to be highly associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in relation to SMI. If the hypothesis is correct, further studies can be conducted to determine if treatment with ranolazine has impact on long-term outcomes such as hospitalizations, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or sudden cardiac death.</brief_summary>
