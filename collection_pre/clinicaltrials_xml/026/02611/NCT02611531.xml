	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different ways to teach subjects while hospitalized how to use respiratory inhalers and to follow-up after discharge home from the hospital to determine durability of the education.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Video vs. TTG Respiratory Inhaler Technique Assessment and InstructioN (V-TRaIN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results in over a million hospitalizations in the United States annually and COPD is the third leading cause of 30-day re-hospitalizations. Clinical trials have established the efficacy of treatments primarily dispensed via respiratory inhaler devices that reduce morbidity and health care utilization if they are used correctly. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these medications in real-world settings is limited by the fact that patients often do not use inhalers correctly. Current guidelines recommend assessing and teaching inhaler technique at all health care encounters, including hospitalization. My work has found that over 75% of hospitalized patients in an urban, predominantly underserved population misuse their respiratory inhalers, highlighting a missed opportunity to educate these patients with high potential to benefit. Hospitalization, therefore, provides a potential 'teachable moment' to correct this misuse. My preliminary data indicate that one strategy, in-person teach-to-goal (TTG), is effective in teaching hospitalized patients proper inhaler technique and is more effective than simple verbal instruction. While TTG is a promising method to improve care for patients who use inhalers, several limitations prevent widespread adoption. First, TTG relies on in-person assessment and education, as well as training and monitoring instructors to ensure fidelity, making it time-consuming and costly. Also, because a single educational session does not ensure long-term retention, post-discharge reinforcement may be needed, which may be impractical with in-person TTG. One potential method to surmount TTG's limitations is use of interactive video module education (VME), a method that has been used for health education in other clinical contexts. Through iterative self-assessments and video-demonstrations on a tablet computer, VME has the potential to be less costly, maintain fidelity, and be more easily extended into the post-discharge setting than in-person TTG. However, certain questions remain about VME. It is unclear whether VME will yield similar results when compared to TTG, or whether patients will have the ability to, and be willing to use, VME in the post-discharge setting. Therefore, before widespread implementation of VME, it is critical to rigorously develop and test VME for inhaler education in the hospital setting. Ultimately, it will also be important to understand patients' ability and willingness to use post-discharge VME for educational reinforcement to allow for this strategy to transition patients across care settings from hospital to home.</detailed_description>
