	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of induction treatment with obinutuzumab, polatuzumab vedotin, and venetoclax in participants with relapsed or refractory FL, and with rituximab, polatuzumab vedotin, and venetoclax in participants with DLBCL. Participants with FL who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at the end of induction therapy will receive post-induction treatment with obinutuzumab and venetoclax, and participants with DLBCL who achieve CR or PR at the end of induction (EOI) will receive post-induction treatment with rituximab and venetoclax.</brief_summary>
