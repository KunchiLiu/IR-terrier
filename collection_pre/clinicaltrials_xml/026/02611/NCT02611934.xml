	<brief_summary>Mild Therapeutic Hypothermia for Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome and Cardiac Arrest Treated with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (UNICORN) study is designed to determine whether mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) applied in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and cardiac arrest treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with better clinical outcomes as compared with therapy without MTH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mild Therapeutic Hypothermia for Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome and Cardiac Arrest Treated With PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The UNICORN study is a multi-center, international, observational, phase IV clinical trial which is aimed to investigate whether MTH applied in patients with ACS and cardiac arrest treated with PCI is associated with better clinical outcomes as compared with therapy without MTH. This trial will provide important information regarding the impact of MTH in unconscious with a score of ≤8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale on admission to the hospital after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with diagnosed or presumed ACS and shockable initial rhythm.</detailed_description>
