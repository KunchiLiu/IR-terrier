	<brief_title>Neurohumoral Mechanism of Deferent Frequency Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation(TEAS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were randomly assigned to three groups, receiving TEAS 30min before anesthesia. The frequency of high frequency group is set to 10/50HZ, low frequency group is 2/10HZ, and the fake stimulation group only attach electrodes without electric current. Acupoint selection is bilateral Neiguan points(PC6). Venous blood is collected 4ml before and immediately after TEAS respectively. Heart rate variability is monitored continuously during the 30min TEAS. The adverse events recorded.</detailed_description>
