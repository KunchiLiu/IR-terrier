	<brief_title>Study of Intranasal Ketamine for Social Impairment in Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To address the significant need for effective treatment of core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), this trial is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study of intranasal ketamine in 24 individuals with ASD ages 12- 30 years using a novel quantitative eye-tracking outcome measure to assess impact of the drug on social impairment. Additionally, to develop a ketamine-focused personalized medicine approach in ASD, the investigators will include pharmacokinetic, molecular pharmacodynamic, and electrophysiological assessments into initial systematic study.</detailed_description>
