	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and feasibility of a new less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) technique with a specific designed cannula for surfactant administration using Beractant replacement in preterm infants &lt;32 weeks of gestation and compare short and long term outcomes with the intubation, administration of surfactant and extubation method (INSURE). This was a single-center, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, controlled study with an experimental cohort of 30 patients treated with LISA and a retrospective control group comprising the 30 most recently treated patients with INSURE. Beractant (4 ml/Kg) was administered as exogenous surfactant in both groups if patients on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) during the first three days of life were needed of more than 30% of fraction of inspired oxygen inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Preterm infants of less than 32 weeks of gestation (WG)breathing spontaneously on nCPAP during the first three days of life that met exogenous surfactant administration criteria (Table l) were eligible to enroll in the study Infants who met intubation criteria (Table 1) at the moment of the surfactant administration were excluded in both groups.</criteria>
