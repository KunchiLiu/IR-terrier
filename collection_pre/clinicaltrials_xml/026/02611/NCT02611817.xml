	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab Subcutaneous (SC) as Maintenance Therapy in Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab subcutaneous (vedolizumab SC). Vedolizumab SC is being tested to treat people who have moderate to severely active Crohn's disease (CD). This study will look at clinical remission in participants with CD who receive vedolizumab SC maintenance therapy after having achieved a clinical response to vedolizumab IV induction therapy. The study will enroll approximately 824 patients. Participants will enter a 6 week Induction Phase where they will be administered open-label vedolizumab IV 300 mg via infusion at Days 1 and 15, and will then be assessed for a clinical response at Week 6. Participants who achieve a clinical response at Week 6 will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups: - Vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2W - Placebo SC Q2W Participants who do not achieve a clinical response will not be randomized into the Maintenance Period, and instead will receive a third infusion of vedolizumab IV 300 mg at Week 6. This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 71 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Participants will also participate in a long-term safety follow-up, by phone, at 6 months after the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) established at least 3 months prior to screening by clinical and endoscopic evidence corroborated by a histopathology report. 2. Moderately to severely active CD as determined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of 220 to 450 within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug and 1 of the following: Creactive protein (CRP) level &gt;2.87 mg/L during the Screening Period OR Ileocolonoscopy with photographic documentation of a minimum of 3 nonanastomotic ulcerations (each &gt;0.5 cm in diameter) or 10 aphthous ulcerations (involving a minimum of 10 contiguous cm of intestine) consistent with CD, within 4 months prior to Screening OR Fecal calprotectin &gt;250 mcg/g stool during the screening period in conjunction with computed tomography enterography (CTE), magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), contrastenhanced small bowel radiography, or wireless capsule endoscopy revealing CD ulcerations (aphthae not sufficient), within 4 months prior to Screening. 3. CD involvement of the ileum and/or colon, at a minimum. 4. Inadequate response with, loss of response to, or intolerance to corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or Tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFÎ±) antagonists 1. Evidence of abdominal abscess Extensive colonic resection, subtotal or total colectomy. 2. History of &gt;3 small bowel resections or diagnosis of short bowel syndrome. 3. Ileostomy, colostomy, or known fixed symptomatic stenosis of the intestine. 4. Prior exposure to investigational or approved nonbiologic therapies (eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, thalidomide, methotrexate or tofacitinib) for the treatment of underlying disease within 30 days or 5 halflives of screening (whichever is longer). 5. Prior exposure to any investigational or approved biologic or biosimilar agent within 60 days or 5 halflives of screening (whichever is longer). 6. Prior exposure to vedolizumab 7. Surgical intervention for CD required at any time during the study. 8. History or evidence of adenomatous colonic polyps that have not been removed, or of colonic mucosal dysplasia. 9. Suspected or confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, ischaemic colitis, radiation colitis, diverticular disease associated with colitis, or microscopic colitis. 10. Active infections 11. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection, TB (active or latent), or congenital or acquired immunodeficiency. HBV immune participants (ie, being hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] negative and hepatitis B antibody positive) may, however, be included. 12. History of any major neurological disorders, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, or neurodegenerative disease.</criteria>
