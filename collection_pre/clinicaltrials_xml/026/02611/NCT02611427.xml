	<brief_title>Increasing Long-Term Physical Activity After Lumbar Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this RCT is to compare energy expenditure from walking between an experimental group that receives a multi-component intervention based on the Health Belief Model of Behavior Change versus a control group. Patients who had surgery for a degenerative condition will be randomized postop when their surgeons deem them orthopedically stable to increase walking (at about 3 months).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients will be eligible if they had lumbar surgery for a degenerative condition and their surgeon deems it safe for them to walk more. Patients will be excluded if they had any new cardiopulmonary symptoms since surgery.</criteria>
