	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study Between JNJ-54861911 and Transporter Substrates Rosuvastatin and Metformin in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, fixed sequence, 2-panel study in a total of 32 healthy adult participants (16 participants per panel). The study consists of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of approximately 3 weeks (Days -22 to -2), an Open-Label Treatment Phase consisting of a single 19 day Treatment Period for Panel 1 (Days -1 to 18) or a single 18 day Treatment Period for Panel 2 (Days -1 to 17) and a Follow-up Phase of 5 to 7 days. In Panel 1, each participant will be administered a single oral dose of 10 milligram (mg) rosuvastatin on Day 1 and Day 14. Participants will receive JNJ-54861911 at a dose of 25 mg once daily from Day 8 until Day 17. In Panel 2, each participant will be administered a single oral dose of 500 mg metformin on Day 1 and Day 14. Participants will receive JNJ-54861911 at a dose of 25 mg once daily from Day 8 until Day 16. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
