	<brief_title>Assessing the Usability and Clinical Utility of the Congo Red Dot Test: A Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine if pregnant women can understand the instructions, carry out the test, and interpret the test results regarding the need for follow-up or treatment women will be recruited to complete a test instruction and comprehension assessment and a usability assessment. Study participants will be a convenience sample of women seeking prenatal services. Participants will first be asked to review the instructions for the Congo Red Dot Test and complete a short written questionnaire that assesses their comprehension of the test instructions. Participants will then be asked to perform the test using their own urine sample and to interpret the results obtained by answering a second written questionnaire. After the woman performs the test, a healthcare provider will use the urine sample to perform a second test.</detailed_description>
