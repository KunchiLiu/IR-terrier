	<brief_title>Local mEHT + TCM Versus Intraperitoneal Chemoinfusion in Treatment of Malignant Ascites: Phase II RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conservative treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis with malignant ascites (PCMA) is based on chemoinfusion with its inherent toxicity. There is a strong demand for a safe and non-toxic method of treatment of PCMA. The new technology of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) has proven efficacy in many advanced cancers with minimal side effects and synergy with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM has a long history of application at advanced cancer as a symptomatic treatment and enhancer of the general resistance of the organism. Shi Pi Decoction is supposed to be the optimum co-treatment of PCMA according to principles of TCM. Intraperitoneal chemoinfusion (IPCI) with cisplatin and fluorouracil is a widespread standard treatment of PCMA in China. This randomized II phase trial studies efficacy and safety of combination of mEHT with TCM in treatment of PCMA versus standard IPCI (CDDP+5FU).</detailed_description>
