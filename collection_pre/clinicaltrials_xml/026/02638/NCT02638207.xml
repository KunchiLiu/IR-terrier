Patients with active disease, i.e. not being in remission, who are progressive or relapsing prior to trial start or during the Washout Phase 4. Weakness of at least 2 limbs 5. 18 years of age or older 6. Adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score between 2 and 9 (with a score of 2 coming exclusively from leg disability) 7.

Unifocal forms of Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 2. Pure sensory Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 3. Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with conduction block [van den Bergh et al., 2010] 4. Patients who previously failed immunoglobulin treatment 5. Treatment with immunomodulatory/suppressive agents (cyclosporin, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine) during the six months prior to baseline visit 6. Patients on or treated with rituximab, alemtuzumab, cyclophosphamide, or other intensive chemotherapeutic regimens, previous lymphoid irradiation or stem cell transplantation during the 12 months prior to baseline visit 7. Respiratory impairment requiring mechanical ventilation 8. Myelopathy or evidence of central nervous system demyelination or significant persisting neurological deficits from stroke, or central nervous system (CNS) trauma 9. Clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy from another cause such as 1. connective tissue disease or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 2. HIV infection, hepatitis, Lyme disease 3. cancer (with the exception of basal cell skin cancer) 4. IgM paraproteinemia with antimyelin associated glycoprotein antibodies 10. Diabetic neuropathy, unless having a stable HbA1C in treated diabetic patients not exceeding the required normal values 11. Cardiac insufficiency (New York Heart Association [NYHA] III/IV), cardiomyopathy, significant cardiac dysrhythmia requiring treatment, unstable or advanced ischemic heart disease 12. Severe liver disease (ALAT 3x &gt; normal value) 13. Severe kidney disease (creatinine 1.5x &gt; normal value) 14. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection 15. Thromboembolic events: patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within the last year prior to baseline visit or pulmonary embolism ever; patients with susceptibility to embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 16. Body mass index (BMI) â‰¥40 kg/m2 17. Patients with uncompensated hypothyroidism (abnormally high ThyroidStimulating Hormone [TSH] and abnormally low Thyroxine [T4]) or known vitamin B12 deficiency if patients don't receive adequate substitution therapy 18. Medical conditions whose symptoms and effects could alter protein catabolism and/or Immunoglobulin G (IgG) utilization (e.g. proteinlosing enteropathies, nephrotic syndrome) 19. Known Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency with antibodies to Immunoglobulin A (IgA) 20. History of hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis or severe systemic response to immunoglobulin, blood or plasma derived products, or any component of NewGam 21. Known blood hyperviscosity, or other hypercoagulable states 22. Use of other blood or plasmaderived products within three months prior to Visit 2 23. Patients with a past or present history of drug abuse or alcohol abuse within the preceding five years prior to baseline visit 24. Patients unable or unwilling to understand or comply with the study protocol 25. Participation in another interventional clinical study with investigational medicinal product (IMP) treatment currently or during the three months prior to Visit 2 26. Women who are breast feeding, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, or are unwilling to use an effective birth control method (such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner) while on study</criteria>
