	<brief_summary>Objectives: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods： This study designs a novel therapy using dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells. 60 patients will be enrolled. They are randomly divided into transcatheter arterial chemoembolization group and dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization group. Treatments will be performed every 3 weeks with a total of three periods. The mail clinical indicators are Progression-Free-Survival and Overall Survival.</brief_summary>
