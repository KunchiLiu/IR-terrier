	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to examine the health effects of mainstream and secondhand hookah (i.e. water pipe) smoke on pulmonary and cardiovascular functions as well as serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Investigators would like to demonstrate that inhalation of both mainstream and secondhand smoke generated by hookah produces adverse pulmonary and cardiovascular effects and alterations in serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adverse Health Effects of Mainstream and Secondhand Hookah Smoke in NYC Hookah Bars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 20 participants are going to be enrolled in this study; 10 participants smoke hookah and 10 participants are exposed to second hand hookah smoke for 2 hours in NYC hookah bars. Subjects in the control group will also be paired as they were for the hookah bar visit but will visit a control location, where they will be asked to consume a similar amount of food and drink at a wine bar. Pulmonary function, cardiovascular changes, and blood and urine markers of inflammatory mediators before, immediately after and 24 hours after the participants' visits to hookah bars and wine bars will be examined. Air quality monitoring will also be performed at the hookah bar and at the control location. Physiological changes will be assessed by measuring pulmonary function, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygenation status. To determine the extent of tobacco exposure and associated inflammatory changes from secondhand hookah smoke, investigators will measure blood inflammatory biomarkers, oxidative stress, gene expression, tobacco-related carcinogenic metabolites, and exhaled carbon dioxide levels.</detailed_description>
