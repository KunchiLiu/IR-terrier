	<brief_title>A Drug Interaction Study to Assess the Effect of Omeprazole on the Pharmacokinetics of Ibrutinib in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, sequential-design drug interaction study to assess the effect of omeprazole on pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and metabolite PCI-45227 in healthy participants. The study mainly consists of 3 Phases: Screening Phase (within 21 days prior to the first dose of study medication), treatment Phase, and a follow up Phase (10 to 12 days after the last dose of study medication). In the treatment Phase, participants will receive Ibrutinib 560 milligram (mg) orally (4 x 140 mg capsules) on Day 1 and Day 7. participants will receive Omeprazole at a dose of 40 mg tablets orally once on Days 3 through 7. The total duration of study for each participant will be approximately for 29 to 32 days. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics of Ibrutinib. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
