	<brief_summary>The overactivity of sympathetic nervous system is worsening the hemodynamic state of heart failure patients. The present study is planned to reduce the sympathetic tone in patients with severe heart failure by renal nervous denervation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supportive Treatment of Severe Heart Failure by Renal Denervation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient population consists of heart failure patients who are not responding properly to medication and biventricular pacing therapy. The inappropriate response to these therapies is evaluated by patient history (NYHA III-IV), echocardiography (EF &lt; 45%), 6-minute walk test (&lt;440m) and measurements of P-ProBNP. The patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria will undergo renal nervous denervation. The patients will be followed up with the same methods as they were recruited to the study. The overall time of follow-up will be 24 months. The patients are randomised according to the waiting list principle in a manner to 1:1. The waiting time will be 6 months.</detailed_description>
