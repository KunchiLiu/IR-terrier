	<brief_summary>To compare pregnancy rate by Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) administration and urinary Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surge method for insemination in patients undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) at Montaserieh infertility center. The present study comprised 309 infertile women candidate for IUI, randomly divided into LH surge and HCG groups (assign the number for each patient, odds number for LH and even number for HCG group). All patients were subjected to baseline ultrasound and received clomiphene citrate before undergoing serial transvaginal sonography. LH was measured using LH kit when 2-5 follicles (18-20 mm) appeared in LH surge group, and if positive, IUI was performed after 24 hours. In HCG group, the patients received HCG 1000 units and underwent IUI after 36 hours. The pregnancy rate was then compared in LH and HCG groups.</brief_summary>
