	<brief_title>The Effect of Hepatic Vein Pressure Gradient(HVPG)-Guided Therapy in Cirrhotic Patients With Esophagogastric Varices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized controlled trial of Zelen-design. Patients randomly enter two treatment groups: 1) the HVPG group and 2) the non-HVPG group. Treatment allocation is by block randomization with an equal number for both groups. The results are concealed in opaque envelopes.After randomization, patients will have a second chance to decide if they want to stay in the current group.Patients can switch to another group according to their will. If they are in the HVPG groupï¼Œthey will receive HVPG measurement before treatment. If they are in the non-HVPG group, they start treatment without HVPG measurement and receive endoscopic treatment plus Carvedilol.The mortality rate and rebleeding rate will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
