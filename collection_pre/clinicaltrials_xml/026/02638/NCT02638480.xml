	<brief_title>Effectiveness of KneeMD on Flexion Contracture in Total Knee Arthroplasty Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative flexion contracture (FC), defined as &gt;10°, is the most common disabling early complication of primary total knee replacement (TKR) surgery, affecting up to 6% of all subjects. A knee flexion of 65° is required to walk, 70° is needed to lift an object from the floor, 85° to climb stairs, 95° for optimal sitting and standing, and 105° to tie shoelaces. With growing subject and physician expectations for function and range of motion (ROM) after surgery, FC complications have become an early measure of success in TKR surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the KneeMD subject-controlled knee rehabilitation device on the incidence of postoperative FC. The primary endpoints are the preoperative change in active range of motion (AROM) and the incidence of postoperative FC at 2 weeks. Secondary endpoints include the change in AROM in subjects with postoperative FC.</detailed_description>
