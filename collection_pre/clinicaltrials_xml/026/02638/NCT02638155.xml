	<brief_summary>The purpose of this exploratory study is to use Electrogastrography (EGG) to measure and compare the gastric myoelectrical activity between persons with food addiction (FA) and a control group. Additionally, this study will explore if differences exist between perceived hunger and satiety and hormone levels related to hunger and satiety in both groups. The comparison of the EGG readings and hormone levels is the next step in furthering our understanding of food addiction and how the physiology - not simply the symptomatology - of FA does or does not relate to weight management.</brief_summary>
