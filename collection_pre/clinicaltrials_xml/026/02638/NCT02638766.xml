	<brief_title>Single Agent Regorafenib in First-line for Metastatic/Unresectable KIT/PDGFR Wild Type GIST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SDH complex is involved in mitochondrial Krebs cycle and defects in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex have identified, as previously mentioned, in KIT/PDGFR WT. This complex, SDH, has 4 subunits (A-D) and SDH-A or SDH-B are involved in oxidization succinate to fumarate. Therefore, loss of function owing to mutational inactivation leads to the cytoplasmic accumulation of succinate which downregulates prolyl hydroxylase. This enzyme has a negative regulator role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) since promotes its proteasomal degradation. Increased levels of HIF1α can enter the nucleus and activate the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)24. In fact, the VEGFR expression is higher in KIT/PDGFR WT than in KIT mutant GISTs25. Approximately 50% of KIT/PDGFR WT show high expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR1). This expression may correlate also with the loss of SDH due to IGF autocrine loop26. IGFR signals through both MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. As previously mentioned, Regorafenib is able to block MAPK signaling pathway at different levels. Interestingly, early interstitial Cajal cell (ICC) progenitors have a phenotype of KITlowCD44+CD34+IGFR+ while committed lineage of progenitors have KIThighCD44+CD34-IGFR-. Unlike mature or more committed lineage of ICCs, the KITlowCD44+CD34+IGFR+ display resistance to Imatinib in spite of kit signaling pathway activation. Thus Regorafenib could gain advantage over Imatinib for treating KIT/PDGFR WT27,28. On the other hand, other subsets within of KIT/PDGFR WT as B-RAF mutants or NF1-associated GIST could also be sensitive to Regorafenib. In this later subset, protein expression of phospho-MAPK was seen in 92% of cases in a series of 25 patients29. Theoretically Regorafenib could also act blocking STAT3, which is activated by RET proto-oncogen, through RET inhibition. STAT3 is implicated as downstream pathway signal in GIST30. Taken together, the previous data suggests Regorafenib could play a relevant role as upfront treatment of metastatic or unresectable locally advanced KIT/PDGFR WT GIST.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must provide written informed consent prior to performance of studyspecific procedures or assessments and must be willing to comply with treatment and followup. Informed Consent must be obtained prior to start of the screening process. Procedures conducted as part of the patient´s routine clinical management (e.g. blood count, imaging tests, etc.) and obtained prior to signature of informed consent may be used for screening or baseline purposes as long as these procedures are conducted as specified in the protocol. 2. Male or female subjects ≥18 years of age 3. Histologically confirmed GIST KIT/PDGFR wildtype, unresectable or metastatic GIST (confirmed by central laboratory). Paraffinembedded tumor block must be provided by all subjects during screening period. 4. Screening of mutations done in exon 11, 9, 13 and 17 in KIT gene and in 12 and 18 exons of PDGFR gene 5. Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. A lesion in a previously irradiated area is eligible to be considered as measurable disease as long as there is objective evidence of progression of the lesion prior to study enrolment. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 7. Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements conducted within 7 days of starting study treatment: Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper normal limit (UNL). Documented Gilbert Syndrome is allowed if total bilirubin is mildly elevated (≤6mg/dl). Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3.0 x UNL (≤5xUNL for subjects with liver involvement of GIST) Lipase ≤1.5 x UNL Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 30ml/mn/1.73 m2 according to the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated formula. International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤1.5xUNL and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated partial thromboplastine time (aPTT) ≤1.5xUNL. Subjects who are being treated with an anticoagulant, such as warfarin or heparin, will be allowed to participate provided that no prior evidence of an underlying abnormality in these parameters exists. Close monitoring of at least weekly evaluations will be performed until INR and PTT are stable based on a predose measurement as defined by the local standards of care. Platelet count ≥100000mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9.0 g/dl, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/mm3. Blood transfusions to meet the inclusion criteria will not be allowed. Alkaline phosphatase limit ≤ 2.5 x UNL (≤ 5x UNL for subjects with disease involving the liver) 8. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception from the moment of signing the Informed Consent Form until at least 3 months after the last study drug administration. The investigator or a designated associate is requested to advise the subject on how to achieve an adequate birth control. Adequate contraception is defined in the study as any medically recommended method (or combination of methods) as per standard of care. 9. Women of childbearing potential must have a blood or urine pregnancy test performed a maximum of 7 days before start of study treatment, and a negative result must be documented before start of study treatment. 1.
