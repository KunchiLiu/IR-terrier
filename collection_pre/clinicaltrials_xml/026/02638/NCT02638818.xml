Surgical technique (minimally invasive versus open) will be at the discretion of the operating surgeon. Patients will not be randomized to a treatment arm. A subset of these patients will also be asked to take part in a pre- and postoperative in-depth interview to explore the lived experiences of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
