	<brief_summary>Assessment of right ventricular (RV) function in patients with acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) is warranted because RV failure is frequent and associated with worse outcome. Transthoracic echocardiography is the cornerstone of RV assessment but it remains challenging. Quantification of RV deformation by speckle-tracking imaging echocardiography (STE) is a widely available and reproducible technique that readily provides an integrated analysis of all segments of the RV. This study aims to investigate the accuracy of STE-derived strain parameters in assessing RV function during ARDS.</brief_summary>
