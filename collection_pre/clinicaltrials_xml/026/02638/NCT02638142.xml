	<brief_summary>DiurHF is a prospective, multicenter, observational, study that compares continuous with intermittent infusion of furosemide in patients admitted with a diagnosis of ADHF. Previous pilot study design was planned to anticipate a larger multicenter trial able to definitively evaluate the optimal loop diuretic use strategy in patients with ADHF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Loop Diuretic Therapy in Acutely Decompensated Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of intravenous loop diuretics is a cornerstone of therapy for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF); significant concerns have been raised regarding risks and benefits of loop diuretics, particularly about dosage and administration regimen. Recent guidelines recommend the use of these drugs to reduce left ventricular filling pressure, avoid pulmonary edema, and alleviate peripheral fluid retention. Some studies have provided guidelines for the administration of these drugs in clinical practice, but data interpretation remains challenging due to the frequent exclusion of patients with kidney disease from major ADHF clinical trials. Therefore, it is not clear if continuous infusion is better than intermittent boluses in terms of decongestion, maintenance of renal filtration function and prognosis. On the other hand, continuous administration should provide a more constant delivery of the drug into the tubule, potentially reducing these phenomena. The aim of the study is to evaluate the better loop diuretic intravenous administration in terms of renal function, congestion signs, BNP and outcome.</detailed_description>
