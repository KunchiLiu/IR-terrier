	<brief_title>Comparative Efficacy and Safety Study of GP2015 and EnbrelÂ® in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Demonstrate equivalent efficacy of GP2015 and EU-authorized Enbrel in patients with moderate to severe, active (RA) who had an inadequate response to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) including methotrexate (MTX). In addition, data on the safety profiles of both products, including immunogenicity and local tolerability at the injection sites, will be collected and compared. An additional study objective is to identify any potential risk of the transition from Enbrel to GP2015 in terms of general safety and immunogenicity in RA patients</detailed_description>
