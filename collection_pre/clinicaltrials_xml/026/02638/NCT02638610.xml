	<brief_summary>The aim of the study: Assessment of Changes of Periocular Skin Sensation Following Eyelid and Ocular Surface Surgeries. Study design: an interventional study that will be conducted at the ophthalmology department, Meir hospital, Kfar Saba, Israel. the study will include 60 healthy patients, at the ages of 40-80, which are candidates for eyelid surgery: blepharoptosis repair, blepharoplasty, ectropion repair and entropion repair. The patients will be recruited from Meir's ophthalmology outpatient clinic. Each patient will undergo a full ophthalmologic examination including relevant assessment of the specific eyelid pathology. The eyelid's sensation will be assessed at 6 points of the eyelid using the Cochet-Bonnet filament-type aesthesiometer (Luneau Ophtalmologie, Paris, France). Measurements will take place before surgery, and two weeks, three months and six months after surgery.</brief_summary>
