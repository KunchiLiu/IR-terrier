	<brief_summary>This study use anterior segment spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to exam patients with closed globe injury, and compared with slit lamp examination. The results showed that OCT can identify features of closed globe injury that were otherwise not visible on slit lamp biomicroscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anterior Segment Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography in Patients With Closed Globe Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anterior segment architecture changes of closed globe injury patients include corneal damage, hyphema, angle recession and lens dislocation, which can be showed with OCT. OCT was superior to slit lamp biomicroscopy examination in detecting anterior segment architecture changes, especially in the presence of media opacities.</detailed_description>
