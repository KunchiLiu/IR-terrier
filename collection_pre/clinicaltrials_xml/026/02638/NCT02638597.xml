	<brief_title>Gemfibrozil for Nicotine Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot clinical trial examining the feasibility and efficacy of gemfibrozil treatment for smoking cessation. Adults with a desire to quit nicotine cigarette smoking will be recruited. Eligible participants will be randomly divided into two groups: those who receive gemfibrozil and waitlist controls. Screening will be conducted with a brief phone screen followed by a longer screening visit for those who qualify. During the screening visit, all study participants will provide demographic information and will be interviewed regarding smoking history. Procedures performed during the screening visit include a blood draw, urine pregnancy test, physical exam, clinical psychiatric interview, and measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide (CO). At baseline, participants will complete the Heavy Smoking Index (HSI) and the Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU-Brief). Participants will also complete the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self Rated (QIDS-SR) to assess symptoms of depression and changes in mood associated with smoking cessation will be assessed with the Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking (CAST) scale . Participants will work with the research clinician to set a target quit date within one week of the baseline session, and all participants will be provided written materials with guidance for smoking cessation as part of a smoking cessation counseling session. All participants will attend visits at the research clinic at 3 days and 4 weeks from target quit date to assess safety, adherence, and smoking status; participants will also receive additional smoking cessation counseling. Smoking status will be determined with exhaled breath CO and a single item questionnaire regarding the number of cigarettes smoked since target quit date and symptoms of depression and mood changes will again be measured. Medication side effects will be quantified using the Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating (FIBSER) scale. The final study visit will occur at 8 weeks after target quit date for completion of the HSI, QIDS-SR, CAST, FIBSER, exhaled breath CO, QSU-Brief, and smoking self-report.</detailed_description>
