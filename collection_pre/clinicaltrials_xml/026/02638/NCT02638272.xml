	<brief_summary>Whether radical debridement is necessary for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis is still questionable. The objective of this prospective randomized study was to compare the outcomes of radical debridement versus no debridement under different surgical procedures for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Outcomes of Radical Debridement Versus no Debridement Under Different Surgical Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventy-four thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis patients with a neurological function of grade D and E underwent surgeries from January 2009 to January 2014. All patients were divided into group A and group B by taking the drawing of lots. In group A, radical debridement, bone graft and instrumentation were performed. In group B, isolated posterior instrumentation without debridement were performed in all cases and drainage of iliopsoas abscess via laparoscopy in 2 cases. The operative time, blood loss, visual analogue score (VAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), kyphotic angle, Frankel grading, fusion rate and complications were evaluated.</detailed_description>
