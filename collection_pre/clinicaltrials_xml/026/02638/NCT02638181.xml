	<brief_summary>This study was to assess the distinct expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13,tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3, and calcium-sensing receptor, in human trabecular meshwork between normal and glaucomatous eyes.The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase 13, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 and calcium-sensing receptor in the trabecular meshwork tissues were examined by streptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemical staining method and western blot, and histological changes of trabecular meshwork were studied by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining.</brief_summary>
