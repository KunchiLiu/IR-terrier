	<detailed_description>Participants coming on study will be assigned to two groups：Acarbose+Saxagliptin and Metformin+Saxagliptin. It may take 1 weeks to be stabilize to a standardized dose, and then the investigators will follow-up the patients for 3 months.During the period,patients will be asked to come back to the investigators center to receive the related examination every month. The investigators will detect HbA1c，fasting and postprandial C-peptide before and after the interventions.</detailed_description>
