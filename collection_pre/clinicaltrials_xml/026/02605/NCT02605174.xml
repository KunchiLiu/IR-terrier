	<detailed_description>Subjects will be asked to treat a migraine attack with study drug on an outpatient basis. Subjects will be provided with a dosing card containing a dose for initial treatment and a second dose to be used for rescue or recurrence of migraine. Each subject's study participation will consist of a screening visit (Visit 1) with a telephone contact within 7 days to confirm eligibility, a Treatment Period of up to 8 weeks, and an End-of-Study (EoS) visit (Visit 2) within one week ( 7 days) of treating a single migraine attack. The total time on study is approximately 11 weeks.</detailed_description>
