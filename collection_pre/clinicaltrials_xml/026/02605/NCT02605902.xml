	<brief_summary>Gilles da la Tourette syndrome (TS)* is a common chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. In most adult patients, quality of life is significantly impaired. TS, therefore, is a cost-intensive disease (in Germany: mean total costs=€3404/year). Despite significant adverse effects, dopamine receptor antagonists were recommended as first choice treatment for many years. Although efficacy could be demonstrated only recently, today, behavioral therapy with face-to-face Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) (including psychoeducation, habit reversal training, function-based assessment and intervention, and relaxation training) is recommended as first line treatment for tics. In Germany, however, dissemination of CBIT is restricted due to a considerable lack of well-trained therapists. The aim of this study is to overcome this deficiency by creating a new and sophisticated internet-delivered CBIT (iCBIT) program. In addition, internet-delivered CBIT will shorten waiting time, will reach additional groups of patients and will be - once developed and established - highly cost-effective (about € 100 vs. € 1450 for face-to-face CBIT). Investigators want to perform a multicenter, randomized, controlled, observer-blind trial including 160 adult patients in order to demonstrate that 8 sessions (10 weeks) of iCBIT are superior to internet-delivered psychoeducation/relaxation in adult patients with TS. Both immediate (1 week after end of treatment) and long-term effects (after 3 and 6 months) will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
