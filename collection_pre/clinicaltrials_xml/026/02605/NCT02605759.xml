	<brief_title>Coldplay Cryoablation of Dysplastic Squamous Tissue in Patients With Esophageal Squamous Cell Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center, prospective, single arm, non-randomized study. The study will proceed in two phases: a pilot phase, followed by the feasibility, safety and efficacy phase. In the pilot phase, up to five (5) patients at one (1) site will be treated with the CryoBalloon Ablation System to confirm its safety and feasibility in the treatment of squamous dysplasia. The second phase will be conducted at two (2) centers and will enroll up to 50 subjects to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the CryoBalloon Ablation System for the treatment of squamous dysplasia.</detailed_description>
