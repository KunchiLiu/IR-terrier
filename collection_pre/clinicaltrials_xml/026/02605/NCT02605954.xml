	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of switching to elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) relative to continuing on a baseline regimen consisting of abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) plus a 3rd antiretroviral agent in maintaining HIV-1 virologic suppression.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIVinfected adult subjects who meet the following criteria will be given the option to participate in the study: Currently receiving ABC/3TC plus a third antiretroviral (ARV) agent for ≥ 6 consecutive months preceding the screening visit. For subjects with 3 or more ART regimens, a regimen history must be provided to the Sponsor for approval. Allowed third antiretroviral agents include LPV/r, ATV+RTV, ATV+COBI (or ATV/COBI FDC), DRV+RTV, DRV + COBI (or DRV/COBI FDC) FPV + RTV, SQV + RTV, ATV (no booster), EFV, RPV, NVP, ETR, RAL or DTG Documented plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit (measured at least twice using the same assay). In the preceding 6 months prior to screening, one episode of "blip" (HIV1 RNA &gt; 50 and &lt; 400 copies/mL) is acceptable, only if HIV1 RNA is &lt; 50 copies/mL immediately before and after the "blip". Plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at screening visit Individuals will have no evidence of previous virologic failure on a PI+RTV or integrase strand transfer inhibitorbased regimen (with or without resistance to either class of ARV). All documented historical plasma genotype(s) must not show resistance to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or emtricitabine (FTC), including, but not limited to the presence of reverse transcriptase resistance mutants K65R, K70E, M184V/I, or thymidine analog associated mutations (TAMs) (TAMs are: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219Q/E/N/R). If a historical genotype is not available or subject has 3 or more ART regimens, subject will have proviral genotype analysis prior to Day 1 to confirm absence of archived resistance to TDF or FTC. Adequate renal function defined as having an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥ 30 mL/min as calculated by CockcroftGault (eGFRCG) Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
