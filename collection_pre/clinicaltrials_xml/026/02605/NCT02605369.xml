	<brief_summary>Universal coverage of good quality facility based care globally could prevent nearly 113,000 maternal deaths, 531,000 stillbirths and 1.3 million neonatal deaths annually by 2020. Yet, only 57% of pregnant Ugandan women choose to deliver at health facilities. This unacceptably low coverage of facility based births could explain, in part, the high maternal and perinatal mortality estimates in Uganda. While multiple studies have examined factors associated with this low utilization of health services around the time of birth, there is inadequate implementation research exploring the best systematic methods that could promote uptake and scale up of facility based births. This study will therefore examine the effect of an intervention package (peer counselling by pregnancy buddies on facility based births, mobile phone messaging promoting facility based births and provision of mama-kits) on the frequency of facility based births and perinatal mortality. The study, a cluster randomized community based intervention trial in post-conflict Northern Uganda, will provide data crucial in framing national policy regarding measures to promote the use of health facilities.</brief_summary>
