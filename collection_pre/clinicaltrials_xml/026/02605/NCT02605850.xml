	<brief_summary>This study will determine the effects of beneficial compounds of plant foods, such as pomegranate on cardiovascular health. This will be tested by asking healthy males to eat a high fat ground beef patty with pomegranate juice (PJ), pomegranate extract (PomX) or water and then measuring blood vessel dilation (endothelial function) by blood flow We also will measure the amount of Nitric Oxide (NO) in your blood and urine samples and sugar and insulin in blood. Healthy men have been chosen for this study because eating high fat hamburger patties can easily mimic in them the condition that causes atherosclerosis. The results from this study may help to explain how high fat foods can be harmful to the body and how beneficial plant foods can have on cardiovascular function</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A. Specific Aims and Objectives 1. Peripheral arterial reactivity by tonometry after a high fat meal with pomegranate consumption 2. To measure nitric oxide and insulin response after a high fat meal and pomegranate consumption These studies will lead to a better understanding of the role of bioactive substances from plant foods such as the pomegranate may demonstrate the importance of plant-based nutrients on cardiovascular health. B. Background Polyphenols belong to the largest group of secondary metabolites produced by plants, mainly, in response to biotic or abiotic stresses such as infections, wounding, UV irradiation, exposure to ozone, pollutants, and other hostile environmental conditions. It is thought that the molecular basis for the protective action of polyphenols in plants is their antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties. Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is grown commercially in the Near East, India, Spain, Israel and the United States (California) where it is of significant economic importance. Pomegranate fruits and products, including juice, tea, wine and extracts are widely consumed and recognized for their health benefits. Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) fruit possesses strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties. High-calorie meals rich in saturated fat can lead to transient exaggerated elevations in blood glucose, free fatty acids, and triglycerides. This condition, termed postprandial dysmetabolism, generates excess free radicals (or reactive oxygen species). The ensuing oxidative stress triggers a biochemical cascade throughout the circulation, inducing inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. These postprandial changes, when repeated multiple times each day, can create a milieu conducive for the development of atherosclerotic risk factors and coronary heart disease (CHD). In order to investigate the impact of pomegranate polyphenols on postprandial flow-mediated dilation, nitric oxide, glucose, insulin, triglycerides levels in men, we propose to achieve the following specific aims using a randomized study design: 1. Peripheral arterial reactivity by tonometry after a high fat meal with pomegranate consumption 2. To measure nitric oxide and insulin response after a high fat meal and pomegranate consumption</detailed_description>
