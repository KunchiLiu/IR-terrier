	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Chinese Formula AMP-1915 on Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In China, the herbal formulas have been used in the treatment of diabetes for centuries. Huangqisan, investigators named it AMP-1915, is one of traditional Chinese herbal formula used to relieve diabetes which was recorded in Shengji Zonglu (General Medical Collection of Royal Benevolence) published in 1117 A.D. AMP-1915 consists of three herbs: Radix Astragali (roots of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao, A), Mori Cortex radices (root barks of Morus alba L., M) and Puerariae Lobatae Radix (roots of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi., P). Recent studies have shown that these three herbs and their constituents have therapeutic effects on the metabolic disorders. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a community hospital of Shanghai, China. 60 adult participants were metabolic disorder patients according with at least two impaired metabolic profiles (obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia or others). During 3-month treatment, participants were randomly divided in to two groups assigned to take AMP-1915 or placebo. AMP-1915 or placebo was mixed into instant noodles as daily meals with same color, shape, size and packaging. BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TCH), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), insulin, HbA1c were measured before and after treatment.</detailed_description>
