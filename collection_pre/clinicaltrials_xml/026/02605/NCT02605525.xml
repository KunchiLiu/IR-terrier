Participant is on maximally tolerated dose of an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for at least 3 months prior to the baseline visit. 6. Participant must present at screening with current proteinuria levels between 1 g/24 h and 3.5 g/24 h, based on spot urine proteintocreatinine ratio (UPCR) 7.

If a female of childbearing potential, participant must have a negative pregnancy test at screening, is not currently breastfeeding, and agrees to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study. Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study 9.

Participant has IgAN with histologic evidence of advanced tubular atrophy and interstitial 4. History or current evidence of other autoimmune disease 5. History or current evidence of any chronic or uncontrolled medical condition which could, in the opinion of the Investigator, affect the participant's safety and ability to adhere to this protocol 6. History or current evidence of a severe acute or chronic infection 7. Use of systemic corticosteroids within 3 months prior to baseline, or anticipated use during the treatment period (Week 1 through Week 4). Note: Corticosteroids administered by inhalation or intranasally, or limited topical use of lowpotency topical corticosteroids are allowed throughout the study. 8.
