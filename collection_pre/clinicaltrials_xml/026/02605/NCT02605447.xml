	<brief_title>EVOLVE Short DAPT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the EVOLVE Short DAPT Study is to assess the safety of 3-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in subjects at high risk for bleeding undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the SYNERGY Stent System. The study will be conducted up to 120 sites worldwide in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Brazil with planned enrollment of approximately 2,000 subjects. Clinical follow-up will be required at the following time points: 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 15 months post index procedure. Subjects must be treated with one of the following P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for 3 months following the index procedure. Subjects must be treated with aspirin for the duration of the trial. The minimum daily maintenance dose of aspirin should be 75-100 mg. Note: For subjects taking anticoagulation, aspirin between 0-3 months is not required (investigator discretion). Subjects are eligible for discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor at 3 months if they meet both of the following criteria: subject was treated with 3 months of study required antiplatelet therapy post index procedure; and subject was free from events (stroke, MI, PCI, coronary artery bypass graft [CABG], and stent thrombosis) between the index procedure and the 3 month visit. Subjects are not eligible for discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor at 3 months if any of the following criteria are met: subject who experiences a stroke, MI, PCI, CABG and/or stent thrombosis, during the 0-3 month period (between the date of the index procedure and the date of the 3-month follow-up visit); or subject who is non-compliant with study required antiplatelet therapy during the 0-3 month period (between the date of the index procedure and the date of the 3-month follow-up visit); or subject judged inappropriate for discontinuation from P2Y12 inhibitor use at 3 months due to another condition requiring chronic P2Y12 inhibitor use. All enrolled subjects who receive a SYNERGY stent must be followed at all milestones through 15-months, regardless of eligibility to discontinue P2Y12 inhibitor. Following the 3-month milestone, subjects who experience MI or stent thrombosis events should be treated per the investigator's discretion and should be followed through the 15-month visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is considered at high risk for bleeding, defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria at the time of enrollment: ≥ 75 years of age and, in the opinion of the investigator, the risk of major bleeding associated with &gt;3 months of DAPT outweighs the benefit, need for chronic or lifelong anticoagulation therapy, history of major bleeding (severe/life threatening or moderate bleeding based on the GUSTO classification) within 12 months of the index procedure, history of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dl) or failure (dialysis dependent), platelet count ≤100,000/μL 2. Subject must be at least 18 years of age 3. Subject must have had implantation of at least one SYNERGY stent within the preceding 3 calendar days 4. Subject must be able to take study required antiplatelet therapy (as required per protocol) 5. Subject is willing to comply with all protocol requirements, including agreement to stop taking P2Y12 inhibitor at the 3month milestone, if eligible per protocol 6. Subject (or legal guardian) understands the trial requirements and the treatment procedures and provides written informed consent before any studyspecific procedures are performed 7. For subjects less than 20 years of age enrolled at a Japanese site, the subject/ the subject's legal representative must provide written informed consent before any studyspecific tests or procedures are performed 1. Subject with an indication for the index procedure of acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) 2. Subject with an indication for the index procedure of Non ST elevation MI (NSTEMI), based on the 3rd Universal MI definition 3. Subject with treatment with another coronary stent, other than SYNERGY, during the index procedure 4. Subject with planned staged procedures. (Note: Planned staged procedures are allowed if performed within 7 days and with only SYNERGY stents). 5. Subject has a known allergy to contrast (that cannot be adequately premedicated), the SYNERGY stent system or protocolrequired concomitant medications (e.g., everolimus or structurally related compounds, polymer or individual components, all P2Y12 inhibitors and aspirin) 6. Subject with implantation of a drugeluting stent within 9 months prior to index procedure 7. Subject previously treated at any time with intravascular brachytherapy 8. Subject has an active peptic ulcer or active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding 9. Subject is participating in an investigational drug or device clinical trial that has not reached its primary endpoint (Note: registry, observational, data collection studies are not exclusionary) 10. Subject intends to participate in an investigational drug or device clinical trial within 15 months following the index procedure (Note: registry, observational, data collection studies are not exclusionary) 11. Subject judged inappropriate for discontinuation from P2Y12 inhibitor use at 3 months, due to another condition requiring chronic P2Y12 inhibitor use 12. Subject with planned surgery or procedure necessitating discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor within 3 months following index procedure 13. Subject is a woman who is pregnant or nursing 14. Subject with a current medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 15 months 15. Target lesion(s) is located in the left main 16. Target lesion(s) is located within 3 mm of the origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery or left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery by visual estimate 17. Subject has unprotected left main coronary artery disease ( &gt; 50% diameter stenosis) 18. Planned treatment of more than 3 lesion 19. Planned treatment of lesions in more than 2 major epicardial vessels 20. Target lesion(s) treated that involve complex bifurcation (i.e. bifurcation lesion requiring treatment with more than one stent) 21. Target lesion(s) is restenotic from a previous stent implantation 22. Target lesion(s) is located within a saphenous vein graft or an arterial graft 23. Target lesion(s) with a TIMI flow 0 (total occlusion) or TIMI flow 1 prior to guide wire crossing 24. Thrombus, or possible thrombus, present in the target vessel (by visual estimate)</criteria>
