	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the normal brain function of premature infants (23 to 31+6 weeks GA) during birth transition and through the first 72 hours of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will measure components of brain function using two sophisticated, non-invasive technologies. First, amplitude integrated electroencephalography (EEG), a "simplified" EEG with four sensors (single channel), enables continuous non-invasive monitoring of cerebral activity. Second, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is another non-invasive technology that allows continuous real-time measurement of regional tissue oxygen utilization of the brain. Both technologies have been used in newborns and have been predictive of brain injury or neurodevelopmental impairment.</detailed_description>
