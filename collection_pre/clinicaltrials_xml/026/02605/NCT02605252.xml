	<brief_summary>As HBsAg clearance is uncommon in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients on nucleoside analogues (NAs) therapy. The purpose of this study is to optimize HBsAg clearance in CHB Patients with sequential treatment of pegylated interferon alpha-2b and NAs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Strategy Study of Functional Cure of Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CHB Patients who had received, and responded to, NAs for more than 12 months are switched to receive peginterferon alfa-2b 80 micrograms/week for 48 weeks and follow up for 48 weeks.</detailed_description>
