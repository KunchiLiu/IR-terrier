	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the gastric retentive Accordion Pill™ Carbidopa/Levodopa (AP-CD/LD) is more effective than the commercially available immediate release Carbidopa/Levodopa in reducing motor fluctuations such as "off time" in advanced Parkinson's Disease patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of the Gastric-retentive AP-CD/LD in Advanced Parkinson's Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-center, global, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group study in adult subjects with fluctuating PD. The study will have 2 open label Titration periods of 6 weeks each prior to the double blind Maintenance period. In the open label periods all patients will be stabilized on the active comparator Sinemet® and then on AP-CD/LD. The double blind Maintenance period will be 13 weeks long.</detailed_description>
