	<brief_title>Cryoablation Therapy or Radiotherapy Therapy for Stage III Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the tumor control in patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy or cryoablation - To determine the quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (≥ 8 vs 7 vs ≤ 6), persistent prostatic specific antigen (PSA) at allocation (&gt; 0.5 ng/mL vs ≤ 0.5 ng/mL), participating center. Patient are allocated to two treatment arms.</detailed_description>
