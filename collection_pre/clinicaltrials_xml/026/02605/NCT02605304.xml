	<brief_summary>People who are infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have a great chance of being cured of the infection when they are treated with sofosbuvir. However, in some instances, treatment with sofosbuvir-containing therapy does not work. It is not known if treating people with sofosbuvir again (retreatment) after it did not work the first time will work. There is an important need to understand retreatment options in those instances. This study is being done to see if two different regimens, ledipasvir with sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks (Group A) and ledipasvir with sofosbuvir for 24 weeks (Group B) are well tolerated in HCV-infected persons where previous treatment with sofosbuvir failed. This study will also look at the safety of each regimen and how well the combination treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir works in people who have cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>12 Weeks of Ledipasvir (LDV)/Sofosbuvir (SOF) With Weight-based Ribavirin vs. 24 Weeks of LDV/SOF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a pressing need to understand appropriate retreatment options for HCV-infected patients who fail direct acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens. To date, over 100,000 prescriptions have been written for SOF. Recent data indicate that the SOF-based treatment defined as SOF/RBV, SOF/pegylated-interferon (PEG)/RBV or SOF/simeprevir (SIM) +/- RBV have led to SVR4 in 70-92% of HCV genotype (GT) 1 patients, depending on the regimen used and presence of cirrhosis. Thus, there are a growing number of individuals who have failed SOF-based regimens and are in need of a retreatment strategy, the majority of which are anticipated to be HCV GT1, given the US distribution of genotypes. There are no data to inform retreatment strategies for HIV-infected individuals with SOF failure, who have traditionally represented a harder to treat group and are impacted by DAA-ARV interactions. This study is a phase II retreatment study of HCV GT1 HIV coinfected patients who have previous virologic failure on a SOF-based regimen. SOF-failures represent a challenging group to retreat as they have already failed one potent regimen, and in many cases may have failed prior regimens as well. This study will provide much needed pilot data evaluating retreatment strategies of LDV/SOF for prior SOF-failures in HIV/HCV coinfection, including those with cirrhosis. Participants in the study will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: 12 weeks of LDV/SOF with weight-based RBV or 24 weeks of LDV/SOF alone. The participants will be followed for an additional 24 weeks after completion of study treatment. The first 15 participants on ARV regimens with a HIV PI/r with tenofovir will be required to participate in the PK component in order to participate in the study. These first 15 participants on PI/r with tenofovir who enroll to the study will undergo semi-intensive PK sampling (pre-dose, hour 1 and hour 4) at weeks 0 and 4 for quantification of tenofovir in plasma. After the first 15 participants have enrolled, subsequent participants taking HIV PI/r with tenofovir may opt out of the PK evaluations but still participate in the study.</detailed_description>
