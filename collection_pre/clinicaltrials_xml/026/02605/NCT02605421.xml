	<brief_summary>This is a phase II single center study to administer two courses of myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy each followed by an autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) rescue in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have completed induction chemotherapy (independent of this study). Ideally, patients should begin consolidation chemotherapy no later than 8 weeks after the start of Induction Cycle #5; however it is strongly recommended to begin consolidation within 4-6 weeks after the start of Induction Cycle #5.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Less than 30 years of age at diagnosis of neuroblastoma No evidence of disease progression: defined as increase in tumor size of &gt;25% or new lesions Recovery from last induction course of chemotherapy No uncontrolled infection Minimum frozen PBSCs of 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg for each transplant are mandatory and a PBSC of 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg for backup are strongly recommended (thus, PBSC of no less than 6 x 106 CD34 cells/kg is encouraged). These must all be collected prior to the initiation of consolidation. Adequate organ function defined as: Hepatic: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 3 x upper limit of institutional normal and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 x upper limit of institutional normal; Renal: Creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 If a creatinine clearance is performed at end induction and the result is &lt; 100 ml/min/1.73m^2, a GFR must then be performed; Cardiac: shortening fraction ≥ 27% or ejection fraction ≥ 50%, no clinical congestive heart failure Appropriate written consent adult or parent/guardian if patient is &lt; 18 years of age and minor information sheet if patient is &gt; 8 years of age</criteria>
