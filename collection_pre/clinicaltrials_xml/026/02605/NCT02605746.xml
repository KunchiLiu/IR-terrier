	<brief_summary>This is two parallel studies to examine pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and pharmacogenetic (PG) endpoints following short-interval therapy (10-14) daily doses without dose reduction and interruption) with the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) small-molecule inhibitor, ceritinib. The Phase 0 study will investigate: 1. first recurrence GBM patients and 2. patients with CNS metastases from solid tumors such as, but not limited to, NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) and melanoma. The CNS (central nervous system) metastases Phase 0 is designed to identify PK effects (in addition to PD, and PG effects on ALK-positive NSCLC metastases), while the GBM Phase 0 is designed to identify PK, PD, and PG effects in all patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Ceritinib (LDK378) in Glioblastoma Multiforme and CNS Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being done to learn about a new drug, Ceritinib (LKD378). The results of the study may reveal how the drug works for cancer that spreads to the brain (metastases) and for a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma (GBM). Subjects are persons scheduled to have surgery to remove the tumor.This study would test how much of the new drug is present in the tumor, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after taking the drug orally for 10-14 days before surgery. It is only given to patients who are already scheduled to have surgery to remove a tumor that has returned. If the drug seems to be working for a subject's tumor, subject will have the option to continue to receive it as part of a continuation study looking at the drug effect on preventing the tumor from recurring. Small samples of blood, tumor tissue, and CSF will be taken. These samples will be sent to and analyzed at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) and to the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen). Subject involvement will be for 10-14 days before surgery and for 30 days following surgery. Patients with ALK+ solid tumors will be provided the option of continuing therapy until tumor progression. ALK positivity will be assessed by approved FISH test (Abbott Molecular Inc) using Vysis break apart probes (defined as 15% or more positive tumor cells), the Ventana IHC (immunohistochemistry) test, and/or NGS (next generation sequencing).</detailed_description>
