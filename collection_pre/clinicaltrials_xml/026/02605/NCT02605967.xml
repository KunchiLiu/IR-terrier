	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized controlled Phase II study is to assess the efficacy of PDR001 versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in patients with advanced NPC. By blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, PDR001 leads to the activation of a T cell mediated antitumor immune response</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically documented nonkeratinizing locally advanced recurrent or metastatic NPC. Must be resistant to platinumbased chemotherapy (defined as progression on or after platinumbased chemotherapy given in the recurrent/metastatic setting). May have received at least 1 prior therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease, up to 2 prior systemic therapies. An archival tumor specimen or newly obtained tumor sample may be submitted at screening/baseline (a fresh tumor sample is preferred), unless agreed differently between Novartis and the Investigator. At least 1 measurable lesion (as per RECIST v1.1) progressing or new since last antitumor therapy. Prior treated brain or meningeal metastases must be without MRI evidence of progression for at least 8 weeks and off systemic steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to screening/baseline. Patient must be willing to undergo testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if not tested within the past 6 months. If HIV+ positive, patient will be eligible if: his/ her CD4+ count ≥ 300/μL; his/her viral load is undetectable; he/she is currently receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other mAbs Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except vitiligo or resolved asthma/atopy that is treated with bronchodilators. Active HBV or HCV infections requiring therapy. Prior PD1 or PDL1directed therapy or any therapeutic cancer vaccine. Patients receiving systemic treatment with any immunosuppressive medication. Use of any vaccines against infectious diseases (e.g. varicella, pneumococcus) within 4 weeks of initiation of study treatment. Other protocoldefine inclusion/exclusion may apply.</criteria>
