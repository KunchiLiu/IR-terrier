	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-sequence, two-periods crossover study, separated by 7 days washout interval from the first Study Drug Administration. This study is conducted to determine the bioequivalence of Rabeprazole from IDIAZOLE 20mg Delayed-Release (DR) tablets (tabs) and PARIET 20 mg DR tabs after a single oral dose administration of each to healthy adults fed under conditions. In Period 1, subjects will be randomized to either Idiazole 20mg DR tabs or PARIET 20 mg DR tabs. Following a washout of at least 7 days, subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 to receive the treatment that they did not receive in Period 1. PARIET is a registered trademark of EISAI Co. Limited.</brief_summary>
