	<detailed_description>Single center, prospective, open clinical study to determine the genomic imprint (epigenetic modification) in a series of male infertility patients with alterations in their spermiogram (oligozoospermia) compared to a group of fertile patients in order to evaluate the effect of FSH ( follicle stimulating hormone) administration on these modifications and on male infertility. Main objective: To determine the genomic imprint (epigenetic modification) in a series of male infertility patients with alterations in their spermiogram (oligozoospermia) compared to a group of fertile patients in order to evaluate the effect of FSH administration on these modifications and on male infertility. Secondary objectives - To assess the main characteristics of the spermiograms of infertility patients before and after FSH treatment. - To assess modifications in the hormones involved in sperm formation in infertility patients before and after treatment. - To analyze the results of assisted reproduction treatments in patients receiving FSH treatment.</detailed_description>
