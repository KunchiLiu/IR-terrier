	<brief_title>Midkine and ACE-Ang II Induced Endothelial Injury in Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study showed that Ang II induced endothelial injury in sepsis patients. Midkine has been shown to regulate the renin-angiotensin system and acts in the upstream signaling pathway of angiotensin (ANG) II. The investigators want to access the relationship between midkine level and ACE-Ang II induced endothelial injury in sepsis</detailed_description>
