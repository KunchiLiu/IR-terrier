	<brief_summary>To assess persistence of Inflectra in patients with Rheumatoid Disease (Rheumatoid arthritis [RA], ankylosing spondylitis [AS], and psoriatic arthritis [PsA]) who are naive to biologics or are switching over from stable Remicade to Inflectra. The main objectives of the study are: - To evaluate real-life drug persistence in RA, AS, and PsA patients who are either initiated with Inflectra™ as their first biologic, or who are switched from stable Remicade™ - To characterise the patient populations and drug usage patterns of RA, AS, and PsA patients who are either initiated with Inflectra™ as their first biologic, or who are switched from stable Remicade™ - To assess the safety of Inflectra™ in RA, AS, and PsA patients who are either initiated with Inflectra™ as their first biologic, or who are switched from stable Remicade for up to 2 years</brief_summary>
