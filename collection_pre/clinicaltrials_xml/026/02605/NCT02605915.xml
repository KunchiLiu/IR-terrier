	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib, open-label, two-stage study with two active regimens in each stage designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination treatment with atezolizumab, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (with and without docetaxel) or atezolizumab and trastuzumab emtansine in participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and locally advanced early breast cancer (EBC), and atezolizumab with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in HER2-negative breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Atezolizumab in Combination With Trastuzumab Emtansine or With Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab (With and Without Docetaxel) in Participants With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer and Atezolizumab With Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide in HER2-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
