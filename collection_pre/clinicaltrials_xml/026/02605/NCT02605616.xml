	<brief_summary>Does the novel drug decrease liver fat in subjects with NASH or NAFLD as compared to placebo</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of a Novel Drug in People With Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) or Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to combine voxel matched magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) liver (pre vs. post) to evaluate hepatic fat and hepatic fibrosis. We will also establish glucose tolerance status by our established labeled oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (6,6 ²H2 glucose). Following baseline evaluation subjects with biopsy/MRE proven NASH will be randomized to one of two groups and treated either with active drug (AZ compound) or placebo for 12 weeks (plus or minus 1 week). Subjects with history suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or NASH will be invited to participate. If they meet criteria following initial screening they will be included in the study. OGTT, liver MRS, MRE will be repeated. Liver enzymes [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] as well as other safety tests [creatine phosphokinase (CPK), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), international normalized ratio (INR),total bilirubin] will be measured before, monthly during therapy and at one month following therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age: 2175 Body Mass Index (BMI) 1940 kg/m^2 Subjects with biopsy/MRE proven NASH [MRS liver fat ≥ 5%, with elevated liver enzymes ALT &lt;5x upper limit normal (ULN)]. Subjects with NAFLD and MRE shows F2 or greater fibrosis Subjects with history suggestive of NAFLD/NASH Total bilirubin must be &lt; 1.5 x ULN and INR must be &lt; 1.3 at baseline screening. TSH and CPK will be within normal limits (WNL) at screening. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who are on stable doses of medications (except pioglitazone) to control hyperglycemia and have baseline HbA1c of 10% or lower. Hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 12.0 in males and 11.0 in females. Medications that may affect glucose metabolism such as corticosteroids, opiates, barbiturates, and anticoagulants. Subjects with anemia, and symptoms suggestive of undiagnosed illness, overt hepatic disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholism or increased alcohol consumption over the ADA guidelines. Any disorder that may potentially impact the outcome measures. Pregnant women and children. Subjects planning weight loss or in any weight loss program. Subjects taking TZD's, Atazanavir, Indinavir, Ketoconazole, Valproic acid, Silybum marianum and Valeriana officinalis.</criteria>
