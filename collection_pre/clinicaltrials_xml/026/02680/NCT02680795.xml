	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized study to determine the PK profiles of belinostat in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors or hematological malignancies who have heterozygous and homozygous UGT1A1*28 genotypes and wild-type UGT1A1 gene. Enrolled patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts (A, B, or C) based on their UGT1A1 genotype</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized study to determine the PK profiles of belinostat in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors or hematological malignancies who have heterozygous and homozygous UGT1A1*28 genotypes and wild-type UGT1A1 gene. Enrolled patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts (A, B, or C) based on their UGT1A1 genotype Enrollment into all cohorts will occur simultaneously rather than sequentially. Belinostat will be administered via a 30-minute infusion once daily from Day 1 to Day 5 of one 21-day cycle. Clinical safety will be monitored in each patient. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected from Day 1 to Day 3, and urine samples for PK analysis will be collected from Day 1 to Day 4.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient is diagnosed with advanced solid tumors or advanced hematological malignancy that is relapsed/refractory, for which no standard salvage therapy exists. 2. Patient must have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy for the current malignancy and has recovered from any toxicity of the prior therapy at screening. 3. Patient has adequate hematological and hepatic functions. 1. Patient is taking UGT1A1 inhibitors (eg, atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir, ketoconazole, sorafenib) at screening. 2. Patient has HBV or HCV 3. Patient has a known HIV positive diagnosis. 4. Patient has congestive heart failure Class III/IV 5. Patient has had previous exposure to belinostat.</criteria>
