	<detailed_description>Using modern technology, the investigators will observe participants taking their TB tablets three times per week using a mobile phone, iPod or computer with camera facilities in the participants home environment. Investigators will connect to the participants mobile phone, iPod or computer at a mutually convenient time three times per week who will observe participants taking their TB medication. The Virtual Observed Therapy will be carried out using NHS Lothian approved software (mobile app called POLYCOM) three times per week. This is software similar to Skype but POLYCOM is the approved software we use in NHS Lothian.</detailed_description>
