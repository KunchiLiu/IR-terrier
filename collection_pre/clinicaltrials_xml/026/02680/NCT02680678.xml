	<brief_title>The Effect of the Timing of Colloid and Crystalloid Infusions on Postspinal Hypotension After Spinal Anesthesia for Caesarian Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To Prevent hypotension fluid replacement is usually used in pregnant patients scheduled for C/S. Different types of fluids can be used in order to achieve this. Also the timing of fluid replacement is important. In the present study patients were separated into 4 groups. Each receiving a one of two fluids in different times. ( Colloid pre-load, colloid co-load, crystalloid co-load and crystalloid pre-load.) The effect of overall hemodynamics and the incidence of hypotension are evaluated. Also peripheric monitors like perfusion index and plethysmographic variability index are evaluated for correlation.</detailed_description>
