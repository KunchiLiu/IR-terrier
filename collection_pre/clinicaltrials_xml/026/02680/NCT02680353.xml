	<brief_title>The Perioperative Analgesic Efficiency of Bilateral Superficial Cervical Plexus Block in Patients With Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bilateral superficial cervical plexus block has successfully been demonstrated to provide an efficient analgesia in patients with thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, carotis end-arterectomy. The present study is aimed to investigate the intraoperative hemodynamic responses, anesthetic and analgesic consumption, and postoperative recovery quality of bilateral superficial cervical plexus block in patients with total thyroidectomy. After approval, patients enrolled in the study is invited to complete the Pain Catastrophizing Scale questionnaire. Patients are divided into two groups by computer-based randomization technique as control and study group. After standard monitorization, anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation, bilateral superficial cervical plexus block is performed to study group and no intervention to control group. At the end of the operation all patients received paracetamol 1 gr intravenous. In postoperative period, visual analog scale values, opioid consumption, presence of nausea-vomiting, anti-emetic usage or any other complications are recorded.</detailed_description>
