	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of, adherence to, and early efficacy of Band Together, a strength-training and walking program (intervention arm) vs. education on the benefits of exercise (control arm) in patients with aggressive gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies (gastric, gastroesophageal, and pancreatic cancer) undergoing neoadjuvant therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resilience and Exercise in Advanced Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A growing body of evidence suggests host resilience (lack of frailty, skeletal muscle reserve, etc.) may impact early healing, recovery following neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, and long-term cancer-free survival. It is well-recognized that resilience is enhanced in individuals with proper diet, sleep habits, and exercise. However, it is unknown whether such resilience can be enhanced by training programs initiated at the time of cancer diagnosis. Although exercise interventions may contribute to these improvements, it is unknown how willing and able these patients are to comply with an exercise regimen during the neoadjuvant therapy period. The aim of this study, therefore, is to evaluate compliance with and the efficacy of Band Together, an exercise program combining strength-training and aerobic exercise, in patients with aggressive GI malignancies undergoing neoadjuvant therapy.</detailed_description>
