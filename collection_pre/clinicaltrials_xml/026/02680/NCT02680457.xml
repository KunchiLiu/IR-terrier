	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by wide fluctuations of glucose. The long-acting insulin has showed to improve glycemic variability however the behavior of insulin glargine versus insulin degludec is unknown.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Insulin Degludec Versus Insulin Glargine on Glycemic Variability in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial, crossover, double dommy, randomized, parallel group was carried out. The sample size was calculated using the formula for clinical trials of mean differences with an "n" of 6 patients per group was obtained. Patients between 30 and 65 years of age will be included with T2DM, without hiperglycemic drugs, A1C 6.5 to 11.0 % and with written signature consent. They were assigned randomly by sealed envelope either to received insulin Degludec or insulinGlargine (10 IU SC every 24 hours for six days), patients who were administered initially insulin Degludec corresponded then insulin Glargine and vice versa, with a washout period of 14 days between each intervention. The clinical findings and laboratory tests included a metabolic profile and biosafety, which will be made at baseline. Body weight, body fat, body mass index and blood pressure were performed during the initial visit, likewise, interstitial glucose concentrations by ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring system (Guardian®, Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge), through which the mean amplitude of glucose excursions [MAGE] and area under the curve of glucose were calculated, which served to assess the glycemic variability. Adverse events and adherence to treatment were documented. Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon, Chi2, Fisher exact test. It is considered with significance at p &lt;0.05.</detailed_description>
