	<brief_summary>Injections of local anesthetics (freezing) and steroids are often performed around injured nerves in individuals with nerve injury-related pain. The current standard of medical care is to inject a combination of local anesthetics and steroids around injured nerves, but there is no proof that this is better than injecting only local anesthetic, or even just sterile salt water. There is evidence to believe that injection of local anesthetic (without the steroid) can calm the injured nerve, and provide pain relief from a few days up to a few months. Injection of sterile salt water also has the potential to provide pain relief by breaking scar tissue around the nerve, thereby relieving compression. The aim of this study is to compare pain relief and possible adverse effects from these three different treatments for foot and ankle nerve pain relief. All 30 participants will be recruited over 9 months from the Altum Health clinic at Toronto Western Hospital. 10 participants will be randomly assigned to each treatment. Each patient will receive 3 injections over 3 weeks or so. Participants will have an in-clinic follow-up at 1 month after the last injection, and a phone follow-up 3 months after the last injection. This is a small-scale study, and information obtained from this study will help in planning and conduct of a larger study with more participants. The larger study will help determine the best possible option for injection in patients with nerve-related injury pain.</brief_summary>
