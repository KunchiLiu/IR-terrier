	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the addition of collagen scaffold loaded with autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells(ABMNC) to Foley catheter balloon after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis in the treatment of severe asherman syndrome. Half of participants will receive collagen/ABMNC scaffold after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis, while the other half will receive Foley catheter balloon.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Severe Asherman Syndrome by Collagen Scaffold Loaded With Autologous Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe asherman syndrome will lead to infertility, and the most common method to treat asherman syndrome is operating to dissect adhesions. In order to prevent the postoperative re-adhesion, many physical isolation measures have been tried. However, they don't improve the microenvironment of endometrial regeneration. It's reported that bone marrow mononuclear cells have good effects on the functional recovery of injured uterus. This study will determine whether collagen scaffolds loaded with autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells will be more effective than Foley balloon catheters at treating infertile women with severe intrauterine adhesions who have taken hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. In addition, the study will be carried out in 2 centers, one is the Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, the other is Changzhou Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital that is in Jiangsu Province.</detailed_description>
