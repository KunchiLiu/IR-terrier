	<brief_summary>Men with oligometastatic prostate cancer lesions will be randomized (1:2) to observation versus SBRT. The study will NOT be blinded. Within three weeks of the initial treatment planning, SBRT (1-5 fractions) will be administered.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation for Prostate Oligometastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research is being done to determine if we can improve the outcome of prostate cancer patients who have failed primary treatment - surgery or local radiation to the prostate - and have 3 or fewer bone metastases. Patients with metastatic prostate cancer disease will usually be placed on hormonal therapy which can work well for a period of time, but hormonal therapy can have side effects that greatly trouble men. Any effort to delay the start of hormonal therapy would be an advantage to the patient. Radiation treatment usually takes many weeks to deliver and is not given in a high enough doses to metastases to prevent them from coming back locally. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is highly focused radiation, given in a very dose intensive fashion and delivered in usually less than one week. Stereotactic body radiation has been shown to be very effective on bone metastases. Therefore, we are studying the effects of stereotactic body radiation treatment on patients with five or fewer prostate cancer bone metastases to determine if we can stall the use of hormonal therapy and/or prevent other bone metastases from developing elsewhere in the body. We will also use an investigational radioactive drug called 18F-DCFPyL can help us find cancer that has spread (metastatic disease) from its original site in people who have cancer in their prostate to other parts of their body.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must have at least one and up to three asypmtomatic metastatic tumor(s) of the bone or soft tissue develop within the past 6months that are ≤ 5.0 cm or &lt;250 cm3 Patient must have had their primary tumor treated with surgery and/or radiation. 5.1.4 Histologic confirmation of malignancy (primary or metastatic tumor). PSADT &lt;15 months. PSA doubling time (PSADT) will be calculated using as many PSA values that are available from time of relapse (PSA &gt; 0.2). To calculate PSADT, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Prostate Cancer Prediction Tool will be used. It can be found at the following web site: https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/psadoublingtime. PSA &gt;1 but &lt;50. Testosterone &gt; 125 ng/dL. Patient must have a life expectancy ≥ 12 months. Patient must have an ECOG performance status ≤ 2. Patient must have normal organ and marrow function as defined as: Leukocytes &gt;2,000/μL Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt;1,000/μL Platelets &gt;50,000/μL Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patient may not have had any prior systemic therapy allowed aside from ADT associated with treatment of their primary prostate cancer or with salvage radiation therapy and for not more than 6 months with the most recent ADT treatment having occurred greater than 6 months prior to enrollment. Castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Suspected pulmonary and/or liver metastases (greater &gt;10 mm in largest axis). Patient receiving any other investigational agents. Patient is participating in a concurrent treatment protocol. Total bilirubin &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal. Liver Transaminases &gt; 5times the upper limit of normal. Unable to lie flat during or tolerate PET/MRI, PET/CT or SBRT. Liver Transaminases &gt; 5times the upper limit of normal. Prior salvage treatment to the primary prostate cancer or pelvis is allowed. = Refusal to sign informed consent.</criteria>
