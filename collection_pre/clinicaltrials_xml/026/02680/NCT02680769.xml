	<brief_summary>Magnesium (Mg) is involved in several pathways that could be affected in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPDs), namely in the contractility and excitability of neuro-muscolar endothelial cells and low-grade inflammation, a typical state of COPD. In this sense, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed a positive role of Mg in asthma since long-period oral supplementation of Mg leads to a clinical and spirometric improvement. Subjects with COPD seem to have a reduced bioavailability of Mg probably due to the use of drugs that may increase Mg losses (e.g. beta-agonists and cortisones), to a reduced dietary Mg intake, and heavy smoking. A recent study showed that the administration of endovenous or aerosol Mg sulphate with beta-agonists acutely improve maximum expiratory flow during COPD relapses as well as the prolonged treatment with endovenous sulphate Mg led to a reduction in pulmonary hyperinflation and increase in muscles involved in respiration, with a consequent clinical and instrumental improvement. These evidences suggest that a chronic supplementation with Mg could improve COPD in clinical and instrumental parameters, but, at the best of our knowledge, no study was available in this sense.</brief_summary>
