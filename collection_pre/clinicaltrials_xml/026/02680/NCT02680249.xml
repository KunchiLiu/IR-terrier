	<brief_title>Food Effect Study of CTP-656 in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess in healthy male subjects a solid oral dose formulation of CTP-656 under fasted and fed conditions. Primary: • To characterize the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile of a single 150 mg solid oral dose of CTP-656 in healthy volunteers under fasted, fed low-fat and fed moderate-fat conditions. Secondary: - To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of metabolites of CTP-656 following a single 150 mg solid oral dose of CTP-656 in healthy volunteers under fasted, fed low-fat and fed moderate-fat conditions. - To assess the safety and tolerability following a single 150 mg solid oral dose of CTP-656 in healthy volunteers under fasted, fed low-fat and fed moderate-fat conditions.</detailed_description>
