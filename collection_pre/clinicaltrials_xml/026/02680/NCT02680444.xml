	<brief_summary>Brief and cost-effective interventions teaching emotion regulation techniques can be feasibly applied to promote mental health in University students. The tools of mindfulness (i.e., objective awareness and acceptance) and positive reappraisal (i.e., positive re-evaluation of negative events) can mutually benefit one another to promote well-being. The current study explored the effects of a randomly-assigned Mindful-Reappraisal intervention (n=36) compared to Reappraisal-Only (n=34) and an active control (n=36) on university students' daily affect over five days. Time by condition interactions were analyzed with planned contrasts and multilevel growth modelling.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The University student lifestyle can lead to heightened stress, anxiety, and burnout. To promote mental health, brief and cost-effective interventions teaching beneficial emotion regulation techniques can not only counteract the negative but also foster positive functioning. The tools of mindfulness (i.e., objective awareness and acceptance) and positive reappraisal (i.e., positive re-evaluation of negative events) can mutually benefit one another to promote well-being. However, there is currently little research testing the viability of brief, self-administered interventions combining training of mindfulness and positive reappraisal. The current study explored the effects of a randomly-assigned Mindful-Reappraisal intervention (n=36) compared to Reappraisal-Only (n=34) and an active control (n=36) on university students' daily affect over five days. Time by condition interactions were analyzed with planned contrasts and multilevel growth modelling.</detailed_description>
