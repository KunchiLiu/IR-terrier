	<brief_title>Evaluation of Amnion Chorion Membrane and Demineralized Freeze-dried Bone Allograft in Periodontal Intrabony Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty patients suffering from advanced chronic periodontitis were included in this randomized controlled clinical trial. Each subject contributed had two- or three-walled intrabony defects. Patients were randomly assigned into four groups; bioresorbable membrane or; bone allograft or combined allograft and membrane or open flap debridement. Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.</detailed_description>
