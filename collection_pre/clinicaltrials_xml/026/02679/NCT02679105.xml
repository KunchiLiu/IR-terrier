Severe atopic dermatitis. Patients with significant diseases other than allergic rhinitis. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study. Patients with a respiratory tract infection in the past 4 weeks prior to Visit 2.
