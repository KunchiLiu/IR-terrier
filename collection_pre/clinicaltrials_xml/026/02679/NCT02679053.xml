	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise as add-on Treatment for Inpatients With Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). The IG will train three times per week on indoor bicycles at 60 to 75% of maximal heartrate aiming at a weekly total of 17.5kcal/kg bodyweight for 6 consecutive weeks. The exercise will take place under supervision. CG will absolve a basic stretching and mobilisation program 3 times per week, also under supervision for 6 consecutive weeks. At the end of every week physical fitness is evaluated by the queens step test. No other activities with moderate or high intensity are allowed throughout the intervention time. All patients will participate in the multimodal treatment program of the depression ward, which includes pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and specialized therapies such as art therapy and ergotherapy.</detailed_description>
