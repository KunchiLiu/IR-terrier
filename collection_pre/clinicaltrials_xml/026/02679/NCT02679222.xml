	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the ketogenic effect of coconut oil and three MCT oils (60-40 , tricaprylin and triheptanoate) on the production of ketones in healthy adults. Each oil are evaluated individually or in combination over a 8h-period during which repeated blood sampling is performed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is composed of eight successive visits. Each visit consists of the consumption of one individual oil or a mixture of oils (20 g of coconut oil or 10 g of coconut oil + 10 g of MCT 60-40 or 20 g MCT 60-40 or 10 g coconut oil + 10 g tricaprylin or 20 g tricaprylin or 10 g coconut oil + 10 g triheptanoate or 20 g triheptanoate) and a 8h follow-up during which repeated blood samples are taken for laboratory analysis (plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, glucose, free fatty acids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, lactate and insulin).</detailed_description>
