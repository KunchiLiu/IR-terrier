	<brief_summary>Honey is a natural product that contains multiple nutrients; it is composed of fructose, glucose and fructooligosaccharides that can potentially serve prebiotic functions. It also contains more than 180 substances including amino acids, vitamins, minerals and enzymes. Investigators hypothesized that supplementation of enteral feeds with honey would produce a bifidogenic effect and stimulate the immune response in preterm infants. Investigators randomly assigned subjects to 4 groups receiving 0, 5, 10 and 15 grams of honey daily for 2 weeks and measured their effect on stool colonization, systemic immune parameters and anthropometric measurements.</brief_summary>
