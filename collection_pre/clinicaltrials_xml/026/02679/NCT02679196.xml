	<brief_summary>Multiple ascending dose study to evaluate safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics effects of KA2237 (PI3 Kinase p110β/δ Inhibitor) in patients with B Cell Lymphoma and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Part I of the study. In Part II, patients with B cell lymphoma will be treated with KA2237 at the MTD to evaluate safety and efficacy in the patient population.</brief_summary>
