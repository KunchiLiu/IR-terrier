	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to use an investigational type of technology called Closed-Loop Control (CLC) Medical Platform System to help control blood sugar in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus in a home setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Project Nightlight: Efficacy and System Acceptance of Dinner/Night vs. 24hr Closed Loop Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CLC will be deployed with different functionalities at different stages of the trial, resulting in variation in what the subject will be responsible for and what the system will drive.These functionalities occur in a randomized cross-over design, each occurring for 8 weeks. These modalities are: 1. SAP=sensor-augmented pump only 2. USS+SAP (d)= SAP during day and CLC starting at dinner and continuing overnight 3. USS+CLC (d)= 24-hour Day and Night Closed Loop Control The closed loop control system's newer version, the inControl Diabetes Management Platform, will be tested in a 48-hour Pilot study at the onset of the trial. This AP system remains a smartphone-based, artificial pancreas platform that automatically controls insulin delivery.</detailed_description>
