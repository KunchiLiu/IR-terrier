	<brief_summary>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two treatment, parallel group study to investigate the effects of RG7625, a cathepsin S inhibitor, on the immune response to a gluten challenge in volunteers with celiac disease. Volunteers with previously diagnosed celiac disease will be randomized to receive either 100 milligrams (mg) RG7625 or placebo twice daily with food for 28 days (Days 1 to 28).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Volunteers with a biopsy confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) serotype DQ 2.5 and HLADQ 8 haplotypes Maintaining a glutenfree diet for at least one year. Compliance will be assessed by serology, compatible responses to a selfreported assessment of glutenfree diet adherence and the absence of typical celiac disease symptoms Able to participate and to comply with the study restrictions including the requirements of the gluten challenge A diagnosis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity A personal history of food intolerance other than to gluten, or diagnosis of galactosemia, lactose, galactose or fructose intolerance A personal history of severe acute symptomatic reaction to sporadic gluten ingestion A diagnosis of refractory celiac disease or presence of severe complications of celiac disease Diagnosed or suspected immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency Acute inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), gastrointestinal obstruction or subocclusive syndromes, digestive perforation or risk of digestive perforation, painful abdominal syndromes of undetermined cause A history of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection. Appendectomy and hernia repair are acceptable Any confirmed significant allergic reactions (urticaria or anaphylaxis) against any drug, or multiple allergies (nonactive hay fever is acceptable) Immunocompromised or with reduced immune function considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator Immunization within 30 days before the screening visit or planning vaccination during the study Women who are pregnant or lactating, or who are of childbearing potential and do not agree to comply with requirements for contraceptive use. Men who do not agree to comply with requirements for contraceptive use and restrictions on sperm donation Participation in an investigational drug or device study within the three months preceding the screening visit</criteria>
