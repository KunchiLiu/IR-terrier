	<brief_summary>This study will compare near clinical oculomotor parameters (heterophoria, vergence ranges, AC/A and accommodative findings) measured when lenses and/or prisms are introduced using three different instruments namely: (i) a standard manual phoropter, (ii) an electronic phoropter and (iii) a wearable adaptive refractor (VisionFit).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Lens Presentation on the Clinical Oculomotor Assessment at Near</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have demonstrated differences in a number of near oculomotor parameters [e.g., heterophoria, accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC/A) ratio] when measured in a manual phoropter versus a trial frame. These differences may be due to variations in proximal vergence, differences in head and eye position and restriction of the peripheral visual field. Further, a number of standard clinical oculomotor procedures require the use of Risley rotary prisms. While prism is typically introduced in a smooth, ramp-like fashion with manual phoropters, step changes in prism are created with electronic phoropters. The precise effect of these variations on clinical measurements is unclear. Accordingly, after a routine refractive examination, a standard clinical near assessment (comprising near heterophoria, AC/A ratio, horizontal vergence ranges, amplitude of accommodation and negative and positive relative accommodation) will be carried out on the same individuals through: (i) a standard manual phoropter (American Optical model 11625), (ii) an electronic phoropter (Topcon CV-5000) and (iii) a wearable adaptive refractor (VisionFit). The latter resembles a trial frame mounted on a helmet carrier (similar to a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope headset) but includes adaptive lenses that can be changed electronically.</detailed_description>
