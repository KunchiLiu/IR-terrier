	<brief_summary>The typical clinical progression of COPD usually results in a decreased level of tolerable physical exertion for the patient. The avoidance of strenuous physical activity leads to a deteriorating level of physical fitness, which further decreases the patient's ability to undertake physical activities. Recent research has shown that whole body vibration has the potential to improve physical fitness of participants, including such measures as the 6 minute walking distance. However, information concerning lung function is lacking. The goal of the study is to test whether the use of whole body vibration training has an effect on the lung function of patients with stable COPD, or if the previously observed effects can be attributed to either pharmaceutical therapy or physical therapy interventions.</brief_summary>
