	<brief_summary>The SAVER pilot is a randomized, open-label pilot study to determine the feasibility of recruitment. In addition to feasibility data, the investigators will carefully collect clinical data to determine if rosuvastatin can reduce post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients. Eligible consenting patients who developed acute, symptomatic, and objectively confirmed proximal leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or PE will be randomized and equally allocated to 2 trial arms, either the treatment group (rosuvastatin tablet (20 mg/day) or the control group (usual care). The pilot trial consists of up to 4 study contacts over 6 months: screening, randomization, telephone follow-up (90 days), and final study visit (180 days).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN: The SAVER pilot is a randomized, open-label pilot study to determine the feasibility of recruitment (main threat to successful completion of the full SAVER RCT). In addition to feasibility data, the investigators will carefully collect clinical data to determine if rosuvastatin can reduce PTS in VTE patients. Eligible consenting patients who developed acute, symptomatic, and objectively confirmed proximal leg DVT and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) will be randomized and equally allocated to 1 of 2 trial arms, either the treatment group or the control group. The pilot trial consists of up to 4 study contacts over 6 months: screening, randomization, telephone follow-up (90 days), and final study visit (180 days). DOSE/ROUTE/REGIMEN: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the treatment or control group. Treatment Group: The treatment arm will receive a 20 mg tablet of rosuvastatin to be taken orally once daily starting at the time of randomization until the completion of follow-up at 6 months. Control Group: Those in the control arm will be followed in the same manner but will not receive study medication. MEASURES AND EVALUATION Screening Visit: Research coordinators at each pilot site will screen patients for eligibility and will maintain detailed logs of all excluded and enrolled patients. After providing informed consent, eligibility will be confirmed by the following tests: a lipid profile, A1C test and transaminase (ALT) level analysis.All eligibility will be reviewed by an investigator. Randomization Visit: Randomization will be conducted using an Interactive Web based Randomization System. Medication Diaries will be dispensed to participants in the treatment arm at baseline along with their study medication, At the final study visit, the study coordinator will review the medication diary and compare to pill count as an indicator of compliance. Adverse Events: AEs will be elicited, monitored and recorded throughout the study. The investigator will report serious adverse events (SAEs) to the SAVER Trial Office in Ottawa, Canada within 24 h of awareness.</detailed_description>
