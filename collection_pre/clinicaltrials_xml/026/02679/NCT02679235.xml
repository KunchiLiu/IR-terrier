	<brief_summary>BEAT7-001 is a randomised, open label, two parallel group study (supplementation versus control). Using a multi-modal brain imaging portfolio, this study will assess whether brain energy metabolism (glucose and ketones), structure or functional connectivity change in older people with frontal glucose hypometabolism after 28 days on an oral dose of 1 g/kg/day of triheptanoin.</brief_summary>
