	<brief_summary>Cardiac rehabilitation patients often fail to exercise as prescribed on days they are not attending rehabilitation and there is a steep drop off in exercise following rehabilitation completion. Moreover, little is known about the amount of time that cardiac rehabilitation patients spend in sedentary behavior, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, independent of time spent in exercise. This pilot study aims to test acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone application (B-MOBILE-CARDIAC) for increasing time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity accumulated in bouts of at least 10 minutes in duration (i.e. bout-related MVPA) and decrease time spent in sedentary behavior. Up to 32 patients will be recruited, enrolled, and randomized during the first 2 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation to either: 1) B-MOBILE-CARDIAC plus cardiac rehabilitation or 2) cardiac rehabilitation alone. Participants will complete 7 days of objective activity monitoring to measure daily minutes spent in bout-related MVPA and sedentary behavior (primary outcomes) at baseline, mid-rehabilitation (6 weeks), end of cardiac rehabilitation (12 weeks), and 4-week follow-up (16 weeks). At these same time points, participants will complete questionnaires assessing sedentary behavior, MVPA, exercise tolerance, health-related quality of life, mood, and affect. At baseline and end of cardiac rehabilitation participants will undergo a blood draw to measure cardiometabolic and inflammatory risk factors and complete a test of cognitive functioning. Feasibility and acceptability of the B-MOBILE-CARDIAC application will be assessed at the 4-week follow-up.</brief_summary>
