Presence of lobar, multilobar, or patchy parenchymal infiltrate(s) consistent with acute bacterial pneumonia on a pulmonary imaging study within 48 hours before the first dose of study drug 4. PORT risk class of II to V 5. Must be a suitable candidate for possible IV to oral switch antibiotic therapy and must also be able to swallow large tablets/capsules intact without crushing 1. A medical history of significant hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to antibiotics of the quinolone or oxazolidinone class or study drug excipients according to the investigator 2. Any infection expected to require other systemic antibiotics in addition to study drug 3. Receipt of systemic antibiotic therapy in the 7 days before enrollment one dose of a single, potentially effective, shortacting antibacterial drug or drug regimen for CABP within 24 hours before enrollment is allowed limited to 25% of enrolled patients At least 48 hours of antibiotic therapy for CABP and the clinic notes document treatment failure (i.e., not by patient history or pulmonary imaging alone) with new or worsening symptoms while on prestudy therapy is also allowed 4.

Current or suspected diagnosis of viral, fungal, or aspiration pneumonia, noninfectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, empyema (not including sterile parapneumonic effusions) 6. Known anatomical or pathological obstruction or history of bronchiectasis or GOLD Stage 4 COPD or history of post obstructive pneumonia 7. Severely compromised immune system 8. Other exclusions include those described in the safety label for drugs in the quinolone and /or oxazolidinone classes such as QT prolongation, proarrhythmic conditions, concomitant use of drugs known to cause QT prolongation, peripheral neuropathy, tendon disorders, history of myasthenia gravis, liver disease, severe renal disease, seizures and concomitant use of MAO A or B inhibitor agents and adrenergic serotonergic agents</criteria>
