	<brief_summary>It is known that teriflunomide, a treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, can be found in low concentrations in semen. Because the drug has been associated with teratogenicity in laboratory animals, the question is raised as to whether the drug can be detected in female partners of sexually active males who are taking the drug to treat their multiple sclerosis.</brief_summary>
