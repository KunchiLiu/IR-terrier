	<brief_summary>Dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) is a common surgical procedure in the U.S. Adequate pre-operative preparation of the uterine cervix is an important part of preventing complications of the procedure. Traditionally, the uterine cervix is prepared for the procedure using water-attracting dilators, which are placed via a speculum exam and cause discomfort for many women. The objective of this study is to investigate the comparative effectiveness of mifepristone (an oral tablet) versus dilators for cervical preparation for D&amp;E.</brief_summary>
