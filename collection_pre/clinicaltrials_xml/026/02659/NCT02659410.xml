	<brief_summary>In Quebec, thousands of workers are concomitantly exposed to heat and chemical compounds. Exposure to heat induces physiological responses that help maintaining a stable body temperature. Those changes can affect organ functions implicated in absorption and metabolism. According to literature, those changes could lead to increased concentrations of chemical compounds in the body and their toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the pulmonary absorption and toxicokinetics of 3 organic solvents in heat stress conditions in volunteers exposed in a inhalation chamber. Results will then be used to develop PBPK models that will allow to predict organic solvent kinetics when coexposed with heat.</brief_summary>
