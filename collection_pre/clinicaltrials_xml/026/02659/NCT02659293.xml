	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3 randomized trial of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone versus lenalidomide alone after stem-cell transplant for multiple myeloma, eligible to subjects who completed autologous stem cell transplant for symptomatic myeloma who are considered for lenalidomide maintenance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone Versus Lenalidomide Alone After Stem-cell Transplant for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: - To compare progression free survival between Kyprolis (Carfilzomib), Revlimid (lenalidomide), Dexamethasone (KRd) arm and lenalidomide arm Secondary Objectives - To determine the rate of minimal residual negative disease (MRD) at 6 and 12 months after randomization - To compare the efficacy (rate of partial response, very good partial response, complete response, and stringent complete response) of KRd vs. Lenalidomide alone after randomization</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients who completed single autologous stem cell transplant after completion of at most 2 induction regimens (excluding dexamethasone alone) and are in at least stable disease in the first 100 days after stem cell transplantation. 2. Patients must be within 12 months of initiation of induction therapy and must have had not more than 2 prior induction regimens. 3. Bone marrow specimen will be required at study entry; available DNA sample will be used for calibration step for MRD evaluation by gene sequencing. 4. Males and females ≥ 18 years of age 5. ECOG performance status of 01 6. Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN and aspirate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 x ULN 7. ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L, hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL, platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L. 8. Calculated creatinine clearance (by CockcroftGault) ≥ 50 ml/min or serum creatinine below 2 mg/dL 9. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have 2 negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to initiating lenalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 1014 days before and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours before lenalidomide is prescribed for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days). 10. FCBP must agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 2) while participating in the study; and 3) for at least 28 days after discontinuation from the study. UCM IRB CRd vs. R Version 1.0 Page 11 11. Male subjects must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 12. All study participants in the US must be consented to and registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMS®. 13.
