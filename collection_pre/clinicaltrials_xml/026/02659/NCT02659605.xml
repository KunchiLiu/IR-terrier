	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if delayed cord clamping above the perineum has an effect on neonatal hematocrit when compared to delayed cord clamping below the perineum in pre-term spontaneous vaginal deliveries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cord Clamping Level Above or Below Mother's Perineum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will compare the difference in neonatal hematocrit with delayed cord clamping above vs. below the perineum, in infants who are born via pre-term spontaneous vaginal deliveries that are vigorous at delivery. Delayed cord clamping below the perineum is an accepted clinical practice in obstetrics and gynecology; however, delayed cord clamping above the perineum has not yet been studied in preterm infants. Delayed cord clamping above the perineum will provide the benefit of immediate skin-to-skin contact between the mother and her newborn. Patients will have delayed cord clamping performed for 60-75 seconds either below the maternal perineum or while the infant is placed on the mother's abdomen. At approximately 24 hours after delivery (at the time of infant heel stick for routine, state-mandated screening tests), a small additional amount of blood will be collected to evaluate newborn hematocrit.</detailed_description>
