	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter pilot Phase 1 study of the checkpoint antibodies ipilimumab and nivolumab in combination with radiotherapy in 18 subjects with unresectable stage IV melanoma. All subjects will receive concurrent ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg) every 2 weeks. Radiotherapy will be initiated after the first dose and before the second dose of immunotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologic diagnosis of stage IV metastatic melanoma, with 1 melanoma lesion that can be safely irradiated in the opinion of the radiation oncologist (note: subjects with primary ocular and mucosal melanoma are permitted). Lesions may include, but are not limited to: Symptomatic lymphadenopathy Bothersome cutaneous disease Hepatic metastases Pulmonary metastases 2. Excluding the lesion intended to undergo radiation, subjects must have at least 1 unresectable, nonbony lesion that is measurable radiographically (based on RECIST 1.1). 3. Any number of prior therapies (including none). For subjects who have received prior systemic treatment with cytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA4), Programmed death 1 (PD1) and/or Programmed deathligand 1 (PDL1) therapy, the last monoclonal antibody administration should be no less than 6 weeks prior to start of this protocol therapy and all prior side effects must have resolved to grade 1 or less by the time of the start of this protocol therapy. 4. Subjects must have completed chemotherapy, targeted therapy, investigational therapy, other immunotherapy, prior radiotherapy, or major surgery (requiring general anesthesia) at least 28 days before administration of the first dose of study drug(s). Subjects undergoing minor surgical procedures and biopsies that do not require general anesthesia may begin receiving study therapy if sufficiently recovered as determined by the treating investigator. Clinically significant toxicity experienced during any prior therapy must be resolved or stabilized before the first dose of study drug(s). 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01. 6. Life expectancy ≥ 4 months. 7. Screening laboratory parameters: White blood cell count ≥ 2000/μL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/μL Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 3 × upper limit of normal Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × (&lt; 3 mg/dL for subjects with Gilbert's disease) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal or creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min (if using the CockcroftGault formula below): Female Creatinine Clearance = [(140 age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85] / [72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL] Male Creatinine Clearance = [(140 age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00] / [72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL] 8. Age ≥ 18 years. 9. Able and willing to give valid written informed consent. 1. Any contraindications for ipilimumab (Yervoy®) or nivolumab (Opdivo®) as per the package inserts. 2. Unresolved immunerelated adverse events following prior biological therapy. Subjects with asymptomatic endocrinopathy may enroll. 3. Active autoimmune disease or any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily of prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. 4. History of motor neuropathy considered to be of autoimmune origin (e.g., GuillainBarre Syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis). 5. Other active, concurrent malignancy that requires ongoing systemic treatment or interferes with radiographic assessment of melanoma response as determined by the investigator. 6. Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for 4 weeks or more after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration. 7. Known immunodeficiency or HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C positivity. Antibody to Hepatitis B or C without evidence of active infection may be allowed. 8. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or any components of the study drugs. 9. Other serious illnesses (e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders). 10. Requirement of radiotherapy to treat brain metastases or receipt of any nonstudy systemic therapy for cancer or any other experimental/investigational treatment. 11. Mental impairment that may compromise the ability to give informed consent and comply with the requirements of the study. 12. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical assessments or poststudy followup contact to determine relapse and survival. 13. Women who are breastfeeding or who are pregnant as evidenced by a positive serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) performed within 14 days of the first dose of study drug and by a urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours of the first dose of study drug(s). 14. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use 2 methods of effective contraception. 15. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, is likely to prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may put the subject at unacceptable risk.</criteria>
