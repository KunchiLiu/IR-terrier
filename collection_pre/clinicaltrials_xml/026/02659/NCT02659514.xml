	<brief_title>Study of Poziotinib in Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of poziotinib in approximately 70 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have received at least 2 prior HER2-directed treatment regimens. Each treatment cycle will be 21 days in duration. During each 21-day cycle, patients who are eligible for participation will receive poziotinib orally once daily for 14 days, followed by 7 treatment-free rest days. All treated patients will be followed up until disease progression, death, intolerable adverse events or up to a maximum of 24 months whichever comes earlier.</detailed_description>
