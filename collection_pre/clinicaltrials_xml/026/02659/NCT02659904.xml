	<brief_summary>Our primary objective in this clinical intervention study, therefore, was to explored the effect of residual tissue thickness on the palatal mucosa healing from baseline to 1, 3 and 6 months after free gingival graft harvesting in order to determine as soon as possible to re-harvest gingival graft from same site.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Quantitative Changes in Palatal Donor Sites Thickness After Free Gingival Graft Harvesting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty individuals (19 males and 21 females; age range: 18-35 years) were enrolled in the study. Based on the remaining tissue at donor site after free gingival graft harvesting, individuals were divided into two groups: 1.0-1.9 millimeter (mm) remaining tissue at donor site after harvesting (n = 20), 2-2.9 mm remaining tissue at donor site after harvesting. Tissue filling in defect area from three points (mesial, central and distal) was measured at various time-points (baseline, post-operative 1, 3, 6 months).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All individuals received oral hygiene instructions and fullmouth scaling was performed. They were instructed to perform a nontraumatic brushing technique (Roll) using an ultrasoft toothbrush Individuals were reevaluated at 8 weeks after initial therapy, and only full mounth plaque score and full mounth bleeding score &lt;15% were enrolled to the surgical procedure mucogingival defects which for soft tissue graft application were indicated For Less than 2 mm group, between 2.5 and 3.4 mm palatal thickness at each measurement points before graft harvesting For 2 mm or more group, between 3.5 and 4.4 mm palatal thickness at each measurement points before graft harvesting. periapical or palatal pathologies, absence teeth from canine to first molar, excessive forces including mechanical forces from orthodontics and occlusion, systemic diseases that would contraindicate for periodontal surgery or interfere with tissue healing, chronic highdose steroid therapy, radiation or immunosuppressive therapy, pregnancy, lactation, smoking, or allergy or sensitivity to any drug Study participants had no history of drug therapy known to interfere with healing and to cause gingival enlargement Individuals who had complication such as bleeding, necrosis and delay healing during or after surgery were excluded from the study.</criteria>
