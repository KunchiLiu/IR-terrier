	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Clinical Response of Subretinal Administration of CNTO 2476 in Participants With Geographic Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study which includes an initial unmasked safety phase, followed by a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), masked treatment efficacy phase for participants who have Geographic Atrophy. The study consists of 2 Phases: Open label safety Run-in Phase followed by double-masked randomized treatment Phase. The duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 5 years. Efficacy will be evaluated at 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to agerelated macular degeneration (AMD) confirmed within 45 days prior to initial randomization verified by the central reading center Study eyes will have a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/80 to 20/800 [Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) log of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) value 0.61.6]. The treatment eye will be that with the worse BCVA at Screening. If BCVA is clinically equivalent, the eye with the larger GA determines the study eye Participant is a suitable candidate for ophthalmologic surgery, is willing and able to comply with the surgical procedure, scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests and other study procedures. Participant has met criteria of the surgery center anticoagulation protocol, if applicable Each participant must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the study Participant has a history of neovascular ("wet") AMD in the treatment eye, including evidence of retinal pigment epithelium rips or evidence of subretinal or choroidal neovascularization or fluid. In cases where imaging is inconclusive, review of the case with the study site, considering history and imaging will determine eligibility. History or evidence of neovascular AMD in the fellow eye is allowed, if antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has not been required for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening Geographic atrophy secondary to any causes other than AMD in either eye A diagnosis of glaucoma with an intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 25 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) while being treated with an ocular hypotensive drug. Treatment should be no more than 1 drug preparation/combination, which can contain 1 or 2 ocular hypotensive active ingredients; participants receiving more than 2 ocular hypotensive active ingredients are excluded Nuclear sclerotic cataract, cortical spoking, posterior subcapsular cataract above Grade 2 per Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) scale or any other ophthalmologic condition that reduces the clarity of the media that, in the opinion of the investigator or reading center, interferes with ophthalmologic examination (example, corneal abnormalities, inadequate pupillary dilation), surgery or imaging in the study eye Myopia greater than minus (&gt;) 8 diopters and participants with greater than (&gt;) 4 diopters of astigmatism, and greater than plus (&gt;+) 10 diopters of hyperopia</criteria>
