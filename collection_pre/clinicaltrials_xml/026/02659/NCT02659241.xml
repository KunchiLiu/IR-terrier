	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if certain characteristics of DNA (the genetic material in cells) affects how ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinomas respond to therapy with AZD1775. Researchers also want to learn if treatment with AZD1775 affects the DNA in cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Induction Wee1 Inhibition in Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: A study cycle is 28 days. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin taking AZD1775 on the day of your laparoscopy. You will first take AZD1775 tablets 2 times each day on Days 1-3. Depending on when your tumor reduction surgery is scheduled, you may continue taking the study drug on Days 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24. The study doctor will discuss this with you. Before every time you take AZD1775 tablets, you will take ondansetron (Zofran). Before your first dose of AZD1775 each week, you will take dexamethasone. You may also receive dexamethasone before additional doses of AZD1775. Ondansetron and dexamethasone are standard drugs given to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Your daily doses of AZD1775 should be taken about 12 hours apart, about 2 hours before or after eating. If you vomit after taking your dose of AZD1775, you should not retake the dose. Wait until your next scheduled dose. Your first dose of AZD1775 on Day 1 should be taken at least 1 hour after your laparoscopy. The second dose of that day may be skipped if the first dose cannot be taken until after 12 PM. You will need to record when you take each dose in a study drug diary. The study staff will give you the study drug diary and show you how to fill it out. You will stop taking AZD1775 tablets about 1-4 days before your tumor reduction surgery. After you have recovered from surgery (about 3-6 weeks later), you will receive standard chemotherapy treatment. The chemotherapy is part of your standard of care treatment and is not part of this research study. The type of chemotherapy you receive will be up to your doctor. Study Visits: On the day of your laparoscopy: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Tumor tissue will be collected during your laparoscopy procedure for biomarker and genetic testing. All samples will be stored at the MD Anderson Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Bank for an unlimited amount of time for testing related to this study. Your samples will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked to your samples. Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code numbers and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the samples to be updated as needed. While you are taking the AZD1775, you will have weekly visits. At each visit: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing. If you do not have tumor reduction surgery, you will stop having study visits after your last dose of AZD1775 and continue on to the follow-up part of the study (described below). If you do go on to have tumor reduction surgery, you will have the below study visits. You will be asked to sign a separate consent document for your tumor reduction surgery that will explain the procedure and its risks. On the day of your pre-operative visit: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, genetic, and biomarker testing. - You will have an EKG. On the day of your surgery: - Tumor tissue will be collected for genetic and biomarker testing during your already scheduled tumor reduction surgery. All samples will be stored at the MD Anderson Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Bank for an unlimited amount of time for testing related to this study. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On the day of your post-operative visit: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG. Length of Treatment: You may take the study drug up to 24 days (including the rest days in between your doses). You will no longer be able to take the study drug if intolerable side effects occur, you are not eligible for treatment or surgery, or you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on this study will be over after follow-up. Follow-Up: Within 30 days after your surgery: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, genetic, and biomarker testing. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG. Standard Follow-Up: You will continue to have follow-up visits every 3 months as part of your standard care. This is an investigational study. AZD1775 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with presumed advancedstage high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma, based on the presence of carcinomatosis, and/or elevated CA125, and/or ovarian mass(es), or at the discretion of the treating physician. 2. Medically able to undergo primary cytoreductive surgery, at least 14 days and up to 28 days after starting study drug, as determined by treating physician. 3. No prior therapy for highgrade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. 4. Patients must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medications and not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of AZD1775 (e.g. uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome; ulcerative disease). Note: Patient may not have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or be receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 5. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function (measured within 7 days prior to the initiation of therapy) as defined below: a. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,500/mcL; b. Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9gm/dL; c. Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mcL; d. Total Bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5X ULN; e.

Women of childbearing potential (WoCBP) may be included only if acceptable contraception is in place for two weeks before study entry, for the duration of the study and for 90 days after the last dose of AZD1775. WoCBP are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause). Acceptable methods of contraception include true abstinence in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle choice of the patient, tubal ligation, vasectomised partner, barrier methods (eg, cap plus spermicide, sponge plus spermicide, diaphragm plus spermicide, or male condom plus a spermicide), intrauterine device methods (eg, Copper T or Levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine system), or hormonal methods (eg, any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an oestrogen and/or a progestational agent 8. (Continued from previous criterion) and that is administered via the oral, subcutaneous, transdermal, intrauterine, or intramuscular route as an implant, hormone shot or injection, combined pill, minipill or patch. All methods of contraception (with the exception of total abstinence) should be used in combination with the use of a condom by their male sexual partner for intercourse. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. All WoCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 3 days prior to study the initiation of therapy.. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 9.
