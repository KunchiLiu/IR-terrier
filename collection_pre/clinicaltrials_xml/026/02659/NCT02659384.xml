Histological diagnosis by image guided biopsy, laparoscopy or laparotomy. Tumors diagnosed on cytology only and borderline tumors are excluded. At least one lesion accessible to biopsy without putting patient at risk WHO PS: 02 for patients having received no more than two previous lines of therapy. WHO PS: 01 for patients having received &gt;2 previous lines of therapy Prior chemotherapy or bevacizumab: Any number of platinumbased chemotherapy lines are allowed but a maximum of 2 previous nonplatinum containing lines Prior treatment with bevacizumab or other targeted agents against Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptor is allowed, but at least 18 weeks must have elapsed since their last administration Eligible patients with ≤ 2 previous treatment lines must have been previously exposed to bevacizumab or other targeted agents against VEGF or VEGF receptor Patients may have had prior therapy providing the following conditions are met: Radiation therapy: washout period of 14 days prior to the first study treatment; exception: single fraction radiotherapy with the indication of pain control Systemic antitumor therapy: washout period of 21 days prior to the first study treatment Recovery from any toxic effects of prior therapy to ≤ Grade 1 per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v4.03) except fatigue or alopecia. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt;18 years Life expectancy of &lt; 12 weeks No adequate hematologic and end organ function Use of acetylsalicylic acid, NSAIDs or other COX2 inhibitors that cannot be stopped at baseline and for the whole duration of the study.</criteria>
