	<brief_title>HyaloFAST Trial for Repair of Articular Cartilage in the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Prospective, randomized, active treatment-controlled, evaluator-blinded (radiologist reviewer and physician evaluator) multicenter study (up to 40 sites in the US and EU). - All subjects that meet preoperative screening eligibility criteria will be randomized to treatment with Hyalofast® with BMAC or Microfracture. - Hyalofast® is a sterile, biodegradable non-woven pad (2 x 2 cm or 5 x 5 cm) that is composed of HYAFF-11®, a benzyl ester of hyaluronic acid. Hyalofast® acts as a biodegradable support for the autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrate. Hyalofast® is soft and conformable and can easily be cut to fit the lesion size. - Autologous bone marrow is harvested from the subject intraoperatively during the Index Procedure. Approximately 60 mL of bone marrow will be aspirated from the subject's iliac crest using the SmartPrep 2 Bone Marrow Processing Pack. The cellular rich portion will be concentrated via the SmartPrep BMAC 2 Centrifuge System at point-of-care to provide 7 mL of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC). 1 - 2 mLs will be used for post-procedure testing of total nucleated cells, cell viability, and sterility. - Hyalofast® with BMAC is implanted during either a standard knee arthroscopy or min-arthrotomy depending upon surgeon preferences and intra-operative findings. The lesion to be treated will be debrided to a stable cartilage margin. The defect will be sized and Hyalofast® will be cut to fit the lesion area. If necessary, more than one Hyalofast® pad can be overlapped to cover the lesion. 2 mL of BMAC will be loaded per Hyalofast® scaffold and then implanted to cover the defect. Hyalofast® with BMAC readily adheres to the site of application, but, if necessary, can be secured to the defect margins with an FDA-approved fibrin glue. - All subjects will be assessed at intervals post-procedure (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months). - Subjects will be required to follow a strict pre-specified post-surgery rehabilitation protocol specific to the defect location. - Measures to assess effectiveness will be conducted at follow-ups, with the primary effectiveness endpoint assessment done at the 24 month timepoint. - Evaluators doing efficacy assessments of the subject and administering subject-reported outcome instruments will be blinded to the treatment. - Safety will be assessed by the collection of adverse events at all timepoints. - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be conducted at Screening, 1 month, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months. Evaluation of the MRIs, including the MOCART score, will be done by blinded radiologist reviewers. The one month MRI will be used as the baseline MRI for evaluation of treatment effectiveness.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient is male or female, between 18 and 60 years of age 2. Patient's body mass index (BMI) is &lt;35 kg/m2 3. Patient has a symptomatic lesion of the femoral condyle (medial and/or lateral) or femoral trochlea that is between 16 cm2 on screening images confirmed by the independent radiologist 4. The symptomatic lesion is classified as International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade 3 or 4 5. Patient agrees to actively participate in a strict rehabilitation protocol and followup program 6. Patient is using only nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or acetaminophen/paracetamol during the month before signing the informed consent form to treat knee pain 7. Patient is willing and able to provide informed consent and comply with study requirements 8. Patient, if woman of childbearing potential, must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening, cannot be lactating and is willing to use adequate contraception for the first 12 months of the study after the last surgery 9. Patient has ability to consistently rate knee pain and function as demonstrated by completion of total KOOS score 10. Patient has a minimum of 45 out of 100 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for index knee pain when remembering index knee pain when not on medication and when active 11. Patient is willing to use other pain medication rather than Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) for 6 months postsurgery (e.g. acetaminophen, or narcotic analgesics, if prescribed). Postsurgical use of aspirin for clot prevention is acceptable. 12. Patient is willing to restrict pain medication after 6 months postsurgery to NSAIDs or acetaminophen/paracetamol only through the end of the trial 13. Patient must have Hematocrit ≥ 28.0%; White Blood Cell count ≤ 14,000; Platelet Count ≥ 50,000; Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL; and International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.6 1.

(Lesions such as minor loose bodies, small debris fragments, small cartilage fragments or prominent knee fat pad are allowed. These lesions may be treated with debridement). 2. Presence of a kissing bipolar lesion that is apposed to the index lesion and is deeper than Grade 2 (ICRS classification) as determined by MRI. (Presence of a kissing (bipolar) lesion that is apposed to the index lesion and is deeper than Grade 2 and is discovered under arthroscopy are allowed). The nonindex lesion, if indicated for treatment, should be treated with the study assigned treatment of the index lesion. 3.
