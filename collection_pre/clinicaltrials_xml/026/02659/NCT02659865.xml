	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of the study drug known as LY3039478 and evaluate two different formulations of LY3039478 in healthy participants. Part A has three periods. Either LY3039478 or placebo will be given once by mouth in each period. Part B has two periods. Participants will receive both formulations of LY3039478, by mouth, over the course of the study. Both parts of the study will also explore how much LY3039478 gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. Information about any side effects will also be collected. Participants may only enroll in one part. The study will last at least 33 days, not including screening. Screening must be performed up to 30 days before enrollment.
