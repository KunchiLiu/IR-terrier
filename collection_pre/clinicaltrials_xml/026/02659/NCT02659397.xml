	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to measure the amount of atorvastatin and ETC-1002 in the blood, to determine how ETC-1002 affects the level of LDL-cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and other markers of health and disease in blood and urine, and to see how ETC-1002 is tolerated in the body compared to placebo when added to stable atorvastatin 80 mg background therapy in statin-treated patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Taking daily stable statin doses for at least 4 weeks prior to screening visit. LDLC between 100220 mg/dL for patients taking daily highintensity statin (for 4 weeks prior to switching to sponsor provided atorvastatin 80 mg/day and stopping all other lipidregulating drugs and supplements) at the screening visit; or, LDLC between 115220 mg/dL for patients taking moderate or lowintensity statin (for 4 weeks prior to switching to sponsor provided atorvastatin 80 mg/day and stopping all other lipidregulating drugs and supplements) at the screening visit. Must be willing to discontinue other lipidregulating therapies during the study History of acute significant cardiovascular disease. Current clinically significant cardiovascular disease. History of inability to tolerate any statin at any dose due to musclerelated pain or weakness.</criteria>
