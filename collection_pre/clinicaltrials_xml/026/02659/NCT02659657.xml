	<detailed_description>The effects of haploidentical rhG-CSF-mobilized unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation (HBMT) on hematological malignancies are well established.The aim of this prospective cohort trial is to determine if acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) could be decreased with IL2 therapy post HBMT.low dose of IL-2 (40 million U/m2) will be administered from WBC engraftment to day 90 post haploidentical transplantation. IL-2 will be administered three times a week.</detailed_description>
