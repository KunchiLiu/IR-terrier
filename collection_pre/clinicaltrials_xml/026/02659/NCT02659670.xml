	<brief_summary>An investigator-blinded, prospective, 6 month study of subjects with persistent erythema associated with active rosacea will be conducted in 20 subjects aged 18 years and older. All subjects will receive standard-of-care brimonidine topical gel, 0.33% with instructions to apply it once daily per package insert. Adherence will be assessed using weekly internet surveys to document how often the medication is being used, as well as reminders about rosacea triggers and general use of brimonidine. Subjects with persistent erythema associated with rosacea will be recruited from the Wake Forest Baptist Health Dermatology Clinics and IRB approved advertising. At the baseline screening visit, subjects will have the diagnosis of rosacea confirmed by an investigator. Subjects will be classified as having erythematotelangiectatic or a combination erythematotelangiectatic and papulopustular. Study staff will evaluate whether subjects believe they have constant erythema or more intermittent flushing and blushing. Subjects will be informed of the benefits and risks of treatment. If they agree to participate, the subjects will give written consent approved by the Institutional Review Board and will be seen in follow up at 3 months and 6 months. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to be in the weekly internet survey group or the standard care non-survey group. The internet survey will ask them how often they have used their medication that week, as well as giving them treatment tips and reminders about rosacea triggers. Subjects will be asked a variety of questions during the weekly internet survey; such as the amount of erythema they currently have (measured by VAS scale), how much burning and stinging they have, how often they have used the medication and where did they apply the medication, as well as any additional side effects they may be having from the medication. Subjects in the non-internet survey group will just get these identical surveys at the Month 3 and Month 6 visits. The Investigator is also interested in learning through the adherence surveys if subjects begin using the medication on an as needed basis, and if this affects the side effect profile and satisfaction with the medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internet Surveys and Their Impact on Adherence to Brimonidine Topical Gel and QOL in Patients With Rosacea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To assess adherence to topical brimonidine for the treatment of rosacea. Secondary Objectives: To determine the impact of reported adherence on rosacea outcomes, To identify factors that affect adherence to rosacea treatment and to assess QOL. Study Design An investigator-blinded, prospective, 6 month study of subjects with persistent erythema associated with active rosacea will be conducted in 20 subjects aged 18 years and older. All subjects will receive standard-of-care brimonidine topical gel 0.33% with instructions to apply it once daily per package insert. Adherence will be assessed using weekly internet surveys to document how often the medication is being used, as well as reminders about rosacea triggers and general use of brimonidine. Before starting treatment, subjects will be reminded that brimonidine is indicated for persistent, not transient, erythema. Subjects will be given a copy of the product package insert and a copy of the American Academy of Dermatology website (www.aad.org) information on rosacea that contains standardized information about the diagnosis and triggers. Subjects with persistent erythema due to rosacea will be recruited from the Wake Forest Baptist Health Dermatology Clinic and IRB approved advertising. At the baseline screening visit, subjects will have the diagnosis of rosacea confirmed by an investigator. Subjects will be classified as having erythematotelangiectatic or a combination erythematotelangiectatic and papulopustular. The Investigator will evaluate whether subjects believe they have constant erythema or more intermittent flushing and blushing. Subjects will be informed of the benefits and risks of treatment as indicated in the package insert. If they agree to participate, the subjects will give written consent approved by the Institutional Review Board and will be seen in follow up at 3 months and 6 months. Subjects will be randomized (according to standard randomization tables)1:1 to be in the weekly internet survey group or the standard care non-survey group. The internet survey will ask them how often they have used their medication that week, as well as giving them treatment tips and reminders about rosacea triggers. They will be asked a variety of questions during the weekly internet survey- such as the amount of erythema they currently have (measured by VAS scale), how much burning and stinging they have, how often they have used the medication and where did they apply it, as well as any additional side effects they may be having from the medication. Subjects in the non-internet survey group will just get these identical surveys at the Month 3 and Month 6 visits. The Investigator is also interested in learning through the adherence surveys if subjects begin using the medication on an as needed basis, and if this affects the side effect profile and satisfaction with the medication. At each visit, review of the internet survey use and medication weights will be done. Disease severity measures (CEA, PSA, lesion counts) will be obtained. Investigator and subject VAS scales to measure facial erythema will be obtained. Adverse events will be logged at every visit. Attention will be paid to any symptoms of rebound erythema and more detailed information concerning location and timing will be collected. The lesion counts will also measure any papules or telangiectasia that may become more readily visible with the improvement in background erythema. Telangiectasia will be counted individually by facial quadrant as noted in the Lesion Count Appendix. Measuring individual visible telangiectasia is important as subjects may confuse these with underlying erythema of rosacea, thus affecting subject assessment of their disease. QOL surveys will be completed at the end of study visit. Descriptive statistics will be generated with mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) or median (interquartile range) for continuous measures depending on the distribution of the data and frequency distribution for categorical variables. Estimate for adherence rates will be obtained as the mean adherence rate along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.</detailed_description>
