	<brief_summary>The long-term goal is to identify and establish effective mind-body interventions (as an aspect of complementary and alternative medicine) to improve health and Quality of Life (QoL) for people with disabilities. Preliminary data suggest that engagement in yoga is feasible and beneficial for multiple study populations, and it may relieve symptoms of neuropathy. The central hypothesis is that individuals who complete yoga will have significantly better balance, mobility, and QoL after 8 weeks of yoga.</brief_summary>
