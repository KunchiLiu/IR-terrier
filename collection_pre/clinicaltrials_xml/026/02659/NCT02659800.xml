	<brief_summary>This pilot, partially randomized clinical trial studies how well glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 works in increasing low cluster of differentiation (CD)4 counts after concurrent radiation and temozolomide treatment in patients with gliomas that tend to grow rapidly and spread (high-grade). Treatment with radiation and chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, may cause an abnormal decrease in CD4 cells, which are an important part of the immune system. Glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 may increase CD4 cell counts and improve survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IL-7 in Increasing Low CD4 Counts After Concurrent Radiation and Temozolomide Treatment in Patients With High Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To test the effect of CYT107 (glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7) on CD4 counts compared to control. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the optimal dose of CYT107. II. To evaluate the effect of concurrent dexamethasone. III. To evaluate the duration of effect on CD4 counts (up to 6 months). IV. To evaluate the total lymphocyte counts over time and serial lymphocyte subtypes (up to 6 months). V. To evaluate the serial cytokines levels (up to 6 months). VI. To evaluate the impact of adjuvant temozolomide on CYT107 effects on CD4 counts. VII. To evaluate anti-drug antibodies. VIII. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of CYT107 in patients with high grade glioma. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore overall survival in patients. II. Tumor infiltrative lymphocytes could be studied in patients undergoing resection of recurrent or progressive tumor. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups depending on their use of dexamethasone. GROUP A (NON-DEXAMETHASONE): Patients not on dexamethasone or on a dose lower than a physiologic dose (=&lt; 0.75 mg daily) are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM A1: Patients receive placebo intramuscularly (IM) once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM A2: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 at 10 ug/kg IM once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM A3: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 at 20 ug/kg IM once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP B (DEXAMETHASONE): Patients requiring dexamethasone at more than a physiologic dose (&gt; 0.75 mg daily) are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM B1: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 as in Arm A2. ARM B2: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 as in Arm A3. In all arms, patients receive adjuvant temozolomide on days 1-5 as per standard treatment beginning 2 weeks post-glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 treatment. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
