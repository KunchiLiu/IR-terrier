	<brief_title>Mortality in Cancer Patients Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in a Resource-limited Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management of cancer patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) has changed dramatically during the last two decades. Initial experiences showed high rates of hospital mortality, reaching up to 75-85% in patients requiring life-sustaining treatments, particularly mechanical ventilation. An increasing number of clinical experiences has been reported pointing to a significant improvement in survival of these patients. However, it is not clear if this results are generalizable to settings with resource constraints. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine 30 day mortality in cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit in a resource limited setting. This study is a prospective cohort of cancer patients admitted to the ICU in which the investigators will evaluate the prognostic of cancer patients admitted for a ICU trial or treatment in ICU without limitations. This study will not consider any change in the treatment plan of the patients. The source of the data will be the clinical records of the patients during the admission and the records of the cancer unit. There will be no direct contact of the research team with the patients or their family.</detailed_description>
