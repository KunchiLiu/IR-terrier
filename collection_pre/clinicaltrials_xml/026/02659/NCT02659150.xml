	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that anti-IL-6 therapy is effective for reducing plaque inflammation as measured by fluorine-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dMARD) inadequate responders and are naive to biologic therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Subcutaneous ACTEMRA on Inflamed Atherosclerotic Plaques in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center study will recruit 21 subjects to undergo an open-label tocilizumab treatment for 13-18 weeks in order to examine the efficacy of tocilizumab on plaque inflammation in RA patients. This multi-center study will employ PET/MR imaging of the carotid and coronary arteries and aorta to assess the effect of anti-IL-6 therapy on arterial inflammation in patients with RA who are synthetic dMARD inadequate responders and are naive to biologic therapy. Secondary, exploratory evaluation will also examine correlations between atherosclerotic plaque inflammation and the inflammatory activity of the rheumatoid joint measured by PET-MR imaging, as well as how the changes in inflammation correlate with lipid and inflammatory biomarkers, and how stress levels are associated with inflammatory activity. Adults between 50 and 75 years old diagnosed with RA will come in for an initial screening visit to assess for clinical eligibility criteria (visit 1). During the screening period, patient acceptability for the study will be assessed on the basis of medical history, concomitant medications, physical examination, and clinical laboratory test results. The study doctor will review the screening test results and procedures to determine the subject eligibility prior to imaging. Women able to become pregnant will be excluded due to teratogenic side effects. A FDG-PET/MR imaging study will be performed at a second screening visit (visit 2) to assess for the presence of arterial, plaque and joint inflammation. A serum pregnancy test will be drawn and confirmed to be negative prior to imaging for female subjects of childbearing potential. Acceptability for study participants will be confirmed on the basis of a tissue-to-background ratio (TBR) of greater than or equal to 1.7 in qualifying vessel (calculated using the mean of the maximum SUV) as measured from FDG-PET/MR imaging. Participants who meet clinical and imaging eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study (visit 3). Subjects will receive first dose of tocilizumab subcutaneously, on subsequent weeks, subjects will be instructed to self-administer tocilizumab at a dose of 162mg every week for a 12 week period. 4 weeks post-initiation, participants will return for a clinical safety follow-up (visit 4). Final evaluation will include physical exams, clinical assessments and carotid IMT test. A second FDG-PET/MR imaging session will take place 12 weeks post-administration (visit 5). Effect of tocilizumab on arterial plaque inflammation will be examined by measuring the change in FDG uptake in the carotid arteries, coronary arteries and aorta between the baseline and 12 week FDG-PET/MRI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults aged 5075 Diagnosis of RA according to the revised 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR; formerly American Rheumatism Association), criteria. Patients who have had an inadequate response to nonbiologic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and are naïve to biologic agents. Presence of plaque inflammation, identified during secondary screening, defined as a target to baseline (TBR ratio) ≥ 1.7 in the carotid artery or ascending aorta. Not wheelchair or bedbound. At screening, active RA consisting of ≥4 swollen joints (28 joint count) and ≥ 4 tender joints (28 joint count) and any one of the following criteria: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (Westergren) ≥ upper limit normal CRP ≥ upper limit normal If using other nonbiologic DMARDS, (ex: methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, leflunomide), patient must demonstrate inadequate response, be on stable dose(s) for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline visit. For methotrexate: patients must be on methotrexate for at least 3 months with 4 weeks stable dose, and will stay on stable dose during the study. taking corticosteroids, must be on stable doses of oral corticosteroids (≤ 10mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit. Dose should remain stable throughout the study. Any investigational treatment not mentioned elsewhere must be discontinued for 4 weeks or 5 half lives, whichever is longer, prior to the baseline visit. Exposure to any investigational biologics should be discussed with the Sponsor. Signed informed consent (and informed assent of minor, if applicable). Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control during treatment and for twelve months after completion of treatment. Subject has provided written informed consent Major surgery (including joint surgery) within 8 weeks prior to screening or planned major surgery within 6 months following randomization. Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks (or 5 halflives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer) of screening.
