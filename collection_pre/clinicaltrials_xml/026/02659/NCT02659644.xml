	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease is a genetic red blood cell disorder that can result in blocking of the small blood vessels from sickle shaped red blood cells. This causes pain, the main feature of sickle cell disease. Also, low amounts of nitric oxide can occur in sickle cell disease, a substance important for widening the blood vessel wall and therefore preventing blockage of the small blood vessels. Citrulline is a drug that is known to increase nitric oxide. This is a phase I study of citrulline given by mouth to evaluate the safety, tolerability and appropriate dosing of this medication for individuals with sickle cell disease.</brief_summary>
