	<brief_summary>Background: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cancer most often seen in people with HIV. It causes lesions. These are usually on the skin but sometimes in the lymph nodes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Researchers think a combination of drugs may help treat KS. Objective: To test a combination of the anti-cancer drugs pomalidomide (CC-4047) and liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) in people with KS. Eligibility: People ages 18 and over with KS Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Questionnaires Physical exam Blood, urine, and heart tests Chest X-ray Biopsy: A small sample of tissue is taken from a KS lesion. Possible CT scan Possible exam of lungs or gastrointestinal tract with an endoscope: A flexible instrument examines inside the organ. Participants will take the drugs in 4-week cycles. They will take Doxil through an IV on Day 1 of each cycle. They will take CC-4047 tablets by mouth each day for the first 3 weeks of each cycle. Participants will have many visits: Before starting treatment To start each cycle Day 15 of first 2 cycles Visits include repeats of screening tests and: Multiple blood draws Photographs of lesions Participants will keep a drug diary. Participants will take aspirin or other drugs to prevent blood clots. Participants with HIV will have combination antiretroviral therapy. Some participants will have a PET scan. Participants will continue treatment as long as they tolerate it and their KS improves. After treatment, they will have several follow-up visits for up to 5 years</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide in Combination With Liposomal Doxorubicin in People With Advanced or Refractory Kaposi Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric angioproliferative tumor that most frequently involves skin, but can also involve lymph nodes, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. It is most common in people with HIV or other forms of immune compromise. Patients with AIDS-associated KS have worse survival than HIV-infected patients without KS. - Patients may present with advanced disease KS and/or concurrent KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) or an IL-6 related KSHV-associated cytokine syndrome (KICS). Patients with the latter conditions have poor outcomes when treated with FDA-approved cytotoxic therapies used for KS, and novel approaches are needed. - A Phase I/II Study demonstrated that pomalidomide 5 mg daily on days 1- 21 of a 28 Day Cycle was safe and tolerable in patients with KS with or without HIV. Increased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts and KS regression were observed. - Combination of pomalidomide with liposomal doxorubicin may offer a new approach for patients with advanced KS or KS and concurrent KSHV-associated MCD or KICS Objectives: - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of various dose combinations of pomalidomide and liposomal doxorubicin in two groups of patients: Group I) KS requiring systemic therapy; Group II) KS with concurrent KSHV-associated MCD or KICS - To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pomalidomide in combination with liposomal doxorubicin; and for patients with HIV in combination with antiretroviral therapy Eligibility: - Patients with biopsy proven (confirmed in the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR) Kaposi sarcoma (KS) - Group I: KS requiring systemic therapy (no prior therapy required) - T1 KS, KS on skin sufficiently widespread that it is not amenable to local therapy, or KS affecting quality of life due to local symptoms or psychological distress OR --KS patients with an inadequate response to pomalidomide (either progressive disease or stable disease after 4 months) OR - KS patients with an inadequate response to liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or other systemic chemotherapy (either progressive disease or stable disease after 6 cycles) - Group I will exclude patients eligible for Group II (below). - A wash out period off treatment of 3 weeks will be required, except in the case of patients with progressive, severe disease in which delay of treatment cannot be justified (i.e. symptomatic pulmonary KS) -Group II: KS in one of the following high-risk groups (no prior therapy required): - Concurrent KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) - KSHV Inflammatory Cytokine Syndrome (KICS), including those also meeting clinical criteriafor KS immune reconstitution syndrome (KS IRIS) o Patients with primary effusion lymphoma or a large cell lymphoma arising in KSHV-associated MCD are excluded. - At least five measurable cutaneous KS lesions with no previous local radiation, surgical or intralesional cytotoxic therapy that would prevent response assessment for that lesion; or other evaluable disease. - ECOG Performance Status (PS): Group I: less than or equal to 2, Group II: less than or equal to 3, ECOG PS of 4 (with Karnofsky 20%) will be allowed in Group II only if symptoms due to pulmonary KS. - Measurable disease by the criteria proposed by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Oncology Committee (for KS). - Patient or legal guardian must be willing to give informed consent. - Patients can be HIV positive or negative. - HAART for HIV+ patients. Design: - This is a Phase I study evaluating 2 groups of patients with KS. Patients will receive pomalidomide once a day, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle, at the various dose levels combined with liposomal doxorubicin IV day 1 of a 28-day cycle until optimal tumor response, unacceptable toxicity, or patient request to discontinue - Patients with HIV will be prescribed HAART. - All patients will receive thromboprophylaxis, generally with aspirin 81 mg tablet daily. - This study will also evaluate the characteristics of 18fluoro-thymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with KS and concurrent KSHV-associated MCD or KICS, and correlate with markers of KSHV-lytic activation</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients must have histologically confirmed Kaposi sarcoma (KS) confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI. All patients should have either five measurable cutaneous KS lesions with no previous local radiation, surgical or intralesional cytotoxic therapy that would prevent response assessment for that lesion; or other assessable disease Group I: KS requiring systemic therapy (no prior therapy required) and: Group I patients should have one or more of the following: T1 KS, KS on skin sufficiently widespread that it is not amenable to local therapy, or KS affecting quality of life due to local symptoms or psychological distress KS patients with an inadequate response to pomalidomide (either progressive disease or stable disease requiring additional therapy after 4 months) KS patients with an inadequate response to liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or other systemic chemotherapy (either progressive disease or stable disease requiring additional therapy after 6 cycles) Group I will exclude patients eligible for Group II (below). A wash out period off treatment of 3 weeks will be required, except in the case of patients with progressive, severe disease in which delay of treatment cannot be justified (i.e. symptomatic pulmonary KS) Group II: KS (no prior therapy required): Concurrent KSHVassociated multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) KSHV Inflammatory Cytokine Syndrome (KICS), including those also meeting clinical criteria for KS immune reconstitution syndrome (KS IRIS) At least five measurable cutaneous KS lesions with no previous local radiation, surgical or intralesional cytotoxic therapy that would prevent response assessment for that lesion; or other assessable disease ECOG Performance Status (PS): Group I: less than or equal to 2 Group II: less than or equal to 3 ECOG PS of 4 will be allowed in Group II only if symptoms due to pulmonary KS.

HAART for HIV+ patients: All HIV+ patients must be willing to be compliant with HAART Group Ion HAART for 1 month with stable disease; however, no minimum time restriction for patients with progressive and/or endorgan threatening disease Group IIno minimum time restriction on prior HAART, patients may be HAART naive. Age greater than or equal to18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of pomalidomide in combination with liposomal doxorubicin in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric trials.
