	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of JNJ-63623872 following administration of a single dose as three different concept formulations with that following administration of the current formulation, under both fed and fasted conditions, in healthy adult participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Relative Oral Bioavailability of JNJ-63623872 Administered as Oral Concept Formulations Compared to the Current Tablet Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label, 2-panel, randomized, crossover study in healthy adult participants to assess the relative bioavailability JNJ-63623872. The study population will consist of 48 healthy adult participants, equally divided over 2 panels: 24 participants in Panel 1 and 24 participants in Panel 2. participants will be randomized within each panel. Participants will not be randomized between panels. Panels 1 and 2 will be performed sequentially. Participants having participated in one panel cannot also participate in the other panel. In Panel 1, during 4 subsequent treatment sessions (Periods I, II, III and IV), each participant will receive 4 treatments (Treatments A, B, C, and D), randomized according to a classical 4 sequence, 4 period Williams design. In Panel 2, during 3 subsequent treatment sessions (Periods I, II and III), each participant will receive 3 treatments (Treatments E, F, and G) randomized according to a classical 6 sequence, 3 period Williams design. Primarily, pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
