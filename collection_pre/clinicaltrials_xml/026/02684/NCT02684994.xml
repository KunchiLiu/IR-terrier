	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to examine the effectiveness of a client-directed version of a well-supported psychological therapy, cognitive processing therapy (CPT), for the treatment of psychological effects of traumatic experiences. Participants in this study are expected to be women who have experienced one or more interpersonal violence experiences (i.e. physical or sexual assault). During the first assessment, you will be interviewed by a qualified interviewer. The interview will ask you about your life experiences and reactions, including traumatic experiences and symptoms you might be experiencing. This portion of the study will take approximately 2-3 hours. If your assessment reveals that you are eligible for the study you will begin the treatment portion of the study. If eligible, you will also be given a packet of questionnaires to complete before your first treatment session. If you are not eligible for the study, we will provide you with a list of referrals from which you could seek treatment with other agencies. If you begin the treatment portion of the study, you will participate in a client-directed version of cognitive processing therapy (CPT). CPT is a treatment designed to help you understand the ways your traumatic experience has affected various aspects of your life (feelings, beliefs, behaviors, etc.). The treatment will consist of four main components: education about trauma responses, experiencing emotions related to the assault, development of skills for examining the truth of thoughts, and examination of beliefs in areas commonly influenced by traumatic experiences. During this treatment, you will be exploring the ways in which the assault has affected your beliefs, such as your beliefs about your own safety, trust, and ability to have relationships. In the sessions, you will explore these areas to discover and change the ways your beliefs since the assault have led to feelings of distress, fear, anxiety, and depression. You will be asked to do activities in between sessions each week which will ask you to think and write about your traumatic experiences. The treatment includes 12 sessions, each for one hour. Sessions will be held once or twice a week. The current version of CPT will include all the components of the regular CPT treatment, but may vary in order of sessions. The regular treatment protocol provides sessions in a set order, but the current study will allow you some choices in when you complete certain activities.</detailed_description>
