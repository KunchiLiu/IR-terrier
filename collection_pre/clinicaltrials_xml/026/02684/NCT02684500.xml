	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if the diameter and flow of the superior mesenteric artery in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage undergoing hypertensive therapy for cerebral artery vasospasm are effected enough to justify withholding enteral nutrition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage and Superior Mesenteric Artery Flow Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study measurements of the diameter and Doppler flow velocity of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) using abdominal ultrasound in order to evaluate the potential additional risk of non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) and non occlusive bowel necrosis (NOBN) in patients undergoing hypertensive therapy for cerebral vasospasm in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (aSAH), to justify the withholding of enteral nutrition.</detailed_description>
