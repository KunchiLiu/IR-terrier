	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving donor lymphocyte cells and SGI-110 will help control acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in patients who have had an allogeneic stem cell transplant (using someone else's stem cells) and have relapsed. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SGI-110 With Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Relapsing Post Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (AlloSCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive SGI-110 as an injection under the skin 1 time a day on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle. Day 1 is the first day you will receive the study drug. If the doctor thinks it is needed, your dose of SGI-110 may be changed or stopped during the study. On Day 6 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, you will receive a donor lymphocyte infusion by vein over about 10-30 minutes. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) may occur after the T-cell infusion. GVHD occurs when donor cells attack the cells of the person receiving the stem cell transplant. If GVHD occurs, you will be given standard drugs that may help control GVHD. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. You cannot continue to receive the study drug until the GVHD is controlled. The study doctor will discuss this with you. Study Visits: Within 3 days before the start of each cycle, on Day 3 of each cycle, and then one time during Weeks 2 and 3 of each cycle (if the doctor thinks it is needed), blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your kidney and liver function. Part of this blood sample will be used for a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant. Urine may also be collected for this pregnancy test. You may be able to have these blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic closer to your home. The results of these tests will be sent to the study doctor at MD Anderson for review. Talk with the study doctor about this possibility. On Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6: - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for chimerism studies, which looks to see how much the blood cells mixed between the donor and recipient. This test shows how well the lymphocyte infusion has "taken." - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy, an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle. These tests/procedures may be performed more often, if you doctor thinks it is needed. Length of Treatment: You may receive up to 12 cycles of SGI-110. You may be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if you develop uncontrolled or severe GVHD, or if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest. This is an investigational study. SGI-110 is not FDA approved or commercially available. SGI-110 is made with decitabine, which is FDA approved and commercially available to treat MDS. SGI-110 is currently being used for research purposes only. The use of donor lymphocytes to treat MDS and AML is FDA approved. Up to 50 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of AML and MDS according to WHO classification that underwent first allogeneic HSCT with either peripheral blood or bone marrow as the source of the hematopoietic stem cells. 2. Age 18 to 75 years old. 3. No more than 1 antigen mismatch at HLAA, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 locus for either related or unrelated donor. 4. Relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation defined as one of the following: Morphological relapse: MDS patients: Reappearance of dysplastic changes in the bone marrow, with or without increase in bone marrow blast count, which is pathologically consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome. AML patients: Bone marrow blast count &gt;/= 5%. Persistence or reappearance of minimal residual disease by flow cytometry or cytogenetic or molecular testing. 5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2. 6. Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance greater or equal than 40 cc/min as defined by the CockcroftGault Equation*. Males(mL/min):(140age)*IBW(kg) / 72*(serum creatinine(mg/dl)). Females(mL/min): 0.85*(140age)*IBW(kg) / 72*(serum creatinine(mg/dl)). 7. Serum bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). 8. Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN. 9. Alkaline phosphatase &lt;/= 2.5 x UL. 10. Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of the study, and able to provide valid informed consent. 11. HIV negative and HBsAg negative. 12. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test for women with reproductive potential. 1. Use of any antileukemic agents after relapse is documented (note that the use of these antileukemic agents given as posttransplant maintenance therapy is allowed in this study, e.g., subcutaneous or oral 5Azacytidine or FLT3 inhibitors for maintenance). 2. Bone marrow blast count &gt;60%. 3. Active acute GVHD grade II or higher. 4. Active chronic GVHD that is extensive. 5. Concurrent use of systemic immune suppressive other than calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus. 6. Active uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial or viral infection. 7. Symptomatic or uncontrolled arrhythmias. 8. Significant active cardiac disease within the previous 6 months, including: New York Hear Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure; Unstable angina or angina requiring surgical or medical intervention, and/or; Myocardial infarction.</criteria>
