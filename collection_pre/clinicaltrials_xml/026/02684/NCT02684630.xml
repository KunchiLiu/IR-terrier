	<brief_title>Trima Accel® System Post Count Algorithm Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate Trima Accel System modified postcount algorithm software. Platelets will be collected according to the Trima Accel System Operator's Manual. Collection procedures will include those in which: 1. a single platelet product is collected 2. a double platelet product is collected, with or without other components. Study participation will be up to 8 days. The apheresis procedure can last from 25 to 150 minutes, dependent upon the product(s) to be collected, machine configuration, donor parameters, the quality of the vascular access, and the tolerance of the donor to the citrate anticoagulant. Donors will have one apheresis procedure and follow-up with any serious adverse events for 7 days.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years. Meets Blood Center criteria for blood donation and is scheduled for an apheresis procedure that includes a single or double platelet product. These criteria are based on FDA Regulations and American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) Guidelines. Appears to have adequate venous access to obtain a postprocedure platelet count. Has given written informed consent. Has undergone a splenectomy.</criteria>
