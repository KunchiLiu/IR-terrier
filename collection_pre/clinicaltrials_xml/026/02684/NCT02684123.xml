	<brief_summary>Alopecia areata is a medical condition, in which the hair falls out in patches. The hair can fall out on the scalp or elsewhere on the face and body. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune skin disease, which means that the immune system is recognizing the hair follicles as foreign and attacking them, causing round patches of hair loss. It can progress to total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis) or complete body hair loss (alopecia universalis). The scalp is the most commonly affected area, but the beard or any hair-bearing site can be affected alone or together with the scalp. Alopecia areata occurs in males and females of all ages, and is a highly unpredictable condition that tends to recur. Alopecia areata can cause significant distress to both patients and their families. In this study, the aim to assess the effects of a new treatment called apremilast in patients with alopecia areata. A total of 30 patients will be included in the study, which will run for a total of 52 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Apremilast in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Alopecia Areata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study consisting of two phases. A total of 30 subjects with moderate to severe alopecia areata (including universalis and totalis) involving 50-100% of the scalp will be enrolled. A possible maximum of 15 patients (approximately 7 patients each) with current episodes of AA totalis / universalis may be included in this study. In Phase 1, subjects will be randomized (2:1) to either receive apremilast or placebo for 24 weeks. In Phase 2, eligible subjects will receive apremilast from Week 24 through Week 48. The following subjects will be eligible to enter into Phase 2: 1. Subjects who received placebo in Phase 1 of the study 2. Subjects who received apremilast in Phase 1 of the study, and who achieved a minimum of 50% regrowth (SALT50) at Week 24, compared to Baseline.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females, 18 years or older at the time of signing the informed consent document. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any studyrelated assessments/procedures are conducted. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. Subject with a diagnosis of patchy scalp alopecia areata present for at least 6 months, and up to a maximum of 10 years. Patients with ≥50% and &lt;95% total scalp hair loss at Baseline as measured using the SALT score to qualify as moderate to severe AA; and 95%100% scalp hair loss to qualify as AA totalis/universalis. Must meet the following laboratory criteria White blood cell count ≥ 3000/mm3 (≥ 3.0 x 109/L) and &lt; 14,000/mm3 (&lt; 14 x 109/L). Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL (≥ 100 x 109/L). Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (≤ 132.6 μmol/L). AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN). If the initial test shows ALT or AST &gt; 2 times the ULN, one repeat test is allowed during the Screening Phase. Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL (34 μmol/L). If the initial test shows total bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL (34 μmol/L), one repeat test is allowed during the Screening Phase. Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL (≥ 6.2 mmol/L). Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Baseline. While on investigational product and for at least 28 days after taking the last dose of investigational product (IP), FCBP who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive options described below: Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD); tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex condom or nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]); plus spermicide PLUS one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with spermicide; (b) cervical cap with spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while on IP and for at least 28 days after the last dose of IP. No evidence of hair regrowth present at Baseline. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment: Clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) cardiac, endocrine, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric, hepatic, renal, hematologic, or immunologic disease, or other major uncontrolled diseases that will affect the health of the subject during the study or interfere with the interpretation of study results. Hepatitis B surface antigen positive at Screening (Visit 1). Hepatitis C antibody positive at Screening (Visit 1). History of positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (eg, Common Variable Immunodeficiency [CVID]). Subjects deemed at risk by the study investigator, may also undergo testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subjects deemed at risk include those with a history of injection drug use, homosexual subjects, and subjects with known sexual contact with an HIV positive partner.
