	<brief_title>Is Eovist Suitable for Arterial-Phase MR Imaging of Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers will review data from the Eovist MRI and compare the scan with previous MRI exams the patient had with the same or other contrast agents. To determine the efficacy of Eovist contrast agent in producing MRI images of the liver. We will monitor patients for any unusual symptoms (adverse events) when the contrast is given. Patients are asked to hold their breath during an MRI scan. Eovist may interfere with the "breath hold" which could result in more breathing artifacts (based on a qualitative scale) on arterial images when the patients are given Eovist vs. other contrast agents.</detailed_description>
