	<brief_summary>This clinical research study has two parts: a safety lead-in and Phase 2. The goal of the safety lead-in is to find the highest tolerable dose of enzalutamide in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel that can be given to patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer. The goal of Phase 2 of this study is to learn if the study drug combination can help to control recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer. The safety of the drug combination will be studied in both parts of the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to either the Safety Lead-in or the Phase 2 portion. The study group you are in will depend on when you join the study. In the Safety Lead-in, each study cycle is 21 days. In Phase 2, the first study cycle (Cycle 0) will be 28 days, and all other study cycles will be 21 days. If you are enrolled in the Safety Lead-in phase, you will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel on Day 1 of Cycles 1-9. You will also take enzalutamide every day. If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will take enzalutamide every day by itself during the first cycle (called Cycle 0). You will then receive paclitaxel and carboplatin by vein on Day 1 of Cycles 1-9. You will also continue taking enzalutamide every day during this time. In both phases, the study drug doses may be lowered if you have side effects. The dose that was found to be appropriate in the safety lead-in will be used in Phase 2. Study Drug Administration: Paclitaxel will be given by vein over 3 hours. Carboplatin will be given by vein over 1 hour. You will take 4 enzalutamide capsules by mouth at the same time every morning with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water. You may take your dose with or without food. The capsules should be swallowed whole and not crushed or cut. If you forget to take a dose, you may take it within 12 hours of the usual dosing time. If you vomit within 30 minutes of taking a dose, you should take the dose again. If you have side effects, your doctor may decide to lower your dose. You will be given a study drug diary to write down when you take each dose of study drug and if you miss any doses. You should bring the study drug diary and any unused study drugs with you to each clinic visit. Study Visits: Cycle 0 Study Visits (Phase 2 participants only): At Week 1 of Cycle 0: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At Week 2 of Cycle 0, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At Week 3 of Cycle 0, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At Week 4 of Cycle 0: - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing. - You will have the same type of biopsy you had at screening. Study Visits for All Participants: At Week 1 of Cycles 1-9: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At Weeks 2 and 3 of Cycles 1-9, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At Week 1 of Cycle 2, blood (about Â½ teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing before the dose and 8 more times over the next 7 hours after the start of the dose. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. At Week 3 of Cycle 3 and then every 9 weeks, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease. Anytime the doctor thinks it is needed, part of the routine blood sample will be used to check how well your blood clots. Length of Treatment: You may continue to receive the study drugs until Cycle 9. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits (described below). Follow-Up Visits: After you stop taking the study drugs, you will return to the clinic every 3 months for 1 year, and then as often as the doctor thinks it is needed after that. At each visit: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have an x-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease. This is an investigational study. Enzalutamide is FDA approved for the treatment of certain types of prostate cancer. Paclitaxel and carboplatin are FDA approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The use of the combination of these 3 drugs to treat endometrial cancer is investigational. Up to 69 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis (by either primary surgical specimen or biopsy for recurrence) of advanced stage (stage III or IV) or recurrent endometrioid endometrial cancer. 2. Measurable disease (at least one measurable lesion) IS required. A measurable lesion is one that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be &gt; 10 mm when measured by CT scan, MRI, or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt; 20 mm when measured by Chest XRay. Lymph nodes must be &gt; 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI. 3. Patients must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy. 4. Patient with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;/= 1. 5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months in the opinion of the principal investigator. 6. Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. 7. Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated UTI). 8. Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration. 9. Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration. 10. PRIOR THERAPY: Patients should have had NO prior chemotherapy agents for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Prior chemotherapy administration in conjunction with primary radiation therapy as a radiosensitizer would NOT exclude a patient from participation in this trial. 11. Patients must have adequate: (1) Bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1,500/mcl, equivalent to Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v4.03) grade 1; Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mcl; (2) Renal function: calculated creatinine clearance (CockcroftGault formula) &gt; 50 ml/min OR 24hour urine creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min; (3) Hepatic function: Bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN (CTCAE v4.03 grade 1; in patients with known Gilbert Syndrome, a total bilirubin &lt;/=3.0 x ULN, with direct bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN). AST and alkaline phosphatase &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN (CTCAE v4.03 grade 1; AST and ALT &lt;/= 3 x ULN (or &lt;/= 5.0 x ULN if hepatic metastases are present); (4) Neurologic function: Neuropathy (sensory and motor) &lt;/= CTCAE v4.03 grade 1; [Continued in Criterion 12] 12. [Continued from Criterion 11] (5) PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is &lt;/= 1.5 (or an inrange INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a PTT &lt;/= 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal. Patients receiving low molecular weight heparin for the prevention or treatment of venous thromboembolic disease are eligible if considered clinically stable on their regimen. 13. Patients must have signed an approved informed consent. 14. Age &gt;/=18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of enzalutamide in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study. 15. The effects of enzalutamide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because therapeutic agents used in this trial may be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and their partners must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of childbearing potential (intact uterus) should have a negative serum pregnancy test. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets. 16. With the exception of alopecia, any unresolved toxicities from prior chemotherapy should be no greater than CTCAE v4 Grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment. 17. Patients on the Phase II portion only must be willing to undergo pre and posttreatment biopsies and have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy. 1. Patients who have isolated recurrences (vaginal, pelvic, or paraaortic) that are amenable to potentially curative treatment with radiation therapy or surgery. 2. Patients with the following histologies of endometrial cancer are not eligible for enrollment: papillary serous adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, sarcoma. 3. Prior Therapy: Prior Chemotherapy: Patients who have had a prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease are excluded. Prior Radiation Therapy: Patients may have received prior radiation therapy for treatment of endometrial carcinoma. Prior radiation therapy may have included pelvic radiation therapy, extended field pelvic/paraaortic radiation therapy, and/or intravaginal brachytherapy, alone or with chemotherapy as a radiation sensitizer. All radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to the first date of study therapy. The prior radiation field, radiation dose, number of fractions and prior radiation start and stop dates must be provided at registration. 4. Patients who have previously received enzalutamide. Patients may have received prior hormonal therapy for treatment of endometrial carcinoma. All hormonal therapy must be discontinued at least one week prior to the first date of study therapy. 5. Patients who have had radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events (CTCAE v4.03 grade 2 or greater, excluding alopecia) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 6. Patients may not receive any other antineoplastic or investigational agents within 3 weeks of study enrollment. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents during treatment on protocol. 7. Patients may not receive strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, CYP2C8 inducers, or CYP3A4 inducers. In addition, patients should not receive drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 or CYP2C9. 8. Patients who are pregnant or nursing. The effects of enzalutamide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 9. Patient had major surgery within 28 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects of the surgery. 10. Patients may not have a history of other malignancies except for basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, unless they have been diseasefree for at least five years. 11.

Patient with history of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to enzalutamide, carboplatin, or paclitaxel. 13. Patients may not have symptomatic, uncontrolled spinal cord compression and/or brain metastases. A scan to confirm absence of brain metastasis is not required. Patients can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before/ during study if these were started at least 28 days prior to entry. 14. As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., severe hepatic impairment, interstitial lung disease [bilateral, diffuse, parenchymal lung disease], uncontrolled chronic renal diseases [glomerulonephritis, nephritic syndrome, Fanconi Syndrome or Renal tubular acidosis]), or current unstable or uncompensated respiratory or cardiac conditions, or uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt;/= 160/90), active bleeding diatheses or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus. Screening for chronic conditions is not required. 15. As judged by the Investigator, the patient is unsuitable to participate in the study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements.</criteria>
