	<brief_title>Chiropractic Treatment for Headache Among Children Aged 7-14</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a two-armed parallel, randomized controlled clinical trial where children suffering from chronic headache and at the same time having one or more biomechanical dysfunctions of the spine are randomized to either chiropractic manipulation treatment or placebo manipulation treatment. The outcome is based on weekly sms responses collecting the number of days with headache the past week, intensity of headache and use of medication for headache. These are answered four weeks prior to initiation of treatment and 16 weeks thereafter. After the 16 weeks follow-up, a final questionnaire is completed including information about the course and the present headache status. The primary outcome is the number of days with headache. Secondary outcomes are intensity of headaches and use of medication for headache. Covariates are collected via baseline questionnaires on patient demographics; medical history; factors known to initiate, worsen or ease the headache; prevalence of headache in the nearest family; and behavioral patterns known to influence headache.</detailed_description>
