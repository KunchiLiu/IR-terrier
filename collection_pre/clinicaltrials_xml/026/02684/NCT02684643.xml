	<brief_title>Study of Individualized Therapy on Hyperphosphatemia in Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients has been one of the most difficult conundrums for nephrologist for the past two decades. Elevated phosphate contributes to secondary hyperparathyroidism, elevated FGF23 levels, and vascular calcification, which in turn predispose to mortality in this population. Current guidelines recommend limiting dietary phosphate intake, strengthening dialysis and using phosphate binders as three therapies for treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Yet exact clinical implication remains ambiguous: how intense restricted phosphate intake should be and how dosage of phosphate binders and dialysis should be adjusted accordingly. Thus, treatments of hyperphosphatemia have not been effective enough, but appear to be refractory. In the current study, the investigators designed individualized phosphate-lowering therapy based on each patient's phosphate-clearing ability, in order to observe and compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the individualized therapy and the regular guideline-recommended therapy.</detailed_description>
