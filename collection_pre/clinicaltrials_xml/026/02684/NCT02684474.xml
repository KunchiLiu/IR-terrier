	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to provide treatment with HBOC-201 to patients with life-threatening anemia for whom allogeneic blood transfusion is not an option. HBOC 201 [hemoglobin glutamer - 250 (bovine)] has been previously studied as an alternative to blood transfusions in severely anemic patients needing a way to enhance tissue oxygenation. HBOC-201 is purified, cross-linked and polymerized acellular bovine hemoglobin in a modified lactated Ringer's solution, and does not require blood compatibility.</brief_summary>
