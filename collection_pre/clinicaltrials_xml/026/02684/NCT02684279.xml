Subject has not taken any medication other than the study drug for the purpose of controlling BED symptoms during the core study. Female subject must have a negative urine pregnancy test at open label (OL) Baseline; females who are postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea) and those who have undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy will be exempted from the pregnancy test. Female subject of childbearing potential and male subject with female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective and medically acceptable form of birth control (see Section 22, Appendix III) throughout the study period.

Subject can read well enough to understand the informed consent form and other subject materials. Subject is considered by the investigator to be at imminent risk of suicide, injury to self or to others, or damage to property. Subject answers "yes" to "suicidal ideation" item 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) on the C SSRS assessment at OL Baseline. Subjects who answer "yes" to this question must be referred to the Investigator for follow up evaluation.
