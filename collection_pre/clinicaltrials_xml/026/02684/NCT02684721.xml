	<brief_title>Does a Home-based Exercise Programme Affect Physical Capacity and Quality of Life in Patients With Pulmonary Embolism?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The existing knowledge regarding pulmonary embolism is primarily focused on the diagnostic methods and medical treatment of the condition, and furthermore on the short term prognosis in terms of mortality and complications. Very few studies investigate how every day life is affected in patients struck by a pulmonary embolism, although many patients display worries and concerns about their physical, emotional and social well-being after discharge. For the time being, no rehabilitation options are available for these patients in Denmark. Methods and materials: 140 patients medically treated for pulmonary embolism will be recruited from 6 different hospitals. After inclusion the patients will be randomly allocated to either the control group, receiving usual care, or the intervention group, receiving an 8-week home-based exercise programme in addition to usual care. At the time of inclusion, after 2 months and after 6 months, the patients' physical capacity is measured using the Incremental Shuttle Walk test. Furthermore the patients' complete a questionnaire on quality of life (EQ-5D and Pulmonary Embolism Quality of Life Questionnaire), self-reported sick leave and use of psychoactive drugs. All follow-up measurements and visits take place at the hospital from which the patient was discharged. Expected outcome and perspective: The investigators expect that the home-based exercise programme will improve the overall treatment outcome for the patients in the intervention group. The study will furthermore contribute significantly to the limited knowledge about the optimal rehabilitation for this group of patients, and may thereby form the basis of future recommendations in this field.</detailed_description>
