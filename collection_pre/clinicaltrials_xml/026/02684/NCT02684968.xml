	<brief_summary>Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 without stratification to bilateral continuous QL catheters with local anesthetic continuous infusion (QL block + IV patient-controlled analgesia group) or normal saline continuous infusion (IV patient-controlled analgesia group). In the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), patients will be given intravenous boluses of hydromorphone or fentanyl as needed. Following immediate recovery from anesthesia, patients will be provided with a hydromorphone IV patient-controlled analgesia pump with standard initial settings and an option of clinician dose for breakthrough pain. IV patient-controlled hydromorphone pump settings will be titrated to comfort level (pain score&lt;4) by blinded clinicians. On the nursing floor, patients will also receive scheduled boluses of of 10 mL 0.1% bupivacaine or normal saline from the pump every 4 hours. These scheduled boluses (clinician dose) will be administered by the nurse using the medication from the pump. If patient agrees ViSi mobile (Sotera Wireless) patient monitoring system will be used to continuously record noninvasive blood pressure, patient activity, posture, 3-lead ECG, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. Data will be recorded at one-minute intervals and downloaded daily to a laptop. Opioid consumption first 72 hours or until discharge, whichever comes first will be recorded. Pain scores during first 72 hours or until discharge, whichever comes first will be recorded with a verbal rating scale and obtained from the patient's electronic medical records. The morning of post operative day 1 and post operative day 3 the ORSDS and QOR surveys will be completed. Morning of the day of discharge, the overall patient satisfaction with pain management survey will be completed.</brief_summary>
