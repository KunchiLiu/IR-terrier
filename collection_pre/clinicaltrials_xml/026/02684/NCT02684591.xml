	<brief_summary>A subset of patients with NAFLD that have not been extensively studied are those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for NAFLD or NASH. Additionally, there have been no significant clinical trials for HIV patients with NAFLD and there are no approved treatment options. We plan to conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the efficacy of 600 mg of Aramchol daily (including 200 mg tablet and 400 mg tablet) versus identical placebo given over 12 weeks to improve HIV-associated hepatic steatosis as measured by a validated and accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aramchol for HIV-associated Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Lipodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the efficacy of Aramchol at 600 mg/day orally versus identical placebo given over 12 weeks to improve HIV-associated hepatic steatosis as measured by a validated and accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based technique. In this study, we propose to randomize up to 50 patients with HIV-associated NAFLD to either Aramchol or placebo for 12 weeks. We plan to enroll a total of 55 patients, expecting some drop outs prior to randomization. After an initial evaluation for insulin sensitivity, liver fat measurement by MRI, and total body fat content by DEXA, patients will be randomized to receive either Aramchol 600 mg/day or placebo orally for 12 weeks. Patients will be monitored at regular intervals for symptoms of liver disease, side effects of medication, and serum biochemical and metabolic indices. Patients will also be assessed for continued HIV viral load suppression and continued tolerance of antiretroviral therapy. At the end of 12 weeks, patients will have a repeat medical evaluation, liver fat measurement, and total body fat content measurement. Pre and post treatment liver fat by MRI, ALT/AST, HbA1c, CRP, insulin sensitivity, and DEXA for whole body fat will be compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be improvement in liver fat by MRI. Secondary end points will be improvement in total body fat, insulin sensitivity and liver biochemistry.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age at entry at least 18 years. 2. And at least one of the following risk factor for more severe liver disease: Hypertriglyceridemia based upon ATPIII guidelines, Increased LDL cholesterol or increased total cholesterol based upon ATPIII guidelines, Decreased HDL cholesterol based upon ATPIII guidelines, Serum alanine (ALT) or aspartate (AST) aminotransferase activities that are above the upper limits of normal. 19 or more in women and 30 or more in men, Overweight as defined as BMI: 25 &lt; 30 kg/m2, Obesity as defined BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, Hyperuricemia based upon ATPIII guidelines, Prediabetes or Diabetes by American Diabetes Association Criteria 3. Lipodystrophy will be confirmed on both clinical and radiologic assessment and defined as: Clinical history and/or exam by the study physician with signs of either facial,temporal, upper or lower extremity lipoatrophy, Documented abdominal fat accumulation with presence of hepatic steatosis on MRI 4. An MRIdetermined fat fraction classification threshold (≥5%) will be used to confirm subjects. MR examinations will include four research sequences (three imaging sequences and one singlevoxel spectroscopy sequence) that have been developed and refined by Dr. Sirlin, allowing for the measurement of liver fat fraction and newer candidate MR biomarkers for future NAFLD studies. MR examinations will last 2030 minutes and will be performed without contrast agents. Subjects will be scanned at 1.5T. To assess sequence repeatability, two sequences per subject, block randomized, will be run three times. For MR elastography, MR imaging will be done which will include placing a vibrating paddle over the abdomen while images are obtained. A comprehensive screening questionnaire will be utilized prior to subjects having an MRI. Experienced research MR technologists will perform MR examinations under the supervision of Dr. Sirlin. 5. History of HIV documented by a previously positive HIV Elisa or PCR. 6. Stable antiretroviral (ART) regimen for at least 12 weeks prior to study inclusion. 7. Written informed consent. 1. Evidence of another form of liver disease: Hepatitis B as defined as presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C as defined by presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in serum, Autoimmune hepatitis as defined by antinuclear antibody (ANA) of 1:160 or greater and liver histology consistent with autoimmune hepatitis or previous response to immunosuppressive therapy, Autoimmune cholestatic liver disorders as defined by elevation of alkaline phosphatase and antimitochondrial antibody of greater than 1:80 or liver histology consistent with rimary biliary cirrhosis or elevation of alkaline phosphatase and liver histology consistent with sclerosing cholangitis, Wilsons disease as defined by ceruloplasmin below the limits of normal and liver histology consistent with Wilsons disease Alpha1antitrypsin deficiency as defined by alpha1antitrypsin level less than normal and liver histology consistent with alpha1antitrypsin deficiency hemochromatosis as defined by presence of 3+ or 4+ stainable iron on liver biopsy and homozygosity for C282Y or compound heterozygosity for C282Y/H63D, Druginduced liver disease as defined on the basis of typical exposure and history,Bile duct obstruction as shown by imaging studies. 2. Evidence of liver cirrhosis based upon clinical assessment, imaging or any of the following lab abnormalities: INR &gt;1.4, albumin &lt;3.2 g/dL, platelet count &lt;90 x 103/microliter 3. History of excess alcohol ingestion, averaging more than 30 gm/day (3 drinks per day) in the previous 10 years, or history of alcohol intake averaging greater than 10 gm/day (1 drink per day or 7 drinks per week) in the previous one year. 4. Contraindications to MRI: The subject has any contraindication to MR imaging, such as patients with pacemakers, metallic cardiac valves, magnetic material such as surgical clips, implanted electronic infusion pumps or other conditions that would preclude proximity to a strong magnetic field, the subject has a history of extreme claustrophobia, The subject cannot fit inside the MR scanner cavity, decompensated liver disease, ChildPugh score greater than or equal to 7 points 6. History of gastrointestinal bypass surgery or ingestion of drugs known to produce hepatic steatosis including corticosteroids, highdose estrogens, methotrexate, tetracycline or amiodarone in the previous 6 months. 7. Recent use (within the last 90 days) of medications to treat hepatic steatosis such as pioglotazone (or medications in the same class) or vitamin E. 8. Use of Aramchol or agents in the same class. 9.
