	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether tralokinumab can be a helpful treatment for alopecia areata. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of a total of 30 subjects with moderate to severe alopecia areata involving 30-100% of the scalp. Expected is 50% of these subjects to have concomitant alopecia areata (AA) and atopic dermatitis (AD). Subjects with AA alone (15 subjects) will be randomized (2:1) to either receive tralokinumab or placebo via subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. Subjects with concomitant alopecia areata and atopic dermatitis (15 subjects) will be randomized separately in a 2:1 ratio to receive tralokinumab or placebo via subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess whether tralokinumab can be a helpful treatment for alopecia areata. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of a total of 30 subjects with moderate to severe alopecia areata involving 30-100% of the scalp. The researchers expect 50% of these subjects to have concomitant alopecia areata (AA) and atopic dermatitis (AD). The researchers' experience in AD12-14, and past experience in psoriasis15, 16 showed that biomarker studies in skin tissues are critical to the understanding of key pathogenic pathways that are upregulated in each disease and how well they are suppressed with effective treatment. These mechanistic studies coupled with clinical trials are key in the disease to shed light on important disease mechanisms, and to explain which molecules are suppressed by each therapeutic target. Data shows that IL-13 is significantly upregulated in both AD and AA lesions compared to nonlesional skin. It is very important to associate the clinical responses with suppression of this cytokine and related molecules as well as other pathway cytokines in skin tissues. Both the whole genomic profiling and individual molecular and cellular markers are very important in order to understand how well anti-IL-13 will change/suppress AA-associated pathways and compare with those that will be suppressed in AD. Since this study is designed to gain basic knowledge rather than to yield information directly related to patient care, the results are not entered in the participants' medical records. If, at a later date, correlations of in-vitro tests and the patients' clinical situation suggest that the results do bear on the patients' health, an amended protocol will be submitted to the IRB so that results can be made available to the medical record.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female, aged from 18 to 75 years, inclusively at the time of signing the informed consent document. Subject has provided written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. Body weight of ≥40 and &lt;150 kg at enrollment. Subject has a history of alopecia areata for at least 3 months. Subject has extensive patchy alopecia areata (at least 30% scalp hair loss). No evidence of hair regrowth at Baseline. For WOCBP only: have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to administration of the IP. For inclusion in the voluntary pharmacogenetic research, subjects should fulfill the following criterion: Provision of a signed and dated written informed consent for the pharmacogenetic sample and analysis. If a subject declines to participate in the pharmacogenetic research, there will be no consequence or loss of benefit to the subject. The subject will not be excluded from the other aspects of the study described in the protocol, as long as they consent to participate in the study. Subject is judged to be in good general health as determined by the principal investigator based upon the results of medical history, laboratory profile, and physical examination performed at Screening. Subjects may be naïve to treatment or unresponsive to intralesional steroids or other treatments for alopecia areata. History of male or female pattern hair loss Ludwig stage III or Hamilton &gt; stage V. Subjects in whom the diagnosis of alopecia areata is in question. Any disorder, including but not limited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic, haematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the opinion of the Investigator and could: 1. Affect the safety of the subject throughout the study 2. Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations 3. Impede the subject's ability to complete the entire duration of study Known history of allergy or reaction to any component of the IP formulation. History of anaphylaxis following any biologic therapy. The following treatments within 4 weeks before the Baseline visit, or any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, will likely require such treatment(s) at any time during the study: 1. Systemic corticosteroids 2. Immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs (eg, cyclosporine, mycophenolatemofetil, IFNγ, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, azathioprine or methotrexate), UltraViolet (UV) B phototherapy; and/or Psoralen UltraViolet A (PUVA) therapy. Treatment with topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus and/or pimecrolimus within 1 week before the Baseline visit. Subject has taken enzymemodifying drugs that are moderate inhibitors/potent inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 or potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 2C19 enzymes (such as cimetidine, quinidine, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole etc…) and strong inducers of CYP enzymes (such as rifampin etc…), in the previous 28 days before day 0.

Tuberculosis requiring treatment within the 12 months prior to enrolment (Visit 1). Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs, ECG, hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during the runin period, which in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the subject's ability to complete entire duration of the study. History of chronic alcohol or drug abuse within 12 months of the enrolment visit, or a condition associated with poor compliance as judged by the Investigator.
