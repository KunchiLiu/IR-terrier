	<brief_summary>Itch, or pruritus, is the most common complain reported by patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) of all subtypes, and there is no current effective treatment. Itch often triggers scratching that creates new wounds and increases EB disease severity. This study aims to target the physiological mechanisms of pruritus. Substance P is a major mediator of pruritus and binds to the receptor neurokinin-1 (NK1), which is expressed in the central nervous system and the skin. VPD-737 (serlopitant), a drug that inhibits the NK1 receptor, has been shown to reduce severe itch in a previous study of 257 adult patients with chronic pruritus. The investigators are now testing VPD-737 in 14 patients with EB in a Phase II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. Our goals is to determine whether daily oral administration of VPD-737 (5 mg) is effective and safe in adolescents and adults with EB.</brief_summary>
