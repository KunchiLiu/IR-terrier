	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare CO2 absorption during gynecologic laparoscopy using the AirSeal® valveless trocar system versus standard insufflation trocars at intra-abdominal pressures of 10 and 15 mmHg. The investigators hypothesize that with the AirSeal® valveless trocar system, gynecologic laparoscopy can be performed at a lower intra-abdominal pressure with a possible resultant decrease in CO2 absorption, while maintaining adequate visualization of the operative field for safe completion of surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AirSeal®Insufflation Trocar/CO2 Absorption Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three main factors affect patients' cardiopulmonary status during gynecologic laparoscopy: 1) degree of Trendelenburg tilt (25 - 30°), 2) carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption and 3) increased intra-abdominal pressure (10 -20 mmHg). Slight modifications to any or all of these three factors can lead to a significant decrease in morbidity. The AirSeal® valveless trocar system reduces CO2 absorption when compared to standard trocars during renal laparoscopy. Also, use of this trocar system provides a more stable intra-abdominal pressure when compared to standard trocars, a feature that could possibly allow for laparoscopic surgery to be performed at lower intra-abdominal pressures.</detailed_description>
