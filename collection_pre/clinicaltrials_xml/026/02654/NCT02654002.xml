	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating single- and multiple-oral doses of GS-9674, and characterize the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of GS-9674. The study will be conducted in 3 parts (Part A, Part B, and Part C). Participants will receive either GS-9674 or GS-9674 placebo. Part A will proceed in 4 prespecified staggered cohorts. Within each cohort, the cumulative, blinded safety data will be evaluated for dose escalation from single-dose (Period 1) to multiple-dose (Period 2). Based on the available safety, pharmacokinetics, and/or pharmacodynamics (PD) data from cohorts in Part A and Part C (if applicable), total daily doses and frequency of dosing will be chosen for the cohorts in Part B. Parts B and C will consist of adaptive cohorts and may be initiated in parallel. Part B cohorts may be initiated in parallel with cohorts in Part A if the total dose under evaluation is at or below a dose already evaluated. This study is partially blinded (no one is blinded on Day -1).</brief_summary>
