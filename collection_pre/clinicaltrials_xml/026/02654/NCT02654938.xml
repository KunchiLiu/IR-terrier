	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability Clinical Trial of Different Doses of the Immunotherapeutic Drug Mobilan (M-VM3) and Placebo in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mobilan is a type V adenovirus carrying TLR5 receptor and its agonist, protein 502s. It's mechanism of action involves activation of immune system and extensive mobilisation of various immunocytes to administration locus. It's safety and tolerability is currently evaluated in first-in-man phase I study in prostate cancer patients. Treatment strategy for the disease (radical prostatectomy or active observation) will be determined by the Investigator in accordance with routine clinical practice of the hospital. Patients will be randomised in cohorts of 4 subjects, where 3 subjects will be administered with Mobilan (М-VM3), and one patient will be administered with placebo. The dose will be escalated from cohort to cohort, the decision on possible dose escalation will be made by Independent Safety Review Board.</detailed_description>
