	<brief_summary>The primary aim of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for supratentorial intracranial hemorrhage is to achieve an atraumatic evacuation of blood products from the brain to prevent the secondary injury that occurs after the initial bleed. The purpose of this Phase II randomized trial is to provide an initial assessment of the efficacy of MIES to improve outcomes in patients with supratentorial ICH. Subjects will be randomized to either medical management or medical management with MIS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INVEST: Minimally Invasive Endoscopic Surgery vs. Medical Management in Supratentorial Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The primary objective of this multicenter randomized controlled trial is to provide an initial assessment of the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive endoscopic surgery with Apollo for the evacuation of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) Study Design: This study will be a prospective, randomized, multi-centered international trial that will enroll up to 180 patients at up to 30 US centers and 5 centers outside of the United States. Patients will be followed for 12 months. Patient Population: Patients with moderate-large volume (20-80 cc) supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who present within 24 hours of symptom onset. Patients will be randomized to either minimally invasive endoscopic evacuation with the Apollo system or best medical management (2:1). Indication: The Apollo system has been cleared for the controlled aspiration of soft tissue and/or fluid during endoscopically guided neurosurgery of the ventricular system. In the present study, the investigators propose to investigate the safety and efficacy of this system for the minimally invasive evacuation of intracerebral hemorrhage.</detailed_description>

High risk condition for ischemic stroke (high risk Afib (e.g., mitral stenosis with Afib), symptomatic carotid stenosis) Requirement for emergent surgical decompression or uncontrolled ICP after EVD Unable to obtain consent from patient or appropriate surrogate (for patients without competence) Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or positive pregnancy test [either serum or urine] (Woman of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to the study procedure.) Evidence of active infection [indicated by fever (at or over 100.7 °F) and/or open draining wound] at the time of randomization Any comorbid disease or condition expected to compromise survival or ability to complete followup assessments through 180 days. Based on investigator's judgment, patient does not have the necessary mental capacity to participate or is unwilling or unable to comply with protocol follow up appointment schedule. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator would interfere with adherence to study requirements.
