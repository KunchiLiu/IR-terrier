	<brief_summary>The quality of induction with sevoflurane, along with its ability to generate optimal conditions for Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) insertion without supplemental opioids or muscle relaxants, has also been well documented. An ideal inhalation induction technique besides being rapid and comfortable for the patient should be economical. To achieve rapidity, use of vital capacity breaths with 8% sevoflurane is a more popular method of induction compared with the conventional incremental induction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Right Lateral Positioning and Its Effect on Induction of General Anesthesia for Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>100 pediatric patients (age range, 1 to 8 years) scheduled for lower abdominal surgery under anesthesia will be included. All children in both groups will be premedicated with midazolam, 0.5 mg/kg orally, about 30 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. A parent or guardian accompanied the child into the operating room to allow the child to remain calm and cooperative for inhalation induction. Before induction, pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram monitoring will be attached. For each group, inhalation induction was initiated using a face mask using "tidal volume" and "vital capacity" breathing in high sevoflurane concentration (8%).</detailed_description>
