	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Prime-Boost Regimen of HIV-1 Nef/Tat/Vif, Env pDNA Vaccine Delivered Intramuscularly With Electroporation and HIV-1 rVSV envC Vaccine in Healthy, HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of an HIV-1 nef/tat/vif, env pDNA vaccine delivered with EP, followed by a rVSV HIV envC vaccine boost, in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive the HIV-1 nef/tat/vif, env pDNA vaccine at Day 0 and Months 1 and 3, followed by the rVSV HIV envC vaccine boost at Months 6 and 9. Participants in Group 2 will receive placebo vaccine at Day 0 and Months 1, 3, 6, and 9. Study visits will occur at Day 0, Week 2, and Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 6, 6.25, 6.5, 9, 9.25, 9.5, 12, and 15. Visits may include physical examinations, urine collection, blood collection, HIV testing, risk reduction counseling, assessments, and questionnaires. Participants will be contacted by study staff for follow-up monitoring annually for 3 years following the initial study injection.</detailed_description>
