	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of a single intrathecal injection of paracetamol, administered at 3 doses to 3 active treatment groups, as compared to placebo solution, for post-operative analgesia of hip replacement surgery performed under spinal anaesthesia. Patients scheduled for hip replacement surgery will be randomised into 4 treatment groups (15 patients per group) to receive either one of the 3 single doses of paracetamol 3% (D1: 60 mg, D2: 90 mg, D3: 120 mg) or placebo solution (P: saline solution) by intrathecal (IT) injection. Immediately after paracetamol or placebo IT administration, all patients will receive a single IT dose of Hyperbaric Bupivacaine HCl 0.5% (12.5 mg for ≤ 160 cm-tall patients and 15 mg for &gt; 160 cm-tall patients). The time interval between paracetamol IT and bupivacaine IT administrations should not exceed 2 min. The study will include a screening phase (Visit 1, Days -21/1), a treatment phase (paracetamol IT administration, anaesthesia and surgical procedure: Visit 2, Day 1) and a follow-up phase including an observation period (Visit 3, from Day 1 after surgery until discharge, a final visit (at discharge) and a follow-up (day 6±1). Pain at rest will be assessed at screening and on visit 2 at baseline (0 h), 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45 and 48 h after anaesthetic IT injection and at discharge, using a 0-100 mm VAS.</brief_summary>
