	<brief_title>Prevention of Delirium in Inpatients Utilizing Melatonin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a randomized double blind controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin in decreasing the incidence of delirium in elderly hospitalized adults compared to a placebo capsule. The study will be conducted on two general Internal Medicine inpatient floors at Yale-New Haven Hospital, St. Raphael's campus. Within 24 hours of admission, study subjects will be approached by a member of the research team, and asked for informed consent. Patients that consent to participate will be randomized to either the treatment or the placebo arm. Each subject will be administered a capsule containing either placebo or 5 mg melatonin each evening at 9 p.m. The capsules will be prepared and administered by the Yale-New haven Hospital Investigational Drug Service. The capsules will be administered nightly until discharge or a maximum of 2 weeks, if the hospitalization is prolonged. Subjects will be assessed twice daily by the floor nurses for evidence of delirium using the CAM (Confusion Assessment Method), which is a validated clinical tool for identifying delirium, and the current standard of practice tool for the diagnosis of delirium.</detailed_description>
