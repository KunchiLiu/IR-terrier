	<brief_title>Viral Inhibition in Children for Treatment of RSV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is recognized as the leading cause of respiratory tract infections in infants and young children and a major cause of hospitalization due to severe respiratory infection. Despite four decades of effort, there are still no effective methods to control RSV infection. Treatment of RSV has been limited to supportive measures. There is an urgent need for safe and effective drugs to treat and prevent RSV disease. AK0529 is an investigational antiviral agent that targets the RSV fusion protein on the surface of the viral envelope and exerts antiviral activity against RSV by inhibiting viral entry into host cells and preventing fusion protein induced cell-cell fusion. AK0529 was generally well tolerated in healthy volunteers. This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antiviral effect of single and multiple dosing of AK0529 in infants hospitalized with RSV infection. It will consist of two parts, Part 1 and Part 2. Each part will consist of three phases, a pre-treatment phase, a treatment phase and post-treatment follow-up phase.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients of any race or ethnicity with an age adjusted for any prematurity of ≥1 month and ≤24 months. Diagnosis of RSV infection by virological means, which may include rapid diagnostic pointofcare testing, within 96 hours preceding screening for Part 1 and 72 hours for Part 2. Patient must weigh &gt;3 kg at screening and be within the 10th and 90th percentiles (inclusive) for the patient's age, based on the local child growth standards, i.e. the Australian Paediatric Endocrine Group Growth Charts. The parent / legal guardian of the patient must have provided written informed consent for the patient to participate. For patients aged &lt;12 months, an occipitofrontal head circumference within the normal range for age and gender. The patient has taken, is currently taking or requires any restricted medications. Patient is known to be HIVpositive (or the mother, if the potential patient is a child aged &lt;6 months). Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to the date of screening. Requires vasopressors or inotropic support at the time of enrolment. Concurrent gastrointestinal conditions that could, in the opinion of the investigator, prejudice absorption of the Investigational Medicinal Product (e.g. protracted vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, a history of necrotising enterocolitis with consequent short gut syndrome). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic lung disease requiring assisted ventilation at the time of enrolment. Diminished ventilatory reserve at risk for hypercapnia (e.g. pulmonary hypoplasia, sequestration syndromes, cystadenomatoid malformation, a history of surgery for diaphragmatic hernia). Left to right shunt meriting corrective therapy. Renal failure including renal anomalies likely to be associated with renal insufficiency (e.g. clinical conditions of renal dysplasia, polycystic renal disease, renal agenesis). Clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation (e.g. hepatic disorder with associated coagulopathy or associated encephalopathy). Cerebral palsy with microcephaly, chronic or persistent feeding difficulties or seizures. Symptomatic because of inborn errors of metabolism (e.g. mitochondrial disorders, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, glycogen storage disorders). Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (e.g. congenital agammaglobulinaemia, common variable immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive therapy other than glucocorticoid or montelukast therapy forming part of care directed by the treating physician). For Part 2 of this study, children with a history of having received palivizumab or any other monoclonal agent directed against RSV in the preceding 120 days. This exclusion criterion does not apply to Part 1. Evidence of active or uncontrolled respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, central nervous system or renal disease unrelated to RSV infection at baseline or any other medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator renders the patient unsuitable for enrolment. A history of epilepsy or seizures including febrile seizures. Allergy to test medication or constituents. Weight less than 10th percentile or greater than 90th percentile for age and gender adjusted for any prematurity. The patient's parent or legally acceptable representative is an employee of the investigator or the study center, with direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that investigator of the study center, or any family members of the employees or the investigator. Failure to satisfy the investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason.</criteria>
