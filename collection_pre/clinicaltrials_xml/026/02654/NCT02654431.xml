	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is the identification and quantification of proteins expression level in breast cancer tissues. The imaging system is intended for diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection, counting and classifying ER/PR IHC stained samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification and Semi -Quantification of ER/PR Proteins Expression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anti ER/PR Kit is a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) assay to identify the progesterone (PR) and estrogen (ER) expressions in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens. Results from the ER/PR test is indicated as an aid in the assessment of the hormones status of breast cancer patients. While the ER/PR kit provides the antibodies that offer direct visualization and semi-quantification of the protein expression through a brightfield microscope, the GenASIs GoPath system is designed to complement the routine workflow of the pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained histologic slides.</detailed_description>
