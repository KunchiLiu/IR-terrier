	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine if the Investigational Medicinal Product Tedopi (OSE2101) is more effective than standard treatment in treating patients with stage IIIB NSCLC unsuitable for radiotherapy or metastatic NSCLC in second- or third-line treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of OSE2101 Versus Standard Treatment as 2nd or 3rd Line in HLA-A2 Positive Patients With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to demonstrate that OSE2101 (Arm A) is superior to standard chemotherapy, pemetrexed or docetaxel (Arm B), in prolonging overall survival (OS) in HLA-A2 positive patients with locally advanced (IIIB) or metastatic NSCLC as 2nd line therapy after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy or 3rd line after failure of platinum- and checkpoint-inhibitor regimens. In Arm B, patients with squamous NSCLC are allocated to docetaxel and patients with non-squamous NSCLC are allocated to pemetrexed if they are pemetrexed-naive or to docetaxel should they have already received pemetrexed. Treatment cycles will be repeated until unequivocal Recist 1.1-defined disease progression as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrollment. 2. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. 3. Female or male, 18 years of age or older. 4. Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of NSCLC that is locally advanced (stage IIIB) unsuitable for radiotherapy or metastatic (stage IV) according to the 7th edition of tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) in Lung Cancer published by the International Union Against Cancer and the American Joint Committee on Cancer. 5. Subjects with disease recurrence or progression 1. Patients must have had progressive disease after only one prior chemotherapy regimen: i) It includes patients who have received one prior platinumbased chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting following surgical resection for early disease and whose disease has recurred within 12 months of completion of prior chemotherapy, ii) It includes patients who received one prior platinumbased chemotherapy in combination with radiation therapy for Stage III locoregional disease and whose disease has recurred within 12 months of completion of prior chemotherapy, iii) It includes patients who received 2 prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimens, if the first regimen was given as adjuvant therapy or was given in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease 2. or Patients must have had progressive disease after 2nd line therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor 6. Subjects with measurable or nonmeasurable lesions. 7. Subjects must express HLAA2 phenotype as assessed serologically. 8. Subjects must be considered suitable for chemotherapy with either singleagent pemetrexed or docetaxel. 9. Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if treated and symptoms have returned to baseline (except for signs and symptoms related to central nervous system therapy) for at least 2 weeks before initiation of allocated treatment and are not taking any forbidden medications. 10. Any prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy or surgeries must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to initiation of study medication. 11. Any toxicity from prior therapy must have recovered to ≤ Grade 1 (except alopecia). 12. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01. 13. Adequate organ function as defined by all the following criteria: 1. Albuminemia &gt; 25g/L 2. Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) with alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN, or AST and ALT ≤ 5 x ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to liver metastases 3. Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN 4. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/L 5. Platelets ≥ 100000/L 6. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL (in the absence of transfusion within 2 weeks before randomization) 7. Creatinine clearance (based on modified CockcroftGault formula) ≥ 45 ml/min. 1. Smallcell lung cancer/mixed NSCLC with small cell component or other neuroendocrine lung cancers (typical and atypical carcinoids, largecell neuroendocrine carcinomas). Largecell carcinoma. 2. NSCLC that is predominantly squamous cell carcinoma, and patient had docetaxel as part of his prior chemotherapy. 3. Current or previous treatment with investigational therapy in another therapeutic clinical trial interrupted less than 4 weeks before study treatment initiation. 4. Patients whose tumor harbors EGFR gene mutation that sensitizes tumors to TyrosineKinase Inhibitor (TKI) (EGFR exon 1821) or Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) rearrangement. 5. Ongoing immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibition, antigen immunotherapy). 6. Spinal cord compression (unless treated with the patient attaining good pain control and stable or recovered neurologic function), carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease 7. Patients with squamous cell histology or nonsquamous cell histology previously treated by pemetrexed and with a contraindication for docetaxel with grade ≥ 2 neuropathy or hypersensitivity reaction to medications formulated with polysorbate 80) as they could be randomly assigned to Arm B. 8. Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications. 9. Treatment with corticosteroids in the last 3week period before inclusion, except for topical, ocular, intraarticular, intranasal, and inhaled corticosteroids with minimal systemic absorption (e.g. with a dose ≤ 500 microgram beclomethasone equivalent for inhaled steroids), or adrenal replacement steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent which are permitted. 10. A recognized immunodeficiency disease including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (and other cellular immunodeficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia or dysgammaglobulinemia; subjects who have hereditary, congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies). 11. Patients with autoimmune disease, with the exception of type I diabetes or treated hypothyroidism. 12. Patients with interstitial lung disease. 13. Patients with active B or C hepatitis. 14. Other malignancy: patients will not be eligible if they have evidence of active malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or localized cervical cancer, or localized and presumed cured prostate cancer). 15. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, and which would, therefore, make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. 16. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of the trial and for at least 90 days after completion of treatment. 17. Male patients sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of the trial and for at least 90 days after completion of treatment. The decision of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator. 18. Breastfeeding women. 19. Women with a positive pregnancy test.</criteria>
