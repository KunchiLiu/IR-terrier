	<brief_summary>This qualitative study aims to evaluate the usability of a smartphone application called DelApp. The study will assess usability and acceptability of the software app by asking 40 clinicians to administer the DelApp assessment to consented patient and clinicians. Feedback will be collected through semi-structured interviews with the clinicians. The feedback will be used to optimise the software application in preparation for formal validations studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of a Software App for Testing Inattention in Delirium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium is an acute, serious syndrome involving abnormalities in attention, arousal and cognition. Delirium affects 1 in 8 hospital patients. Delirium is linked to a higher risk of death, increased length of stay, and substantial patient and carer distress. Despite its massive medical importance, delirium is grossly underdetected, with rates of formal detection of 20% or less. Investigators previously developed a new neuropsychological test for the objective measurement of inattention in delirium, implemented on a computerised device (Delbox). A prototype software application for smartphones (DelApp) has been developed based on the 'Delbox' tests. Findings from two pilot studies suggest that the DelApp performs well as a method for objectively measuring attention in delirium. As part of a new programme of work on attentional tests for delirium, formally funded by the Medical Research Council (grant value £1.01M), investigators plan further studies to refine the DelApp before conducting larger scale formal studies. The reasons for doing these additional studies are to: (1) shorten the duration of the DelApp assessment; (2) ask end users (i.e. clinicians) to evaluate the user interface; (3) gather feedback from end users regarding the ease of use of the test; and any other feedback from clinicians and patients; and finally (4) develop the DelApp software application further based on user feedback. Here investigators propose a preliminary qualitative study to evaluate feasibility of the optimised DelApp test (points 2 and 3). Investigators will assess usability and acceptability by asking 40 clinical staff to administer the DelApp test to consented patients (N=10) and colleagues (approximately N=30). Feedback will be collected from clinicians and patients through semi-structured interviews. The outcomes of this feasibility study will make further optimisation of the app possible, in preparation for formal validation studies.</detailed_description>
