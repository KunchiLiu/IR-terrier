	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to compare maintenance treatment with avelumab plus best supportive care (BSC) with BSC alone, to determine if avelumab has an effect on survival in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that did not worsen during or following completion of first-line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Of Avelumab In Patients With Locally Advanced Or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer (JAVELIN Bladder 100)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium Stage IV disease at the start of firstline chemotherapy Measurable disease (per RECIST v1.1) prior to the start of firstline chemotherapy Prior firstline chemotherapy must have consisted of at least 4 cycles and no more than 6 cycles of gemcitabine + cisplatin and/or gemcitabine + carboplatin No evidence of progressive disease following completion of firstline chemotherapy (i.e., ongoing CR, PR, or SD per RECIST v1.1 guidelines ) Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic therapy within 12 months of randomization Prior immunotherapy with IL2, IFNÎ±, or an antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCD137, or CTLA 4 antibody (including ipilimumab), or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or immune checkpoint pathways Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (Grade &gt;1 NCI CTCAE v4.0); however, alopecia, sensory neuropathy (Grade 2 or less), or other (Grade 2 or less) adverse events not constituting a safety risk based on the investigator's judgement are acceptable. Patients with known symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases requiring steroids Diagnosis of any other malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the breast or of the cervix, low grade prostate cancer on surveillance without any plans for treatment intervention, or prostate cancer that has been adequately treated with prostatectomy or radiotherapy and currently with no evidence of disease or symptoms.</criteria>
