	<criteria>Patients who have signed Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of any studyrelated procedure. Male and female adults aged ≥ 40 years. Patients with moderate to severe airflow obstruction with stable COPD (Stage 2 or Stage 3) according to the 2014 GOLD Guidelines. Patients with a postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥40 and &lt; 80% of the predicted normal value, and postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.70 at runin Visit 101. (Post refers to 15 min after inhalation of 400 µg of salbutamol). Current or exsmokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years (e.g. 10 pack years = 1 pack /day x 10 years, or ½ pack/day x 20 years). An exsmoker is defined as a patient who has not smoked for ≥ 6 months at screening. Patients who are on triple treatment at least for the last 6 months (LAMA +LABA/ICS). Patients who have not achieved acceptable spirometry results at Visit 101 in accordance with ATS (American Thoracic Society)/ERS (European Respiratory Society) criteria for acceptability (one retest may be performed for patients that don't meet the acceptability criteria) . Patients who have had more than one COPD exacerbation that required treatment with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids and/or hospitalization in the last year prior to Visit 1. Patients who developed a COPD exacerbation of any severity either 6 weeks before the screening (Visit 1) or between screening (Visit 1) and treatment (Visit 201) will not be eligible but will be permitted to be rescreened after a minimum of 6 weeks after the resolution of the COPD exacerbation. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
