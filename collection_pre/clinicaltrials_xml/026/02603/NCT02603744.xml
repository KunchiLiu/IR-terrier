	<brief_title>Autologous Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Transplantation in Women With Premature Ovarian Failure (POF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study 9 patients with the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure will participate. The patients will be divided randomly in 3 groups, each group contains 3 patients. First group will receive 5 millions of ADSCs, second group receive 10 millions cells and the third group receive 15millions of ADSCs. Stem cell Transplantation method is intraovarian injection of ADSCs which will be performed under guidance of transvaginal sonography. All the patients will be followed for 12 months after cell injection to evaluate any adverse events .</detailed_description>
