	<brief_title>Oral Treprostinil in Subjects With Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate how oral treprostinil can affect pulmonary vascular resistance, as assessed by right heart catheterization, and exercise capacity, as assessed by the Six-Minute Walk Test. This is a 16-week study that will involve at least 10 clinical trial centers. The expected enrollment period is around 24 months and 52 subjects will be entered into the study.</detailed_description>
