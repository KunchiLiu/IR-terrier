	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching to a fixed dose combination (FDC) of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) versus continuing on a regimen consisting of boosted atazanavir (ATV) or darunavir (DRV) plus either emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) in HIV-1 infected adults who are virologically suppressed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Currently receiving a once daily antiretroviral regimen consisting of ritonavir or cobicistat boosted ATV or DRV plus either FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit Adequate renal function: Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 50 mL/min (≥ 0.83 mL/sec) according to the Cockcroft Gault formula Life expectancy ≥ 1 year Currently on a stable regimen for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit with documented plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit (or undetectable HIV1 RNA level according to the local assay being used if the limit of detection is ≥ 50 copies/mL) Have no documented or suspected resistance to FTC, tenofovir, ABC or 3TC, including but not limited to the reverse transcriptase resistance mutations K65R and M184V/I No previous use of any approved or experimental integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) Key An opportunistic illness indicative of stage 3 HIV diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis (eg, ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding) Have been treated with immunosuppressant therapies or chemotherapeutic agents within 3 months of study screening, or expected to receive these agents or systemic steroids during the study (eg, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, and other immune or cytokine based therapies) Current alcohol or substance use judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with subject study compliance A history of or ongoing malignancy (including untreated carcinoma insitu) other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma. Individuals with biopsyconfirmed cutaneous KS are eligible, but must not have received any systemic therapy for KS within 30 days of Day 1 and are not anticipated to require systemic therapy during the study Active, serious infections (other than HIV 1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1 Participation in any other clinical trial, including observational studies, without prior approval from the sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the individual unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements Any known allergies to the excipients of B/F/TAF FDC or ATV, RTV, DRV, COBI, FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC Females who are pregnant (as confirmed by positive serum pregnancy test) Females who are breastfeeding Acute hepatitis in the 30 days prior to study entry Chronic hepatitis B infection in individuals not on a TDF containing regimen, as determined by either: Positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen and negative HBV surface antibody, regardless of HBV core antibody status, at the screening visit Positive HBV core antibody and negative HBV surface antibody, regardless of HBV surface antigen status, at the screening visit Active tuberculosis infection Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
