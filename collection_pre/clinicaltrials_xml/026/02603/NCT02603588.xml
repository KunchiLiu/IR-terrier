	<brief_summary>Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG)-acupuncture has been shown to exhibit distinct effects in treatment of nasal inflammatory disease, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. Investigators aimed to assess the effects of SPG acupuncture for nasal ventilation function and autonomic nervous system in health volunteers. The randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial enrolled healthy volunteers.Healthy subjects were randomly assigned to either active SPG-acupuncture group or sham-acupuncture group. All subjects were assessed for self-reported nasal ventilation, nasal patency (nasal airway resistance (NAR) and nasal cavity volume (NVC)), exhaled nasal nitric oxide (nNO) before and after acupuncture. Meanwhile, in order to explore underlying mechanisms of SPG acupuncture, the changes in neuropeptides (substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY)) in nasal secretions were investigated at baseline, 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours after acupuncture.</brief_summary>
