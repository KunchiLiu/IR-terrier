	<brief_title>Adductor Canal Catheter vs Local Infiltration of Analgesia for Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing two methods of postoperative analgesia following primary TKA. Eligible primary TKA patients must be ASA I - III and require less than 20 mg oxycodone daily (or its equivalent). Exclusion criteria are: allergy to anesthetics, contraindication to regional anesthesia, sensory/ motor disorder involving operative limb, non-english speaking, ASA IV or greater, psychiatric or cognitive disorders, incarceration, renal insufficiency with Cr &gt; 2.0 and hepatic failure. When patients agree to participate in the study the following data will be collected by the research staff: ASA physical status, age, height, weight, gender, quantitative opiate use, numeric pain score with visual descriptors, painDETECT score, WOMAC score and baseline Pain Management Questionnaire. When designated through randomization, local infiltration of analgesia will be placed intraoperatively by the surgeons, per usual protocol and patients in the LIA group will receive sham adductor canal catheter. All ACC's for both study groups will be placed postoperatively in the PACU. Those collecting data will be blinded from identifying patients in the control group, as both groups will have ACC placed with same technique. Potential risks for each procedure, which will be explained to the patient, include: bleeding, local infection, local anesthetic toxicity in the form of seizure and cardiac arrest and neuropathy. The preceding are commonly listed though infrequent complications of both procedures. Continuous ultrasound will guide the placement of the ACC. All adductor canal catheters will remain in for 72 hours. Pt from LIA group will be discharged home with sham catheter with a saline infusion at 10 ml/hr via an ambulatory pump. Patients in ACC group will be discharged with continuous adductor canal catheter delivering ropivacaine 0.2% at 10 ml/hr via an ambulatory pump. Patients will be called daily for pain diary results. As well as at 6-8 weeks postoperatively to collect painDetect and WOMAC survey.</detailed_description>
