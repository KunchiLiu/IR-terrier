	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of single doses of LY3154207 on the amount of time it takes for healthy sleep-deprived men to fall asleep. The study will also estimate how much LY3154207 gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to remove it. Information about any side effects that occur will be collected. Each participant will complete four study periods, which will last a total of about 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
