	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of switching from a regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) and abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or a fixed dose combination (FDC) of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (ABC/DTG/3TC) to a FDC of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) versus continuing DTG and ABC/3TC as the FDC ABC/DTG/3TC in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adults.</brief_summary>
