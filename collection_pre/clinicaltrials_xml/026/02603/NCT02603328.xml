	<brief_summary>The study aims to demonstrate that extended course atorvastatin therapy reduces lesional iron deposition without increasing the risk of rebleeding (acute hemorrhage) in patients with cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM). Subjects will be randomized to daily atorvastatin (20,40 or 80mg PO) or placebo and followed for 36 months, or until a clinically overt CCM hemorrhage or attrition from drug related adverse events. Subjects will undergo a total of four MRI scans with biomarker studies, and serial clinical assessments.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a prospective phase I/II randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded, single-site clinical trial. Sixty CCM subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive either atorvastatin (40 mg PO) or placebo, All subjects will undergo baseline and three interval MRI studies at 6, 18 and 36 months throughout the three-year study period. Systematic dose escalation regime will be followed based on lesional and brain vascular permeability assessed by dynamic contrast enhanced quantitative perfusion (DCEQP). At the six month MRI scan, subjects with &gt; 30% reduction in either lesional or brain permeability will be continued on the same dose. If neither lesional or background brain permeability exhibit &gt;30% reduction, the dose will be escalated to 80 mg in the absence of any side effects. Enrolled subjects and investigators assessing dose related DCEQP and iron deposition in lesions by Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) will be blinded to treatment group allocation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of CCM of any genotype supported by relevant imaging studies. 2. Symptomatic CCM bleeding event within 2 years prior to enrollment. 3. Must be willing/able to travel to the study site for all study visits (baseline, 6 months, 18 months and 36 months) over the course of the study period. 1. Premenopausal women who are breastfeeding, pregnant or likely to get pregnant during the study period. 2. Previous cranial irradiation. 3. Failure to pass MRI safety screening (claustrophobia, metal implant . . . etc) 4. Known allergy or intolerance to gadolinium. 5. Severely impaired renal function (eGFR &lt; 60ml/min), active renal disease or status postkidney transplants. 6. Statin therapy, for any indication, within 12 months preceding enrollment. 7. Indication to use statin medication for current approved indication, unrelated to CCM 8. Known allergy or intolerance to statins 9. Liver dysfunction or active liver disease (including chronic viral hepatitis) defined as baseline serum transaminases levels twice the upper range of normal. 10. Previous diagnosis of skeletal muscle disorders of any cause (myopathy), or baseline creatine kinase level five times the upper range of normal. 11. Currently treated with or likely to need treatment with one or more of prohibited medications listed in section 5.3. 12. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. 13. Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization) until subject either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the site investigator, for at least 30 days prior to study entry. 14. Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated, including conditions resulting in or precipitating myopathy (e.g. HIV, uncontrolled hypothyroidism). 15. In the investigator's opinion, the patient is unstable, and would benefit from a specific intervention rather than treatment with atorvastatin. 16. Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give written informed consent. 17. No documentation of valid healthcare insurance. 18. No medical record confirmation of primary care physician.</criteria>
