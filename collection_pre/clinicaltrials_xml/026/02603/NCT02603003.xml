	<brief_summary>Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with lung cancer, and circulating tumor cells(CTCs) play a key role in the process of distant metastasis. The investigators' study will elaborate the clinical significance of CTCs intervented by Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) in lung cancer from the diagnosis and clinical staging,metastasis and recurrence, individual treatment and prognosis and so on, in order to provide a new direction for the treatment of lung cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with lung cancer, and circulating tumor cells play a key role in the process of distant metastasis.In recent years, research results have shown that CTCs may become a emerging marker and new target in the treatment of lung cancer. The investigators' study will elaborate the clinical significance of CTCs intervented by TCM in lung cancer from the diagnosis and clinical staging,metastasis and recurrence, individual treatment and prognosis and so on, in order to provide a new direction for the treatment of lung cancer.</detailed_description>
