	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate SPI-1005 in Adults With Meniere's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic study of oral SPI-1005 in adults with Meniere's disease. All subjects will undergo baseline audiometric testing and have their severity of sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo determined before the start of a 21-day course of treatment with SPI-1005 or placebo. During treatment with SPI-1005, and 7 days and 28 days following the cessation of SPI-1005, subjects will have their hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo assessed. Additional testing including electrocochleography will be performed at baseline, at the end of SPI-1005 treatment, and 28 days after the SPI-1005 treatment has stopped. Six outpatient visits will be performed over a 7-week period.</detailed_description>
