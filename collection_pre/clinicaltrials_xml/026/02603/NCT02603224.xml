	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug, MRG-201, in healthy volunteers. MRG-201 is designed to mimic the activity of a molecule called miR-29 that decreases the expression of collagen and other proteins that are involved in scar formation. MRG-201 is being studied to determine if it can limit the formation of fibrous scar tissue in certain diseases. MRG-201 will be tested in healthy volunteers by injection into intact skin or adjacent to a short skin incision. Volunteers may receive one or several doses of MRG-201, and will be monitored for local reactions in the skin, signs or symptoms of adverse effects on the body, and for the levels of MRG-201 in the blood over time. Skin biopsies will also be collected to study how cells in the skin respond when exposed to MRG-201.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Study of MRG-201 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: Cohorts of 3-6 healthy male volunteers, ages 18-45, will receive single or multiple ascending doses of MRG-201 by intradermal injection at one site and placebo at a second site over a period of up to 15 days, with follow-up for up to 28 days after the last dose to determine the maximum tolerated dose in intact or incised normal skin and the tendency for active drug to diffuse through the skin.</detailed_description>
