	<brief_summary>GSK3039294 has been developed in order to offer an orally available alternative to parenteral CPHPC (GSK2315698 [metabolite of GSK3039294]) for plasma serum amyloid P component (SAP) depletion prior to use of anti SAP monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the treatment of systemic amyloidosis. This phase 1 study is intended to study safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of GSK3039294 in humans. This study consists of three parts. Part A will evaluate safety and tolerability of single doses of GSK3039294 in healthy subjects, Part B will evaluate safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3039294 in healthy subjects, and Part C will evaluate safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3039294 in subjects with systemic amyloidosis. Part A is a single dose, open label, dose escalation study. Two cohorts of subjects will be enrolled to provide data from 6 subjects per cohort and up to 4 different doses (2 dose levels per cohort) of GSK3039294 will be tested. For Cohorts 1 and 2, each subject may take part in two dosing periods. Part B is repeat dose, open label, dose escalation study. Sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 3a to ensure 6 completers (Cohort 3b will be conducted if required) and GSK3039294 will be administered repeatedly for a total of 21 days. Each subject will take part in a single study period. In Part C a single dose level of GSK3039294 will be tested for 21 days repeat dose, in 12 subjects with systemic amyloidosis. Each subject will take part in a single study period. The total duration for Part A is approximately 8 weeks, Part B is approximately 8-9 weeks, and Part C is approximately 13 weeks.</brief_summary>

Male or female Female subjects are eligible to participate if they are of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 month of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milliinternational units (MIU)/milliliter (mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms (pg)/mL (147 picomoles [pmol]/liter [L]) is confirmatory Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with one of the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until completion of the followup visit: (a.) Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia; (b.) Male condom plus partner use of one of the following contraceptive options: Contraceptive subdermal implant that meets the effectiveness criteria of a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label, Oral Contraceptive either combined or progestogen alone, Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring, Percutaneous contraceptive patches, Occlusive cap (female diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) with a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, cream or suppository). These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in the protocol. Additional Inclusion Criteria Healthy Volunteers: Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. Additional Inclusion Criteria Healthy Volunteers: A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor if required agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Additional Inclusion Criteria Healthy Volunteers: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%) Additional Inclusion Criteria Patients: Subject medically diagnosed with systemic amyloidosis Additional Inclusion Criteria Patients: serum amyloid P component (SAP) scan identifying amyloid at any anatomical site, including subset of patients with moderatelarge amyloid load in the liver Additional Inclusion Criteria Patients: Up to and including New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 with a stable clinical cardiac status 12 weeks prior to screening Additional Inclusion Criteria Patients: For Amyloid Lightchain (AL) amyloidosis patients, &gt;=12 months postchemotherapy with a stable free light chain (FLC) ratio in the preceding 4 months Additional Inclusion Criteria Patients: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &gt;50 mL/minute Additional Inclusion Criteria Patients: Alanine amino transferase (ALT) &lt;=3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin &lt;=1.5x ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 xULN is acceptable if bilirubin was fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%), irrespective of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level Additional Inclusion Criteria Patients: Subject is ambulant and capable of attending the clinical unit Prohibited medication History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: For United Kingdom (UK )sites healthy volunteers: an average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females.
