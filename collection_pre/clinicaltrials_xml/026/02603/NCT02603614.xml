	<brief_summary>CNDP-578-02 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, crossover design trial. Eight evaluable subjects (n=8) with chronic stable heart failure and moderate renal impairment will be randomized (1:1) to receive cenderitide or placebo. Enrolled subjects will begin with Infusion Period A where they will receive up to 7 days of continuous, subcutaneous, dose-escalating infusions of cenderitide or placebo via the Insulet Drug Delivery System. Enrolled subjects will then cross over into Infusion Period B where they will receive up to 7 days of continuous, subcutaneous, dose-escalating infusions of cenderitide or placebo.</brief_summary>
