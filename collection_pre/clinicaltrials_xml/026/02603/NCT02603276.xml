	<brief_summary>A large body of evidence confirm the cholesterol lowering effect of phytosterols and red yeast rice. Because their mechanisms of action mime the ones of chemical statins and cholesterol absorption inhibitors, it is plausible that their association will provide a more relevant (and safe) LDL cholesterolemia reduction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lipid-lowering Effect of Phytosterols, Red Yeast Rice and Their Combination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large body of literature suggest that the patients are strongly interested in self-medicating them with "natural" products aimed at reducing their plasma level of LDL-cholesterol. Plant sterols and red yeast rice are among the most widely marketed product with these properties in Western countries. However plant sterols per se have a limited effect on cholesterolemia, while full dosed red yeast rice can induce myalgias and myopathies as statins do. In this context, the aim of the investigators' study was to evaluate if the association of both products at low dosage could induce an additive or synergistic effect in term of LDL-reduction in humans.</detailed_description>
