	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the COMFORT (C-Communication, O-Orientation and opportunity, M-Mindful presence, F-Family, O-Openings, R-Relating, and T-Team) caregiver intervention in improving communication and reducing distress in caregivers of patients with lung cancer. Caregivers of patients with cancer may experience stress and anxiety due to difficulty communicating with family, friends, and healthcare providers, or feeling unable to communicate openly. A communication intervention that improves the caregiver's ability to communicate with patients and healthcare providers may help reduce caregivers' psychological distress and improve the health outcomes of patients.</brief_summary>

To explore common family caregiver communication concerns in oncology and their impact. III. Estimate the effects of the CCI on family caregivers' psychological distress (primary outcome) and caregiver confidence with communication (secondary outcome). OUTLINE: Participants receive the printed communication tool "A Communication Guide for Caregivers," a guide developed from the COMFORT communication curriculum, a national training program for palliative care communication. After a 1 week period to review the material, participants undergo communication coaching with a research nurse by phone over approximately 1 hour. After completion of the study, caregivers are followed up at 1 month to complete questionnaires and rate their satisfaction with the intervention.</detailed_description>
