	<brief_summary>Previous research has identified spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leakage as a cause for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, leading to positional headache patterns. Typical magnetic resonance imaging findings include subdural fluid collections, enhancement of pachymenginges, engorgement of venous structures, pituitary hyperemia, and sagging of the brain (SEEPS). Because pituitary hyperemia has been documented in cases of spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leakage and is known to mimic a pituitary tumor or hyperplasia, the investigators would like to like to assess the clinical manifestations and neuroimaging abnormalities of SIH patients with regard to the pituitary gland. Specifically, the investigators are looking to analyze the compression of the pituitary stalk and conduct a systemic evaluation of pituitary function in SIH patients.</brief_summary>
