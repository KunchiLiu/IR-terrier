Hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the last 6 months before screening visit. Hypoglycemic unawareness as judged by the Investigator in the last 6 months before the screening visit. History of severe hypoglycemia requiring treatment by emergency room admission or hospitalization in the last 6 months before screening visit. Any clinically significant abnormality identified on physical examination, laboratory tests, or vital signs at the time of screening that in the judgment of the investigator or any sub investigator would preclude safe completion of the study. Known history of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to the time of screening. Use of investigational drug(s) within 3 months or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to the screening visit. Patients who had previously received SAR342434 in any other clinical trial. Pregnancy and lactation: Women of child bearing potential (WOCPB) (premenopausal, not surgically sterile for at least 3 months prior to the time of screening) not using highly effective (ie, with low failure rate &lt;1% per year) method(s) of birth control throughout the study and/or unwilling to be tested for pregnancy. Any contraindication to the use of Humalog as defined in the national product labels; history of hypersensitivity to Humalog or to any of the excipients.
