	<brief_title>AIH-induced Walking Recovery After Subacute SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the study is to determine whether repeatedly breathing low oxygen levels for brief periods (termed acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH)) improves recovery of walking after spinal cord injury. This idea stems from animal studies on respiration, in which investigators showed that mild AIH improves breathing in rats with spinal injuries. These studies showed that AIH induces plasticity, strengthening neural connections by increasing the production of key proteins and improving the sensitivity of spinal cord circuitry. The ultimate goal of this research is to assess the potential of mild AIH as a therapeutic approach not only in persons with chronic spinal cord injury but also in persons with subacute injury. By applying AIH during early stages of recovery, the investigators hope to expand the potential benefits of AIH to broader range of persons with spinal injury, thereby improving functional independence and quality of life for servicemen and civilians.</detailed_description>
