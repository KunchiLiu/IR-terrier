	<brief_summary>Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) develop because of the interaction of predisposing factors like neuropathy, angiopathy and infection. Likewise, environmental factors like lesion hygiene, diet and life style. DFU results as a complication in diabetic patients and it is the most common cause of non-traumatic foot amputation in people older than 50 years. Foot amputation decreases patients´ quality of life since only 33% of them will continue walking with the use of a prothesis. However, 30% of patients subjected to amputation will die in the first year after surgery and by the 5th year, post-surgery 50% of them will need the amputation of the remaining body extremity. According to the World Foundation for Diabetes, in Latin America there are 18 million people with Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2). This number will increase in the next 20 years to 30 million. Medical expenses for diabetic patients are calculated to be around 8,000 million dollars, annually. In Mexico, according to the Mexican Federation for Diabetes there are 6.5-10 millions of diabetic patients. Amputation due to DFU complications has many social and economic implications. In Mexico in 2011 diabetes mellitus complications were the principal cause of death in the institute of mexican social security (IMSS) population. On the other hand, 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1h)-pyridone (PFD) is considered an anti-inflammatory drug that promotes re-epithelization due to fibroblast stimulation, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis during tissue remodeling. According to this, the investigators believe that PFD could play an important role in DFU resolution and for this reason, the investigators consider necessary to analyze the efficacy of 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1h)-pyridone for the treatment of DFU since it has showed improvement in chronic skin ulcers in pilot studies. Nowadays, DFU treatment includes management of metabolism, angiopathy and neuropathy along with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. However, several reports indicate it is insufficient for and adequate control of diabetic patients. Then, it is important to develop efficient therapies for the treatment of DFU. In this context, Ketanserin (Sufrexal™) is a drug to induce scar formation. It has been demonstrated to decrease peripheral vascular resistance, platelet aggregation and improves hemorheologic parameters. Topical administration of ketanserin has showed beneficial effects in inflammation, granulation and epithelization. Since these two drugs have showed beneficial effects in tissue regeneration, the investigators believe it is important to compare their safety and efficacy for the treatment of DFU</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pirfenidone Plus MODD in Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized using a random number table to distribute in the control (ketanserin) and the experimental group (PFD+MODD). Demographics data and medical history will be registered on a monthly basis, relative ulcer volume will be calculated by measuring the longest, widest and deepest ulcer side with sterile flexible graduated ruler. The ulcer will be classified according to Wagner scale and photographs will be taken. Ulcer area will be washed with aseptic solution (accua aseptic solution™) and a biopsy of around 10-15 mm3 will be taken from the middle of the ulcer using a scalpel blade. Patients in the experimental group will receive topical PFD+MODD (8% gel) three times a day and patients in control group will receive ketanserin (2% cream) twice a day. Both groups will apply the medicament for six months previous cleansing of the area. Biopsies will be taken at the beginning, at month one and month two. After this time, only photographs will be performed, and relative ulcer volume will be measured. 5 ml of blood will be taken at the beginning and the end of the study to measure general clinical parameters.</detailed_description>
