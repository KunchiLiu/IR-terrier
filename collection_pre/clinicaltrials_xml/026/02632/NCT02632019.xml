	<brief_summary>Objectives: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and prognosis of dendritic cell-precision T cell for neo-antigen in the treatment of advanced biliary tract malignant tumor. Methods: This study designs a novel therapy using dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells. 40 patients will be enrolled. They are randomly divided into gemcitabine group and dendritic cell-precision T cell for neo-antigen combined with gemcitabine group. Gemcitabine treatments will be performed once a week with a total of six times. Dendritic cell-precision T cell for neo-antigen combined with gemcitabine treatment: Gemcitabine: once a week with a total of six times before 60 days prior to the start of drawing blood. Dendritic cell-precision T cell for neo-antigen: once per 3 weeks with a total of three periods. The mail clinical indicators are Progression-Free-Survival and Overall Survival.</brief_summary>
