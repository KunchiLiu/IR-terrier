	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to acquire preliminary, pilot data over a 1-year period on the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous denosumab versus the current CHEO standard-of-care (intravenous zoledronic acid) for the treatment of osteoporosis in children. Both denosumab (1.0mg/kg) and zoledronic acid (0.025mg/kg) will be given as two doses separated by a six month interval (i.e. at baseline and 6 months), with follow-up to 1 year.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject or subject's legally acceptable representative has provided informed consent. 2. Children aged 4 to 16 years at the time of enrolment. 3. Children with a history of clinically significant bone fragility in the preceding 24 months, requiring the child to have ONE or more of the following clinical profiles: 1. At least one lowtrauma vertebral or long bone fracture in a child with an underlying disease known to be associated with osteoporotic fractures (e.g. glucocorticoidtreated diseases, Crohn's disease, rheumatic disorders, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, other muscular dystrophies, spinal muscular atrophy, cerebral palsy); OR 2. At least one lowtrauma vertebral or long bone fracture in the last 24 months, in a child with a known genetic osteoporotic condition such as osteogenesis imperfecta (confirmed on molecular genetic testing); OR 3. At least one lowtrauma vertebral or long bone fracture in the last 24 months, in an otherwise healthy child with a diagnosis of osteoporosis confirmed on transiliac bone biopsy. Transiliac bone biopsy is a requirement in this subgroup as per the usual standard of care, as this is the only test that will definitively confirm osteoporosis in an otherwise healthy child who does not have a genetic bone fragility condition. 1. Any child for whom the treating physician feels participation is not advised. 2. Prior treatment with an osteoporosis agent (e.g. bisphosphonate). 3. Renal insufficiency defined as an eGFR less than 60ml/min/1.73m2. 4. Active or prior diagnosis of malignancy or undergoing investigations for a suspected childhood cancer. 5. Currently breastfeeding or plans to breastfeed during the study. 6. Pregnancy (verified by pretreatment pregnancy test in all menstruating or sexually active females). 7. Untreated vitamin D deficiency, defined as a serum 25OHD level &lt;50nmol/L. 8. Untreated hypocalcemia, defined as a serum ionized calcium level &lt;1.1mmol/L. 9. Active or historic eczema/cellulitis. 10. Children planning dental procedures and/or dental surgery during the course of the study. 11. Children with a documented history of atrial fibrillation. 12. Children with asthma who are acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) sensitive. 13. Children that have had parathyroid or thyroid surgery. 14. Children who are allergic to rubber or latex. 15. Males with a pregnant partner.</criteria>
