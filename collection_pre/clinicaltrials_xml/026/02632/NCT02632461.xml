	<detailed_description>This study will last approximately 6 months. Participants will attend one 1-hour orientation meeting at the beginning of the study and a 2-hour baseline assessment and training meeting. Additional assessments will be conducted at 3 months and 6 months. Weekly questionnaires will be administered. Everyone in the study will be asked to listen to 2 podcasts per week. Each of the podcasts will take about 15 - 20 minutes to listen to and so participants should expect to spend 30 - 40 minutes each week listening to podcasts. Participants will also be randomized to either track diet with an app on their smartphone or using a device they wear on their wrist. Each week, participants will be sent an email as a reminder on how to use their diet tracking device. They will also be encouraged to monitor their exercise and body weight.</detailed_description>
