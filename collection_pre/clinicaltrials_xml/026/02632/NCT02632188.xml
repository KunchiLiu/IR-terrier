	<brief_summary>Objectives: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radical surgery combined with dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells in reducing the recurrence and metastasis of liver cancer Methods: This study designs a novel therapy using dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells. 60 postoperative patients of hepatocellular carcinoma will be enrolled. They are randomly divided into postoperative routine therapy group and dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells combined with postoperative routine therapy group. Dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells treatments will be performed every 3 weeks with a total of three periods. The mail clinical indicators are Progression-Free-Survival and Overall Survival.</brief_summary>
