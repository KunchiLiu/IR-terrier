	<brief_summary>Objectives: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PIK-HER2 cells in the treatment of advanced Her2 high expressed gastric cancer with liver metastasis patients. Methods: This study designs a novel therapy using PIK-HER2 cells. 40 Her2 positive patients with liver metastasis from gastric cancer will be enrolled. They are randomly divided into dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells (DC-PMAT) group and PIK-HER2 cells group. Both DC-PMAT treatment and PIK-HER2 cells treatment will be performed every 3 weeks with a total of three periods. The mail clinical indicators are Progression-Free-Survival and Overall Survival.</brief_summary>
