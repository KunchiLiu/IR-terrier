	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to measure the association between extracellular RNA (ex-RNA) levels in plasma in patients receiving aggressive outpatient therapy for CHF with (1) cardiac remodeling and (2) cardiovascular events. The investigators will follow patients during standard medical therapy for CHF to assess changes in ex-RNA levels in the plasma, and how these are associated with cardiac remodeling (by cardiac imaging) and outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plasma ExtrAcellular RNAs and Biomarkers of Heart FaiLure During Decongestion: PEARL-HF Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly 5 million people in the United States have congestive heart failure (CHF). Although medical therapy such as beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone antagonists has improved prognosis, the overall rate of hospital admissions has continued to rise in the last decade and the mortality for patients with symptomatic heart failure remains worse than the majority of cancers in this country. Accordingly, significant opportunities exist for the improvement in outcomes of patients with CHF, both from a morbidity and mortality standpoint. Such opportunities may lie in the outpatient medical management of patients with CHF. In this study, the primary objective is to measure the association between extracellular RNA (ex-RNA) levels in plasma in patients receiving aggressive outpatient therapy for CHF with (1) cardiac remodeling and (2) cardiovascular events. The investigators will follow patients during standard medical therapy for CHF to assess changes in ex-RNA levels in the plasma, and how these are associated with cardiac remodeling (by cardiac imaging) and outcomes.</detailed_description>
