	<brief_summary>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent infection occurring in patients who are admitted to the ICU. The accumulation of respiratory secretions in the subglottic space is a well-proven cause of VAP. Investigators invented a manual method with high-flow air produced by resuscitator to impinge secretion from the subglottic space to oral cavity. Investigators want to compare it with conventional method which uses a special intubation tube with an independent dorsal lumen to suction subglottic secretion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent infection occurring in patients who are admitted to the ICU. The accumulation of respiratory secretions in the subglottic space is a well-proven cause of VAP. Therefore, prevention should include the aspiration of secretions from the subglottic space. Investigators invented a manual method with high-flow air produced by resuscitator to impinge secretion from the subglottic space to oral cavity. This method has been granted as a patent by Chinese national intellectual property patent office, it has been used in investigators' daily work for more than 10 years and more than 20 Chinese ICUs have used it everyday. Investigators want to compare it with conventional method which uses a special intubation tube with an independent dorsal lumen to suction subglottic secretion.</detailed_description>
