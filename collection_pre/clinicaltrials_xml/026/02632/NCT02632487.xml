	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of combining a traditional, structured exercise intervention with an innovative intervention designed to decrease sedentary behavior and increase non-exercise physical activity (NEPA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wearable Technology to Reduce Sedentary Behavior and CVD Risk in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recruitment of 40 sedentary men and women â‰¥ 60 years of age with elevated cardiovascular risk and follow them for 20 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned (n = 20/group) to 1) an 8-week, twice-weekly, multi-modal, center-based exercise intervention (EX) followed by 12 additional weeks of follow-up assessment, or 2) the same intervention with participants also asked to wear a validated lightweight activity tracker on their hip during waking hours and instructed on how to reduce sedentary behavior increase NEPA within their daily routines (EX + NEPA). Evaluations will be done to 1) the extent to which EX + NEPA modifies sedentary behavior, 2) the impact of the interventions on cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, exercise capacity, waist circumference, and circulating biomarkers, and 3) develop and optimize study procedures to guide the future trial.</detailed_description>
