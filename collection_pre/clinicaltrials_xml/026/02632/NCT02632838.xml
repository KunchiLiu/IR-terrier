	<brief_summary>Monitoring and self-management are important components of effective chronic disease care and improved patient outcomes. With the rapid development of integration of mobile health technology (mHealth) into health care delivery services, mHealth intervention provides a great opportunity to improve the efficiency of chronic disease management. However, little is known about whether mHealth interventions can effectively impact the health and health care outcomes in underserved populations. This pilot study will assess the preliminary effectiveness of a mobile-based health intervention in an urban underserved community with a high incidence of hypertension. It is hypothesized that patients with hypertension will experience improved outcomes due to the use of a mHealth application compared with patients who are not using the application. The findings from this study will advance our understanding of the utility of mHealth interventions among underserved populations and generate evidence to support this new health care delivery approach in underserved urban communities. In this study, three hypotheses will be tested: 1. Hypertension patients using the mHealth application exhibit a greater decrease in blood pressure and better maintenance over a 6-month period compared to those who receive standard care. 2. Hypertension patients using the mHealth application will exhibit more effective self-management as compared to those who receive standard care. 3. Utilizing the mHealth application helps nurses to monitor hypertension status more effectively than monitoring hypertension status without the mHealth application.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A mixed study design will be utilized. This study will have two steps, implementation and evaluation. In implementation, a pilot version of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be utilized to examine BP decline and BP maintenance with 30 participants assigned either to standard care and treatment (the standard follow-up group) or to the standard care plus mHealth (the mHealth group). In evaluation, improved quality of life, patient self‐efficacy, greater treatment adherence, reduced hospital utilization, and health providers' feedback will be assessed through surveys and a group interview. Step 1: Implementation A pilot version of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be utilized to examine hypothesis 1. A parallel-group 6-month study design will be utilized, in which 30 participants will be randomly assigned either to the standard follow-up group or the mHealth group. Jordan &amp; Harris Community Health Center's (J&amp;HCHC) nurse will help to identify and random selected patients, nurses will not be blinded in this study, each nurse will keep monitoring their patients from both groups. Based on the J&amp;HCHC's current practice, all hypotension patients are required to visit the nurses for their regular hypertension care every week. Therefore, all participants in this study will be asked to visit J&amp;HCHC once a week for the 6-month period as usual. The standard follow-up group will receive regular hypertension care as usual which consists: nursing assessment, medication management, patient education, follow up and continuing care. Home monitoring is a great way to help detect and monitor high blood pressure. The mHealth group will ask to use iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor on a daily basis at HOME and also will be asked to visit J&amp;HCHC once a week to receive the regular hypertension care for the 6-month period as usual. After all participants complete their 6-month study, the study data will be collected from Electronic Health Record (McKesson) and patient's mobile devices. In this study, a FDA 510K approved device, iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor (iHealth Lab Inc.), will be utilized for the mHealth group. This is a fully automatic wrist cuff blood pressure monitor that uses the oscillometric principle to measure blood pressure and pulse rate. The monitor works with mobile devices to test, track and share vital blood pressure data. There are no physical risks associated with using this device to take the blood pressure at home. Besides the FDA 510K approval, iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor has also CE medical certification (Europe) and ESH Certification (European Society of Hypertension). iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor works with both Apple and Android devices. Apple iOS devices requires iOS version 5.0 or higher and Android devices requires operating system 3.0 or later. iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor can maintain a maximum of 10,000 measurements or three years of usage. In addition, iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor has a Bluetooth sync system that will pair with both Apple and Android devices. The synchronization allows the monitor to send systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rate to patients' mobile devices. The free iHealth MyVitals app then automatically keeps a history of BP data and gives patient the option to share their blood pressure data information with their healthcare provider. In addition to keep the data on the mobile device, patient also receive a free and secure cloud account. Vital data on the cloud allows patients to access from any computer and to share readings with their healthcare provider, if they choose to do so. With this type of information available, patients will be able to do self-management and nurses will be able to actively provide intervention activities. Conceptual diagram for iHealth BP-7 Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor device, apps and cloud sever are presented in research protocol Step 2: Evaluation The outcome evaluation for this study will be immediately started when the 6-month implementation step completed. The evaluation will be conducted from both patients and nurses. During this evaluation step, Hypothesis 2 and 3 will be tested. For hypothesis 2 improved quality of life, patient self‐efficacy, greater treatment adherence, and reduced hospital utilization will be evaluated by the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF‐36) and Medication Adherence Self‐Efficacy Scale (MASES). All participate patients will be asked to complete these two surveys; the completion of two surveys will be approximately 10- 15 minutes. For hypothesis 3, hypertension status monitoring experiences and feedbacks from health provider will be assessed by administering a group interview to five community nurses. This group interview also will be immediately conducted when the implementation step completed. This group interview will be approximately 90 minutes. Study principal investigator or co-principal investigator will lead this group interview. A group interview guide will be used to guide the process, and the entire interview will be audiotaped by digital recorder, and transcribed.</detailed_description>
