	<criteria>1. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures 2. Healthy male subjects aged 18 50 years, inclusive, with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venepuncture 3. Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive 4. Provision of signed, written and dated informed consent for optional genetic research 1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study 2. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease, or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs 3. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of the administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP) 4. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, haematology, or urinalysis results at screening and checkin, as judged by the investigator, including: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN); Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; ULN; Bilirubin (total) &gt; ULN; and Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) &gt; ULN 5. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 6. Suspicion or known Gilbert's syndrome 7. Abnormal vital signs, after 10 minutes supine rest, at screening and checkin, defined as any of the following: Systolic blood pressure(BP) (SBP) &lt; 90mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg; Diastolic BP (DBP) &lt; 50mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg; and Pulse &lt; 45 or &gt; 85 beats per minute (bpm) 8. Any clinically significant abnormalities (at screening and checkin) in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the resting ECG and any clinically significant abnormalities in the 12lead ECG, as considered by the investigator that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes, including abnormal STTwave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular hypertrophy 9. Prolonged QTcF (QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula) &gt; 450 ms or shortened QTcF &lt; 340 ms or family history of long QT syndrome, at screening and checkin 10. PR(PQ) interval (ECG interval measured from the onset of the P wave to the onset of the QRS complex) shortening &lt; 120 ms (PR &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 120 ms is acceptable if there is no evidence of ventricular preexcitation), at screening and checkin 11. PR (PQ) interval prolongation (&gt; 240 ms) intermittent second (Wenckebach block while asleep is not exclusive) or third degree AV block, or AV dissociation, at screening and checkin 12. Persistent or intermittent complete bundle branch block (BBB), incomplete bundle branch block (IBBB), or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) with QRS &gt; 110 ms. Subjects with QRS &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 115 ms are acceptable if there is no evidence of, for example, ventricular hypertrophy or preexcitation, at screening and checkin 13. Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judged by the investigator 14. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the 3 months prior to screening 15. Any history of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol, as judged by the investigator 16. Positive screen for drugs of abuse, alcohol or cotinine (nicotine) at screening or admission to the unit 17. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically significant allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD5718 18. Excessive intake of caffeine containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate), as judged by the investigator 19. Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP 20. Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed medication including antacids, analgesics (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of 20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to the administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long halflife 21. Plasma donation within 1 month of screening or any blood donation/blood loss &gt; 500 mL during the 3 months prior to screening 22. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been approved for marketing) within 3 months of the administration of IMP in this study. The period of exclusion is 3 months after the final dose from a previous study 23. Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship, trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order 24. Involvement of any AstraZeneca, PAREXEL or study site employee or their close relatives 25. Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements 26. Subjects who are vegans or have medical dietary restrictions 27. Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator In addition, any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the genetic research: 28. Previous bone marrow transplant 29. Nonleukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of the date of the genetic sample collection</criteria>
