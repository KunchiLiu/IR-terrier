	<brief_summary>Study Design: Longitudinal Experimental Study Objective: Analyze the relationship between Upper Limb Neural Tension Test (ULNTT1) and cervico-thoracic spine biomechanics using a new motion-capture spine movement data analyzing model based on Least Square Approximation. Summary of Background Data: ULNTT1 is a test able to determine cervical nerve roots and brachial plexus displacement within their interface structures. No studies were conducted about ULNTT1 and cervico-thoracic spine motion patterns relationship. Methods: 12 subjects with ULNTT1 asymmetry &gt; 10° (AS group) and 11 subjects with ULNTT1 symmetry (S group) at clinical tests will be enrolled for the study. Subjects will be analyzed for ULNTT1 with an electrogoniometer using two parameters, one operator and one patient-dependent. Fine lateral bending cervico-thoracic spine motion patterns will be collected with motion-capturing technique and data will be analyzed with Least Square Approximation tools. Subjects with impairments in cervico-thoracic spine mobility will undergo to correction of those with spinal manipulative therapy. ULNTT1 and spine mobility will be so re-evaluated with same methods.</brief_summary>
