	<brief_summary>This study will compare two standard treatments in acute stable traumatic vertebral fractures (types A1 and A3.1 by Magerl Classification). The two treatments are as follows: 1. SpineJack® system 2. Conservative Orthopedic Management consisting of brace and pain medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SpineJack® Versus Conservative Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>100 subjects (18 to 60 years old) will be enrolled (1:1) with one to two painful traumatic fractures, non-pathological (types A1 and A3.1 by Magerl Classification). Subjects will be followed at admission, procedure, discharge, 1 month, 3 months, 12 months and 24 months post Vertebral Compression Fracture (VCF) reduction procedure or the set-up of the brace. The estimated enrollment period is 12 months and each patient should perform a 24 months follow-up period. Therefore, the total study duration is estimated to be 36 months for the complete study.</detailed_description>

Active systemic or local infection at baseline 6. Patient with substance abuse 7. History of intolerance or allergic reaction to titanium or acrylic compounds 8. Fracture geometry making the insertion of the implant impossible 9. Malignant lesions 10. Any other medical illness or condition that, in the investigator's opinion, is likely to impair longterm followup (e.g., cancer) or greatly increase the risk of surgery* 11. Patient on longterm steroid therapy (steroid dose ≥ 30 mg /day for &gt; 3 months) 12. Patient presenting with a noncorrectable spontaneous or therapeutic coagulation disorder. 13.
