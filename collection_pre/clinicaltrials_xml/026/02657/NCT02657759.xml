	<criteria>To be eligible to the study, male and female volunteers will have to fulfill the following criteria (assessment based on the medical examination performed at V0 with a checking at V1): Age between 18 and 65 years (limits included). BMI between 18,5 and 30 kg/m² (limits excluded). For women: Non menopausal with the same reliable contraception since at least three cycles before the beginning of the study and agreeing to keep it during the entire duration of the study (condom alone without spermicide gel excluded) or menopausal without or with hormone replacement therapy (oestrogenic replacement therapy begun from less than 3 month excluded).

Able and willing to participate to the study by complying with the protocol procedures as evidenced by his dated and signed informed consent form. Affiliated with a social security scheme. Agree to be registered on the volunteers in biomedical research file. After V0 biological analysis the subjects will be eligible to the study on the following criteria: Fasting blood LDLc level (Friedewald estimation method) between 1,3 and 2,2g/L (limits included with ± 2% tolerated around). A rescreening can occur from 2 months after the exit of study for failure to comply with the one or more of the eligibility criteria listed above. Volunteers with the following criteria will be considered as non eligible to the study (assessment based on the medical examination performed at V0 with a checking at V1): Suffering from a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, uncontrolled thyroidal trouble or other metabolic disorder. Suffering from a severe chronic disease (e.g. cancer, HIV, renal failure, hepatic or biliary disorders ongoing, chronic inflammatory digestive disease, arthritis or other chronic respiratory trouble, etc.) or gastrointestinal disorders found to be inconsistent with the conduct of the study by the investigator (e.g. celiac disease). With a history of ischemic cardiovascular event or, during the previous 6 months a surgical procedure.

Requiring a cholesterol lowering by immediate pharmacologic intervention according to the current recommendations (AFSSAPS 2005). Under lipidlowering treatment (e.g. statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, etc.) or stopped less than 4 months before the randomization. Under medication which could affect blood lipid parameters (e.g. longterm corticosteroid systemic drug, systemic antibodies, androgens or phenytoin, etc.) or stopped less than 1 month before the randomization (stable longterm treatment with beta blocker or thiazide diuretics tolerated). Regular intake of dietary supplements or "health foods" which are known to decrease LDLc or triglycerides (e.g. rich in plant stanol or sterol like PROACTIV or DANACOL products, red yeast rice, policosanol, capsules containing omega3 fatty acids from fish oils, etc.) or stopped less than 3 months before the randomization. Under treatment or dietary supplement which could significantly affect parameter(s) followed during the study according to the investigator or stopped in a too short period before the randomization. With significant change in food habits or in physical activity in the 3 months before randomization or not agreeing to keep them unchanged throughout the study. With reported body weight variation &gt; 5% in the 3 months prior the randomization or with a hyper or hypocaloric diet planned in the next 4 months. With a personal history of anorexia nervosa, bulimia or significant eating disorders according to the investigator.

Who made a blood donation in the 3 months before the randomization or intending to make it within 5 months ahead. Taking part in another clinical trial or being in the exclusion period of a previous clinical trial.

Under legal protection (guardianship, wardship) or deprived from his rights following administrative or judicial decision. Presenting a psychological or linguistic incapability to sign the informed consent. Impossible to contact in case of emergency. After V0 biological analysis the subjects will be considered as non eligible to the study on the following criteria: Fasting blood glucose level &gt; 1,26 g/L (6,99 mmol/L). Fasting blood triglycerides &gt; 3,5 g/L (3,95 mmol/L). Fasting blood TC &gt; 4,5 g/L or HDLc &lt; 0,1 g/L with an abnormality judged as clinically significant according to the investigator. Blood AST &gt; 1,68 µkat/L, ALT &gt; 1,70 µkat/L or GGT &gt; 2,55 µkat/L (values corresponding to 2,5xULN). Blood urea &gt; 12,11 mmol/L (value corresponding to 1,5xULN) or creatinine &gt; 125 µmol/L. Complete blood count with hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/L or leucocytes &lt; 3000 / mm3 or leucocytes &gt; 16000 /mm3 or clinically significant abnormality according to the investigator. A rescreening can occur from 2 months after the exit of study for failure to comply with the one or more of the eligibility criteria listed above.</criteria>
