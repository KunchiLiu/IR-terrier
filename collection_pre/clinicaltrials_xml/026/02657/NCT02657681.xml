	<brief_summary>This is a randomized sham-controlled double-blind study to test the hypothesis that transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) of the motor cortex improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease. Half of the patients will receive real tSMS treatment, the other half will receive sham treatment (placebo).</brief_summary>
