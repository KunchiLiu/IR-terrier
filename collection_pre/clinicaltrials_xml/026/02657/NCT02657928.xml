	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well ribociclib and letrozole work in treating patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, or endometrial cancer that has returned (come back) after a period of improvement. Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some enzymes needed for cell growth. Cancer cells that are estrogen receptor positive may need estrogen to grow. Letrozole lowers the amount of estrogen made by the body and this may stop the growth of tumor cells that need estrogen to grow. Giving ribociclib together with letrozole may be an effective treatment in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, or endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ribociclib and Letrozole in Treating Patients With Relapsed ER Positive Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Primary Peritoneal, or Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Demonstrate if the combination of letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) leads to a higher percentage of patients who are progression free at 12 weeks (PFS 12) as compared with that observed in prior studies with single agent letrozole. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Demonstrate if the combination of letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) leads to a higher cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) response rate in patients with relapsed ER positive ovarian cancers and endometrial cancers as compared to that observed in previously reported single agent letrozole studies. II. Median progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), the confirmed response rate, and adverse events. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Identify molecular biomarkers associated with a response to treatment with letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) (in patients with relapsed ovarian carcinomas and endometrial cancers). II. Develop patient derived xenograft (PDX) avatars on tumors from participants for possible future translational study evaluating a potential correlation between responses in the PDX model to patients' responses. OUTLINE: Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) daily and letrozole PO daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
