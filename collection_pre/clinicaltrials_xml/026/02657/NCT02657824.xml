	<brief_summary>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a parameter that should be evaluated rapidly to the patients, admitted to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The investigators aimed to investigate correlation between LVEF and 4 different mitral valve movements which alternate to the classical LVEF assessing methods and evaluate these methods can be used or not in the emergency department.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid and Easy Evaluation of Cardiac Systolic Function by Means of Mitral Valve Movements in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective observational study was conducted in an acutely dyspneic patients with receiving echocardiagraphy by the chief physicians. Measurements were performed before echocardiography lab by the physician who conducted the survey in the emergency department. In parasternal long axis view mitral valve E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS) M-Mod measurements and mitral valve anterior leaflet and septal distance (P-ALSS) B-Mod measurements and in apical four chamber view mitral valve anterior leaflet and septal distance (A-ALSS) B-Mod measurements and distance between mitral valve anterior and posterior leaflets (MVLS) B-Mod measurements were acquired as the minimum distance in diastole. LVEF of patients were measured by cardiologist. Correlation of the all values between LVEF and sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood probabilities were calculated.</detailed_description>
