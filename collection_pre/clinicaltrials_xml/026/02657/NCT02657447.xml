	<brief_summary>This study is a phase I, open label, randomized study to assess pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of 177Lu-DOTA-HH1 (Betalutin®) radioimmunotherapy in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The study will also investigate the safety, toxicity and efficacy of Betalutin and pre-dosing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed (by WHO classification) relapsed indolent nonHodgkin Bcell lymphoma of following subtypes: Follicular lymphoma (follicular grade IIIIA), Marginal zone lymphoma (exclusion of MZL if large lymphocytes &gt; 50%), Small lymphocytic lymphoma, Lymphoplasmacytoid and classical mantle cell lymphoma (no blastoid MCL). 2. Requiring initiation of treatment for the NHL. 3. Relapsed after at least one line of therapy including rituximab combination chemotherapy regimen. 4. Exhausted and/or ineligible for all standard treatment options. 5. Not a candidate for an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients in progression after successful stem cell collection before before highdose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation may be considered for enrolment. 6. Age ≥ 18 years.. 7. A prestudy ECOG performance status of 02. In selected patients an ECOG score of 3 can be acceptable if it is clearly lymphomaassociated at the discretion of the investigator. 8. Life expectancy should be ≥ 3 months. 9. &lt;25% tumour cells in bone marrow biopsy prior to HH1/Betalutin treatment. At screening patients with higher levels may be included, provided patient agrees to have a new bone marrow biopsy prior to HH1/Betalutin treatment . If amount of tumour cells is still above 25% after rituximab pretreatment, the patient will need to be excluded from the study prior to HH1 infusion and Betalutin administration. 10. All patients must have at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion (&gt;1.5 cm in its largest dimension by CT scan). Patients without such a target lesion can be accepted on an individual basis if histological organ involvement can be evaluated for response e.g. involvement of the skin or the gastrointestinal tract. 11. Women of childbearing potential must: have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and before Betalutin injection understand that the study medication is expected to have teratogenic risk agree to use, and be able to comply with, highly effective method of birth control with a PearlIndex ≤ 1%. Contraception is required without interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy and for 12 months after end of study drug therapy, even if she has amenorrhoea. 12. Male subjects must agree to use condoms during intercourse throughout study drug therapy and the following 12 months. 13. Patients previously treated with native rituximab are eligible. 14. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol, and agrees to return to the hospital for followup visits and examination. 15. The patient has been fully informed about the study and has signed the informed consent form. 16. Negative HAMA test. 1. Medical contraindications, including uncontrolled infection, severe cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric or metabolic disease, steroid requiring asthma/allergy, known HIV positive. 2. Laboratory values during screening : Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC) ≤ 1.5 x 109 /l Platelet count ≤ 150 x 109 /l (platelet count at D28 must not be more than 20% lower than the result at screening) Total bilirubin ≥ 30 mmol/l ALP and ALAT ≥ 4x normal level e. GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 as measured by the CKDEPI method. 3. Known or suspected CNS involvement of lymphoma 4. Previous total body irradiation, or irradiation of &gt; 25% of the patient's bone marrow. 5. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy or another investigational drug received within the last 4 weeks prior to the patient entering screening. 6. Earlier treatment with radioimmunotherapy. 7. Exposure to another CD37 targeting drug. 8. Concurrent participation in another therapeutic treatment trial. 9. Previous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autologous and allogenic). 10. Pregnant or lactating women. 11. Transformed or potentially transformed NHL 12. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to enrolment 13. Test positive for hepatitis B (HBsAg and antiHBc) 14. A known hypersensitivity to rituximab, HH1, Betalutin or murine proteins or any excipient used in rituximab, HH1 or Betalutin</criteria>
