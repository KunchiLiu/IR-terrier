	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Tumor Cell-derived Microparticles Packaging Chemotherapeutic Drugs to Treat Malignant Pleural Effusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant pleural effusion(MPE) as a common complication of advanced lung cancer is lack of efficient treatments. The investigators have successfully produced tumor cell-derived microparticles packaging chemotherapy drugs and confirmed that this new integrative targeted biochemotherapy treatment could effectively restrain tumor growth at cellular and animal levels.This new method could control tumor growth in vivo effectively and induced pleural adhesion in the early clinical study. So the investigators attempt to explore the anticancer effect and related immune regulation mechanism of methotrexate-autologous tumor derived microparticles (MTX-ATMPs) in MPE treatment. The tumor cells in the malignant pleural effusion are prepared by screening, then MTX-ATMPs are made. Participants enrolled are randomly assigned to experimental and control group, each of them is injected with the prepared drug once in two days until the malignant pleural effusion are disappeared or the treatment cycle has been six times. During or after the whole treatment, reactions to each treatment of the participants are carefully followed up.</detailed_description>
