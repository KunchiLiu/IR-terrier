	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Transcutaneous Sacral Nerve Stimulation (TENS SNS) is as effective as Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) as therapeutic option for subjects with Idiopathic Overactive Bladder (OAB) who have failed conventional therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Transcutaneous and Percutaneous PTNS on Idiopathic OAB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both therapies have been proven to be effective, but very few times have been compared. PTNS and TENS SNS have been proven effective modifying bladder diary scores (change in the frequency of day and night urination, and urge incontinence), and improving subject's quality of life. Only PTNS has shown changes in urodynamic data while undergoing therapy. The investigators hypothesize that short-term effectiveness and benefit reported, is at least equal in the TENS group, if we compare both therapies in a randomized control trial. Secondary goals are to evaluate changes in bladder diary scores (frequency of urination, nocturia, urgency leakage episodes ), participants quality of life improvement scores, changes in detrusor instability, and changes in urodynamic data while undergoing these therapies.</detailed_description>
