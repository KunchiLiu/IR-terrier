	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) once daily compared tot placebo in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. The primary endpoint is a reduction of exacerbations of the disease during the treatment period. Next to this parameter the investigators expect to show a significant beneficial effect on lung function parameters, QoL, bacterial load of pathogens in sputum and tobramycin resistance.</brief_summary>
