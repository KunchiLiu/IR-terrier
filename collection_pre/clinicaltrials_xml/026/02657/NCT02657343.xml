	<brief_title>An Open-Label, Phase Ib/II Clinical Trial Of Cdk 4/6 Inhibitor, Ribociclib (Lee011), In Combination With Trastuzumab Or T-Dm1 For Advanced/Metastatic Her2-Positive Breast Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies. Ribociclib is a drug that is designed to block certain proteins called Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs) that are required for cells to divide. These proteins may also control the ability of certain cancers to grow. In this research study, we are looking for the safe and tolerated dose of ribociclib that can be given in combination with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). T-DM1 is a standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ribociclib as a treatment for any disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer, with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients without pathologic confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis from physical examination or radiologic evaluation. The primary tumor, and/or metastasis must have been tested for ER, PR and HER 2, and be HER2 positive as defined by the 2013 ASCOCAP guidelines. Measureable disease by RECIST 1.1 (at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension &gt; 20mm with conventional imaging techniques or &gt; 10mm with spiral CT or MRI) or evaluable disease. Bone lesions (blastic, lytic, or mixed) in the absence of measurable disease as defined above are also acceptable. Prior treatment Cohort A: Prior treatment with at least one regimen containing Trastuzumab and taxane. No prior treatment with TDM1 that was discontinued due to disease progression or toxicity. No more than 4 prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting. Cohort B: Must have received prior Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and TDM1 in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting. No limit on prior lines of therapies. Age ≥ 18 years.

History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ribociclib, TDM1 (Cohort A) and/or Trastuzumab (Cohort B). In general, the use of any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the care of the patient is permitted in this study, except as specifically prohibited below. Combination administration of study drugs could result in drugdrug interactions (DDI) that could potentially lead to reduced activity or enhanced toxicity of the concomitant medication and/or Ribociclib. Patient is currently receiving any of the following medications and cannot discontinue use within 7 days prior to starting study drug (see (Tables 1 and 2, Appendix B for details): Known strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5, including grapefruit, grapefruit hybrids, pummelos, starfruit, and Seville oranges That have a narrow therapeutic window and are predominantly metabolized through CYP3A4/5 Herbal preparations/medications, dietary supplements. The list provided here (and in Tables 1 and 2, Appendix B) is not comprehensive and is only meant to be used as a guide. The list is based on the Oncology Clinical Pharmacology DrugDrug Interaction Database (release date: 29 Oct 2012), which was compiled from the Indiana University School of Medicine's P450 Drug Interaction Table. http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/maintable/) and supplemented with the FDA Draft Guidance for Industry, Drug Interaction Studies Study Design, Data Analysis, and Implications for Dosing and Labeling (February 2012) (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm292362.pdf), and the University of Washington's Drug Interaction Database (http://www.druginteractioninfo.org/). For current lists of medications that may cause QT prolongation and/or torsades de pointes (TdP), refer to the CredibleMeds® website (https://crediblemeds.org/). Participants who have any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical trial or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, active untreated or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections, etc.). Participants who have had major surgery within 2 weeks prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects (tumor biopsy is not considered as major surgery).

Concurrent malignancy or a malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study drug, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma, nonmelanomatous skin cancer or curatively resected cervical cancer. Participants with malignancies less than 3 years prior to registration may be considered eligible after discussion with the principle investigator. Participants who are currently receiving or have received systemic corticosteroids ≤2 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not fully recovered from side effects of such treatment. The following uses of corticosteroids are permitted: single doses, topical applications (e.g., for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intraarticular). Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumarinderived anticoagulant for treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is allowed. Participation in a prior investigational study within 30 days prior to enrollment or within 5 halflives of the investigational product, whichever is longer. Patient with a ChildPugh score B or C. Participants who have a history of noncompliance to medical therapies. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Ribociclib has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Ribociclib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with Ribociclib. These risks also apply to Trasutuzumab used in this study. Pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a postitive hCG laboratory test (&gt;5 mIU/mL). Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly effective contraception methods include: Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient Combination of the two following Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 4 months after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.</criteria>
