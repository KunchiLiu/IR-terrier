	<brief_summary>Respiration rate is a critical vital sign that provides early detection of respiratory compromise and patient distress. Continuous monitoring of respiration rate is performed in patients under different clinical conditions, including post-surgery or different respiratory diseases. Clinician observation, pulse oximetry, and capnography are used individually or in combination to monitor ventilation during sedation and on post-surgical patients. The American Society of Anesthesiologists mandates the monitoring of respiration by measuring end tidal carbon dioxide (RRetco2) during procedural sedation and anesthesia. Other techniques for respiration rate measurement include different technologies such as acoustic respiratory rate (RRa). The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of RRetco2 and RRa under certain respiratory conditions.</brief_summary>
