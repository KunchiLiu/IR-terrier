	<brief_summary>This study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label trial focused on assessing the safety and tolerability of ExpressGraft-C9T1 skin tissue in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Because the focus is on safety rather than efficacy, a standard of care comparator is not included in this first-in-human study. Targeted enrollment for this study is up to 6 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of diabetes and who have foot ulcers. Subjects will each receive a single application of ExpressGraft-C9T1 skin tissue on a single identified study DFU following a 6-10 day run-in period. Any subjects requiring additional treatment will receive protocol-defined dressings through study session 7 as necessary. Enrollment will occur with a minimum of one week between each subject.</brief_summary>
