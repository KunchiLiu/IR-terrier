	<detailed_description>PriMatrix (TEI Medical Inc) is a promising collagen membrane derived from fetal bovine dermis. The acellular porous structure of the membrane permits rapid re-vascularization and cellular re-population. The membrane contains a high proportion of type III collagen. Type III collagen helps regulate tissue healing by promoting neoepithelialization and angiogenesis. Wounds grafted with PriMatrix exhibited significantly faster healing rates compared to control wounds while having a minimal foreign body response and early repopulation by progenitor cells. The ability of PriMatrix to permit neovascularization, reepithelialization, minimal immune response, and population by progenitor cells suggests that it may serve as an ideal alternative to CTG under CPF for root coverage. In this regard, the current study aims to serve as a pilot to test the feasibility of the use of PriMatrix as a graft material under a CPF to attain root coverage of Miller Class I &amp; II defects.</detailed_description>
