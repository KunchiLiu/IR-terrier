	<brief_summary>Patients for upper limb surgeries who are candidates for infraclavicular block will be screened. Two techniques of infraclavicular block will be compared. Measured outcomes are performance times, block onset times, patient satisfaction, quality of block, and requirement for supplementary analgesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Costoclavicular vs Paracoracoid Approach to Infraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block: a Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infraclavicular brachial plexus block under ultrasound guidance is used for surgeries on the upper limb. Traditionally, the block is performed at the lateral infraclavicular fossa where the cords are variable in position relative to the axillary artery. A recently introduced technique is the costoclavicular approach where the cords are viewed as relatively more superficial and clustered together compared to the traditional technique. Those meeting the inclusion criteria and will consent to participate in the study will be randomized to have either an infraclavicular block in the paracoracoid approach (Group 1) or an infraclavicular block in the costoclavicular approach (Group 2). All groups will have the same injectable volume (35 mls) and local anesthetic concentration (ropivacaine 0.5%). There will be 35 study patients for each group for a total of 70 patients.</detailed_description>
