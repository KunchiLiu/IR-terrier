	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if a continuous feeding regimen as compared to an intermittent bolus feeding regimen leads to improved weight gain in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) after stage 1 procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Feeding Strategies for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent years, survival after neonatal cardiac surgery has improved significantly. As life span has improved in HLHS/single ventricle variants (SVV) survivors, focus has shifted to the understanding and management of associated health problems. Growth failure is a well-recognized major co-morbidity in these patients. Infants with HLHS/SVV demonstrate progressive growth failure after stage 1 procedures, which appears to stabilize only after stage 2 procedures. Poor nutritional status increases risk for post-operative infections, extends hospital length-of-stay, and adversely affects neurodevelopmental outcomes. To date, evidence-based feeding strategies that support adequate weight gain and improve nutritional status have not been identified after stage 1 procedures. Continuous enteral feeding regimens have resulted in improved growth in a diverse population of infants with congenital heart disease and have been shown to decrease energy expenditure in premature infants and adults. A randomized, controlled study of HLHS/SVV infants who underwent stage 1 procedures at a single medical center was conducted with the primary objective of comparing weight gain at hospital discharge between infants receiving a continuous feeding regimen versus an intermittent feeding regimen. Secondary objectives were to compare growth and markers of nutritional status at hospital discharge between the two groups. The investigators hypothesized that infants with HLHS/SVV who receive a continuous enteral feeding regimen versus an intermittent feeding regimen will demonstrate improved weight gain, growth, and nutritional status after stage 1 procedures at hospital discharge.</detailed_description>
