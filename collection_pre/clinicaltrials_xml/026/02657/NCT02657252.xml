	<brief_summary>It will be done a randomized triple-blind study comparing 0,2% polidocanol versus 75% hypertonic glucose of sclerotherapy in lower limbs´ telangiectasis. It will be included only adult women with reticular veins on the side of the thighs and mild venous insufficiency (CEAP 1). The primary endpoint will be efficacy, and secondary will be safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polidocanol Versus Glucose Treatment of Telangiectasia Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background. The prevalence of chronic venous disease is high in the general population, mainly in young women, and in milder cases the usual complaint is aesthetic. Various techniques are used for treatment of mild varicose disease, including surgical treatment, laser ablation and sclerotherapy. Telangiectasis are those with less than 1 mm diameter, reddish and important contribution to the aesthetic damage, and sometimes they are related to local pain. There is no consensus in the literature about the effectiveness of treatment with sclerotherapy, despite of being an usual procedure with different chemicals. Methods and design. One hundred lower limbs of healthy women between 18 and 65 years will be triple blind randomized to receive treatment with polidocanol 0.2% diluted in 70% hypertonic glucose versus 75% hypertonic glucose for sclerotherapy treatment of telangiectasis. The patients will be examined and clinically classified. It will be included patients with telangiectasis sited at out's thigh, and only one extremity will be included per patient. The patients with varicose disease CEAP 2 or more will not be included. The treatment will be carried out in only one session and the medication volume not exceeding 5 ml. Clinical follow-up protocols will be filled on regular visits on days 0 - 7 - 60 concomitantly with photograph documentation. Supplementary examination for venous mapping with ultrasound pretreatment is performed for all patients. Discussion. This prospective controlled double-blind randomized trial aims to verify and compare the efficacy and safety for sclerotherapy treatment of telangiectasis of the lower limbs. The results may help physicians to choose the best sclerotherapy treatment for telangiectasis.</detailed_description>
