	<brief_summary>The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy with MiniMed 640G with SmartGuard activation in preventing hypoglycemia events in comparison sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy with Minimed 640G without SmartGuard activation in type 1 diabetic adults with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The study should show: - A reduction in the number of severe hypoglycemia, fewer hypoglycemic events and a reduction in the time spent in hypoglycemia six months in any group compared to Baseline. - A complete prevention of severe and not severe hypoglycemia in the pump group Minimed 640G + Enlite sensor with SmartGuard activation</brief_summary>
