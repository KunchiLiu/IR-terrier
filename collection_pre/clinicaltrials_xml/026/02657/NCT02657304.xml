	<brief_title>Effect of Early Education on the Observance of CPAP Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea (SA) affects more than 4% from general population (20% of people over 65 years) and is largely underdiagnosed, it can be rise up by some factors such as: obesity, male gender. Sleep Apnea can increase the occurrence of cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic events (particularly stroke, diabetes &amp; obesity). CPAP is currently the Gold Standard treatment of SA and to prevent these events, with a major clinical benefit, long term adherence to CPAP is a significant problem where a significant rate of rejection and abundance after 6 months of treatment. The investigators hypothesize that an early education and information of SA (in the first 2 weeks after diagnosis of SA and one telephonic call/month while 5 months) would allow to increase significantly the optimal observance of CPAP (&gt; 5 h/night). Thus, in this study, we will compare evolution of the observance of CPAP (h/night), of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI), patient knowledge of their SA and its deleterious health consequences in an early education and information during five months against a control group receiving only usual care (standard).</detailed_description>
