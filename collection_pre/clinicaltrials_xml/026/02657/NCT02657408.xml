	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Assess Pharmacodynamic Effects on Segmental Endotoxin Induced Inflammatory Response of BI 1026706 Versus Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Signed informed consent consistent with ICHGCP guidelines and local legislation prior to participation in the trial. Healthy volunteers of both sex between 18 and 65 years (inclusive) of age, on the day of subject's signature of informed consent. Healthy subjects as assessed by the investigator, based on a screening examination including medical history, physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature), 12lead ECG, lung function and clinical laboratory results. FEV1 (Forced expiratory volume) of &gt;80% and FEV1/FVC (Forced vital capacity) of &gt;70% of the predicted normal value at screening Current smokers with a smoking history of at least 1 pack year and with at least 1 cigarette per day in the previous year BMI (Body mass index) range: &gt;18.5 and &lt; 29.9kg/m2. Negative urine drug screening. Negative breath alcohol test. Negative skin prick test (performed within the 12 months prior to study start or at study start) Females NOT of childbearing potential are defined as: Women who are postmenopausal (12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause; in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous levels of FSH above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30 ng/L is confirmatory) or who are permanently sterilized (defined as hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy). Further inclusion criteria apply Exclusion criteria: History of any relevant lung disease (i.e. COPD, asthma, chronic bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), pneumocystis infection, active tuberculosis, silicosis or any other lung surfactant overproduction syndromes). Subjects with clinically relevant abnormal hematology, blood chemistry, or urinalysis at the screening visit Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature and ECG) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance. Subjects with a history of any clinically significant cardiovascular, metabolic, renal (including renal stones), hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematological, dermatological, venereal, neurological, psychiatric or other major disorders. Subjects with a malignancy for which the subject has undergone resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the last five years. Subjects with treated basal cell carcinoma or fully cured squamous cell carcinoma are allowed to participate. Subjects with previous surgery of the gastrointestinal tract likely to affect drug absorption. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts. Subjects with clinically relevant infection or known ongoing clinically relevant inflammatory process. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity including allergy to drug or its excipients or medications in line with bronchoscopy (bronchodilators, sedatives and local anesthetics). Subjects with a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTcB interval (such as repeated demonstration of a QTcB interval &gt;450 ms), or any other relevant ECG finding at screening visit (Visit 1) according to the investigator. Neutrophil blood count indicative of immunosuppression according to the investigator at screening visit (Visit 1). Subjects with previous surgeries that may have left ferromagnetic material in the body, ferromagnetic implants or pacemakers. Participation in another study with any investigational product within 2 months prior to screening or if screening occurs within 6 halflives of intake of another investigational drug (whichever is greater). Male subjects who do not agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming pregnant from the first dosing day until 3 months after the trial medication treatment has finished. Subjects who are committed to an institution by way of official or juridical order will not be enrolled in the trial. Receipt of live (attenuated) vaccine within the 4 weeks prior to screening or during the trial. Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator; for instance, because he is not considered able to understand and comply with study requirements or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study. For female subjects: Positive pregnancy test at screening Visit 1, pregnancy or plans to become pregnant within 30 days after study completion Lactation Further exclusion criteria apply</criteria>
