	<brief_summary>The association between low level laser and auricular acupuncture can be an alternative when conventional drugs are contraindicated or to reduce the quantity of these postoperative medications. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of low level laser at auriculotherapy points in reducing postoperative pain in lower third molar surgery. Eighty third molars surgeries will be performed in 40 healthy patients by a split-mouth design. Immediately after surgery, each side of the patient's mouth will be randomly treated with different regimens in a double-blind design: low level laser in auricular acupuncture points or simulation of its use. This treatment will be performed at 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The primary variable is the post-operative pain. The secondary variables are trismus, edema and local temperature. They will be assessed at baseline, 24 hours, 48 hours and seven days after surgery.The blood samples for analysis of systemic inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and interleukin 8) will be assessed at baseline and 24 hours after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Low-level Laser at Auriculotherapy Points to Reduce Postoperative Pain in Inferior Third Molar Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Third molar surgery is the most common surgical procedure in dentistry. A comfortable, fast postoperative return to daily activities has increased the need to control inflammation and its signs and symptoms, such as pain and edema. Anti-inflammatories and analgesics have been used for this purpose, but they are not exempt from adverse effects, such as allergies and chronic gastritis, not to mention the medicine costs. The association between low level laser and auricular acupuncture can be an alternative when conventional drugs are contraindicated or to reduce the quantity of these postoperative medications. Among the advantages, we can mention the low risk of side effects, low cost and simplicity of application. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of low level laser at auriculotherapy points in reducing postoperative pain in lower third molar surgery. Eighty bilateral, symmetrical lower third molars surgeries will be performed in 40 healthy patients. Each patient will be his or her own control, through a split-mouth technique. Immediately after surgery, each side of the patient's mouth will be randomly treated with different regimens in a double-blind design: low level laser in auricular acupuncture points or simulation of its use (contralateral side). This regimen will be repeated at 24 and 48 hours after surgery. All patients will receive the same medication (paracetamol) and will be oriented to take it only if they have pain. Neither the surgeon nor the patients know the assigned treatment. The primary variable is the post-operative pain assessed by visual analog scale, and the secondary variables are trismus, edema, local temperature. Dysphagia and presence of infection (systemic temperature, lymphadenopathy) will also be evaluated. These variables will be assessed at baseline, 24 hours, 48 hours and seven days after surgery. All adverse effects will be recorded. The blood samples for analysis of systemic inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and interleukin 8) will be assessed at baseline and 24 hours after surgery.</detailed_description>
