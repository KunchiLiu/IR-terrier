	<brief_title>Renal Safety of Bowel Preparation With Polyethylene Glycol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most commonly used bowel cleansing agent for colonoscopy in the world. PEGs are non-absorbable isosmotic solutions that pass through the bowel without net absorption or secretion. Significant fluid and electrolyte shifts are therefore attenuated. However, several studies have shown that PEG may also impair renal function. One recent population-based study reported that the use of PEG was associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury. The renal safety of PEG in Taiwanese patient has not been reported.</detailed_description>
