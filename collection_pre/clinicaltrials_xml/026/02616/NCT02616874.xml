	<brief_summary>The BCN02-Romi study aims to evaluate a combined "kick and kill" strategy using the most immunogenic candidate vaccine available so far (HIVconsv) with the strongest latency reversal agent available at present time (romidepsin) in a cohort of early-treated HIV positive individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effect of HIVconsv Vaccines in Combination With Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Romidepsin on the Viral Rebound Kinetic After Treatment Interruption in Early Treated HIV-1 Infected Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combined use of therapeutic vaccination and specific drugs that can reactivate latent virus from the reservoir (Kick and kill strategies) hold the promise to achieve functional cure and viral eradication of HIV infection. The present project consists of a proof-of-concept clinical trial in a cohort of 24 early treated HIV-1 infected individuals rolled-over from the BCN01 vaccine clinical trial in which participants received the most immunogenic vaccines tested to date, ChAd and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA).HIVconsv vaccines. All individuals will be given a booster immunization with MVA.HIVconsv in combination with romidepsin (RMD), a potent histone deacetylation inhibitor (HDACi) and will later undergo a monitored antiretroviral pause. HIVconsv vaccines have specifically been designed to stimulate a broad and potent cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response towards the most conserved viral regions of the HIV-1 proteome, which have recently been suggested to have a crucial role when targeting HIV variants harboured in the latent reservoir with mutations to escape T-cell immune responses. The study includes the development of a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) substudy to analyse the in vivo effects of RMD in the induction of HIV expression in resting cells, deeply investigate any unintended effect on the CTL function as well as predict the relationship between RMD exposure and such effects. The investigators' results will allow investigators to optimize RMD dosing, to evaluate the clinical efficacy of this eradication strategy after the cART interruption and to identify better correlates of control of rebound viremia after cessation of treatment.</detailed_description>
