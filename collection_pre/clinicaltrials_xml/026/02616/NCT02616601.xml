	<criteria>Subject is male and/or female, 18 years of age or older. Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent. Subject is willing and able to apply the test article(s) as directed, comply with study instructions and commit to all followup visits for the duration of the study. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of actinic keratoses with at least five and no more than ten clinically typical, visible or palpable, discrete, AK lesions, each at least 4 mm in diameter on the face (excluding ears) or balding scalp. Subject is in good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition that might impair evaluation of AK lesions or which, in the investigator's opinion, exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation. Females must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or use an effective method of birth control with a negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) at the Baseline Visit Subject is pregnant, lactating, or is planning to become pregnant during the study. Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study. Subject has used an investigational drug or investigational device treatment within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has hyperkeratotic, hypertrophic, or large matlike AKs (e.g., AK &gt;1 cm2 in size) within the Treatment Area. Subject has the need or plans to be exposed to artificial tanning devices or excessive sunlight during the trial. Subject is immunosuppressed (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), systemic malignancy, graft host disease, etc.) Subject has experienced an unsuccessful outcome from previous topical fluorouracil therapy (an unsuccessful outcome is defined as after a reasonable therapeutic trial with no compliance issues and the topical drug did not work). Subject has a history of sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the test articles. Subject has known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme deficiency. Subject used topical creams, lotions, or gels of any kind within the selected Treatment Area within one day prior to entry into the study. Subject has used topical medications; corticosteroids, alpha hydroxy acids (e.g., glycolic acid, lactic acid, etc. &gt;5%), beta hydroxy acid (salicylic acid &gt;2%), urea &gt;5%, 5fluorouracil, diclofenac, imiquimod, ingenol mebutate, or prescription retinoids (e.g., tazarotene, adapalene, tretinoin) within the selected Treatment Area (face or balding scalp) within one (1) month prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has had cryodestruction, curettage, photodynamic therapy, surgical excision, or other treatments for AK within the selected Treatment Area (face or balding scalp) within one (1) month prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has used oral corticosteroid therapy, interferon, cytotoxic drugs, immunomodulators, immunosuppressive therapies, or retinoids within one month prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has had dermatologic procedures or surgeries such as: laser resurfacing, Psoralen + ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, ultraviolet B therapy, chemical peels, or dermabrasion within the selected Treatment area (face or balding scalp) within six months prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has lesions suspicious for skin cancer (skin cancer not ruled out by biopsy) or untreated skin cancers within the selected Treatment Area (face or balding scalp). Subject has any skin pathology or condition on the face or balding scalp that, in the investigator's opinion, could interfere with the evaluation of the test article or requires the use of interfering topical, systemic, or surgical therapy. Subject has any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, would make it unsafe or preclude the subject's ability to fully participate in this research study. Subject is unable to communicate or cooperate with the investigator due to language problems, poor mental development, impaired cerebral function, or physical limitations. Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to comply with the requirements of the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, drug dependency, mental incapacity) in the opinion of the investigator. Subject has been previously enrolled in the same study.</criteria>
