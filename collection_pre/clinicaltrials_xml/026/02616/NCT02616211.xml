	<brief_summary>Patients are asked to participate in this study if they have been diagnosed with a thoracic carcinoma which includes lung cancer and have a gene mutation (alteration in the body's genetic instructions) and after undergoing treatment the cancer has come back, progressed, or shown a partial response on standard treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Integrated Approach to Treating Recurrent Thoracic Carcinomas Resistant to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to improve the treatment outcome for thoracic carcinomas after they become resistant to targeted therapy, the investigator is using tumor biopsies at the time of recurrence for genomic analysis to identify novel somatic changes in critical genes and gene pathways that can potentially be targeted with therapy. The study team is also creating patient-derived xenografts to test drug efficacy and optimize personalized therapy for each patient.</detailed_description>
