	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-1226 composed of perflubron with ascending doses of carbon dioxide (4%, 8%, and 12% CO2) administered over 2 minute nebulisation to healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase1, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Double-blind, Single-ascending Dose Study in Healthy Subjects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There will be up to 3 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort will include 12 subjects (9 receiving S-1226 and 3 receiving matching placebo). For each dose level, a sentinel group of 2 subjects will be dosed (1 subject with S-1226, 1 subject with placebo) 24 hours prior to dosing the rest of the study population. It may be necessary to repeat, or modify (decrease) a dose level, and thus an additional cohort of up to 12 subjects may be enrolled.</detailed_description>
