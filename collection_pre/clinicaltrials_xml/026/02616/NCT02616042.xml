	<detailed_description>With growing interest in plant-based products among researchers, many toothpastes with various herbal extracts have been introduced over the past few decades,Centella asiatica (CA), a small herb broadly cultivated in China, Southeast Asia, India and Oceanic countries, has long been used for therapeutic purposes since ancient times.CA has been reported to be useful in the treatment of skin diseases wound repair and healing of burn. In dentistry, few studies have explored the efficacy of CA. In one study, CA was demonstrated to be an effective supportive agent following periodontal treatment, resulting in reduced plaque and gingivitis. In spite of such wound healing properties of CA, its usage in dental field has been limited. Bamboo salt (BS) is a Korean folk remedy consisting of sea salt roasted in bamboo which has long been used for therapeutic purposes in Korea. Toothpastes containing BS has been sold in Korea for some decades. Some in vitro studies and animal studies using rats demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of BS. Nevertheless, no human study has yet evaluated the effect of BS on periodontal health. Therefore, the new dentifrice containing CA and BS was developed.</detailed_description>
