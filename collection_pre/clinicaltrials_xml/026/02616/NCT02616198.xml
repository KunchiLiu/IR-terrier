	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical performance of two highly viscous encapsulated GICs (EquiaFil and Riva SC) covered with two different coatings (Equia Coat and Fuji Varnish) over 6-year using modified United State Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. A total of 256 restorations were made with EquiaFil and Riva SC. Equia Coat or Fuji Varnish was used randomly on the surface of the restorations. The restorations were evaluated at baseline, 6, 12, 18 months and 6 years after placement using modified USPHS criteria. The results were evaluated with Pearson Chi-Square and Mann Whitney U-test (p&lt; 0.05).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical performance of two highly viscous encapsulated GICs (EquiaFil and Riva SC) covered with two different coatings (Equia Coat and Fuji Varnish) over 6-year using modified United State Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Fifty-four patients having Class I and II restorations/caries were included in the study. A total of 256 restorations were made with EquiaFil (GC Corp, Japan) and Riva SC (SDI, Australia). Equia Coat or Fuji Varnish was used randomly on the surface of the restorations. After cavity preparations, the teeth were randomly restored with one glass ionomer cement and coated with Equia Coat or Fuji Varnish. The restorations were evaluated at baseline, 6, 12, 18 months and 6 years after placement using modified USPHS criteria. Two evaluators checked color-match, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, caries formation, anatomical form, postoperative sensitivity and retention rate and photographs were taken at each recalls. The results were evaluated with Pearson Chi-Square and Mann Whitney U-test (p&lt; 0.05). The 18-month results were presented at the CED IADR congress iheld in Barcelona in 2010 (Turkun LS, &amp; Kanic O ,Clinical evaluation of new glass ionomer coating combined systems for 18-months Journal of Dental Research 89 (Special Issue B) Abstract #402.) Gurgan S et al. also mentioned our 18-month results in their published manuscript ( Gurgan S,Kutuk ZB, Ergin E, Oztas ZZ &amp; Cakir FY (2015) Four-year randomized clinical trial to evaluate the clinical performance of a glass ionomer restorative system Operative Dentistry 40(2) 134-143).</detailed_description>
