	<brief_summary>A randomized screening trial to compare the diagnostic accuracy of screening for breast cancer with three-dimensional digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) plus two-dimensional full-field digital mammography (FFDM) versus FFDM alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tomosynthesis Mammography Imaging Screening Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Tomosynthesis Mammography Imaging Screening Trial (TMIST) LEAD-IN is being conducted to ensure that all Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group / American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG/ACRIN) TMIST components are properly functional and to provide an opportunity for fine tuning before launching the full TMIST. The accrual target for TMIST LEAD-IN is 6354 participants (one tenth of the projected enrollment target for TMIST) at three lead-in study sites: 1. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, 2. Vancouver (under the auspices of the Screening Mammography Programme of British Columbia) and 3. The Ottawa Hospital.</detailed_description>
