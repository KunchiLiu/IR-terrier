	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) fixed dose combination (FDC) after switching from a stable regimen consisting of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) plus a third antiretroviral agent in participants harboring the archived nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutation M184V and/or M184I in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Documented historical genotype report showing M184V and/or M184I (mixtures are acceptable) in reverse transcriptase. Individuals must not have any primary integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) or primary protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations present on historical genotype; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations are allowed. Proviral DNA test must not have additional exclusion resistance mutations against PIs, NRTIs and INSTIs Part 1 (first 50 individuals): Historical genotype report must show M184V and/or M184I in reverse transcriptase WITHOUT any other NRTI resistance mutation (including thymidine analogueassociated mutations (TAMs) [TAMs are: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219Q/E/N/R], K65R, T69 insertion and Q151M mutation complex [A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, Q151M] Part 2 (after the interim efficacy review 50 individuals): Historical genotype report must show M184V and/or M184I in reverse transcriptase WITH or WITHOUT one or two thymidine analogueassociated mutations (TAMs) [TAMs are: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219Q/E/N/R]. Evidence of K65R, K70E, T69 insertion and/or Q151M mutation complex [A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, Q151M] will not be eligible Currently receiving an antiretroviral regimen consisting of FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC in combination with one third antiretroviral agent for ≥ 6 consecutive months preceding the screening visit Documented plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit Plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL at screening visit Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 30 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula for creatinine clearance A female individual is eligible to enter the study if it is confirmed that she is: not pregnant of nonchildbearing potential stopped menstruating for ≥ 12 months of childbearing potential and agrees to utilize the protocol specified method of contraception or be nonheterosexually active or practice sexual abstinence from screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 30 days following discontinuation of study drugs Male individuals must agree to use the protocol specified method(s) of contraception during heterosexual intercourse or be nonheterosexually active, or practice sexual abstinence from screening throughout the study period and for 30 days following the last study drug dose Male individuals must agree to refrain from sperm donation from first dose until at least 30 days after the last study drug dose Key Individuals will have no evidence of previous virologic failure on a PI/r or INSTIbased regimen (with or without resistance to either class of ARV). Individuals may have evidence of prior virologic failure on only an NNRTI plus 2 NRTIbased regimen Individuals on a current PI/rbased regimen will have no evidence of previous use of any approved or experimental integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) (for any length of time) Hepatitis C infection that would require therapy during the study Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive Individuals with clinical evidence of decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, etc.) Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, non invasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma. Individuals with cutaneous KS are eligible, but must not have received any systemic therapy for KS within 30 days of Day 1 and must not be anticipated to require systemic therapy during the study Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1 NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
