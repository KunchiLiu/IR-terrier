	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/ tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) relative to unchanged current antiretroviral therapy (ART) by assessing spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) measured at Week 48 in virologically-suppressed, HIV-1 infected participants aged ≥ 60 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Switching From a Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) Containing Regimen to Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir Alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC) in Virologically-Suppressed, HIV-1 Infected Adults Aged ≥ 60 Years</brief_title>

	<criteria>Key Currently receiving a TDF and FTC or 3TCcontaining 'backbone' (maximum 2 NRTIs) regimen plus a third agent for ≥ 6 consecutive months prior to screening visit. For individuals with 3 or more ART regimens, a regimen history must be provided for approval by the Sponsor. Refer to assigned interventions for allowed third agents of the current regimen. Documented plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit (measured at least twice using the same assay). In the preceding 6 months prior to screening, one episode of "blip" (HIV1 RNA &gt; 50 and &lt; 400 copies/mL) is acceptable, only if HIV1 RNA is &lt; 50 copies/mL immediately before and after the "blip". Plasma HIV1 RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL at screening visit Adequate renal function Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula (eGFRCG) and are on ARVs that are appropriately dose adjusted for renal function per package insert All documented historical plasma genotype(s) must not show resistance to TDF or FTC, including, but not limited to the presence of reverse transcriptase resistance mutations K65R, K70E, M184V/I, or thymidine analogassociated mutations (TAMs) that include M41L, L210W, D67N, K70R, T215Y/F, K219Q/E/N/R. If historical plasma prior to first ART is not available or individual has 3 or more ART regimens, individuals will have proviral genotype analysis prior to Day 1 to confirm absence of archived resistance to TDF or FTC. Study performed DXA scan and Tscore received prior to Day 1 Key Previous use of any approved or experimental integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) (for any length of time) if the current regimen contains a PI/r Individuals will have no evidence of previous virologic failure on a PI/r or INSTIbased regimen (with or without resistance to either class of ARV) A new AIDSdefining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening (except CD4+ cell count and/or percentage criteria) Hepatitis C virus that would require therapy during the study Individuals receiving ongoing treatment for bone disease (eg, osteoporosis), including bisphosphonates, denosumab, and strontium ranelate NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
