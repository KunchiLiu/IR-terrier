	<brief_title>Preliminary Research On Two-step Dosing Of Imipenem/Cilastatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared with Imipenem/Cilastatin 2 hours continuous dosing method and two-step dosing method (0.5 hours before enter half dose, after 1.5 hours, the other half of the input dose) of blood drug concentration in the body than the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) pathogens percent of dosing interval duration (100% fT &gt; MIC), blood drug concentration in the body more than 4 times the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) pathogens percent of dosing interval duration (100% fT &gt; 4 MIC), blood drug concentration peak and the ratio of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) pathogens (Cmax/MIC), blood drug concentration (Tmax) used in the peak time, used to guide clinical patients with severe infection of Imipenem/Cilastatin usage.</detailed_description>
