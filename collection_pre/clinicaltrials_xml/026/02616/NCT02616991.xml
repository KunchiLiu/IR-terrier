	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether systematically performing computed tomography (CT) venography (i.e a CT acquisition of the pelvis and of the lower limbs, during the venous phase of opacification) in addition to thoracic CT angiography in women with suspected postpartum pulmonary embolism (PE) results in a gain in venous thromboembolism detection rate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a leading cause of maternal death during postpartum in developed countries; Thoracic computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the first-line diagnostic test for PE suspicion, but has a 20 to 35% rate of inconclusiveness during pregnancy and postpartum, 2 to 3 times higher than that of the general population. CT venography (CTV) consists in a delayed CT acquisition of the abdomen, pelvis and lower limbs, 3 minutes after starting contrast administration. It can be used for detecting deep venous thrombosis (DVT), the source of emboli in most PEs. The investigators hypothesized most postpartum PEs are due to pelvic vein thrombosis and that detecting such pelvic DVT by performing systematic CTV could increase the overall venous thromboembolism (VTE) detection.</detailed_description>
