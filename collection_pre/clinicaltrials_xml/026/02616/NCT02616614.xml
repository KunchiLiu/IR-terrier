	<brief_title>Double-blind Placebo-controlled Trial of Generic Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel Versus Onexton Gel in Acne Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double blind, three-arm, parallel group, placebo control bioequivalence study with clinical endpoint, at multiple study sites, designed to establish bioequivalence of clindamycin 1.2% and benzoyl peroxide 3.75% gel of Actavis and Onexton® (clindamycin 1.2% and benzoyl peroxide 3.75%) gel in the treatment of subjects with Acne Vulgaris. The primary objective is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a generic of clindamycin 1.2% and benzoyl peroxide 3.75% gel to Onexton® in the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy male or nonpregnant female aged ≥ 12 and ≤ 40 years with a clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris On the face, ≥25 noninflammatory lesions (i.e., open and closed comedones) and ≥ 20 inflammatory lesions (i.e., papules and pustules) and ≤ 2 nodulocystic lesions (i.e., nodules and cysts). For the purposes of study treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be limited to the facial treatment area. Counts of nodules and cysts should be reported separately and not included in the inflammatory or noninflammatory lesion counts. Lesions involving the eyes and scalp should be excluded from the count. (Subjects may have acne lesions on other areas of the body (e.g., on the back)).
