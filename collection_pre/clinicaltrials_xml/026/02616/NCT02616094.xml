	<brief_summary>Extending previous findings, and applying a novel multi-method translational approach, this project hypothesizes that there are alcohol-related neuroendocrine and neural changes observable in acute and protracted abstinence, and which can accurately classify future relapse and treatment outcome in separate alcohol dependent (AD) patient samples, thereby validating them as biomarkers of relapse, with potential clinical utility as prognostic markers in identifying and treating those most susceptible to relapse.</brief_summary>
