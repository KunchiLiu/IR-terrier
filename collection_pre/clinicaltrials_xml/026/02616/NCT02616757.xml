	<brief_summary>Simple bone cysts (SBCs), also known as unicameral bone cysts (UBCs), are benign bone lesions. Literature to date describes little agreement between clinicians on specific prognostic criteria for the prediction of cyst healing, recurrence or fracture. Evidence has shown that bone mineral density (BMD) is a reliable indicator of risk to SBC patients given its association with the mechanical properties of bone. There has been further exploration into the use of quantitative ultrasound to assess bone density by measuring the velocity of the ultrasound transmission over the bone. To determine whether the QUS can provide prognostic information with respect to cyst healing, recurrence or fracture with a SBC, further study is needed.</brief_summary>
