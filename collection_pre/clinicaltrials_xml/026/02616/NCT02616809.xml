	<brief_summary>This study aims to test the short-term effects of intermittent standing, slow cycling and slow walking, compared to sitting, on continuous blood glucose and ambulatory blood pressure among pre-hypertensive and pre-diabetic adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Standing and Light-intensity Activity on Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Blood Glucose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll 10 adults who will each complete four experimental conditions in random order. Each of the four experimental conditions are as follows: 1) sit continuously for 8 hours in a simulated office environment, 2) break-up sitting time with standing based on set hourly intervals, 3) break-up sitting time with slow-walking on a treadmill desk based on set hourly intervals, 4) increase energy expenditure by slow cycling based on set hourly intervals. Participants will completed each condition one week apart and dietary intake will be standardized by giving participants the same meals during each intervention condition. Study measures will include: anthropometrics (height and weight), blood pressure, fasting glucose, 24-continuous glucose monitoring, full-day ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, cognitive testing (cognitive performance), energy expenditure, physical activity via accelerometer, sleep via accelerometer, and heart rate.</detailed_description>
