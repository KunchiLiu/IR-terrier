	<criteria>The subject must have received 24 months of treatment with tesevatinib on study KD019101. (Twentyfour months of study drug treatment includes days without treatment that were allowed by the KD019101 protocol.) Sexually active subject (male and female) has agreed to use two forms of accepted methods of contraception during the course of the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug. Effective birth control includes (a) IUD plus one barrier method; (b) on stable doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (eg, oral, injectable, implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; or (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm). Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at screening. Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However, women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, or ovarian suppression.</criteria>
