	<brief_summary>The overall aim of the present research project is to examine whether consumption of high daily amounts of cheese, both high-fat and low-fat, affects risk markers of disease in a study population of men and women with metabolic syndrome risk factors. It will be explored whether high-fat and/or low-fat cheese consumption can be regarded healthy to consume for at-risk populations (assessed by within-group comparisons from baseline values) and if low-fat or non-fat alternatives to high-fat cheese should continue to be recommended (assessed by between-group comparisons). In addition, it will be assessed if cheese consumption affects women and men differently as suggested by observational data. The present research project will examine the health effects of cheese as a food product per se and not as a sum of single nutrients, knowing that the single components of cheese cannot be adequately placebo-matched. A relatively high daily intake of high-fat cheese will be compared to a similar intake of low-fat cheese and with a carbohydrate control.</brief_summary>
