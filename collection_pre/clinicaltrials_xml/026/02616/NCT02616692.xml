	<brief_summary>This non-interventional cross-sectional online survey will evaluate preferences among patients with self-reported HCC. The survey will ask patients to express their preferences regarding descriptions of HCC treatments, which will include sorafenib (which will be described as 'oral anti-cancer therapy'), repeated transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). Please note that all interventions that patients may have received before completing this online survey were given regardless of their participation in this survey. Questions also include asking patients to rank various treatment characteristics (e.g., mechanism of action, risk of adverse effects, etc.) relative to each other. The ultimate goal is to better understand patient perceptions of these treatments and to provide evidence to help in patients' and physicians' treatment decision-making in HCC.</brief_summary>
