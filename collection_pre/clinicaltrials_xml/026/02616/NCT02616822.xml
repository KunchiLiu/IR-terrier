	<brief_summary>Arterial Hypertension (HBP) has a high prevalence and low rates of control, is considered a major modifiable risk factors and one of the most important public health problems. Mortality from cardiovascular disease increases progressively with increasing blood pressure (BP) in a linear, continuous and independent. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension exhibit metabolic abnormalities, which are related to endothelial dysfunction. Resveratrol, a polyphenol stilbene derived from various species of plants, but in our food, mainly present in red wine and grapes, has shown protective effects in cardiovascular diseases, such as preventing the damage caused by oxidative stress, decreased plasma lipids with inhibiting the formation of atherosclerotic plaque; protective effect of vascular endothelium, with increased release of nitric oxide and decreased production of free radicals in animal models, but human studies are limited and insufficient to clarify the possible effects of trans-resveratrol (biologically active form) on endothelial function, blood pressure and central aortic pressure in treated hypertensive individuals.The aim of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of trans-resveratrol supplementation on endothelial function in treated hypertensive patients.</brief_summary>
