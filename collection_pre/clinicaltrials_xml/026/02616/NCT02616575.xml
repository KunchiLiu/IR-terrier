	<brief_summary>Aims: The purposes of this study are 1. to create a smart living environment with home care system using GPS and cloud-based services for elderly people. 2. to improve the home care system from user feedback and recommendations. Methods: Participants (n = 50) will be recruited from geriatric clinics in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) main hospital and its Beihu branch. Enrollment criteria include: aged 60 or older, living alone or with one companion (not children), taking at least one chronic medications, having the capability to understand the study and complete the study, willing to participate into the study with telephone follow ups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Application of Smart Health Management System on Home-Care for Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: At present, with the changing of the society structure, the ratio of nuclear family and older people who live alone is arising. Therefore, making care system fit for aging population to create a appropriate healthcare is cricial. Thus, the investigators have established a smart home health care system, SilverLink to improve resident quality for older adults living alone. Aims: The purposes of this study are 1. to create a smart living environment with home care system using GPS and cloud-based services for elderly people. 2. to improve the home care system from user feedback and recommendations. Methods: Participants (n = 50) will be recruited from geriatric clinics in NTUH main hospital and its Beihu branch. Enrollment criteria include: aged 60 or older, living alone or with a companion (not children), taking at least one chronic medications, having the capability to understand the study and complete the study, willing to participate into the study with telephone follow ups. This study includes two sessions: 1. set up the healthcare system, with home GPS and sensors. The investigators will stick small sensors on fridge door, pillbox, pendant…for automatic detection of the frequency of food intake, take medicine and get out of home….Also, the investigators will use accelerometer to track the body movement for older adults. 2. use APP for blood pressure (BP) or other measurements data tracking. The investigators develop an APP system to help older adults to log in and track their dairy physiological measurements. (optional) Anticipated results: Provide feasibility data for system to allow future modifications of the system. Improve older adults' life quality and satisfaction. Under the integration of this healthcare technology and the central communication medical services may create a smart healthcare network, which is not only the effectiveness on reducing medical costs, but also will provide a convenient connection between living alone older adults and their family.</detailed_description>
