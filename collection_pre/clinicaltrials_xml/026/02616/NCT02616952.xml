	<brief_title>A Chinese Herbal Decoction for Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pilot randomized, controlled trial is aimed to preliminarily assess the effectiveness of Yiqi Suoquan Tang, a Chinese Herbal decoction, in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receiving Yiqi Suoquan Tang or pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) using a random number generator in a 1:1 ratio. To minimize the evaluation bias, the outcome assessors and statisticians will be masked to treatment allocation. Assuming a two-sided alpha of 0.05, power of 90%, and a 20% drop-out, a sample size of 36 would be needed for each group. The statistical analysis will be performed based on the intention-to-treat principle, which is defined as patients that have received at least one treatment. Missing data will be replaced by the last observed value. Continuous variables will be compared by Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables will be analyzed by chi-square test, Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis H test as appropriate. For comparison between two time points, paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used as appropriate. A statistically significant difference was set at P&lt;0.05.</detailed_description>
