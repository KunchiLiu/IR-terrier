Primary endpoint: score of change in spontaneous pain by using the visual analogue scale (VAS) after seven days of treatment. Secondary endpoints: intensity of pain evaluated by the VAS scale on each study visit, impression of the research subject checked by a 7-point scale, changes in clinical symptoms, and frequency of use of the rescue medication. Evaluation of drug safety as per the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. This is a double blind, randomized, comparative study, with a total of 208 subjects divided into 2 groups: 104 subjects treated with loxoprofen sodium (transdermal patch 100 mg; Daiichi-Sankyo) associated with placebo tablet (experimental group) and 104 subjects treated with transdermal patch of placebo associated with Loxonin® (loxoprofen sodium 60 mg - Daiichi-Sankyo - control group).
