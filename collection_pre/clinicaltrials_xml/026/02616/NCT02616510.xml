	<brief_summary>The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy amongst women of reproductive age. PCOS is associated with various cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia hypertension and the metabolic syndrome. Whether these increased cardiovascular risk factors result in the development of actual cardiovascular disease in later life remains to be established. Women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), experience menopause prior to the age of 40 years. Women with POI may exhibit dyslipidemia. A young age at menopause has been previously associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>
