	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that the absorption of topically applied EFA-containing emollient (SSO) into the skin and thence into the bloodstream in children with SAM will improve skin barrier function and accelerate weight gain and clinical rehabilitation beyond that possible through normal standard-of-care</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Emollient Therapy for Severe Acute Malnutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A child with SAM, in addition to wasting will often present with infection, hypothermia, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance - complications attributable, at least in part, to compromised skin barrier function. Essential fatty acid (EFA)-containing emollients such as sunflower seed oil (SSO) have been shown to augment skin barrier function, reduce transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and risk of bloodstream infection and mortality, and promote weight gain in preterm infants. Recent research from rural Bangladesh showed very low levels of EFAs in young children in the general population. It is believed that EFA levels will be further depleted in children with SAM. So the investigators aim to demonstrate the feasibility of topical applications of SSO to children with SAM, and to measure clinical impact of emollient therapy with SSO on skin barrier function, skin condition, EFA levels in blood, weight gain, co-morbidities (e.g., pneumonia, sepsis), and time to complete acute rehabilitation from SAM, in addition to the benefits of normal standard-of-care.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Parent or legal guardian is willing and able to provide written informed consent for the subject to take part in the trial and comply with an inpatient stay of at least 10 days.
