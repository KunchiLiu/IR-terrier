The purpose of this study is to implement the parent training program and evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Depending on the results, investigators expect core aspects of this module to be adaptable and modified or extended for parents of older children in the future to meet the needs of families across the stages of childhood development.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mindfulness Training for Head Start Parents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parents of children enrolled in the Head Start program will be recruited to take part in a training module to learn and practice mindfulness techniques. Recruited participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention group or a wait-list control group. Parents in the intervention group will attend the training, which involves 6 weekly, group sessions. Data will be collected from both the intervention and wait-list control groups 1-3 weeks prior to the intervention period and 1-3 weeks following the end of the intervention period. This data will be collected through self-report questionnaires, in-home observations, hair sample from parents, an activity tracker for parents, and records on developmental assessments and attendance of the target child from Head Start. The wait-list control group will be offered a training after measures are completed. Intervention group participants may be invited to take part in focus groups after the training is complete. At these focus groups, they will engage in a discussion of their experiences and opinions about the class. Some participants may be invited to individual interviews to share their experiences and aid further revision of the program.</detailed_description>
