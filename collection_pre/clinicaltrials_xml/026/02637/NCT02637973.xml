	<brief_title>Effects of Empagliflozin on Liver Fat Content, Energy Metabolism and Body Composition in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this multicentre, prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, 2-arm parallel, interventional pilot study HCL and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) will be quantified with 1H magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy. Hepatic ATP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations will be assessed with 31P MR spectroscopy (1). Whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility will be measured by combining hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic pancreatic clamp tests with isotopic dilution of 6,6-2H2 glucose and indirect calorimetry as shown (2). Abdominal fat distribution will be quantified by MR imaging. Newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) will be randomly allocated to once daily 25 mg empagliflozin (EMPA) or placebo for 24 weeks with a computer-generated random sequence and will be masked to the treatment assignment. Participants will visit the clinical research center at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks for MRS and metabolic examinations, including blood sampling for hepato- and adipocytokines. Anthropometric parameters (body weight, waist circumference, total body fat, blood pressure) and glycemic control (HbA1C, fasting blood glucose, FBG) will be assessed at baseline and during monitoring visits every 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
