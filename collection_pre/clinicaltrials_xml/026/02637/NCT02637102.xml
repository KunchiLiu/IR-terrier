	<brief_summary>CAVIAR is a multicentre prospective observational study. Centres for cardiac and vascular surgery assess and manage patients in different ways before surgery. Some centres have introduced the use of intravenous iron therapy for patients with anaemia in the preoperative setting. Consequently regional variation exists in the assessment and management of patients before cardiac and vascular surgery. We aim to observe and measure these differing pathways and observe if there is variation in iron deficiency and anaemia and the impact of these variables on patient cardiorespiratory function as well as post-operative outcomes. [Sub-Study] For patients who are receiving intravenous iron therapy as part of their routine clinical care, we wish to observe this effect in more detail. We will assess the impact of the treatment on well-being, blood count and fitness. Information will be collected through Quality of Life questionnaires, total haemoglobin mass test (via blood collection) and fitness testing.</brief_summary>
