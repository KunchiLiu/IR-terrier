	<brief_title>Effects of Beta-glucan on Energy Intake and Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Satiation and satiety are part of the body's complex appetite control system that ultimately play a role in limiting energy intake. Satiation is referred to as the process that leads to the termination of eating, which may be accompanied by feelings of satisfaction. Satiety is the feeling of fullness that persists after eating, with the potential to suppress further energy intake until hunger returns. There is evidence to suggest that increasing gastro-intestinal viscosity improves appetite control and reduces subsequent food intake. Beta-glucan is a soluble fibre proposed to behave this way. In this double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial, subjective appetite sensations will be measured and blood will be collected at specific time points during the two arms in order to determine hormonal responses. Ad libitum food intake will be recorded. Food diaries will be used to measure dietary intakes.</detailed_description>
