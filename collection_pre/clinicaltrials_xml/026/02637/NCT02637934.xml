	<brief_summary>Up to 30 women with known or suspected epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer will participate in two different imaging cohorts. The Biodistribution cohort will include up to 10 patients and the Dynamic cohort will include up to 20 patients. Human dosimetry will be calculated from the Biodistribution cohort. The Dynamic cohort date will evaluate preliminary information on uptake of [18F]FTT in gynecological cancer and compare with PARP-1 activity in tissue.</brief_summary>
