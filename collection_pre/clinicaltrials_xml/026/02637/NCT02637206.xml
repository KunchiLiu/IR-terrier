	<brief_summary>GSK2894512 is a novel anti-inflammatory agent that is currently under development for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis and chronic plaque psoriasis. This study will be a Phase I, single-center, randomized, partial-blinded (evaluator blinded) study which consists of two parts (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 of this study will assess skin irritation following a single application of GSK2894512 cream at 2 concentrations (e.g. 0.5% and 1%) and placebo by simple-patch test and photo-patch test under semi-occlusive conditions in 20 healthy Japanese volunteers. Part 2 of this study will assess skin irritation following repeat application at 0.5% and 1% of GSK2894512 cream and placebo for 7 days under non-occlusive condition in 6 healthy Japanese volunteers. The study will have Screening visit which will occur within 30 days from the Day 1 visit of each part. Eligible subjects will be able to participate either of Part 1 or Part 2. Subjects will visit the site on Day -1, and hospitalized until the end of all assessments on Day 4 (Part 1) or Day 7 (Part 2). Subjects will re-visit the site on Day 8 (Part 1) or Day 15 (Part 2) for follow-up assessments. This study will be the first to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK2894512 cream after single and repeat application in Japanese subjects. Results from this study will enable further clinical investigation in the Japanese population.</brief_summary>

Clinicallyrelevant skin disease, including psoriasis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, acne, dysplastic nevi, or other skin pathologies, or a history of skin cancer, that may, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicate participation or interfere with test site evaluations. Considered immunocompromised, or has a clinicallyrelevant history of or currently suffering from any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect the evaluation of the study product or place the subject at undue risk. A positive prestudy syphilis, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody, Human Immunodeficiency Virus antigen antibody or Human Tcell Lymphotropic Virus1 result of screening.
