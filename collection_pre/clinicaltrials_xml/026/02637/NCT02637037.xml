Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive at screening 1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study 2. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease, or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs 3. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of investigational medicinal product 4. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis results, as judged by the investigator 5. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in vital signs, as judged by the investigator 6. Any clinically significant abnormalities on 12lead ECG as judged by the investigator 7. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody 8. Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judged by the investigator 9. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of IMP in this study. The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose. 10. Plasma donation within 1 month of screening or any blood donation/loss more than 500 mL during the 3 months prior to screening 11. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to dapagliflozin/metformin XR. 12. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the 3 months prior to screening 13. Positive screen for drugs of abuse, cotinine or alcohol at screening or on each admission to the study center 14. Use of drugs with enzymeinducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP 15. Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed medication including antacids, analgesics (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, vitamins and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long halflife 16. Known or suspected history of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol as judged by the investigator 17. Involvement of any AstraZeneca or study site employee or their close relatives 18. Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements 19. Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship, trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order</criteria>
