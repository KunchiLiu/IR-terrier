	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a prospective analysis of the Alternative Payment Methodology (APM) demonstration project sites. The investigators' goal is to conduct a cross project analysis of findings. The investigators propose to use mixed methods to study processes and outcomes associated with the APM natural experiment in payment reform. The investigators hypothesize that Community Health Centers (CHCs) participating in the APM demonstration project will redesign their workflows to better focus on patient and population health needs, resulting in reallocation of financial resources, lower overall costs, changes in utilization patterns, and improved quality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Community Health Centers' Adoption of a New Global Capitation Payment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Led by the Oregon Primary Care Association, three community health center (CHC) organizations in Oregon developed an Alternative Payment Methodology (APM). Under this APM pilot participating CHCs will receive a prospective payment system (PPS) payment as a capitated equivalent in a per-member-per-month rate for all of their Medicaid patients. Oregon CHC organizations (several clinic sites) implemented Phase I of this demonstration project on March 1, 2013; Phase IIA was implementedon July 1, 2014; Phase IIB on October 1, 2014; and Phase III began July 1, 2015. We are a prospective analysis of the APM project sites. We propose to use mixed methods to study processes and outcomes associated with the APM natural experiment in payment reform. We hypothesize that CHCs participating in the APM demonstration project will redesign their workflows to better focus on patient and population health needs, resulting in reallocation of financial resources, lower overall costs, changes in utilization patterns, and improved quality. The study will include baseline qualitative data collection as clinics are transitioning to the APM methodology. We will conduct 2 site visits to each intervention clinic to observe practice changes that occurred post APM-implementation (first visit approximately 12-18 months post-APM implementation; second visit approximately 30-36 months post-APM implementation). We will also assemble and analyze of pre-post quantitative and qualitative datasets, and interpretation and dissemination of study findings.</detailed_description>
