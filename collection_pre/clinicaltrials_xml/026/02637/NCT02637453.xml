	<brief_summary>Pulmonary vein(PV) isolation has become the cornerstone of radiofrequency ablation for AF. However, recent reports have clearly shown that the longer the follow-up period, the lower the success rate with a single ablation procedure. In 5-year follow-up, the mean success rate was only about 45%. The purpose of the study to investigate whether the linear ablation perpendicular to the PV ostium on the basis of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation, can reduce recurrence rate of AF. All patients will be followed up for 12 months. And fourteen days Holter will be performed at the end of follow-up.</brief_summary>
