	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Fedovapagon for Nocturia in Men With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fedovapagon is a selective vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) agonist that has an antidiuretic effect through stimulation of V2 receptors in the kidney and is being developed for the treatment of nocturia. Nocturia, defined as the complaint that the individual has to wake at night one or more times to void, is a common condition and shows an age-dependent increase in both prevalence and severity (number of nocturnal voids). It has a significant detrimental impact on the quality of life in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of fedovapagon in the treatment of nocturia with BPH.</detailed_description>
