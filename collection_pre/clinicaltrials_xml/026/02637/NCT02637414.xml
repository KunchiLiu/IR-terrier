	<detailed_description>Introduction: Stress related disorders may result in absenteeism and less productivity in companies. This protocol proposes a well-being program, delivered through an application for mobile devices, based on meditation and positive psychology principles such as human development, the improvement of virtues, quality of life and well-being. In the modern world not all people are willing to attend classroom training for several reasons. In this sense, the investigators hypothesize that this program offered in mobile application may promote well-being and reduce stress related problems in the participants. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a well-being program delivered through an application for mobile devices in a sample of employees who work in a company (Natura Inovação/Cosméticos) and in a hospital (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein). Methods: Two hundred and fifty employees from Natura Inovação/Cosméticos and 250 employees from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein will be recruited. The participants will be randomized in two groups of 125 participants each one, half of them in the control group (GC) and the other half to the intervention group (GI), by institution. The GI will participate in the Flourishing App Program, for eight weeks, while the GC will have access to a Control App. Then, after the evaluations, the GC will receive the intervention (Flourishing App Program), while the first group will not receive any intervention. Questions will be applied to evaluate the levels of stress and well-being of participants before and after the program and before and after each training period.</detailed_description>
