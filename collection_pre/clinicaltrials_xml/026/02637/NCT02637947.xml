	<brief_summary>The study purpose is to demonstrate that ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation using the Niobeâ„¢ ES system results in superior outcomes compared to a manual approach in subjects with ischemic scar VT in a low ejection fraction population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of VT Ablation Outcomes Using Remote MAGNETIC Navigation Versus Manual Approach in a Low LVEF Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, single-blind, prospective, multi-center post market evaluation. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility and asked to complete written informed consent prior to any study specific testing assessments. After completing written informed consent, a total of 382 subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive VT ablation treatment using either the Niobe ES or standard manual catheter ablation treatment using commercially available products. This will be the largest randomized VT study comparing outcomes from RMN to manually guided catheter ablation procedures. Subjects will be randomized according to a computer-generated randomization scheme. Randomization will be blocked at the study site level and subjects will be blinded to group assignment. Since quality of life measurements will be collected during follow-up, this study is single-blinded in order to mitigate patient bias. Clinical evaluations will not be masked to the treating physician.</detailed_description>
