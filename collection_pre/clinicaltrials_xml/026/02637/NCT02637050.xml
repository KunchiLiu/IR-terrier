	<criteria>Female and male patients ≥ 18 years of age, diagnosed with CTEPH regardless of the current treatment Availability of a signed informed consent WHO Pulmonary Hypertension clinical classification Group IV (CTEPH): 1. Right heart catheterization (RHC) results that are in line with both of the following haemodynamic levels: Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) ≥ 25 mmHg at rest Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤ 15 mmHg 2. Confirmation of CTEPH diagnosis by one of the following as recommended by standard guidelines: At least 1 (segmental) perfusion defect(s) in ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan or Pulmonary artery obstruction seen by MDCT (multidetector computed tomography) angiography or Pulmonary artery obstruction seen by conventional pulmonary cineangiography (In case of suspicion/diagnosis of 'subacute' Pulmonary Embolism: Patients who are treated with anticoagulation for at least 3 months before diagnosis of CTEPH) Patients with an underlying medical disorder with an anticipated life expectancy less than 6 months Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could jeopardize the safety of the patient or his/her compliance in the study, or otherwise make the patient inappropriate for study participation.</criteria>
