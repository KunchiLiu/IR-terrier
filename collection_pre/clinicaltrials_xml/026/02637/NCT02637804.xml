	<brief_summary>Clinical evaluation of stenfilcon A compared with narafilcon A and delefilcon A This is a total 120 subject, randomized, open label, bilateral wear, two week crossover study (each lens for 1 week) evaluating the clinical performance of stenfilcon A spherical lenses compared to narafilcon A or delefilcon A spherical lenses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daily Disposable Silicone Hydrogel Contact Lens, Stenfilcon A, Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of stenfilcon A compared with narafilcon A and delefilcon A. The study group will be allocated into two groups, of 60 subjects each, based on the control lenses, narafilcon A and delefilcon A spherical lenses. Study groups: 1. stenfilcon A vs. narafilcon A group 2. stenfilcon A vs. delefilcon A group</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she: Is over 18 years of age (inclusive) Has had a selfreported visual exam in the last two years Is an adapted daily disposable nonsilicone hydrogel spherical contact lens wearer Can achieve best corrected spectacle distance visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye. Can achieve a distance visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye with the study contact lenses. Has clear corneas and no active ocular disease Has read, understood and signed the information consent letter. Has a CL (Contact Lens) spherical prescription between 0.75 and 8.00 (inclusive) Is willing to comply with the wear schedule. Is willing to comply with the visit schedule A person will be excluded from the study if he/she: Is not a habitual wearer of daily disposable nonsilicone hydrogel spherical contact lenses Has a CL prescription outside the range of the inclusion power range Has a spectacle cylinder â‰¥1.00D of cylinder in either eye. Has a history of not achieving comfortable CL wear (5 days per week; &gt; 8 hours/day) Has contact lens best corrected distance vision worse than 20/25 in either eye Presence of clinically significant (grade 24) anterior segment abnormalities Presence of ocular or systemic disease or need of medications which might interfere with contact lens wear Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear Has a known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity) Has aphakia, keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea. Has undergone corneal refractive surgery. Is participating in any other type of eye related clinical or research study.</criteria>
