	<brief_title>A Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of IPI-549</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study IPI-549-01 is a first-in-human multicenter, open-label, up to five-part Phase 1/1b dose-escalation study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of IPI-549 monotherapy and IPI-549 in combination with nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Approximately 175 subjects will receive IPI-549, either as a monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab. Subjects will receive IPI-549 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is achieved or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Part A (QD dosing) (and Part B (BID dosing) if necessary) a dose escalation part of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, and PD of IPI-549 as a single agent in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Part A/B will determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for IPI-549 single agent that is going to be administered in Part D as a single agent and Part C in combination with nivolumab. Part C a dose-escalation part of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, and PD of IPI-549 when administered in combination with IV nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Part C will determine the RP2D for the combination of IPI-549 and nivolumab (combination RP2D). Part D will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity of IPI-549 administered as a single agent in a cohort of subjects with advanced solid tumors. Part D, Cycle 2 will also include a pilot food (a high-fat meal) effect evaluation that will have 8 subjects out of the entire cohort of subjects participating in the Part D. Part E will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity of IPI-549 in combination with intravenous (IV) nivolumab 240 mg Q2W in a cohort of subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a cohort of subjects with melanoma and a cohort of subjects with Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck (SCCHN). One or more cohorts of subjects with additional tumor types may be enrolled if supported by data generated in dose escalation or earlier expansion cohorts. To be eligible for enrollment in Part E, subjects must have received an anti-PD1/PD-L1 as their most recent treatment prior to study entry. The dose level to be administered in Part E will be the combination RP2D as determined in Part C.</detailed_description>
