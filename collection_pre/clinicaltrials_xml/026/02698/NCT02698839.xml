	<brief_summary>PIONEER-II RCT trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority registry trial. 539 subjects from about 40 interventional cardiology centers in China will be enrolled to evaluate In-stent late lumen loss(LLL) as the primary endpoint at 9 months. And all the subjects will be followed up to 5 years to attain the data of the secondary endpoints.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of BuMA Supreme Drug Eluting Stent(DES)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Realizing even more uniform and complete endothelial coverage, BuMA Supreme™ biodegradable drug coating coronary stent system comprises a new generation of biodegradable drug eluting stent under development by SINOMED. BuMA Supreme™ reconfigures BuMA™ DES utilizing a high caliber cobalt chromium platform coated with rapidly degrading PLGA scaffold.</detailed_description>
