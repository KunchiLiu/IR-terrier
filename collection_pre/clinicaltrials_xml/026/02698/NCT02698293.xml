	<brief_summary>This is a phase I dose escalation study of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of patients with pre-malignant tumors and superficial microinvasive disease of the anal canal and/or perianal skin. All subjects (a maximum of 12) will be given the photosensitizer Gliolan orally followed by the administration of red light (629-635 nm) to the tumor from a laser. The dose of Gliolan will be 40 mg/kg administered approximately 4-6 hours before light administration. There will be two levels of light dose: 50 and 100 J/cm2, 3-6 patients in each. Patients will be observed for 30 days for the development of DLT. Patients will be followed up for 24 months for additional toxicity and efficacy data collection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Anus Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>A histological or cytological diagnosis of highgrade dysplasia or carcinoma insitu, within past 4 months. Premalignant lesions containing focal microinvasion are eligible when: Surgery is not clinically mandated. Subjects with medical conditions precluding surgery. Subjects whose lesions cannot be completely resected based on size or location, or where significant functional morbidity would be anticipated with further surgery. Patients refuse surgery. The justification for inclusion of patients with microinvasive disease is based reports demonstrating the ability of photodynamic therapy to successfully treat both dysplasia and T1 squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (22). ECOG performance status of 01. 18 years of age or older. Study subjects capable of providing informed consent. Study subjects in whom the lesion has invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the anal cavity which is clinically appreciable. Clinically occult microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the anal cavity which is not focal. Study subjects who are pregnant or lactating. Study subjects who have a platelet count of less than 100,000/cubic mm. Study subjects with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin levels &gt;2X normal or a history of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis of the liver. Significant cardiovascular history that would put the study subject at risk from hypotension that may occur with Gliolan Study subjects with porphyria or hypersensitivity to porphyrins. Study subjects with abnormal baseline creatinine level or diagnosed kidney disease. Study subjects who have a medical history of immune suppression. This will include patients with a past transplantation requiring ongoing immunosuppressive medications. Patients with HIV infection are eligible provided they are on highly active antiretroviral therapy and their most recent CD4 count is &gt;200</criteria>
