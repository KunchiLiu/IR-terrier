	<brief_summary>Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an incurable, devastating, inherited skin disease for which there is only supportive care. RDEB is due to mutations in COL7A1 gene that encodes for type VII collagen (C7), the major component of anchoring fibrils (AFs) mediating epidermal-dermal adherence. Approximately 20% of COL7A1 mutations are nonsense mutations leading to premature stop codons and a truncated C7 with diminished function. The investigators demonstrated that aminoglycosides such as gentamicin readily induce premature termination codon (PTC) "read through" and produce biologically functional C7 in 22 reported COL7A1 nonsense mutations. Importantly, aminoglycoside-induced C7 reversed the abnormal RDEB cell phenotype and incorporated into the dermal-epidermal junction. Herein, the investigators propose the first clinical trial of gentamicin (topical and intradermal) in RDEB patients with nonsense mutations that the investigators have fully characterized. The milestones include increased C7 and AFs at the patients' dermal-epidermal junction, improved RDEB Disease Activity Score, and absence of significant gentamicin side effects.</brief_summary>
