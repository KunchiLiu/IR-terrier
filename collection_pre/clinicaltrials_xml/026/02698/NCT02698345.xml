	<brief_summary>- Prospective, multi-center, single-arm registry study - A total of 100 subjects with isolated popliteal artery lesions according to inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. - All popliteal artery lesions will be treated with drug-eluting balloon (In.PACT Admiral, Medtronic). • Atherectomy or use of bare nitinol stent in combination with drug-eluting balloon is allowed • Patients will be followed clinically for 12 months after the procedure. - Imaging study (Duplex ultrasound, CT angiography or catheter angiography) follow-up will be performed at 12 months.</brief_summary>
