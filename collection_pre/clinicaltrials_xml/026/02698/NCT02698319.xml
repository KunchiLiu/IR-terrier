	<brief_summary>Crowding in the emergency department (ED) is a well documented problem putting patients at risk of adverse outcomes. To combat this, most ED's use some form of triage. In the last two decades systematic triage or process triage has become the norm in most countries but this approach is supported by limited evidence. Our aim is to develop a faster triage model of only a few vital parameters, based on a data from a large cohort of unselected ED patients and evaluate if such a model combined with a clinical assessment by the ED nurse is inferior to existing triage models in a prospective cluster-randomized trial</brief_summary>
