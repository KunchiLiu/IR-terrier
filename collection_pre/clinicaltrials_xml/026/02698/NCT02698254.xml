	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to test the safety of repeat radiation for brain tumors that came back after the first course of radiation. Researchers also want to learn how repeat radiation affects your quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Trial of Dose-Volume Constraints for Reirradiation of Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, you will be treated with radiation. The type of radiation used to treat you will be determined by your doctor. Radiation Therapy: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the dose of radiation will be decided by your radiation oncologist, using guidelines developed for this study. The dose will depend on your age, the type of tumor, your previous radiation treatment, and the amount of time that has passed since your last course of radiation. You will sign a separate consent form for radiation treatment that will describe how the radiation will be administered and its risks in more detail. Before beginning radiation, you will have what is called a "simulation" to plan your radiation. During the simulation, you will be flat on your back on a computed tomography (CT) table and a soft plastic mask will be made to help hold your head still during treatment. This is the position you will be in when you receive radiation treatment. You will then have a CT scan, which will make computerized images to help plan your treatment. This should take about 15 minutes. You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Study Visits: At Months 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25 after radiation therapy: - You will have a physical exam. - You will have an MRI to check the status of the disease. - You will complete questionnaires about your quality of life and symptoms. Starting 2 years after radiation therapy, the study staff will continue checking your medical record to find out about your health status. Length of Treatment: You may receive up to 6 weeks of radiation therapy. You will no longer be able to receive radiation therapy if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your active participation on the study will be over after the last study visit (about 25 months after your radiation). This is an investigational study. Radiation will be provided according to routine clinical standards using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The use of a second course of radiation is investigational. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Brain Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Previous pathologic confirmation of a tumor treated with radiation to the brain completed at least 6 months prior to the start of planned reirradiation, except for patients with tumors that are routinely diagnosed without biopsy, including germinoma and optic pathway glioma. Patients with a history of cranial irradiation for leukemia are eligible. 2. Patient must have received one and only one previous course of radiation to the brain, delivered at 1.5 2.5 Gy/fraction, one fraction per day. 3. Multidisciplinary evaluation of the patient must be performed with a consensus recommendation for reirradiation. 4. Patient may not receive concurrent chemotherapy with reirradiation, other than temozolomide or bevacizumab given at the discretion of the treating neurooncologist. 5. Patient must have imaging findings within the last 3 months consistent with recurrent disease in the brain. Pathologic diagnosis of recurrence is not required. 6. Patient may undergo surgical resection prior to reirradiation. 7. Dosevolume histogram data and crosssectional imaging from previous radiation must be obtained. Electronic dosimetry records in DICOM format from previous radiation are strongly preferred. 8. Signed informed consent by patient and/or parents or legal guardian. 9. Lansky/Karnofsky Performance Status score of 50100. 1. Patients with recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) 2. Pregnancy</criteria>
