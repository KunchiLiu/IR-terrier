	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to demonstrate that in elderly and frail patients, a narrower control of intraoperative blood pressure (BP) by the use of a continuous and noninvasive BP monitoring, coupled with an adequate depth of anesthesia, will reduce the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment and the hospital length of stay.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimized Anesthesia to Reduce Postoperative Cognitive Impairment in the Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative cognitive impairment (delirium and cognitive dysfunction) are frequent and feared complications in the elderly; they increase the postoperative morbidity and mortality, worsen the cognitive and functional outcome with loss of independence and increase the hospitalization length and costs . However, the etiology of these postoperative cognitive impairment, although probably multifactorial, remains unclear and strongly debated. The investigators hypothesize that excessive anesthesia depths associated with intraoperative hypotension may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment following surgery.</detailed_description>
