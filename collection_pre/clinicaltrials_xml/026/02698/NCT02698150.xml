	<brief_title>Remote Monitoring of Patients With Functional Mitral Regurgitation Undergoing Mitraclip Transcatheter Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The scope of the HERMES study is to investigate whether the information obtained by remote monitoring in patients with severe functional mitral regurgitation who have undergone transcatheter mitral valve edge-to-edge repair with the Mitraclip system may have the potential to guide treatment decisions at follow-up visits, and improve the quality of life. Candidates to the Mitraclip procedure on optimal medical therapy will be offered the opportunity to participate to the study by bringing home a tablet and a series of sensors and wearables to collect daily information on blood pressure, oxygen saturation, weight variation, heart rate, symptoms and compliance to therapy. These variables will be blinded, stored by the tablet and downloaded by the core institution at follow-up visits. Clinicians will be encouraged to use these data to guide their decisions, personalizing drug therapies and follow-up schedules to the individual patient's need. Patients that during the run-in phase (from enrollment to 30+-7 days) will have used the tablet for &gt;66% of the days will undergo the Mitraclip procedure and continue to keep the tablet for up to 12 months (active group). Patients that during the run-in phase (from enrollment to 30+-7 days) will have not used the tablet for &gt;66% of the days, will continue the study as a control group. Predefined clinical follow up assessments for collection of study endpoints will be at 1 month post Mitraclip, 6 months post Mitraclip and 12 months post Mitraclip. Quality of life, assessed by means of the SF36v2 questionnaire, will be assessed at enrollment, pre Mitraclip, at 1 month after Mitraclip and at 12 months after Mitraclip. A series of secondary endpoints, including 6MWT assessments and consumption of resources will be also assessed.</detailed_description>
