	<brief_summary>Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) and glistenings development is among the primary reasons for sub-optimal visual capacity following cataract extraction surgery. Primary objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of PCO and glistenings of the popular envista MX-60 intraocular lens (Bausch + Lomb) in a random sample of cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification at least 1 year prior to their enrollment at the study</brief_summary>
