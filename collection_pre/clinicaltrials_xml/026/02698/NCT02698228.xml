	<brief_summary>The goal of the RAPID study is to fundamentally transform the way serious injuries are managed after earthquakes and other disasters by introducing a novel and cost-effective method for pain control. The study will enroll patients in the aftermath of a major earthquake to determine whether regional anesthesia, either with or without ultrasound-guidance, can reduce suffering from lower limb injuries, the most common earthquake-related injury, above and beyond the current standard of care for pain control in these settings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Anaesthesia for Painful Injuries After Disasters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Regional Anaesthesia for Painful Injuries after Disasters (RAPID) study aims to evaluate whether regional anesthesia (RA), either with or without ultrasound (US) guidance, can reduce pain from earthquake-related lower limb injuries in a disaster setting. The proposed study is a blinded, randomized controlled trial among earthquake victims with serious lower extremity injuries in a resource-limited setting. After obtaining informed consent, study participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation to either: standard care (parenteral morphine at 0.1 mg/kg); standard care plus a landmark-guided fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB); or standard care plus an US-guided femoral nerve block. General practice humanitarian response providers who have undergone a focused training in RA will perform nerve blocks with 20 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine. US sham activities will be used in the standard care and FICB arms and a normal saline injection will be given to the control group to blind both participants and non-research team providers. The primary outcome measure will be the summed pain intensity difference calculated using a standard 11-point numerical rating scale reported by patients over 24-hours of follow-up. Secondary outcome measures will include overall analgesic requirements, adverse events and participant satisfaction.</detailed_description>
