	<brief_summary>Bupropion is used in psychological disorder mainly in major depressive disorder (MDD). In China, buproprion Immediate Release (IR) and Sustained Release (SR) tablet have been in market for the treatment of MDD. Bupropion Hydrochloride (HCl) Extended Release (XL) tablets formulation is proposed for marketing approval in China for same indication. Therefore, a pharmacokinetic study is planned to be conducted in Chinese subjects. It is an open label, single-centre and single cycle study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of 150 milligram (mg) and 300 mg following single and repeated daily doses. Approximately 16 males and females Chinese healthy subjects will be enrolled into the study to get 12 completed subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Able to actively communicate with the investigator and to complete the studyrelated documents; able to understand the contents of the Informed consent form (ICF) and to sign a written ICF prior to any studyspecific procedures. Males and females aged between 18 and 45 years inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Nonsmoking healthy males and females as assessed by medical history and physical examination. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters which are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Body weight&gt;=50 kilograms (Kg) and Body mass index (BMI) 19.0 to 25.0 kg/square meter (m^2). A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing and agrees to use the contraception methods during the study and until follow up contact. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use the contraception methods during the study and until follow up contact. ALT, ALP and total bilirubin =&lt;1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5x ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35 percent [%]). Based on single or averaged corrected QT interval (QTc) values of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period: QTc &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch block. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). Drug or alcohol abuse or dependency within one year prior to enrolment. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study, defined as: an average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks. One drink is equivalent to 12 gram (g) of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 millilitre [ml]) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits. Unstable disease conditions; any laboratory measurements assessed by the investigator as clinically relevant (including electroencephalogram [EEG], ECG, haematology, biochemistry and urine analysis, etc.); any disorder that might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drug; or in the investigator's opinion the disease may lead to safety concerns or interfere with the pharmacokinetics assessment. Subjects with concurrent or previous neuropsychological disorders, as assessed by Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating (CSSR) Scale or by the investigator, have suicidal tendency, or have committed suicidal behavior/attempt. Known history of cerebral trauma, previous cerebral disorders, seizures or eating disorder, and other conditions that in the investigator's opinion may increase the risk of seizures. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of Other Criteria Serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody or Syphilis antibody positive. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. Blood donation in the 3 months prior to enrolment. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 ml within a 56 day period. Obvious evidence of active haematological diseases, or significant blood loss in the last 3 months. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within 30 days prior to the first dosing day in the current study. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Known allergy to Bupropion ExtendedRelease Tablets or any of its components. Lactating females or women of child bearing potential used oral or implanted contraceptives within the 30 days prior to enrolment, or received injections of chronically acting contraceptives in the 1 year prior to study initiation. Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Other conditions which, in the Investigator's judgment, render subjects unsuitable for the clinical study.</criteria>
