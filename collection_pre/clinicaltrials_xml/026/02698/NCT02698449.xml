	<brief_title>Neurorehabilitation After Traumatic Brain Injury: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment following moderate to severe traumatic brain injury are usual. To date, cognitive rehabilitation effects on cerebral plasticity and quality of life remain unproven essentially because of methodological biases. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation is an innovative technique of noninvasive brain stimulation that showed efficacy in literature. The current study want to better understand cerebral plasticity mechanisms to optimize non-pharmacological rehabilitation approaches for patients with traumatic brain injury. The aim in the present study is to assess the effect of rehabilitation combined with Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation provided to traumatic brain injury patients with cognitive impairment on cerebral plasticity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Effects of rehabilitation and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation will be observed on functional magnetic resonance imaging activation maps acquired. Relationship between attentional outcomes measured in the neuropsychological assessment and activation extend will be explored.</detailed_description>
