	<brief_title>Bevacizumab and Nimustine in Patients With Recurrent High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although anti-angiogenesis therapy for glioblastoma(GBM) are showing promise, GBMs often develop resistance to treatment within months or weeks after salvage therapy. There are still no effective markers to predict the response rate to bevacizumab. So the investigators initiate a single-arm Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of bevacizumab and nimustine regimen and to explore the predictive markers in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological diagnosis of primary tumor as highgrade gliomas (WHO III or IV) All patients should complete radiotherapy and chemotherapy for primary gliomas Enhanced MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed unequivocal evidence of tumor recurrence or progression. Those patients underwent surgical resection after tumor recurrence can also be enrolled if histological diagnosis of GBM is available, and MRI within 3 days after operation is needed. The patients with recurrent gliomas didn't undergo bevacizumab therapy before enrollment. The time to be enrolled should be more than 90 days after the radiation therapy, more than 28 days after operation for recurrent tumor or prior chemotherapy.
