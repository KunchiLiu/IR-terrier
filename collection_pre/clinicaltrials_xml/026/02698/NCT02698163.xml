	<brief_summary>Non-surgical root canal therapy (RCT) represents a standard of treatment that addresses infected pulp tissue in teeth and protects against future infection while preserving the tooth for the patient for mainly cosmetic purposes. RCT is offered as the better cosmetic, cheaper, and less time intensive treatment option for a patient compared to those of dental implantation. Dental implantation is the alternative to RCT, and they are both originally offered at the time of the initial consultation. RCT involves non-surgically removing dental pulp comprising blood vessels and nerve tissue, decontaminating residually infected tissue, and using a filler material to replace the non-surgically created space where the pulp was removed. Currently, standard of care treatment for RCT utilizes gutta-percha as the root canal filling material. Our research group has previously demonstrated NDGP's improvement in tensile strength compared to those of gutta-percha. This research studies a new type of filler, gutta-percha modified by the addition of nanodiamond material (NDGP). This is an equivalence study of NDGP and standard gutta-percha administration.</brief_summary>
