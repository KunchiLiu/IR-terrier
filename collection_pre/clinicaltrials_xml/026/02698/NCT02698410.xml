	<criteria>Histological documented unresectable advanced (locally or metastatic) well or moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the lung or thymus (typical and atypical carcinoids according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) 2004 criteria); Imaging documented progression within 12 months before screening visit (V1), according to RECIST criteria v 1.1; Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST criteria v 1.1, on a CT scan performed at screening visit (V1); Octreoscan or Ga68DOTATATE/TOC/NOCPETTC within 12 months before screening visit (V1); Adequate liver, renal and bone marrow function. Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma and mixed Neuroendocrine tumours (NET), according to WHO 2004 criteria. Neuroendocrine tumours other than lung or thymus. Nonneuroendocrine thymic neoplasm. Treated with systemic therapies (chemotherapy, interferonalpha, somatostatin analogues, molecular target therapies) within 1 month prior to screening visit (V1). Treated with a number of systemic therapy lines &gt; 3 prior to screening visit (V1), and any of the following: 1. for chemotherapy no more than 1 line prior to V1; 2. for somatostatin analogue no more than 1 line therapy, considered as treatment lasting more than 6 months, prior to V1; 3. no therapy with Temozolomide (TMZ) prior to V1. Received a prior therapy with Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) within 6 months prior to screening visit (V1). Received locoregional therapies (Transarterial embolization, Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, thermoablation with radiofrequency) and Selective internal radiotherapy within 3 months prior to screening visit (V1).
