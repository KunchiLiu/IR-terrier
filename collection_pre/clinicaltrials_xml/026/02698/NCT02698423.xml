	<brief_title>Feasibility and Acceptability of Offering Self-sampling to Non-attendees in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women residing in the canton of Geneva, aged between 25 and 69 years, who haven't had a Pap test in the last three years, will be invited to participate. Participation to the study will be encouraged through public displays, social networks, and medical consultations. Women meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. They will be randomized into two groups and will receive a home-sent letter, inviting them to either come in for a Pap test or to perform and send back the HPV self-sample that they'll receive at their domicile. Both groups will also receive a questionnaire, in order to better understand the reasons for their previous non-attendance to cervical cancer screening.</detailed_description>
