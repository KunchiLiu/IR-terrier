	<brief_title>Prospective Registry on User Experience With The Mapping System For Ablation Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TRUE HD Study is aimed at collecting real-world data on the use of the Rhythmia mapping system and the IntellaMap Orion mapping catheter in patients indicated for ablation procedure with use of a 3D Mapping system. The study will collect specific information on management of ablation procedures with the commercial system including but not limited to acute procedural success, type and proportion of arrhythmias mapped/treated, and how mapping system is used overall. Usage data may be used for the planning of future clinical trials.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who are eligible for an ablation procedure with the Rhythmia 3D mapping system and IntellaMap Orion mapping catheter according to current international and local guidelines (and future revisions) and per physician discretion; Subjects who are willing and capable of providing informed consent; Subjects who are willing and capable of participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation at an approved clinical investigational center; Subjects whose age is 20 years or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and national law. Subjects requiring de novo ablation of atrial fibrillation; Subjects who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that would directly interfere with the current study, except when the subject is participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry with no associated treatments; each instance must be brought to the attention of the sponsor to determine eligibility*; The subject is unable or not willing to complete followup visits and examination for the duration of the study; Subjects who have undergone a previous cardiac ablation within 30 days prior to enrollment; Unrecovered/unresolved Adverse Events from any previous invasive procedure; Women of childbearing potential who are, or plan to become, pregnant during the time of the study (method of assessment upon physician's discretion).</criteria>
