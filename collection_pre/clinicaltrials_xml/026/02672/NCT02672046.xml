	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate an algorithm to screen patients with a possibility of meniscal injury referred to a sports injury outpatient clinic by using patient-reported symptoms. It will be investigated whether the algorithm is able to identify which patients are deemed relevant to undergo assessment by a physician (i.e. in case the patient need to undergo surgery) and which patients are relevant to undergo assessment by a physiotherapist. This will be evaluated by estimating the sensitivity of the new algorithm compared to actual relevancy based on the traditional clinical assessment of the patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimized Referral of Knee Patients at the Clinic of Sports Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to current practice, patients referred to the Clinic of Sports Injuries will be assessed by either a physician or a physiotherapist. Current practice will continue unchanged during this study. Before the scheduled assessment, patients will be asked to fulfill a questionnaire including KOOS, a further description of symptoms, previous treatment by physiotherapist and expected upcoming treatment (i.e. surgery or referral to physiotherapist). An algorithm based on the self-reported information will be used to categorize whether the patient are considered relevant to be referred to assessment by a physician or to assessment by a physiotherapist. After clinical assessment of the patient, the physician or physiotherapist does a registration of diagnosis, choice of treatment and complexity. Based on choice of treatment and complexity, the patient will be categorized as either relevant to be referred to assessment by a physician or to assessment by a physiotherapist. This categorization is by definition considered correct. The ability of the algorithm will be evaluated by comparing it's categorization to the correct result. Sensitivity will be estimated.</detailed_description>
