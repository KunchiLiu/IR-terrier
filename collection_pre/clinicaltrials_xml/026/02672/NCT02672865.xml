	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine safety and tolerability of adjuvant hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with mitomycin and cisplatin in subjects with locally advanced gastric cancer undergoing standard surgical resection. Subjects will be treated with HIPEC using a single dose each of mitomycin 15mg/m2 and cisplatin 50mg/m2 at 41-42 C for 90 minutes, during the definitive surgical procedure for gastric cancer. HIPEC will be performed after resection but before anastomosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment Plan: Patients undergoing definitive resection for gastric cancer and meeting the eligibility criteria will be treated with HIPEC using a single dose each of Mitomycin 15mg/m2 and Cisplatin 50mg/m2 at 41-42 C for 90 minutes. HIPEC will be performed after resection but before anastomosis. Both Cisplatin and Mitomycin are commercially available chemotherapeutic agents and will be obtained as marketed drugs. Outcome Measures: Patients will be followed up for 90 days following surgery and all postoperative complications will be recorded and graded according to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification. Schedule for Follow Up: Trial-related patient assessments will be performed daily while the patient remains in the hospital for postoperative care, and then at postoperative clinic visits. The final postoperative clinic visit for evaluation study outcomes and complications should occur between postoperative days 90 and 95 to allow for a cumulative assessment of the patient's perioperative complications, if any.</detailed_description>
