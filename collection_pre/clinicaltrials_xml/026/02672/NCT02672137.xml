	<brief_title>Knowledge Translation for Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AMI-OPTIMA study was a cluster randomized controlled trial of 24 hospitals to one-year knowledge translation (KT) vs usual care. Prior to randomization, we reviewed charts of 100 consecutive acute coronary syndromes (ACS) patients at each participating hospital in 2009. During one year, hospitals randomized to KT completed: 1) revision of the most recent American Heart Association Guidelines of ACS management, 2) focus groups to identify and solve local care gaps, and 3)local champion team to promote evidence-based medical therapy (EBMT). At the end of 12-month of KT/usual care, we reviewed discharge prescriptions of 100 consecutive ACS patients at each participating hospital (year 2012). EBMT was pre-defined as in-hospital anticoagulation and discharge prescription of dual anti-platelets, beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin pathway modulating agents (for patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function). Refusal, impaired cognitive function, allergy or intolerance of patients to any of EBMT were considered valid reasons for withholding EBMT.</detailed_description>
