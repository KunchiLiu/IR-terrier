	<brief_summary>Study is designed to characterize subject and treating investigator reported outcomes in the early post-treatment period, following bilateral correction of nasolabial folds using Emervel Classic and Emervel Deep. 1. to evaluate subject-reported return to social engagement, after the initial treatment (Baseline/Day 1 visit). 2. to evaluate change in Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at day 30- subject/investigator reported 3. to evaluate subject satisfaction with treatment outcome at baseline, day 14 and day 30. 4. to evaluate change in Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) from baseline to post-treatment follow-up time points at day 14 and Day 30 - investigator reported 5. to evaluate all adverse events during the course of the study</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key 1. Male or female subjects, 35 to 60 years of age 2. Bilateral NLFs: severe (WSRS = 4/4) or moderate (WSRS = 3/3), as assessed by the treating investigator 3. Subjects of childbearing potential who agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception during the study and for 30 days following study completion. Childbearing potential is defined as not being surgically sterile (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or those who are not postmenopausal (absence of menstruation for at least 1 year prior to Day 1). If not surgically sterile or postmenopausal, the subject agrees to use acceptable forms of contraception. Acceptable methods of contraception are defined as follows: 1. use of oral/systemic contraceptives for at least 3 months prior to the start of the study; or 2. use of an intrauterine device; or 3. use of double barrier (e.g., condom or diaphragm and spermicidal foam/gel, condom and diaphragm); or 4. use of contraceptive implants or injectables for at least 28 days prior to the start of the study; or 5. partner with vasectomy at least 3 months prior to study start; or 6. strict abstinence. Females of child bearing potential must have negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) at Day 1 and Day 14 if touchup is to be performed. Key 1. Subject who presents with a severity of wrinkles or folds that require other treatments, e.g. laser treatment, chemical peeling, to achieve optimal correction 2. Previous facial surgery, including aesthetic facial surgical therapy, liposuction or tattoo, in the treatment area 3. Previous tissue augmenting therapy or contouring with permanent fillertype injectable product 4. Previous tissue augmenting therapy with nonpermanent filler or fatinjection in the facial area to be treated, within twelve (12) months before treatment 5. Previous tissue revitalisation treatment with neurotoxin below the zygomatic arch, within six (6) months before treatment 6. Previous tissue revitalisation treatment with laser or light, mesotherapy, chemical peeling or dermabrasion below the zygomatic arch within six (6) months before treatment 7. Subject who presents with severe midface volume loss 8. Subject has a beard or facial hair that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the study injections and/or study assessments 9. Woman who plans to become pregnant during the study 10. Woman who is pregnant or breast feeding 11. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to any injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) gel 12. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to local anaesthetics, e.g. lidocaine or other amidetype anaesthetics 13. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to grampositive bacterial proteins 14. History of severe or multiple allergies manifested by anaphylaxis 15. History of bleeding disorders or treatment with anticoagulants or inhibitors of platelet aggregation within two (2) weeks before treatment 16. Treatment with chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, immunomodulatory therapy (e.g. monoclonal antibodies), systemic or topical (facial) corticosteroids (inhaled corticoids are allowed) within three (3) months before study treatment 17. Any medical condition or treatment that, in the opinion of the treating investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for inclusion 18. Study site personnel, close relatives of the study site personnel (e.g. parents, children, siblings, or spouse), employees, or close relatives of employees at the Sponsor company 19. Participation in any clinical study within thirty (30) days before treatment</criteria>
