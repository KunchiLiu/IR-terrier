	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine the effects of end-stage renal disease on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of apixaban. This is a single-center open-label pharmacological study. Apixaban will be prescribed at the dose of 2.5 mg twice per day for nine days. The concentration of the drug will be measured with repetitive blood tests the first and the eighth day of administration (non-dialysis days). The same blood tests will be repeated before, during, and after dialysis on dialysis days. If the study shows inadequate or suboptimal efficacy with the 2.5 mg dose, it will be repeated with the 5 mg twice-daily dose.</brief_summary>
