	<brief_title>The Evaluation of Pre-Post Smoke Evacuation Uses on Surgical Smoke and Bio-Aerosols in Operating Rooms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose of Project Smoke and bio-aerosols are routinely produced by surgical instruments; eg, lasers, electrosurgical units, radiofrequency devices, ultrasonic devices, power tools. Plume and bio-aerosols contain odor-causing and odorless toxic gases, vapors, dead and live cellular debris (including blood fragments), and viruses. These airborne contaminants can pose respiratory, ocular, dermatological and other health-related risks, including mutagenic and carcinogenic potential, to patients and operating room personnel. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) have also studied electrosurgical smoke at length. Therefore, the equipment of smoke evacuation in OR needs to be used. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the pre-post smoke evacuation uses on surgical smoke and bio-aerosols particles in operating rooms at a university hospital, Thailand. Methodology Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) guideline is used as the conceptual framework of this study including evidence based practice for smoke and bio-aerosols evacuation systems. The study design is a quasi-experimental study (manipulation and control only, without randomization) comparing the amount of surgical smoke and bio-aerosols particles pre- post smoke evacuation uses. The samples consist of 64 cases of surgical patients who receive head-neck or breast surgery and 64 cases of surgical patients who receive abdominal laparoscopic surgery. The amount of surgical smoke and bio-aerosols' particles in the surgical field and OR environment are measured by AeroTraxTM Handheld Airborne Particle Counter Model 9306.</detailed_description>
