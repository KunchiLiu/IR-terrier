	<brief_title>EDWARDS INTUITY Valve System CADENCE-MIS Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized study to compare the cross-clamp time (XCT) and cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPBT) of the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system in a minimally invasive surgical approach (MIS) with any commercially available aortic bioprosthesis in standard full sternotomy surgical approach, in patients with logistic EuroScore &lt; 20 undergoing elective isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. Additionally, the aim is to gather sufficient data to quantify the effect size of short term patient benefit outcomes previously identified from literature and to explore additional healthcare resource utilization endpoints.</detailed_description>
