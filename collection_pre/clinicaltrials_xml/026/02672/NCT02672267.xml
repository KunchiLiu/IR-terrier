	<brief_title>A Study of Allogeneic Low Oxygen Mesenchymal Bone Marrow Cells in Subjects With Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths. Stem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy on ventricular function and profusion. Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different indications. These clinical trials showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias, improvement in functional status and increased ejection fraction. The hMSCs are able to: 1. Prevent reperfusion injury; 2. Prevent excessive fibrosis; 3. Reestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area. 4. Reestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis; 5. Preserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration); 6. Prevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation. It is well accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of diagnosis; 7. Limit infarct size. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by ejection fraction and LVESV preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject quality of life as well as longevity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males and females 1885 years of age. 2. First Acute Myocardial Infarction (STEMI, non STEMI) within 7 days of study enrollment. Myocardial infarction is defined as ECG, Lab and CMR evidences. 3. Subject had successful revascularization within 12 hours of symptoms as evidenced by residual stenosis &lt; 30% and TIMI antegrade flow II or III in the culprit vessel. Revascularization may include one of the following: PCI angioplasty/stenting placement Thrombolytic therapy 4. Life expectancy greater than 12 months. 5. Ability to understand and provide signed informed consent, or have a designated legal guardian or spouse legally able and willing to make such decisions on the subject's behalf. 6. Reasonable expectation that subject will receive standard post myocardial infarction care, unless contraindicated, including medications: • Anticoagulation (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, etc.), betablockers, ace inhibitors, and statin agents, as tolerated. 7. Attend all scheduled safety followup visits. 1. Hemodynamic instability as demonstrated by any of the following: Requirement of intraaortic balloon pump of left ventricular assist device. Need for inotropic support (e.g. dopamine and/or dobutamine) for more than 36 hours for the maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure ≥60 mmHg. 2. History of cancer within the past 5 years, with the exception of localized basal or squamous cell carcinoma. 3. Clinicallysignificant hematologic, hepatic, or renal impairment within 24 hours of study procedure as determined by screening clinical laboratory tests. Severe chronic anemia or hematocrit ≤24%. Liver function tests (total bilirubin at 3 times upper limit of normal, or creatinine level ≥3mg/dL). 4. Presence of any other clinicallysignificant medical condition, psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality, that in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor for which participation in the study would pose a safety risk to the subject. 5. Participation in another study with an investigational drug or device within 3 months prior to stem cell administration. 6. History within the past year of drug or alcohol abuse. 7. Females known to be pregnant, lactating or having a positive pregnancy test (will be tested during screening) or planning to become pregnant during the study. 8. Inability to comply with the conditions of the protocol. 9. Presence of a transplanted tissue or organ or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) (or the expectation of the same within the next 12 months). 10. Planned Automatic Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (AICD) or CRT within the next 12 months. 11. Need for chronic intermittent inotropic therapy. 12. Active myocarditis or early postpartum cardiomyopathy (within the first twelve months of delivery). 13. Porphyria. 14. Allergy to sodium citrate or any "caine" type of local anesthetic. 15. Subject scheduled for hospice care. 16. Clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history, physical examination, ECG (e.g. life threatening arrhythmias, including QTc interval of ≥550 ms) or laboratory tests at the screening assessment that would interfere with the objectives of the study or that would, in the Investigator's opinion, preclude safe completion of the study. 17. Abnormal findings could include: known HIV infection or other immunodeficiency state, chronic active viral infection (such as hepatitis B or C), acute systemic infections (defined as subjects undergoing treatment with antibiotics), gastrointestinal tract bleeding, or any severe or acute concomitant illness or injury. 18. Any other medical, social, or geographical factor that would make it unlikely that the subject could comply with study procedures (e.g., alcohol abuse, lack of permanent residence, severe depression, disorientation, distant location, or a history of noncompliance).</criteria>
