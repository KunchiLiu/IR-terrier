	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate MECC compared with conventional extracorporeal circulation of diabetic patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization procedures. The investigators focused on the effects of extracorporeal circulation especially the renal function between both groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does MiECC Improve Outcome in Diabetic Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Bypass Grafting?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is known having a negative influence referring to systemic inflammatory reaction after cardiac surgery which can cause acute kidney injury (AKI). Miniaturized extracorporeal circulation (MECC) attempts to reduce the adverse effects of conventional extracorporeal circulation bypass. Finally, AKI after CPB is a significant clinical problem that increasingly complicates the course of hospitalization and clinical outcome.</detailed_description>
