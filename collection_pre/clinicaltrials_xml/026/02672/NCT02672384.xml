	<brief_title>Chronic Periodontitis in Critically Ill Patients: Diagnosis and Epidemiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Periodontitis (CP) is a common but under diagnosed chronic infection and inflammation of the periodontal tissue. Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the most common pathogens associated with CP. In patients hospitalised in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), P. gingivalis has been reported to be associated with Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). This pilot study evaluate an easily accessible method the Point of care P. gingivalis tests on saliva and detection of antibodies against P. gingivalis in sera (already validated to diagnose CP in the general population) to dental examination as a gold standard, in ICU patients. A biobank from critically ill patients will be establish for future oral health research in this patient population: for about 50 patients with both samples available, at enrolment and at day 5 +/-2 days after enrolment. Oral pathogens of different sites (tongue, saliva, dental plaque, internal jaw) at enrolment and at day 5 +/- 2 days after enrolment. Samples of periodontal pocket will be collected only for patients diagnosed with CP. When patients will have a pulmonary sample performed in routine, pulmonary sample will also be stored. Plasma and sera will also be taken at enrolment and stored for further research on P. gingivalis and inflammation in ICU patients Patients will be enrolled and will be contacted after 3 months.</detailed_description>
