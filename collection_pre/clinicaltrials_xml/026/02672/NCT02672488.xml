	<brief_summary>Metformin is a widely used oral drug for type 2 diabetes and its antitumor effects have got much more attentions recently. It has been shown that metformin exerts anti-cancer activities in several cancers, including primary liver cancer. In this phase II study, safety and efficacy of the combination of metformin and sorafenib will be evaluated in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Plus Sorafenib for Advanced HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sorafenib is the standard choice for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC-C), but the efficacy is not satisfied. Metformin is a widely used oral drug for type 2 diabetes and its antitumor effects have got much more attentions recently. It has been shown that metformin exerts anti-cancer activities in several cancers, including primary liver cancer. Recent studies suggest that metformin treatment can reduce the risk of HCC in patients with type 2 diabetes and inhibit HCC invasion and increase drug sensitivity to sorafenib, however, the safety and efficacy of combined therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. In this phase II study, patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, measurable disease, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score≤1 will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive the treatment of sorafenib or metformin plus sorafenib. The potential improvement of overall survival, time to progression and safety will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
