	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Patients with Renal Impairment: Have a negative result from a serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative result from a serum or urine pregnancy test on Day 1 If premenopausal, have regular menstrual cycles (cycles of 2435 days duration) over the past 6 months as reported by the patient If female of childbearing potential, agree to use an effective method of contraception (i.e., condom plus diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or nonhormonal intrauterine device) and not become pregnant throughout the study.

Patients with Renal Impairment many be enrolled if the positive test result is due to prescription drug use and approved by the Principal Investigator and Sponsor Study Physician, on a casebycase basis Participation in any other clinical investigation using an experimental drug requiring repeated blood or plasma draws within 30 days of IP administration Participation in a blood or plasma donation program within 60 or 30 days, respectively, of Investigational Product (IP) administration Previously participated in an investigational study of Ulipristal Acetate Breastfeeding</criteria>
