	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well midostaurin and decitabine work in treating older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia and FLT3 mutations. Midostaurin and decitabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Midostaurin and Decitabine in Treating Older Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia and FLT3 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the complete response rate for elderly patients with FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using midostaurin and decitabine. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the 1-year overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) rates. II. Determine overall response rates in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the complete response duration in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the prognostic and predictive factors (FLT3 internal tandem duplication [ITD] versus [vs] tyrosine kinase domain [TKD] mutation) for patients treated with this regimen. II. Explore genetic targets for this disease. OUTLINE: Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-5 and midostaurin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 8-21 of courses 1 and 2, and on days 1-28 of each subsequent course. Patients failing to achieve complete response (CR)/complete response with incomplete recovery (CRi)/partial response (PR)/morphologic leukemia-free state by end of course 2 receive midostaurin PO BID on days 1-28. Patients achieving CR/CRi/PR/morphologic leukemia-free state by end of course 8 may continue on current regimen. Patients failing to achieve a CR/CRi/PR/ morphologic leukemia-free state in bone marrow blasts by end of course 8 go to event monitoring. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>

1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x ULN (does not apply to patients with isolated hyperbilirubinemia [e.g., Gilbert's disease], in that case direct bilirubin should be =&lt;

NOTE: periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception) Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening); NOTE: for female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c): a) Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception b) Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) c) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository NOTE: In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) OR Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 5 months after stopping midostaurin medication NOTE: They should not father a child in this period A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens Immunocompromised patients (other than that related to the use of corticosteroids) including patients confirmed to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or have active viral hepatitis Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements;
