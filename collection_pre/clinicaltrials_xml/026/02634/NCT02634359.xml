	<brief_summary>The study objective is to collect data to assess the accuracy and reliability of Earlysense fertility cycle monitoring performance vs. acceptable known reference methods such as blood tests and intra-vaginal Ultrasound currently used as validated methods to detect ovulation and pregnancy. In addition the collected data will be used to further enhance and improve the existing algorithms.</brief_summary>
