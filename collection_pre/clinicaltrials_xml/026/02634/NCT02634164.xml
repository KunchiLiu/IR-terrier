	<brief_summary>Diabetes is classified as an impairment of the body's ability to control blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can give rise to macrovascular (i.e., heart disease and stroke) and microvasculature damage such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. These comorbidities may definitively reduce quality of life. Hypotheses to be tested: 1. The ingestion of amino acids L-Isoleucine and L-Leucine at a therapeutic dose prior to a glucose load will concurrently and independently improve glucose tolerance. 2. The ingestion of L-Isoleucine and L-Leucine separately or together will have a minimal effect on incretin responses of Glucagon-like peptide-1 and Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GLP-1, GIP).</brief_summary>

These comorbidities may definitively reduce quality of life. Hypotheses to be tested: 1.

Specific Aim I will test the hypothesis that the ingestion of amino acids L-Isoleucine and L-Leucine at a therapeutic dose prior to a glucose load will concurrently and independently improve glucose tolerance. 2. Specific Aim II will test the hypothesis that the ingestion of L-Isoleucine and L-Leucine will have a minimal effect on incretin responses in conjunction with prior research.</detailed_description>
