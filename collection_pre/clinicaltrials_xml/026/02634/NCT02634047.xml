	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate the difference in the first attempt and overall success rate of different techniques for insertion of transesophageal echocardiography. Secondary aim is to investigate the difference of the duration of insertion using the selected technique, complications during insertion such as oropharyngeal mucosal injury and hematoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of McGrath Videolaryngoscope to Assist Transesophageal Echocardiography Probe Insertion in Intubated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty adult patients, who received general anaesthesia for elective open heart surgeries that required transesophageal echocardiography insertion, will be randomized by means of a computer-generated randomization order into two groups: Conventional group (Group C), and videolaryngoscope group (group VL). Success rate of the selected technique (first attempt and overall), duration of insertion for selected technique, complications such as oropharyngeal mucosal injury and hematoma will be noted.</detailed_description>
