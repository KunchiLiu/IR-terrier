	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of gemcabene 600 mg QD compared to placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled on high-intensity or moderate-intensity stable statin therapy. Patients with HeFH, ASCVD, or otherwise uncontrolled, may be included with baseline LDL-C value ≥ 100 mg/dL. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to gemcabene 600 mg QD or placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Provision of written and signed informed consent (by subject or legal guardian) prior to any studyspecific procedures; 2. Male or female (neither pregnant or lactating) ≥ 18 years of age at the time of consent; 3. Currently on a stable, lowfat, lowcholesterol diet in combination with allowed statin doses as described in Table 1, with or without ezetemibe 10 mg QD for at least 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit; 4. Fasting LDLC value ≥ 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) at the Screening Visit; 5. Physical examination, including vital signs, that is within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the Investigator; 6. Weight ≥ 50 kg; with a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 45 kg/m2 7. Subjects with Type 2 diabetes who take antihyperglycemic agents must be on a stable regimen for at least 3 months, with no planned changes in medications for the study duration. Exclusion Criteria 1. Abnormal liver function test at the PreScreening or Screening Visit (AST or ALT) &gt; 2x ULN (upper limit of normal), total bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN, or alkaline phosphate &gt; 2x ULN based on appropriate age and gender normal values. Subjects with bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN and a history of Gilbert's syndrome may be included; relfexive direct bilirubin testing will be used to confirm Gilbert's syndrome; 2. Moderate (Grade B) or severe (Grade C) chronic hepatic impairment according to the ChildPugh classification; 3. Active liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, automimmune hepatitis, liver failure, liver cancer), history of liver transplant, known diagnosis of HIV or AIDS; 4. Triglyceride value ≥ 500 mg/dL at the PreScreening Visit or the Screening Visit; 5. Moderate to severe renal insufficiency define as an estimated GFR &lt; 60mL/min/1.73m (calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation) at the PreScreening Visit or Screening Visit; 6. Abnormal urinalysis (proteinuria greater than trace or any male or nonmenstruating female with greater than trace hematuria) confirmed by reflexive urine protein:creatinine ration testing; 7. Uncontrolled thyroid disease; hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism as defined by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) below the lower limit of normal or &gt; 1.5x ULN, respectively, based on results from the PreScreening Visit or the Screening Visit. If controlled, treatment should be stable for at least 3 months prior to Screening; 8. Type 1 diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c value &gt; 8.5% based on results from the PreScreening or Screening Visit, or taking a thiazolidinedione (i.e. pioglitazone or rosiglitazone); 9. New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure; 10. Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina pectoris, coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, or other major cardiovascular events resulting in hospitalization within 3 months of the Screening Visit. Subjects with adequately treated stable angina, per Investigator assessment, may be included; 11. Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or prolonged QT on the Screening Visit or Day 1 prior to dosing ECG (QTcF &gt; 450 msec for men and &gt; 470 msec for women) or known family history of prolonged QT or unexplained sudden cardiac death; 12. Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as sitting systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg, and confirmed by repeat measurement; 13. Currently receiving cancer treatments or, in the Investigator's opinion, at risk of relapse for recent cancer; 14. Inadequate washout of a PCSK9 inhibitor (8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit), a fibrate lipidregulating agent (6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit), niacins (4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit), or other lipidregulating therapies such as bile acid sequestrants (4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit); 15. Hypersensitivity to or a history of significant adverse reactions to any fibrate lipidregulating agent; 16. Use of any excluded medications or supplements (e.g. potent cytochrome P450 [CYP] 3A4 inhibitors as described in Appendix D; 17. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the past year or inabilty to comply with protocol requirements, including subjects restrictions (see Section 5.6.3); 18. Previously treated with gemcabene (CI1027), participation in another clinical study of an investigational agent or device concurrently or within 1 month prior the Screening Visit, or use of an investigational agent within 1 month or 5 halflives (if known), whichever is longer, prior to the Screening Visit; 19. Any other finding which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or participation in the study.</criteria>
