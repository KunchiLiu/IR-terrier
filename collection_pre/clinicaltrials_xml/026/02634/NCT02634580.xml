	<detailed_description>After screening subject subjects who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized with an allocation ratio of 2:2:1:1 into 4 groups: evolocumab (AMG 145) 420 mg administered by subcutaneous injection monthly and placebo pill daily; evolocumab (AMG 145) 140 mg administered by subcutaneous injection every two weeks and placebo pill by mouth daily; placebo 420 mg administered by subcutaneous injection monthly and ezetimibe 10 mg pill daily; placebo 140 mg administered subcutaneous injection every two weeks and ezetimibe 10 mg pill daily. Randomization will be stratified by screening LDL-C level and baseline statin use. Randomization should occur within 5 - 10 days of the screening LDL-C evaluation used to determine eligibility. Subjects on low or atypical statin dose will continue to take the statin without any dose adjustment for the duration of the blinded portion of the study. After Week 12, ezetimibe will be discontinued and subjects will move to an open label dose of evolocumab administered by subcutaneous injection either every two weeks or monthly and their standard of care.</detailed_description>
