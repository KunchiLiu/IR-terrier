	<brief_summary>To assess and compare the performance of the HR HPV HC2® test (Qiagen/Digene) and the APTIMA® HPV Assay (Hologic) using LBC Specimens (ThinPrep® Pap Test) for the detection of HPV infection and high-grade CIN lesions in a screening population of women 30 years of age or older in Germany.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of the APTIMA® HPV Assay and Comparison With the HR HC2® Test Using LBC ThinPrep® Specimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is conducted in the areas of Tuebingen, Freiburg and Saarbruecken in Germany. In total, 10.000 ThinPrep® LBC cervical samples were collected from June 2009 to May 2012. Liquid based cytology (LBC) was performed by a central laboratory in Saarbruecken. Human papilloma virus (HPV) testing with the HR HPV HC2® test and APTIMA® HPV Assay were performed at the Section of Experimental Virology, Institute of Medical Virology, University Clinic of Tuebingen, Germany (UKT). Within a follow-up phase women who tested positive in any test at baseline will be monitored over a period of 5 years. Study close out visit: In addition, approximately 5 years after baseline ThinPrep® LBC cervical samples will be collected from a random sample of 4000 study participants who tested triple negative at baseline for determination of the longitudinal negative predictive value (NPV) and HPV related disease after a 5 year period. Women who tested positive in any test will undergo colposcopy.</detailed_description>
