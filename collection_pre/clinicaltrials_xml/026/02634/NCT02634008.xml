	<brief_title>Treatment of Recently Acquired Genotype 1 Hepatitis C With the 3D Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of a highly potent IFN-sparing drug combination in the setting of recently acquired genotype (GT) 1 HCV infection is hypothesised to result in the vast majority of patients achieving SVR. In this setting, it is anticipated that therapy can be shortened relative to that used in established chronic infection. A short course IFN-free strategy is likely to be highly attractive to both patients and clinicians and if proven may further encourage early HCV testing and diagnosis. In this pilot study, the investigators plan to explore the safety, efficacy and feasibility of the IFN-sparing combination of paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir, dasabuvir and ribavirin for 8 (and then potentially 6) weeks in patients with documented recently acquired GT 1 HCV infection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provision of written informed consent; Male and female patients aged 18 years and over; Willing to use two effective methods of contraception during the treatment period and 24 weeks post; HCV genotype 1 infection at screening; Detectable HCV RNA at screening (&gt;10,000 IU/ml), and in the opinion of the investigator is unlikely to demonstrate spontaneous viral clearance; Compensated liver disease (ChildPugh A); Negative pregnancy test at screening and immediately prior to first dose of study drugs; Medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history and vital signs; Adequate English to provide reliable responses to the study questionnaires; Recently acquired HCV infection (estimated duration of infection ≤12 months) as defined by*: 1. i) First antiHCV Ab or HCV RNA positive within the previous 6 months and ii) Documented antiHCV Ab negative within the 18 months prior to antiHCV antibody positive result OR 2. i) First antiHCV Ab or HCV RNA positive within the previous 6 months and ii) Acute clinical hepatitis (jaundice or ALT&gt; 10 X ULN) within the previous 12 months prior to first positive HCV antibody or HCV RNA, with no other cause of acute hepatitis identifiable OR 3. For cases of recent HCV reinfection the following criteria are required: Documented prior HCV antibody positive with HCV RNA negative on at least 2 occasions 6 months apart AND new HCV RNA positive within the previous 6 months. * Estimated duration of infection based on midpoint between last antibody or RNA negative and first antibody or HCV RNA positive in the case of seroconversion and 6 weeks prior to date of maximum ALT in the case of acute hepatitis. If coinfection with HIV is documented, the subject must meet the following criteria: On a stable antiretroviral regimen for &gt;8 weeks prior to screening visit, with CD4 T cell count &gt;200 cells/mm3 and a plasma HIV RNA below the limit of detection. Pregnancy/lactation Infection or coinfection with an HCV genotype other than 1 Subject has current or past clinical evidence of decompensated liver disease, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, oesophageal varices, and/or any of the following screening laboratory results; International Normalized Ration (INR) &gt; 1.5; Patients with a known inherited blood disorder and INR &gt; 1.5 may be enrolled after discussion with the Principal Investigator Serum albumin &lt;3.3 g/dL; Serum total bilirubin &gt;1.8 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless isolated in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome; Subject shows evidence of significant liver disease in addition to hepatitis C, which may include but is not limited to drug or alcoholrelated cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or primary biliary cirrhosis; Subject has active malignant disease or history of malignant disease within the past 5 years (with the exception of treated basal cell carcinoma); History of chronic pulmonary disease associated with functional limitation, severe cardiac disease, major organ transplantation or other evidence of severe illness, malignancy, or any other conditions which would make the patient, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study; Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus as evidenced by haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥8.5%; Therapy with any systemic antiviral, antineoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment (including supraphysiologic doses of steroids and radiation) ≤6 months prior to the first dose of study drug Prior treatment failure with an HCV protease inhibitor; Any investigational drug ≤6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug; Positive test at screening for antiHAV IgM Ab, antiHBc IgM Ab or HBsAg; Confirmed presence of hepatocellular carcinoma indicated on imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months prior to screening or on an ultrasound performed at screening (a positive ultrasound result will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI); Subject has history of organ transplant that requires chronic immunosuppression Corneal, skin, and hair grafts are allowed; History of severe psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator is unstable enough to compromise treatment adherence; Subject has evidence of serious or severe bacterial or fungal infection(s), including active tuberculosis; Prohibited medications and herbal remedies as detailed in section 5.5; Screening laboratory tests showing any of the following abnormal results: Haemoglobin &lt;100 g/L Calculated creatinine clearance &lt;50mL/min Platelets &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1,500 cells/µL.</criteria>
