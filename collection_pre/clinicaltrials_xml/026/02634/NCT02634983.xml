	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess global ventilated lung volume in moderate to severe COPD patients using MRI lung imaging after 8 days of treatment with QVA149 compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>QVA Mechanistic Efficacy Study (Receptor Effects, Etc)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current physiological measures of small airway dysfunction are limited, subject to a high degree of variability and do not allow a quantitative assessment of global and regional ventilation defects. The MRI approach represents an opportunity to better understand the impact of a potent dual bronchodilator on the small and central airways and thereby increasing ventilated lung volume, gas exchange, and ventilation-perfusion deficits.This study will investigate the effect of QVA149 on global and regional lung ventilation using MRI lung imaging to enhance the understanding of QVA pharmacology in COPD patients.</detailed_description>
