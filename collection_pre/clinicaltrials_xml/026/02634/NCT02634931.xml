	<brief_title>Long-term Trial of Topical Sirolimus to Angiofibroma in Patient With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease that causes benign tumors on the almost whole body (including skin, brain, kidney, lung and heart), behavior disorder as autism, mental retardation and neurologic symptom as epilepsy. Angiofibroma is a TSC-specific facial skin lesion, and hamartoma caused by increase of the component of skin connective tissues and blood vessels. Other skin lesions due to TSC are white macule (hypomelanotic macule), plaque, shagreen patch and ungual fibromas. Current therapeutic methods for angiofibroma are laser and surgical treatments, but there are problems as many relapses, deficiency of evidence, change of pigment, scar and risk of infection. This is a multicenter and open-label trial. The trial consists of two phase. In the first trial phase for 52 weeks, the efficacy as well as the safety is evaluated. For the second trial phase the trial will be continued until the date of approval of NDA for NPC-12G. The safety is evaluated during the second trial phase, but not the efficacy. Patients who meet all entry criteria for the trial apply 0.2% NPC-12G gel twice a day. Patients will visit at 4 to 5-week intervals for the first 6 months of the first trial phase, and then 3 months intervals thereafter.</detailed_description>
