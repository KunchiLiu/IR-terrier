	<brief_summary>Absolute voice rest is commonly prescribed after vocal fold surgery, also known as phonomicrosurgery, for benign vocal fold lesions. This is thought to decrease scarring of vocal folds, which could result in increasing tissue stiffness and limitations in optimal vocal outcome. Unfortunately there is no standardized protocol as to how long patients should rest their voice after phonomicrosurgery. To date, there are no studies in the literature directly comparing the impact of short-term and long-term voice rest on vocal fold healing and voice outcome after phonomicrosurgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Duration Of Absolute Voice Rest on Voice Outcome After Phonomicrosurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether 3 days versus 7 days of absolute voice rest will result in different voice outcomes in patients who have undergone phonomicrosurgery for benign vocal fold lesions.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patients with benign mid membranous vocal fold lesions such as the following: 1. Polyps 2. Cysts 3. Subepithelial fibrous mass 2. Undergoing elective phonomicrosurgery for vocal fold lesions, which involves microflap excision +/ truncation +/ steroid injection into the vocal folds. 3. Age 18 and older Patients with any of the following will be excluded from the study: 1. Reinke's edema 2. Active smokers 3. Ligamentous mid membranous vocal fold lesions 4. RRP (Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis) 5. Dysplasia 6. CIS (Carcinomainsitu) 7. SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) 8. Extent of surgery exceeds what is mentioned in the inclusion criteria (e.g., CO2 laser, balloon dilatation, vocal fold augmentation in addition to phonomicrosurgery) 9. Previous vocal fold surgery 10. Systemic steroids 11. History of systemic illness that could affect wound healing</criteria>
