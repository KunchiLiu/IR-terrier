	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if an eight week multimodal Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP) intervention can effectively improve symptom severity, frequency and quality of life (Q.O.L) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. This will be measured by a reduction in AF symptom score, perceived stress, anxiety, hostility and depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program on Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a very common cardiovascular disease. Symptoms include dizziness, palpitations, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, fatigue and exercise intolerance. AF is also associated with a high risk of complications like thrombo-embolism and stroke, heart failure, dementia. The presence and severity of these symptoms and complications adversely affect a patient's health related quality of life. Improvement in quality of life (QOL) is an important measure for evaluating response to treatment in AF patients. Depression and anxiety are significant part of the psychosocial burden faced by approximately one-third of AF patients, and are important components that effect QOL in these patients. In this study the investigators will apply the 3RP (Relaxation Response Resiliency Program - developed at the Benson Henry Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital) intervention among AF patients to assess the reduction in their stress, anxiety and depression levels and the reduction in AF symptom burden and severity.</detailed_description>
