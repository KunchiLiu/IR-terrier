	<brief_summary>In this randomized clinical trial, subjects will be assigned to either an assay-guided treatment condition (AGT) or a treatment-as-usual condition (TAU). All subjects will provide a DNA sample at the Screening Visit for the Genecept Assay ™. In the AGT condition, assay results will be provided to the treating investigator, who will use the results to guide antidepressant pharmacotherapy. In the TAU condition, the investigator will treat the subjects without the knowledge of the pharmacogenetic testing results. Assay results for all subjects will be provided to the investigator once all Week 8 visit procedures have been completed. Raters of the primary endpoint assessment and subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age 1875 years; SubGroup Age =/&gt; 65 years 2. Ability to understand and provide informed consent 3. Ability to understand, read and speak English 4. Primary diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (without psychosis) based on DSM5 criteria and MINI 7.0 5. SIGHD17 score &gt;18 (i.e., moderate depression) at Screening and Baseline 6. Failure of at least 1 prior adequate trial of standard antidepressant in the current major depressive episode (using ATRQ criteria i.e., 6 weeks at adequate dose) due to inefficacy, side effects or intolerability 7. Subject is willing to follow study instructions, complete study assessments and likely to complete all required visits 1. Severe personality traits (based on DSM5 criteria) that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the participation in the study or the evaluation of efficacy and safety and all diagnosed Personality Disorders 2. Current DSM5 diagnosis of Neurocognitive Disorders, Schizophrenia Spectrum (lifetime diagnosis) and other Psychotic Disorders, Bipolar and Related disorders (lifetime diagnosis*), Trauma and Stress related Disorders, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Related Disorders. Other DSM5 disorders that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the participation in the study or the evaluation of efficacy and safety. 3. DSM5 diagnosis of Substance Related and Addictive Disorders diagnosed in the last 12 months (other than tobacco and caffeine) 4. History of Suicidal Behavior within 12 months of screening or presence of Active Suicidal Ideation with Intent in the past 12 months (Items 4 or 5) at Screening or Baseline, as determined by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS), or subject is considered to be an acute suicide risk in the clinical judgment of the investigator 5. Previous homicidal behavior or acute homicidal risk at Screening or Baseline, in the clinical judgment of the investigator 6. Four (4) or more failed pharmacologic interventions for depression in the current major depressive episode (One of the four failed interventions must meet ATRQ criteria i.e., 6 weeks at adequate dose). 7. Subjects who are not willing to take psychotropic medications for treatment of MDD. 8. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (TMS) started within 90 days of screening or planned during the study. 9. Subjects with a vagus nerve or deep brain stimulator are prohibited from the trial. 10. Psychotherapy including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) started within 90 days of screening or planned during the study. 11. Unstable or active medical condition(s) which in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the subject's safety or interfere with participation of the study or confound evaluation of efficacy or safety. 12. Current diagnosis of unstable hypothyroidism. 13. Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy during the study or believe they may be pregnant at Screening or Baseline. 14. Participation in another investigative trial within 30 days of screening 15. Subject previously treated with the use of a similar psychotropic genetic testing assay. 16. Subject tests positive for illicit drug use on the urine drug screen (UDS) at the screen visit (including Marijuana where legal).</criteria>
