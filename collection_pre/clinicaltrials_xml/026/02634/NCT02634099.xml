	<brief_title>A Comparison of Three Methods of Hemoglobin Monitoring in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Major Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the study is to compare 3 methods of hemoglobin measurement in pediatric patients undergoing major surgery. During general anesthesia investigators will measure and compare at different periods of time blood hemoglobin levels obtained from a radial artery catheter with 2 non invasive methods of measurement using hemocue and SpHb</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Paediatric patients scheduled for major orthopaedi or neurosurgical process under general anesthesia Arterial catheter necessary in the anesthetic protocol.
