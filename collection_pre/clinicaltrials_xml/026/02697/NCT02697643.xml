	<brief_summary>For behavioral health clinicians who are interested in getting tailored treatment and level of care recommendations, "BH-CDS" is a desktop/tablet web-based application that provides clinicians with data and a rationale for better decision-making to improve patient care. Few Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are available for Behavioral Health, and unlike existing CDS this product will compile relevant patient data and organize these data into general treatment recommendations linked to the patient's presenting circumstances, symptoms and substance use issues. The BH-CDS solution shall factor patient characteristics into a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) that will group patients according to their responses with other patients with similar responses (i.e., a subgroup or "class"). Once patients have been assigned to a class, the solution shall present recommendations to counselors that use the software.</brief_summary>
