	<brief_summary>Study design is a prospective, randomised, double-blind, and interventional. Primary aim of the study is to investigate efficacy of antiseptic-coated intermittent hydrophilic urinary catheters in prevention and reduction of catheter-associated urinary tract infections in children with neurogenic bladder. Secondary aim is to assess feasibility of antiseptic-coated intermittent hydrophilic urinary catheters in neurogenic bladder management. Octenidine chloride will be used as antiseptic.</brief_summary>
