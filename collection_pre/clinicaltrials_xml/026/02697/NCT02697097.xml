	<mesh_term>Femoracetabular Impingement</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Males and Females. Aged 1830. Control group Normal range of movement and no evidence of femoroacetabular impingement on clinical examination (negative impingement test, no symptoms). Participants with femoroacetabular impingement as diagnosed clinically and on radiological imaging for the comparison group (MRI). Patients under the age of 18. Patients over the age of 30. Control group evidence of underlying pathology affecting the hip, abnormal range of motion, evidence of femoroacetabular impingement on clinical examination. Previous surgery of the hip joints. Medical history of arthritis (including rheumatoid and reactive). Family history of femoroacetabular impingement (control arm participants). Patients who are currently experiencing or have experienced hip pain in the previous 1 year (control arm). Other conditions (e.g. neurological, muscular dystrophy etc) which may affect hip muscle strength.</criteria>
