	<brief_title>Pilot Pharmacokinetic Study of Oral Testosterone Ester Formulations in Hypogonadal Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five period cross-over study in which subjects received a single day of dosing in each period. Dosing was either QD or BID with one of two T esters (T-enanthate (TE) or T-undecanoate (TU)). Dosing was within 5 minutes of meals (breakfast and for BID dosing dinner). There was a minimum of a 5-day washout between periods. Subjects were hypogonadal men.</detailed_description>
