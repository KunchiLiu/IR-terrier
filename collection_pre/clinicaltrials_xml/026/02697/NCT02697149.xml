	<brief_summary>Radiation exposure may put endoscopists at risk when performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Although non-radiation endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was reported in pregnant women in previous reports, it remains unclear whether endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is also effective and safe when endoscopists were not expose to radiation. This study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of nonradiation-to-endoscopist endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with complexity level I/II.</brief_summary>
