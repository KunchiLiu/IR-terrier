	<brief_title>The Effect of Subsartorial Saphenous Block on Postoperative Pain Following Major Ankle and Hind Foot Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major ankle and hind foot surgery causes intense postoperative pain. Implementation of continuous sciatic catheters has been a great success in reducing postoperative pain following these operations, but despite an effective sciatic catheter patients still report moderate to severe pain from the anteromedial side of the ankle. According to cadaver dissection studies the saphenous nerve innervates the anterior and medial parts of the ankle and talonavicular joint, and even though a saphenous block is standard procedure in many departments of anesthesiology worldwide, scientific evidence regarding the effect of the saphenous block on postoperative pain is lacking. This study investigates the effect of a selective, ultrasound-guided subsartorial saphenous block on postoperative pain following major ankle and hind foot surgery.</detailed_description>
