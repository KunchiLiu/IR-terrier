	<brief_title>Trial of a Social Marketing Campaign to Increase HPV Vaccination Among Mexican American Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will assess a social marketing campaign on HPV vaccination with and without a text messaging reminder system targeting Mexican Americans in a community-based setting, at the Ventanilla De Salud (Health Window, VDS) program of the Mexican Consulate. Investigators plan on recruiting 200 Mexican American parents of children ages 9 through 17. Every VDS attendee eligible for the study and who is willing to consent to participate will be invited to the study. Consenting participants will be randomized to either a follow-up reminder text messaging system or to the group which will not receive the text messaging reminders. All participants, regardless of text messaging arm, will evaluate the campaign and investigators will assess adherence to the HPV vaccine for the total sample.</detailed_description>
