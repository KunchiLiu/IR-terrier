	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the persistence of anti-Hep B antibody at 9 to 10 years of age after the last priming dose in subjects who completed study A3L12 (NCT00401531), and also evaluate the immune response against hepatitis B one month after vaccination (challenge vaccination) with a stand alone monovalent hepatitis B vaccine. Primary objectives: - To describe the persistence of anti-hepatitis B antibody at 9 to 10 years of age after last priming dose in subjects having received hepatitis B vaccine at birth and a hexavalent vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months of age according to the vaccine received during A3L12 study (Hexaxim® [Group 1] or Infanrix® hexa [Group 2]) - To evaluate the immune response against hepatitis B one month after vaccination with a stand alone monovalent hepatitis B vaccine (challenge vaccination). Secondary objectives: - To describe serious adverse events (SAEs) reported throughout the trial after administration of hepatitis B vaccine.</brief_summary>
