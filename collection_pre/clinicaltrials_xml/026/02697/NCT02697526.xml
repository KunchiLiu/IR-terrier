	<brief_title>Differences in Radial Artery Occlusion From Two Different Compressive Methods Used in Patients in Order to Achieve Homeostasis After Transradial Catheterization and Their Repercussion in Artery Functionality and Hand Mobility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes in Allen's test and pulse oximetry will be evaluated at baseline, 1 week and 3 month of catheterization in both groups of patients in order to check the functionality of the communications between the ulnar and radial arteries. The repercussion of each compressive method on radial occlusion and artery revascularization will be assessed by eco-Doppler at any time. Changes in diameter of arterial lumen of radial and ulnar arteries as a consequence of radial occlusion will be done simultaneously of blood flow Doppler measurements. The possible impact of radial occlusion on hand mobility will be done using a dynamometer designed to evaluate strength (Endurance test) and muscular claudication (Rapid exchange test).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients in whom at least the diagnostic catheterization has been done successfully by the radial artery route. Patients with a negative Allen's Clinical test showing hyperemia before 9 seconds after pressure release over the ulnar artery pulse. Patients showing a Barbeau pattern A,B or C with the pulsioximetric test after releasing pressure over the ulnar artery pulse. Patients that will be able to do the follow up visits at 1 week and 3 month. Signature of informed consent Patients in that neither the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure has successfully done via the radial artery route. Patients with a positive Allen's test (no hyperemia) after pressure and release over the ulnar artery pulse. Patients showing a Barbeau pattern D with the pulsioximetric test after releasing pressure over the ulnar artery pulse. Inability to visit at 1 week and 3 month. Impossibility to obtain informed consent form</criteria>
