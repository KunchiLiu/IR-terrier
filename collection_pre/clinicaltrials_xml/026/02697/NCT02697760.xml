	<brief_title>The CZT Dynamic Myocardial Perfusion Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) provide incremental diagnostic and prognostic information over relative perfusion alone. Recent development of dedicated cardiac SPECT cameras with better sensitivity and temporal resolution make dynamic SPECT imaging more practical. The potential roles of myocardial perfusion in subjects with cardiovascular risks and heart failure warrant further investigations. The present project aims to develop and validate the noninvasive measurement of MBF and MFR by using dynamic imaging with a CZT camera, and evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic implications.</detailed_description>
