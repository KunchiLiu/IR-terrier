	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate clinically and radiographically the effect of Mucograft® seal when used for the ridge preservation procedure in combination with Freeze Dried Bone Allograft (FDBA) at the extraction site in terms of hard and soft tissue remodeling after 4 months healing period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Mucograft® Seal on Post-extraction Ridge Preservation Using Bone Allograft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the serious consequences of single or multiple tooth extraction is the bone resorption that follows, which may create aesthetic problems and compromise future implant placement. Ridge preservation procedures typically use a combination of a scaffold and a membrane. Scaffolds most commonly used are bone grafts; autogenous, allografts, xenografts, and alloplasts. Among these bone grafts, allograft materials such as Demineralized Freeze Dried Bone Allograft (DFDBA) and Freeze Dried Bone Allograft (FDBA) are frequently used in site preservation procedures. An additional alternative is to use a collagen sponge (CS) in the extraction socket to prevent the infiltration of soft tissues to the lower area and to protect and maintain bone graft materials. Although ridge preservation has several benefits, it also has several risks and limitations, such as membrane exposure and possible infection, loss or fibrous encapsulation of graft particles, longer healing period prior to implant placement, invasive and technique sensitive procedure, additional cost, and possible soft tissue dehiscence in bone grafted sites compared with non-grafted sites. Therefore, any modifications of the technique that will reduce these risks and limitations would be advantageous. Mucograft® TM has been specifically designed for soft-tissue regeneration. Its bi-layer structure supports tissue in-growth and regeneration and promotes cellular and extracellular integration within the host tissue. Clinically, this new collagen membrane was associated with a sufficient width of newly formed attached gingiva with coverage of Miller class-I and class-II recession defects. These results suggest that the use of Mucograft® TM in periodontal plastic surgery may provide a viable source of grafting material as an alternative to autogenous and non-autogenous soft tissue graft materials. This study is a clinical and radiographic, randomized parallel arm comparative evaluation of the addition of Mucograft® seal to FDBA in the ridge preservation procedure. Group A will receive FDBA and a CS. Group B will receive FDBA with Mucograft® seal.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Be at least 18 years of age. Have unsalvageable nonadjacent nonmolar teeth scheduled for extraction: maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars, and mandibular canines and premolars that require an extraction with ridge preservation planned for delayed implant placement. If a subject has multiple teeth to be extracted, only one tooth will be included in the study. Presence of buccal plate at the extraction site as determined by first sectional CBCT scan. Patients who are currently treatment planned in the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) periodontology clinic to receive ridge preservation and meet all medical and dental requirements of the TUSDM periodontology clinic for periodontal surgery (e.g., subjects with no diseases or medication allergies contraindicating periodontal surgery). Display no evidence of acute periodontal infection: e.g., abscess, suppuration, severe swelling and/or spontaneous bleeding. Nonsmoker or smoke less than 10 cigarettes per day. Not participating in any other research study for the duration of this study. Have any known disease that interferes with periodontal surgery and would not allow the patient to be treatment planned for the procedures in the TUSDM periodontology clinic (e.g., severe anemia, low white blood cell count, bleeding or coagulation disorder, uncontrolled hypertension (150/90), recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months of enrollment), diabetes (HbA1C ≥7%), HIV/AIDS (selfreported), history of or currently undergoing head and neck radiation, history of or currently taking bisphosphonates, endocrineinduced bone diseases (e.g. hyperparathyroidism), immunosuppressive therapy). Have limited mental capacity and unable to give informed consent. Be a pregnant or lactating female (selfreported) (following TUSDM periodontology clinic guidelines elective surgical procedures and radiographs/CBCT scans are usually postponed until after delivery). Any known allergy/hypersensitivity to FDBA (contains trace amount of gentamicin, providoneiodine), CS or Mucograft® seal. Any known allergy to yeast. Have untreated acute infection at surgical site. Have untreated malignant neoplasm. Individuals opposed to having porcine derived materials placed in their mouth due to any personal reasons such as religious reasons. Teeth requiring flap reflection for extraction, e.g. deep subgingival caries or fractures.</criteria>
