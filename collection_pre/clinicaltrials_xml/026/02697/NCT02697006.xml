	<criteria>Patients in cardiogenic shock in the setting of acute myocardial infarction or Patients undergoing high risk coronary revascularization procedures (e.g., multivessel disease, left main, or last patent conduit interventions) in the catheterization lab. Cardiogenic shock is defined as Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg for at least 30 min or Inotropes are needed to maintain blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg or Clinical signs of heart insufficiency with pulmonary congestion or Signs of end organ hypoperfusion with at least one of the following criteria: Altered mental status cold, damp skin or extremities oliguria (≤ 30 mL/h) serum lactate &gt; 2.0 mmol/L Written consent of the patient or the legal caregiver Age &gt; 85 years Cardiac arrest out of hospital with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) &gt; 10 min Coma with fixed pupils not induced by drugs; Mechanical causes for cardiogenic shock (ventricular septal defect of papillary muscle rupture) Noncardiogenic causes of shock (bradycardia, sepsis, hypovolemia, etc.) Fever (Body temperature &gt; 38.0 °C) or other evidence of sepsis Onset of cardiogenic shock &gt; 6 h before enrollment; Lactate &gt; 22 mmol/L; Massive pulmonary embolism; Severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease precluding insertion of femoral arterial or venous catheters Previous known aortic regurgitation greater than grade II Contraindications for anticoagulation Severe hemolysis of any cause Patient is participating in an investigational drug or device study trial that has not reached the primary endpoint or that interferes with the current study endpoints.</criteria>
