	<detailed_description>Participant will be allowed to choose how they would like to receive study-related communications (such as text messages, email, phone call, or in person) about visit reminders and study letters. Participant will be told about which methods are secured and which are not. If participant chooses to receive communications by an unsecured method, they will need to sign a consent document to confirm their preference. If participant does not wish to sign the communication consent form, they will automatically receive their communications in a secure manner (such as telephone call, encrypted email, or in-person). Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. Participant will have an equal chance of being assigned to Group 1 or 2. - If participant is in Group 1, they will receive an active nicotine patch and BATS counseling, which focuses on helping to increase rewarding experiences while quitting smoking. - If participant is in Group 2, they will receive an active nicotine patch and Health Education/ Smoking Cessation counseling, which focuses on coping strategies for not smoking and related health issues. Participant will not know which group they are assigned to. Study Drug Administration: Participant will start using their nicotine patches on their scheduled quit day, which is about 4 weeks from the beginning of the study (the day before Visit 4). Participant should apply the nicotine patch to the upper arm. Participant should put it in a slightly different place each day to avoid skin irritation. Participant may take the patch off at night to avoid sleeping problems. Participant will be given a study diary to record how many cigarettes they smoke (if any) each day while they are on study. Participant must return their study diary and any unused study patches at Visit 9. Study Visits (Visits 1-9): At Visit 1: - Urine will be collected for a routine test to check participant's nicotine, cotinine and anabasine levels. Cotinine is a chemical released in participant's body when it breaks down nicotine and will show whether and how much they have recently smoked. Anabasine is used to show if nicotine is found in the urine due to a nicotine replacement therapy or from tobacco use. - Participant's CO level and weight will be measured. - Participant will also perform tasks related to smoking behavior that will take 45 minutes. At every study visit: - Participant will complete questionnaires about several topics, including depression, suicide, their smoking behavior, and any side effects from the study patch. These questionnaires should take about 45-60 minutes in total to complete. - Participant will receive counseling about quitting smoking, where they will talk about possible "triggers" for smoking and strategies for dealing with quitting smoking. These sessions will take about 45 minutes each. These sessions may be audiotaped. During counseling on Visit 1, participant will set a "quit date" for stopping smoking, about 3 weeks later. Participant should not quit smoking before the quit date. Participant may also set goals to reduce their smoking before that point. Participant should try to stay smoke-free after the quit date. Participant will also be given a drug instruction sheet, a card with emergency contact information, and a participant manual to help participant follow along with the topics discussed during counseling. Lab Session: Participant will take part in a lab session at or before Visit 1 to test their brain activity. Participant will be asked to watch a series of slides. The slides will include pictures of people, nature, and artwork. Slides showing nude people, medical procedures, and victims of car crashes will also be shown. Participant will be shown examples of these slides before beginning the procedure and given the opportunity to withdraw from the study at that point. During the lab session, participant's brain electrical activity will be checked with an electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, small sensors will be placed on participant's scalp and face. Participant should not drink more than 2 cups of coffee or other caffeinated drinks for at least 2Â½ hours before the session. At the lab session, participant may be asked to smoke a cigarette if the doctor thinks it is needed for them to show their normal smoking behavior. Participant will also complete computer tasks, including questionnaires that will measure their emotions and attention level. These tasks should take about 90 minutes to complete. The lab session may last up to 2 hours total. Length of Treatment: Participant will receive the nicotine patch for up to 8 weeks. Participant will be taken off study early if the study staff thinks it is in their best interest or if they are unable to follow study directions. Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits (Visits 9 and 10, below). End-of-Treatment Visit (Visit 9): After participant has finished using the nicotine patch, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - Participant's CO level will be measured. - Urine will be collected to measure participant's cotinine and anabasine levels. - Participant will complete the same questionnaires they completed at the regular study visits. Follow-Up Visit (Visit 10): At about 3 months after participant has stopped smoking, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - Participant's CO level will be measured. - Urine will be collected to measure participant's cotinine and anabasine levels. - Participant will complete the same questionnaires they completed at the regular study visits. This is an investigational study. The nicotine patch is FDA approved and commercially available to help people stop smoking. Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this portion of the study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
