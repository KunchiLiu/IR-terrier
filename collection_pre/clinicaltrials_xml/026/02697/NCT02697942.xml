	<brief_title>Hemodialysis-based Interventions to Preserve Cognitive Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a pilot, single center, randomized, controlled trial to slow cognitive decline in adults undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The investigators primary objective is to demonstrate feasibility for the interventions (cognitive training and exercise training) in Aim 1. The investigators will formally test whether whether cognitive training (tablet-based brain games) and exercise training (stationary foot pedal) administered during HD slow cognitive decline as well as improve secondary outcomes (physical function, frailty, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as part of Aim 2. The investigators will compare these two interventions against the standard of care. Pre- and post-intervention assessments will be conducted at the dialysis unit by a study coordinator and by research assistants. Participants will be followed for 6 months to assess cognitive decline.</detailed_description>
