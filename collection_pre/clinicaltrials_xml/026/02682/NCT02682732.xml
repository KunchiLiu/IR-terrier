	<brief_summary>The current understanding of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is that one site of bone marrow (BM) sampling serves as a window that represents all AML cells distributed throughout the BM, an assumption that has yet to be questioned. Simulation in mice led to inconsistent representation of the full BM, which can incorrectly suggest the absence of leukemic cells. Positron-emission tomography (PET) scan can detect areas of high metabolic activity in the body using for instance a radioactive sugar. In one report, its use in human AML has provided proof-of-principle evidence of unequal distribution of AML cells in BM. Accordingly, the alternative hypothesis is to test if PET scan can demonstrate if BM geography can alter AML cells spread and home them as distinct areas rather than uniform spread as if they are distributed in liquid state.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>New diagnosis of AML according to the WHO (World Health Organization) criteria Prior malignancy, unless the patient has been diseasefree for at least five years following curative intent therapy, with the following exceptions: patients with treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the diseasefree duration, if definitive treatment for the condition has been completed; or patients with organconfined prostate cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 3 or more Inadequate renal function (i.e., estimated GFR (glomerular filtration rate) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2). Inadequate hepatic function (i.e., serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5×ULN; AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase) &gt; 2.5×ULN) Presence of uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infections (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment). Having any other severe concurrent disease or serious organ dysfunction that may place the patient at undue risk to receive induction therapy. Pregnancy or lactating female.</criteria>
