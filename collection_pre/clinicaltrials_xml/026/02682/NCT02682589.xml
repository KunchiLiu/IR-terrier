	<brief_title>Open Versus Laparoscopic Complete Mesocolic Excision for Locally Advanced Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (CME) in treating colon cancer has been reported to be feasible and safe and holds many advantages when compared with traditional open surgery, such as reducing preoperative blood loss, alleviating postoperative pain and reducing complications and length of hospital stay. Whether laparoscopic CME could achieve an equivalent oncological outcome, especially for locally advanced malignancy, is still being discussed. The purpose of this study is to determine the short and long outcomes of open and laparoscopic CME for locally advanced colon cancer patients. The primary endpoint is the 5-year disease-free survival rate. Secondary endpoints include completeness of mesocolon, morbidity and mortality, local recurrence, overall survival, quality of life et al. In this study, eligible patient will be randomly allocated to receive either open or laparoscopic CME surgery. Randomization will be performed centrally and be stratified for age, gender, T-stage, tumor location. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio, in favor of the laparoscopic CME. The extent of resection according to CME principle is identical for both arms. CME involves the removal of the afflicted colon and its accessory lymphvascular supply at their origins by resecting the colon and mesocolon in an intact envelope of visceral peritoneum and mesenteric fascia. Type of anastomosis, location of auxiliary incision and drainage of surgical field are up to the discretion of the surgeon. In laparoscopic surgery, a "medial-to-lateral" approach and a no-touch isolation are required . Intraoperative pictures were taken at various stages, as were photographs of the postoperative specimen, which will be assessed by a third-party expert to qualify the surgery. The baseline demographics and conditions as well as the perioperative and postoperative outcomes will be recorded through a prior designed format. Our study is expected to last seven years, of which two years for recruiting patients, five years for follow-up. Patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 year, every 6 months for 3 years postoperatively.</detailed_description>
