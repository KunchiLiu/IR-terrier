	<brief_summary>The natural course of extracapillary glomerulonephritis is severe leading to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or death in most cases. Despite immunosuppressive treatment, long-term renal outcome remains poor since active crescents usually progress to fibrotic scars with glomerular occlusion and disruption.In experimental models Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor therapy targeting the over-expression of angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors, that are responsible for dysregulated proliferation of parietal cell progenitors, blocks the formation of crescents and their fibrotic evolution. Should these drugs have similar effects in humans, ACE-inhibitor therapy on top of standard immunosuppression might be instrumental to prevent ESRD and promote renal function recovery in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
