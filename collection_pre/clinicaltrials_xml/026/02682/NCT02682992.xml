	<brief_title>Low-Level Laser Therapy for Prevention of Oral Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase II, single-arm trial to examine the efficacy of prophylactic low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to reduce the incidence of oral mucositis and adverse events in patients receiving combined modality therapy consisting of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled to receive prophylactic LLLT in addition to standard of care measures for oral mucositis or other toxicity of therapy. The radiation and chemotherapy dose, schedule, modality, technique, and any required adjustments will not be influenced by this protocol and will follow standard existing institutional practices. Patients will receive LLLT three times per week concurrently with chemoradiotherapy. LLLT may be delivered either immediately prior to or after the patient's daily fraction of radiotherapy. Patients will be treated extra-orally with a THORÂ® LED cluster for one minute along the buccal mucosa on each side and intraorally for one minute to the tongue and soft palate. During each LLLT treatment session a thorough oral exam will be performed to identify any areas of mucositis. If the patient should develop intraoral lesions they will be targeted directly with the intraoral probe for one minute to each site of mucositis. The laser settings to be used are as follows: frequency 2.5 Hz; wavelength 660 nm; and power 75 mW, for an energy of 4.5 J. Patients will be evaluated prior to therapy, weekly during therapy, two weeks after the completion of therapy, and three months after the completion of therapy. During each assessment, the following toxicities will be assessed: pain, mucositis, dysphagia, xerostomia, dysgeusia, dermatitis, trismus, and quality of life. Previous studies indicate that approximately 40% of patients will experience severe mucositis with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy. The hypothesis in this trial is that the addition of LLLT to this treatment regimen will decrease the rate of severe acute OM to 20%. We plan to enroll 25 patients at our institution in 12 months after the trial opens.</detailed_description>
