	<brief_summary>Teduglutide is approved for treatment of adults with short bowel syndrome (SBS). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in children up to the age of 17 with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support. Subjects may choose whether to receive the study drug or to participate in a standard-of-care arm. All participants who complete the study may be eligible to receive the study drug in a long-term extension study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Informed consent by a parent or guardian or emancipated minor prior to any studyrelated procedures 2. When applicable, an informed assent by the subject (as deemed appropriate by the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board) prior to any studyrelated procedures 3. Current history of SBS as a result of major intestinal resection, (eg, due to necrotizing enterocolitis, midgut volvulus, intestinal atresia, or gastroschisis) 4. Short bowel syndrome that requires PN/IV support that provides at least 30% of caloric and/or fluid/electrolyte needs prior to screening 5. Stable PN/IV support, defined as inability to significantly reduce PN/IV support, usually associated with minimal or no advance in enteral feeds (ie, 10% or less change in PN or advance in feeds) for at least 3 months prior to and during screening, as assessed by the investigator. 6. Sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential (in the teduglutide treatment arm only) must use medically acceptable methods of birth control during and 4 weeks after the treatment period 1. Subjects who are not expected to be able to advance oral or tube feeding regimens 2. Serial transverse enteroplasty or any other bowel lengthening procedure performed within 3 months of screening 3. Known clinically significant untreated intestinal obstruction contributing to feeding intolerance and inability to reduce parenteral support 4. Unstable absorption due to cystic fibrosis or known DNA abnormalities 5. Severe, known dysmotility syndrome, such as pseudoobstruction or persistent, severe, active gastroschisisrelated dysmotility, that is the primary contributing factor to feeding intolerance and inability to reduce parenteral support, prior to screening. Dysmotility is defined as severe if it is expected to limit the advancement of enteral feeding. 6. Evidence of clinically significant obstruction on upper GI series done within 6 months prior to screening. 7. Major GI surgical intervention including significant intestinal resection within 3 months prior to the screening visit (insertion of feeding tube, anastomotic ulcer repair, minor intestinal resections ≤ 10 cm, or endoscopic procedure is allowed). 8. Unstable cardiac disease, congenital heart disease or cyanotic disease, with the exception of subjects who had undergone ventricular or atrial septal defect repair, and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation. 9. History of cancer or clinically significant lymphoproliferative disease, not including resected cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinoma, or in situ non aggressive and surgically resected cancer. 10. Pregnant or lactating female subjects (in the teduglutide treatment arm only). 11. Participation in a clinical study using an experimental drug (other than glutamine or Omegaven) within 3 months or 5.5 halflives of the experimental drug, whichever is longer, prior to screening, and for the duration of the study. 12. Previous use of teduglutide or native/synthetic glucagonlike peptide2 (GLP2) 13. Previous use of glucagonlike peptide1 analog or human growth hormone within 3 months prior to screening 14. Previous use of octreotide, or dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4) inhibitors within 3 months prior to screening 15. Subjects with active Crohn's disease who had been treated with biological therapy (eg, antitumor necrosis factor [antiTNF]) within the 6 months prior to the screening visit 16. Subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who require chronic systemic immunosuppressant therapy that had been introduced or changed during the 3 months prior to screening 17. More than 3 SBSrelated or PNrelated hospital admissions (eg, documented infectionrelated catheter sepsis, clots, bowel obstruction, severe waterelectrolyte disturbances) within 3 months prior to the screening visit 18. Any major unscheduled hospital admission which affects parenteral support requirements within 1 month prior to or during screening, excluding uncomplicated treatment of bacteremia, central line replacement/repair, or issues of similar magnitude in an otherwise stable subject 19. Body weight &lt; 10 kg at the screening and baseline visits 20. Signs of active severe or unstable, clinically significant hepatic impairment during the screening period, as indicated by any of the following laboratory test results : 1. Total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 7x ULN 3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 7x ULN For subjects with Gilbert's disease: 4. Indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN 21. Signs of known continuous active or unstable, clinically significant renal dysfunction shown by results of an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 50 mL/min/1.73 m2. 22. Parent(s) and/or subjects who are not capable of understanding or not willing to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements 23. Unstable, clinically significant active, untreated pancreatic or biliary disease 24. Any condition, disease, illness, or circumstance that in the investigator's opinion puts the subject at any undue risk, prevents completion of the study, or interferes with analysis of the study results.</criteria>
