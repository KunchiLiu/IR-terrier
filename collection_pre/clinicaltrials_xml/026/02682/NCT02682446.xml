	<brief_summary>After endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer (EGC), there remained concerned about the development of the metachronous gastric neoplasm (MGN). The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of H. pylori eradication for reducing MGN after ESD and the efficacy of serum pepsinogen (PG) for predicting development of MGN after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for EGC and to evaluate other risk factors for the incidence of MGN. The investigators enrolled the participants who were tested serum PG I and II at the time of ESD for EGC, from January 2007 to May 2013 in single tertiary center, retrospectively. The baseline characteristics of the participants, H. pylori status, and serum pepsinogen were analyzed for the development of the MGN.</brief_summary>
