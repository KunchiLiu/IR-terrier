	<brief_summary>This study will compare three glucose measurement techniques among diabetic children and adolescents. The study seeks to determine if a hydrogel microneedle patch, versus a lancet or intravenous catheter, would be a preferable option for monitoring glucose levels among the diabetic pediatric population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glucose Measurement Using Microneedle Patches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen children and adolescents with diabetes will be tested for their glucose measurements comparing interstitial fluid collected via a hydrogel microneedle patch, versus the standard of care blood sample (lancet), and lab grade blood draw (intravenous catheter). Samples will be taken hourly from all three devices for four hours. All four measurements will be compared against each other to see how close they are with measuring the glucose values. Each participant will be asked to rate their apprehension prior to receiving each method for blood or interstitial fluid collection as well as the pain associated with each method immediately after collection.</detailed_description>
