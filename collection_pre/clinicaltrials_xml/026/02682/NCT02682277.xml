	<brief_title>Efficacy of Polyglucosamine Long Term Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two groups of subjects were compared. A comparable diet condition, consisting of 10 % reduction of caloric intake was followed, according to a questionnaire based on the weekly number of servings. No modification of physical activity was requested. One group had to take the polyglucosamine tablets and the other group placebo tablets for at least 12 months. It is known, that polyglucosamine is a fat binder acting in a physical-chemical manner, the positive charged fiber is bound to the negative charged dietary fat and this complex is unable to pass the gut wall into the body but is naturally excreted,hence this energy is not available. Therefore, this medical device should show a measurable reduction in body weight.</detailed_description>
