	<brief_summary>The main objective is to demonstrate the effects of early dopaminergic activation on the autonomic nervous system in subjects with newly diagnosed vs. established type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint is the effect of Bromocriptine QR on changes in autonomic function measured by assessing sympathetic and parasympathetic function using conventional measures of autonomic function, including power spectral analysis of heart rate as well as peripheral autonomic function using sudorimetry and laser scanning of peripheral microvascular autonomic control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bromocriptine-QR Therapy on Sympathetic Tone and Vascular Biology in Type 2 Diabetes Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an interventional, twenty-four week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial with bromocriptine QR in subjects with newly diagnosed and established type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to evaluate its effects on the cardiovascular and peripheral autonomic nervous system, as well as on inflammatory markers, the leptin/adiponectin system, hormonal levels of RAS and HPA axis, indices of insulin resistance, and measures of oxidative and nitrosative stress. Forty newly diagnosed diabetes subjects and 40 subjects with established diabetes will be enrolled in the study and each randomized to treatment with bromocriptine-QR or placebo. Secondary endpoints will demonstrate the effects of dopaminergic activation with Bromocriptine-QR on the regulation of Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Axis (HPA) axis hormones, on the plasma levels of markers of inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress in newly diagnosed vs. established type 2 diabetes subjects. The study will evaluate treatment effects on inflammatory markers, the Leptin/Adiponectin system, and hormonal levels of rennin-angiotensin system (RAS), aldosterone and cortisol. Specifically, the following markers of inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress: 1) C reactive protein (CRP), 2) interleukin-6, 12, and 10, 3) tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha), 4) plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) will be evaluated. A co-secondary objective of the study will be to assess the impact of Bromocriptine-QR vs Placebo on measures of insulin resistance and glycemic control (e.g., oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose and insulin, Matsuda index, Homeostasis Model Assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).</detailed_description>

Other exclusions include coronary artery bypass graft or coronary angioplasty in the previous 3 months, unstable angina pectoris (chest pain at rest, worsening chest pain, or admission to the emergency room or hospital for chest pain) within the previous 3 months, or seizure disorders. Active infection (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis), or a history of severe infection during the 30 days prior to screening Major surgical operation during the 30 days prior to screening Cancer, other than nonmelanoma skin or nonmetastatic prostate cancer, within the past 5 years Uncontrolled or untreated hypothyroidism as evidenced by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations &gt;4.8 µU/ml Other serious medical conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the subject's participation in the study, including any concurrent illness, other than diabetes mellitus, not controlled by a stable therapeutic regimen, or conditions or abnormalities (e.g., blindness) that might interfere with interpretation of safety or efficacy data, or history of noncompliance Clinically significant abnormalities on screening laboratory evaluation, unless approved by the Sponsor Abnormalities of liver function defined as any liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (SGPT), Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal History of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIIV congestive heart failure. Concurrent participation in another clinical trial with use of an experimental drug or device within 30 days of study entry. History of alcohol or substance abuse or dementia Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. Women who become pregnant will be discontinued from the study.
