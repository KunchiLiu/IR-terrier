	<brief_summary>Purpose: To report the immediate and prolonged (one week) effects of elastic bandage on balance control in subjects with chronic ankle instability. Material and methods: Twenty-eight individuals successfully completed the study protocol, of whom 14 were randomly assigned to the elastic bandage group (7 men, 7 women) and 14 were assigned to the non-standardized tape group ( 9 men, 5 women). To objectively measure postural sway we used computerized dynamic posturography with Sensory Organization Test and Unilateral Stance test. We analyzed the following Sensory Organization Test parameters: the composite Sensory Organization Test score, the composite Sensory Organization Test strategy and the Sensory Organization Test condition 2 and its strategy. In addition, we studied the centre of gravity sway velocity with open eyes and close eyes during the US test.</brief_summary>
