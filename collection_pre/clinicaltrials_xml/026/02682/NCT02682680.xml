	<brief_summary>A 24-week, randomized, open-label study investigating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of colesevelam 3.75 g daily compared to ezetimibe 10 mg daily, as an add-on to baseline statin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are not at target for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (&gt; 7.0%) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (&gt; 2.0 mmol/L).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Comparing Colesevelam vs. Ezetimibe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll 440 adult patients with T2DM who are not at target for HbA1c and LDL cholesterol. Patients who are on baseline statin therapy will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to colesevelam 3.75 g daily for 24 weeks, or ezetimibe 10 mg daily for 24 weeks. If patient has statin intolerance, they may be on a fibrate and/or niacin, or on no lipid lowering therapy. The primary efficacy objectives are 1. to demonstrate that colesevelam 3.75 g daily is non-inferior to ezetimibe 10 mg daily as add-on to statin therapy for patients achieving a composite target of HbA1c (≤ 7.0%) and LDL cholesterol (≤ 2.0 mmol/L) at week 24, and 2. to compare the proportion of patients achieving a composite target of HbA1c (≤ 7.0%) and LDL cholesterol (≤ 2.0 mmol/L) at week 24. This study will also assess the primary composite outcome in a sub-group of patients on sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy.</detailed_description>
