	<brief_summary>Evaluation of a non-invasive technique to measure cardiac output (esCCO™) with the "clinical goldstandard" of the transcardiopulmonal thermodilution technique (PiCCO®). Effect of different potential interference factors to the accuracy of measurement (changing concentration of norepinephrine, generally severity of the basic disease - APACHE II score).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring (esCCO™) in Critically Ill Patients Within ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurements have to estimate the agreement of esCCO™ and PiCCO® related to the cardiac output (cardiac index). It should consult a comparison of methods between a complete non-invasive cardiac output monitoring method (esCCO™) and the transcardiopulmonal thermodilution technique (PiCCO®). The accuracy shall carve out as well as the power of agreement of both measurement methods. It takes two simultaneous measurements at a time of critically ill patients at interdisciplinary surgical intensive care units. Furthermore the force of the major variables (1. requirement of norepinephrine and 2. APACHE II-score) to the estimators shall be realized. esCCO™ vs. (PiCCO®) This research shall include 100 patients which have to undergo a complex intensive care treatment within predefined therapy intentions. During a daily screening within the interdisciplinary surgical intensive care units of the Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel it will be opted for the inclusion of the patients. Points of time x [x ε M and M = {1, 2, 3, 4}] - two test series (measurement 1 and 2). According to the ability of the patient to the research the predefined point of time number 1 will be supposed (point of time number 1: inclusion criterium). The predefined point of time number 2 will be supposed if the therapy concept is planned or changed. The point of time number 3 is defined as the re-evaluation in the course of changed therapy conceptions. If the medical practitioner team decides to renounce the PiCCO-system, the predefined point of time number 4 has arrived. The requirement of norepinephrine will be registered in every measurement (1 and 2). The APACHE II-score will be surveyed each point of time x (see above). The remaining treatment of the patients will be performed in the conventional way by the medical practitioner team within the interdisciplinary surgical intensive care units.</detailed_description>
