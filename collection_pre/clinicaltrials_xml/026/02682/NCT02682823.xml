	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate RLHFs concerning administration of the tocilizumab autoinjector AI-1000 G2 in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have been receiving subcutaneous (SC) tocilizumab using the commercially available prefilled syringe and needle safety device (PFS-NSD). The study will enroll participants with RA, a subset of whom will be assigned to perform self-injection with the AI-1000 G2. Enrolled caregivers (CGs) and health care professionals (HCPs) will administer the AI-1000 G2 injection to the remaining study participants. The study will enroll approximately 45 participants with RA across three cohorts. Group 2 will also include 15 paired CGs to administer the injection, and Group 3 will include 15 paired HCPs to administer the injection. With an expected drop-out rate of 20%, the target enrollment (to achieve a final sample/ratio of 45:15:15) will be 95 individuals overall.</brief_summary>
