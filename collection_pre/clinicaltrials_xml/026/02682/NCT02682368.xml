	<brief_summary>Both acute gallbladder pathology and diverticular disease are common conditions met in emergency departments in the western world and comprise the bulk of admissions throughout general surgical calls. On the other hand both entities need imagistic confirmation and description to tailor further management, which may be not readily available at the moment of patient's presentation in A&amp;E's doorstep or after referral to the on call general surgeon. These delays may lose the window of opportunity for emergency surgery or prolong unnecessary admission for a patient with known condition which may need just a fast exclusion of a more advanced stage and then be further treated conservatively or even discharged. The increased length of stay, as investigators know and expect is rising the costs of healthcare and this is a very delicate subject in nowadays medical practice. Investigators think that USS performed at the bedside will help in decreasing the length of stay, especially for weekend admissions when radiology is not readily available. Ultrasound scanning (USS) has become very popular over the last half century and the equipment has become more compact, of a higher quality and less expensive, which has facilitated the growth of point-of-care ultrasonography — that is, USS performed and interpreted by the clinician at the bedside. The concept of an 'ultrasound stethoscope' is rapidly moving from theory to reality. Since 1993 surgeon-performed US came to the attention at 79th Annual Clinical Congress of the American College of Surgeons. Nowadays USS was extended successfully to other acute settings, and in several USA residency programs and several EU countries, bed side imaging is included in the training curriculum or as stand alone competence for non radiological medical practitioners. Alas it is still not the norm across EU or the entire USA despite studies that proved its usefulness. As an example, currently in Ireland surgeon performed US is not a popular skill. The present paper proposes to address this issue at a larger scale than present studies, which tend to be confined on a limited number of patients and hospitals and different approaches. Currently, the European Society for Trauma &amp; Emergency Surgery® provides modular USS courses that imbue surgeons with necessary skills to perform bedside US for conditions like trauma (FAST scan), acute cholecystitis. Also this paper aims to leap forward, for the more skilled ultrasonographers in diagnosing and classifying diverticular disease. The paper will be divided in two parts, the general part (with an extensive literature review and basic science and gestures for US performing) while the second part will be the original research. The closing remark is that by learning and doing these procedures the surgeon performing USS doesn't undermine his/her radiologist colleague's authority and skill. The big picture is that some basic tasks are transferrable and if used in an appropriate and methodical manner the final common goal - the benefit of the patient - is readily achieved.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicentric Point of Care UltraSound by Surgeons Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was accepted as a Master of Surgery Thesis by Research (MCh) at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) There will be two parallel studies done at the same time: 1. Bed-side surgeon performed ultrasound scanning (USS) for biliary pathology 2. Bed-side surgeon performed USS for suspected diverticulitis There will be a number of ultrasound courses in which surgeons and radiologists will teach other surgeons how to perform basic USS in regards to suspected cholelithiasis and diverticular disease. The courses are endorsed by the European Society for Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ESTES). As a note, the students are surgeons with little-to-none experience in ultrasound scanning. The course website is in the following link: http://www.thesoundofthebody.org This courses have 2 to 4 modules in which the basics of USS is taught and have a large hands-on experience. Then 15-20 examinations under supervision per student have to be done before embarking into the study. A good chance for that is in the induction room before elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in patients with known gallbladder disease. STUDY Patients with suspected biliary pathology or diverticular disease (as per inclusion criteria below) that are coming into the Emergency Department (ED), clinic, preoperatively or as a consult in the hospital will undergo an USS done by the naive surgeons trained in one of these courses. Patients will be explained the procedure, will have a leaflet with information and an informed consent that they will have to sign. Bed-side USS is performed after that usually immediately or several hours after presentation (depends on the type of consult request), and the results and measurements are recorded on a data sheet (one type of data sheet for each study -biliary or diverticular-). Pictures with the images are saved as well for quality control. Time, date is recorded as well. Then the same patients will have a departmental USS/CAT-Scan (depends on the pathology suspected) done by qualified radiologists. Or there are instances when the patients will have to undergo surgery and then the scans will be compared to the intra-operative findings. In Ireland this usually takes a long time, patients may come to ED on a Friday and have their USS done in radiology department on Monday. The radiologist performing the USS/CT/MRI does not know that the patient has already been scanned by the surgeon. In Ireland the radiologist's report is uploaded in an online system named NIMIS (The National Integrated Medical Imaging System), along with time and date of the actual scanning, time and date of reporting (reporting is not instantly). Data will be collected and stored anonymously, and processed with Microsoft Excel, IMB SPSS, R-studio The same rules will be applied in hospitals from other countries that will get involved in the study. As soon as Investigators have the names and approval from them to get involved, they will be uploaded on this ClinicalTrials.</detailed_description>
