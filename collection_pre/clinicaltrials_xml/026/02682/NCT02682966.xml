	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study in patients who undergo routine postoperative troponin assessment after major elective noncardiac surgery. Two groups are created based on postoperative troponin levels: Postoperative myocardial injury (PMI) group with troponin I levels ≥ 60 ng/L and a control group with troponin levels &lt; 60ng/L. Our objective is to determine the association of PMI with CAD and PMI with pulmonary embolism using coronary computed tomography angiography in patients undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>≥ 60 years old Major noncardiac surgery, defined as noncardiac surgical procedures requiring hospital admittance &gt; 24 hours Elective surgery, defined as surgery that that has been preceded by a preoperative consultation at the anaesthesia preoperative screening outpatient clinic. ≥ 1 troponin assessment in the first 3 postoperative days as a part of the routine 'postoperative troponin assessment' protocol. For patients who undergo surgery more than once, the first surgery will be included in the analysis. Reoperations will not be included. Typical anginal complaints Acute STelevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on ECG Patients unable to fully comply to study needs (e.g. incompetent patients or patients unable to communicate in Dutch or English) Contraindications for CCTA: Severe claustrophobia; Allergic reaction to contrast fluid; Renal insufficiency, defined as a GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2, calculated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) calculator; Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35%; uncontrolled irregular heart rhythm or tachycardia unresponsive to beta blockade (e.g. atrial fibrillation)</criteria>
