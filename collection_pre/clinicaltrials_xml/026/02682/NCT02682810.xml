	<brief_title>Point of Care Virologic Testing to Improve Outcomes of HIV-Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At public sector clinics in Lusaka, Zambia, approximately 2,867 HIV-exposed infants between 4 and 12 weeks of life will be randomized in this trial of point-of-care virologic testing to improve outcomes of HIV-infected children in Zambia. There is a standard of care (SOC) or control arm and an intervention arm known as the Alere arm. In both study arms, early infant diagnosis (EID) will be provided at 6 weeks of life. Infants randomized to the SOC arm will receive EID through the existing prevention of mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) program, with samples sent to an off-site laboratory for DNA PCR testing. Infants randomized to the intervention arm will receive POC diagnostic Alere Q qualitative test (along with a dried blood spot [DBS] drawn for confirmatory DNA PCR). HIV-infected infants will be followed for 12 months.</detailed_description>
