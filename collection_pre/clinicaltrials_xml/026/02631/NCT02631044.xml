	<brief_summary>This open-label Phase 1 study will evaluate the safety, PK, and antitumor activity of modified T cells (JCAR017) administered to adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL. The dose and schedule of JCAR017 will be evaluated and modified, as needed, for safety and antitumor activity. We will also determine how long the modified T cells stay in the patient's body and how well JCAR017 works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma whose disease has come back or has not responded to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of JCAR017 in B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1 study to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of JCAR017 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), follicular lymphoma Grade 3B, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This study will evaluate and refine the dose and schedule of JCAR017 to optimize safety and antitumor activity. Upon successful generation of JCAR017 product, participants will receive treatment with one or more cycles of JCAR017 therapy. Each cycle will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by one or two doses of JCAR017 administered by intravenous (IV) injection. The follow-up period for each participant is approximately 24 months after the final JCAR017 infusion. Long-term follow-up for survival, toxicity, and viral vector safety will continue under a separate long-term follow-up protocol per health regulatory authority guidelines, currently up to 15 years after the last JCAR017 infusion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age â‰¥18 years 2. Relapsed or refractory Bcell NHL, including a. DLBCL cohort: DLBCL, not otherwise specified (NOS), per WHO classification, including transformed DLBCL from indolent histology (tDLBCL), primary mediastinal Bcell lymphoma (PMBCL), and follicular lymphoma Grade 3B. Subjects must have been treated with an anthracycline and rituximab (or other CD20targeted agent) and have one of the following: i. Biopsyproven refractory disease after frontline chemoimmunotherapy ii. Relapsed or refractory disease after at least 2 lines of therapy or after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (autoHSCT); subjects with tDLBCL must have received at least 1 line of therapy after transformation to DLBCL. iii. Relapsed or refractory disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) b. MCL cohort: Mantlecell lymphoma with relapsed or refractory disease after at least 1 prior line of MCL therapy 3. Measureable, PETpositive disease by Lugano classification 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 5. Adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac function 6. Adequate vascular access for leukapheresis procedure 7. Participants who have received previous CD19targeted therapy must have CD19positive lymphoma confirmed on a biopsy since completing the prior CD19targeted therapy. 1. Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy 2. History of other primary malignancy not in remission for at least 2 years (The following are exempt from the 2year limit: nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated localized prostate cancer, and cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy or a squamous intraepithelial lesion on Pap smear) 3. Treatment with alemtuzumab within 6 months of leukapheresis or fludarabine or cladribine within 3 months of leukapheresis 4. Active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 5. Uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection 6. Presence of graftvshost disease (GVHD) 7. History of cardiovascular disease 8. History or presence of clinically relevant CNS pathology 9. Pregnant or nursing women 10. Use of the following: 1. Therapeutic doses of corticosteroids within 7 days of leukapheresis or 72 hours prior to JCAR017 administration. Physiologic replacement, topical, and inhaled steroids are permitted. 2. AlloHSCT within 90 days of leukapheresis 3. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) within 6 weeks prior to JCAR017 administration 4. GVHD therapies within 4 weeks of leukapheresis and JCAR017 administration 5. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 1 week of leukapheresis. Oral chemotherapeutic agents are allowed if at least 3 halflives have elapsed prior to leukapheresis. 6. Lymphotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 2 weeks of leukapheresis 7. Experimental agents within 4 weeks of leukapheresis unless progression is documented on therapy and at least 3 halflives have elapsed prior to leukapheresis 8. Radiation within 6 weeks of leukapheresis. Subjects must have progressive disease in irradiated lesions or have additional nonirradiated, positron emission tomography (PET)positive lesions to be eligible. 11. Prior CAR Tcell or other geneticallymodified Tcell therapy, with the exception of prior JCAR017 treatment in this protocol for subjects receiving retreatment</criteria>
