	<brief_summary>The choice of drug administration time may affect the pharmacokinetics and/or drug response, and knowledge of any such circadian rhythm-dependent effects may help to reduce side effects or to enhance efficacy. This study designed to investigate the potential influence of the time of drug administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the valsartan in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronopharmacology of Valsartan in Normotensive Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>International guidelines recommend the use of long acting, once-daily medications that provide 24h efficacy; they improve adherence to therapy and minimize BP variability with smoother and more consistent BP control. Valsartan has been approved to be used once-daily, without any specification of treatment-time in package insert. Several trials have investigated the differential effects of morning versus evening administration of valsartan in hypertensive patients, however, the results of these studies were contradicting. Furthermore, the specific administration time dependent dose response curve have not been previously investigated. So, this study designed to investigate the potential influence of the time of drug administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the valsartan in healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
