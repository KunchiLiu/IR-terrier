	<brief_title>A Study of HMPL-689 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive a single dose of HMPL-689 or matching placebo during Day 1. The planned dose levels are: 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 30 mg (about 7 cohorts of 8 subjects). In each dose cohort, 8 subjects will be randomized to receive HMPL-689 (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects) under fed condition with a standard meal. For the first dose Cohort (1 mg), a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1 HMPL-689 and 1 placebo) will be dosed 24 hours prior to the planned dosing of the remaining six subjects. The decision of dose escalation or study termination will be made jointly by the principal investigator and the sponsor based on the clinical data (safety, tolerability, available PK data and clinical laboratory values). Any dose level may be repeated, reduced or split into 2 doses if deemed appropriate by the Principal Investigator and Sponsor's medical Expert.</detailed_description>
