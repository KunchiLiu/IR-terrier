	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-national, multi-center, double-blind (sponsor open), randomized, placebo-controlled trial in subjects with active primary Sjögren's syndrome designed to understand the safety and tolerability profile of belimumab/ rituximab co-administration and of belimumab monotherapy; and to evaluate whether either co-administration therapy or belimumab monotherapy has a substantive effect on disease activity. This study will consist screening period, double blind treatment period, a general follow-up period and individualized follow-up period. Approximately 70 subjects will be recruited into the study initially. At Day 0, subjects will be randomized 1:2:2:2 to one of the four treatment arms placebo arm, belimumab monotherapy arm, co-administration therapy arm and rituximab monotherapy arm. Once a sufficient number of subjects have completed the Week 24, interim analyses and sample size re-estimation will be conducted. The total number of subjects randomized may increase following sample size re-estimation up to a maximum of 120 recruited into the study. Subjects in all arms will receive investigational product (IP) until Week 52 (completion of the treatment phase). All subjects will enter a 16-week general follow-up period after the Week 52 visit or after discontinuation if a subject discontinues IP and withdraws from the treatment phase visits prior to Week 52. After completing the general follow-up period, subjects with cluster of differentiation (CD)19+ B-cell levels below the lower limit of normal (or less than 90 percent [%] of baseline, if baseline value was below lower limit of normal [LLN]) will enter an individualized safety follow-up phase and return to the clinic for visits every 12 weeks with monthly calls between visits to evaluate subjects for any serious adverse events (SAEs) related to IP or study participation, fatal SAEs, and designated adverse event of special interests (AESIs) (i.e., infections, malignancies, or depression, suicide/self-injury), and to check concomitant medications. The total duration of participation of a subject in this study will be approximately up to a maximum of 2 years (i.e., up to Week 104).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt;=18 years, at the time of signing the informed consent. Documented Primary Sjögren's Syndrome by American European Consensus Group criteria including: either antiSjogren'ssyndromerelated antigen A (SSA) or antiSjogren'ssyndromerelated antigen B (SSB) positive. Baseline unstimulated salivary flow &gt;0.0 mL/min or evidence of glandular reserve function (stimulated baseline salivary flow &gt;0.05 mL/min). Symptomatic oral dryness (&gt;=5/10 on subject completed numeric response scale). Systemically active disease, ESSDAI &gt;=5 points. Male and female subjects; females of child bearing potential are eligible if using effective contraception: Female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: 1. Nonreproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy, Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study; otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. 2. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options in the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication up to Week 68 after Day 0. Ability to understand and comply with the protocolrequired procedures and provision of informed consent. Diagnosis of secondary Sjögren's syndrome. Active lifethreatening or organthreatening complications of Sjogren'ssyndrome (SS) disease at the time of screening based on treating physician evaluation including but not restricted to (1) vasculitis with renal, digestive, cardiac, pulmonary or central nervous system (CNS) involvement characterized as severe, (2) active CNS or peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement requiring high dose steroids, (3) severe renal involvement defined by objective measures, (4) lymphoma.
