	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of induction treatment consisting of atezolizumab in combination with obinutuzumab plus lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), followed by maintenance treatment with atezolizumab plus obinutzumab plus lenalidomide in patients who achieve a complete response (CR), a partial response (PR), or stable disease at end of induction.</brief_summary>
