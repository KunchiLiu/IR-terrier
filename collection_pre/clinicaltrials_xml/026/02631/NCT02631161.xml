	<brief_title>Glass Hybrid Versus Composite Restorations of Non-carious Cervical Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, monocenter parallel group study on restoration of tooth with non-carious cervical restorations. Each patient receives cervical restoration(s) either with glass hybrid EQUIA forte or with composite resin/adhesive combination Filtek Supreme XT/Clearfil SE Bond in anterior/posterior tooth region. Restorations will be provided by one experienced operator. One of two independent examiners will evaluate the restorations at baseline (1 week after placement), and after 18, and 36 months according to the FDI criteria. Reliability of examination will be assessed on a random sample of 30 restorations.</detailed_description>
