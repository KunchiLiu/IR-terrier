	<brief_title>Sisters in Health: A Weight Loss Study for African American Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A disparity exists in the prevalence of overweight and obesity between non-Hispanic white (NHW) and African American (AA) women. More AA women (78.2%) are overweight or obese compared to NHW (61.2%). Obesity increases the risk of developing numerous chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Among AA women, there is a higher prevalence, and almost double the risk, of developing T2DM compared to NHW. African Americans also have higher rates of complications and mortality from T2DM, and are more at risk for hypertension compared to NHW. Obesity is a costly epidemic. Fortunately, weight is a modifiable risk factor for reducing or preventing obesity and related diseases. Interventions to reduce overweight and obesity through lifestyle change have been less effective for AA women compared to NHW women. African American women tend to lose less weight in standard behavioral weight loss interventions. A potential reason for smaller weight loss is that compared to NHW women, AA women have been shown to engage in less physical activity (PA) during these interventions. The Sisters in Health study will test the efficacy of a 6-month randomized controlled trial in overweight and obese African American women. Women will be recruited to participate in this study comparing a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (BWI) to a physical activity enhanced BWI (BWI-PA) for 6 months. The primary objective of this study is to determine if AA women randomized to the BWI-PA will experience greater weight loss and PA compared to women receiving the BWI. Women in both groups will receive 18 face-to-face sessions on a tapered basis (weekly to biweekly). Face-to-face sessions will provide women with the knowledge, behavioral skills and strategies for weight loss.</detailed_description>
