	<brief_title>Advance Care Planning With Older Patients Who Have End-stage Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney failure becomes more common as people age. It increases the risks of other major illnesses, sudden worsening of symptoms, and death. Even so, many people with kidney failure do not talk about their preferences for end-of-life care. Advance care planning (ACP) can help patients and families think through their preferences for future care and discuss these with the professionals looking after them. This may lead to care more in keeping with patients' wishes and so reduce distress for patients and families. ACP is recommended as good practice for people with kidney failure. However, questions remain about the impact of ACP on patients and families; and also about the best ways to put ACP into practice. Doing research about ACP is challenging for everyone involved, so we need to thoroughly test our research methods in a pilot study before we attempt a larger study that would fully answer those questions. To test our methods we will carry out a small-scale randomised controlled trial comparing those patients who use ACP with those who do not, in terms of: quality of life, anxiety, depression, physical functioning, well-being, satisfaction with decision-making and agreement between the patient and their nominated carer in terms of the patient's preferences for care at the end of life.</detailed_description>
