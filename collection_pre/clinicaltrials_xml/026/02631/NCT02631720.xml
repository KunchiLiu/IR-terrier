	<brief_summary>While many patients experience benefits from transplant, complications such as infections and lung rejection may affect long term survival and quality of life. In this study doctors are looking at a complication called Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD is thought to be chronic rejection of the lung by the immune system and is the leading cause of death after lung transplantation. The purpose of this study is to help doctors determine: - why some people get CLAD and others do not - how patients who get CLAD do after CLAD is diagnosed - how CLAD may affect quality of life</brief_summary>
