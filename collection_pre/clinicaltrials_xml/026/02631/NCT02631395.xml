	<brief_title>The Effect of a Shoulder Training Program to Prevent Shoulder Pain Among Girls in Junior Team Handball</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six teams, consisting of 13 to 25 players each, were randomized into two groups throughout their competition seasons. Three teams participated in a seven--month, three--times--a--week shoulder--muscle strength--training program while three teams participated in a comparable handball training program but did not conduct any specific upper--body strength training. Effects of this strength--training program were evaluated by comparing pre-- and post--training data from a survey on shoulder complaints based on a self--report questionnaire (quick DASH) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The players completed the VAS on pain once a month. In addition to that the players were tested in a maximum push up test, dynamometer test for internal and external rotation strength in the shoulder and throwing distance in the pre- and posttest.</detailed_description>
