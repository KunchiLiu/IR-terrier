	<brief_summary>This is a study that aims to evaluate the feasibility of undertaking a United Kingdom (UK) multi-centre randomised controlled trial of BET for the treatment of moderate (grade 2 or 3) retraction pockets (RPs). This future study will aim to address the question: Does BET improve symptoms scores, audiometry and otoscopic appearance of Grade 2-3 pars tensa RPs in adult patients? Currently conservative treatments for this condition has been shown to be ineffective; there is a significant risk of progression to hearing loss or more serious complications in untreated retraction pockets; and the surgical treatments available to us in the UK not only have a number of risks and drawbacks, but also do not aim to treat the underlying cause (Eustachian Tube dysfunction (ETD)).</brief_summary>
