	<brief_summary>While newborn and child survival remains a priority, optimal development of survivors is receiving increasing attention. Interventions that impact both survival and development should be prioritized for action. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) improves survival, and potentially neurodevelopment, in preterm and low birth weight infants in hospital settings but its coverage remains low. Innovation is required to allow the community-based delivery of KMC by front-line workers. This could greatly accelerate scale up and sustainability of this intervention in low resource settings. The proposed randomized trial is planned in a setting where 40% of births take place at home. Early discharge (as early as within 12 hours of birth) is common for facility births, often at the request of families for social and cultural reasons. Many of the hospitals do not have incubators for the care of very small babies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community Kangaroo Mother Care for Improving Child Survival and Brain Development in Low Birth Weight Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low birth weight (LBW) infants will be identified through surveillance. Eligible infants will be randomized into the intervention and control groups. Mother in the intervention group will be supported by a ANM-like study workers assisted by ASHA-like study workers to provide Kangaroo mother care (KMC) to their babies at home. Breastfeeding support will also be provided to these mothers by ANM-like study workers. Essential newborn care will be delivered through Government workers in both groups. Survival will be measured in all enrolled infants through contacts at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of age. Information will also be ascertained on initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding rates, incidence of infection in the neonatal and in the 1-5 months period. Development outcomes (Maternal Depression, Maternal sense of competence, Mother-infant Bonding, Mother-infant interaction, Newborn Behaviour, Infant temperament, Brain development) will be measured at enrolment, 6weeks, 6 and 12 months of age. Growth will be measured at enrolment and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
