	<brief_summary>Kono and collegues have described a new anastomotic technique to restore bowel contintuity after ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease (CD). This tecnique implies a hand-sewn ileocolic anastomosis, that involves exclusively the antimesenteric side of the bowel and that functionally acts as an end-to-end anastomosis. In a retrospective study, the authors have shown that this anastomotic tecnique, when compared to stapled side-to-side anastomosis, significantly reduces the severity of endoscopic recurrence at 1 year after surgery and the rate of reoperation for anastomotic recurrence at 5 years after surgery. Aim of this trial is to compare the outcomes of the Kono anastomosis with the ones achieved by the stapled side-to-side anastomosis, within a prospective randomized study.</brief_summary>
