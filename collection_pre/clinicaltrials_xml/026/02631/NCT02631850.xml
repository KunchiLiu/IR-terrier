	<brief_summary>The current proposal aims to conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial comparing virtual-reality gaming delivery of Constraint Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) with (1) traditional clinic-based CI therapy of equal total active therapy duration and (2) a control group equating the dose of in-person therapy. Individuals with chronic stroke will be randomized to one of four different interventions: (1) traditional clinic-based CI therapy (35 therapist/client contact hours), (2) therapist-as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic and 15 hours of independent game play at home), (3) therapist-as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy with additional therapist contact via telerehabilitation (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 4 therapist contact hours via teleconference, and 15 hours of independent game play in the home), and (4) 5 hours of standard occupational therapy. After 6-month follow-up, individuals assigned to standard OT/PT will cross over to a modified gaming therapy condition (a stand-alone application of the rehabilitation game without additional therapist contact).</brief_summary>
