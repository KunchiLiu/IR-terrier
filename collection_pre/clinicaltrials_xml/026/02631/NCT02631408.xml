	<brief_summary>Vancomycin powder (for solution for Infusion) will be investigated (off-label usage) in spinal fusion surgery. The powder will be locally administered into to the wound cavity before wound closure. Hypothesis: Locally applied vancomycin powder leads to a reduction in postoperative surgical site infections</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrawound Vancomycin Powder in Spinal Fusion Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vancomycin is being widely used as an antibiotic agent for intravenous and topical use. The surgical application of vancomycin powder in Austria is limited as there is no powder with marketing authorization for intraoperative, intrawound usage. Previous reports widely document the application of vancomycin powder for solution for infusion. The powder is not soluted, but instead directly spread throughout the wound surface. Limited data is available for spinal fusion surgery, mostly retrospective studies. Results were promising, but the low evidence level does not allow for a conclusion regarding routine usage. Additional randomized, controlled trials are necessary to further investigate this matter. This trial aims to investigate Vancomycin powder "Xellia" 1000mg, which has a Marketing authorization, in an off-label usage (intrawound, intraoperatively) in spinal fusion surgery. The investigational medicinal product will be used unmodified.</detailed_description>
