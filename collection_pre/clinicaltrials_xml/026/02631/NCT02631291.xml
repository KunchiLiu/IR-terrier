	<brief_summary>This study is for adults 60 years and older who are grieving the recent loss of a spouse or partner. Bereavement is one of the most distressing transitions faced by older adults and triggers dramatic changes to older adults' daily routine which puts them at-risk for a mood disorder. The purpose of this study is to promote bereaved elders' mental health by focusing on healthy lifestyle practices. Study treatment involves using a tablet to record their daily physical activity, diet, and sleep behaviors, for 12 weeks. The investigators follow-up with people for up to one year.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preventing mental health problems that develop following spousal bereavement is important because these conditions are highly prevalent and have lasting adverse consequences for the well-being of the bereaved survivor. The proposed research will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a healthy lifestyle intervention that uses a technology-based behavioral self-monitoring protocol to encourage engagement in physical activity, healthy eating, and good sleep practices following spousal bereavement. Data from 10 participants will be used for the development of a prevention intervention manual (Aim 1). A small pilot study will be conducted (Aim 2) in which 50 participants will be randomly assigned to 12 weeks of (1) behavioral self-monitoring using a smartphone (n=20), (2) behavioral self-monitoring using a smartphone + motivational interviewing-based lifestyle coaching (n=20), or (3) enhanced usual care (n=10). Blood samples will be collected to explore inflammatory cytokines as a potential mediator/moderator of mental health risk.</detailed_description>
