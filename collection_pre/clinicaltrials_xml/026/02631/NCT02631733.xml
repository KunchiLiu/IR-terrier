	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together with liposomal irinotecan in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Liposomal irinotecan and veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Irinotecan and Veliparib in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of MM-398 (liposomal irinotecan) + veliparib combination. II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of MM-398 + veliparib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To characterize the preliminary efficacy of the combination using key efficacy indicators, such as objective response rate, clinical benefit rate defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at 24 weeks, and progression free survival (PFS). EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I. Imaging, tumor, and blood biomarkers to assess the sensitivity or resistance to each drug and correlation with clinical response. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation of veliparib. Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and veliparib orally (PO) on days 5-12 and 19-25 or 3-12 and 17-25. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have pathologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following solid tumors: cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), gastric cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective Prior poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy is allowed Patients at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) site must be willing to undergo a pretreatment ferumoxytol magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (patients will be excluded from undergoing ferumoxytol MRI if they have evidence of iron overload, a known hypersensitivity to ferumoxytol or any other IV iron product, a documented history of multiple drug allergies, or those for whom MRI is otherwise contraindicated, including claustrophobia or anxiety related to undergoing MRI); this eligibility criterion applies only to patients enrolling at NCI Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) Life expectancy of greater than 3 months Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL without the use of hematopoietic growth factors Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (=&lt; 5 x upper limit of normal [ULN] is acceptable if liver metastases are present) Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men and women treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of veliparib, MM398 and ferumoxytol MRI administration Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document IMAGING CORRELATIVE STUDY: Patients will be eligible to participate in the ferumoxytol (FMX) imaging study if they do not meet any of the following criteria Evidence of iron overload as determined by: Fasting transferrin saturation of &gt; 45% and/or Serum ferritin levels &gt; 1000 ng/ml A history of allergic reactions to any of the following: Compounds similar to ferumoxytol or any of its components as described in full prescribing information for ferumoxytol injection Any IV iron replacement product (e.g. parenteral iron, dextran, irondextran, or parenteral iron polysaccharide preparations) Multiple drugs Unable to undergo MRI or for whom MRI is otherwise contraindicated (e.g. presence of errant metal, cardiac pacemakers, pain pumps or other MRI incompatible devices; or history claustrophobia or anxiety related to undergoing MRI) Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; patients must have completed prior biological therapies and/or targeted therapies &gt;= 2 weeks prior to study enrollment; patients who have had radiation to the pelvis or other bone marrowbearing sites will be considered on a case by case basis and may be excluded if the bone marrow reserve is not considered adequate (i.e. radiation to &gt; 25% of bone marrow) Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents Patients with active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to veliparib, MM398 and ferumoxytol Clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including history of small bowel obstruction unless the obstruction was a surgically treated remote episode Active infection Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with any of these agents Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible Patients who are taking medications which are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)</criteria>
