	<brief_summary>The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements. This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) versus placebo in subjects with anemia due to International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with ring sideroblasts (≥ 15%) who require Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Luspatercept (ACE-536) to Treat Anemia Due to Very Low, Low, or Intermediate Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia is considered to be one of the most prevalent cytopenias in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes, an umbrella term used to describe disorders relating to the ineffective production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets. Ranging in severity from mild (asymptomatic) to severe, anemia can result in patients requiring regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which can lead to further complications from iron overload. The goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of luspatercept versus placebo in anemic patients who are categorized as International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), have ring sideroblasts present, and require constant RBC transfusions. The design of the study will allow a period of initial randomization of patients into either the luspatercept or placebo arm, followed by a double-blind treatment period, and then an MDS disease assessment visit. For those patients that are determined to be experiencing clinical benefit as judged from the study Investigator by this disease assessment visit, they will be permitted to enter the double-blind Extension Phase of the study. Once patients are discontinued from study treatment, they will enter a post treatment follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: 1. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF). 2. Subject has a diagnosis of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (according to WHO 2008) that meets International Prognostic Scoring SystemRevised (IPSSR) classification of very low, low, or intermediate risk disease and has Ring sideroblasts ≥ 15% of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow Fewer than 5% blasts in the bone marrow 3. Subjects requiring red blood cell transfusions ≥ 2 units in an 8week period 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0, 1, or 2 5. Subjects who are refractory/intolerant/ineligible to prior ESA treatment, defined as: Refractory to prior Erythropoiesis stimulating agents(ESA) treatment: documentation of nonresponse or response that is no longer maintained to prior ESAcontaining regimen, either as single agent or combination (eg, with GCSF); ESA regimen must have been either recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu EPO) ≥ 40,000 IU/wk for at least 8 doses or equivalent OR darbepoetin alpha ≥ 500 μg Q3W for at least 4 doses or equivalent Intolerant to prior ESA treatment: documentation of discontinuation of prior ESAcontaining regimen, either as single agent or combination (eg, with GCSF), at any time after introduction due to intolerance or an adverse event ESA ineligible: low chance of response to ESA base on endogenous serum erythropoietin level &gt; 200 U/L for subjects not previously treated with ESAs The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment: 1. Prior therapy with disease modifying agents (eg, immunemodulatory drug [IMiDs such as lenalidomide], hypomethylating agents, or immunosuppressive therapy [IST]) or experimental agents for underlying Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) disease 2. Previously treated with either luspatercept (ACE536) or sotatercept (ACE011) 3. MDS associated with del 5q cytogenetic abnormality 4. Secondary MDS, ie, MDS that is known to have arisen as the result of chemical injury or treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation for other diseases. 5. Known clinically significant anemia due to iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiencies, or autoimmune or hereditary hemolytic anemia, or gastrointestinal bleeding iron deficiency to be determined by a bone marrow aspirate stain for iron, calculated transferrin saturation (iron/total iron binding capacity) ≤ 20%, or serum ferritin ≤ 15 μg/L 6. Prior allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant 7. Known history of diagnosis of Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 8. Use of any of the following within 5 weeks prior to randomization: anticancer cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent or treatment corticosteroid, except for subjects on a stable or decreasing dose for ≥ 1 week prior to randomization for medical conditions other than MDS ironchelating agents, except for subjects on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization other red blood cell (RBC) hematopoietic growth factors (eg, Interleukin3) 15. Prior history of malignancies, other than MDS, unless the subject has been free of the disease for ≥ 5 years. However, subjects with the following history/concurrent conditions are allowed: Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Carcinoma in situ of the cervix Carcinoma in situ of the breast Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (T1a or T1b using the tumor, nodes, metastasis [TNM] clinical staging system) 16. Major surgery within 8 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects must have completely recovered from any previous surgery prior to randomization</criteria>
