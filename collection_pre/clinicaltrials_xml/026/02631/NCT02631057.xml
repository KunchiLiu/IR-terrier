	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the LoS from treatment of oral anticoagulant initiation to hospital discharge of patients hospitalized and subsequently treated with dabigatran or warfarin for non-valvular atrial fibrillation in a real-world Japanese clinical practice. The secondary objective of the study is to compare LoS of patients hospitalized with 1) acute ischemic stroke, and 2) due to non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Other objectives are (1) to compare the in-hospital direct and indirect-related costs between dabigatran and warfarin, and (2) to compare the rates of patients directly discharged at home after the index hospitalization between dabigatran and warfarin.</brief_summary>
