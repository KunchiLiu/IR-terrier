	<brief_summary>This study compared the efficacy and safety of S1 plus carboplatin (C) followed by S1 with pemetrexed plus carboplatin (C) followed by pemetrexed in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild type advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Patients with previously untreated EGFR wild type stage IIIB or IV nonsquamous NSCLC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 were randomly assigned to receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 or S1（80-120 mg/d）combined with carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5 every 3 weeks for up to four cycles. Eligible patients received maintenance until disease progression: pemetrexed or S1. The primary end point of this non-inferiority study was progression free survival（PFS）</brief_summary>
