	<brief_summary>The predominant remaining questions for post-transplant treatment of HCV in the DAA era are whether a ribavirin-free regimen is possible and whether pre-emptive treatment is now a potential option to prevent long-term damage to the allograft. Our aim is to provide answers to these primary questions with our multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label intent-to-treat phase IV study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LIVE-C-Free: Early and Late Treatment of Hepatitis C With Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir in Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label phase IV study including two subgroups: 1. Early Cohort -- Compare ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment for 8 weeks vs. 12 weeks in patients within 90 days of liver transplant 2. Late Cohort -- Compare ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks vs ledipasvir/sofosbuvir alone for 12 weeks in patients over 90 days post-liver transplant</detailed_description>
