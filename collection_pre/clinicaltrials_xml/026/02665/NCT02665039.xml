	<brief_title>A Trial With Vinflunine in Patients With Metastatic Bladder Cancer and Impaired Renal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rational The standard first line treatment for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma unfit for cisplatin due to renal impairment is carboplatin containing chemotherapy, with a median overall survival of approximately 8-10 month. New, more effective regimens in terms of tumor control and quality of life are urgently needed. Vinflunine has proven efficacy in urothelial carcinoma and is registered as second line treatment. The combination of gemcitabine and vinflunine has not yet been evaluated in first line treatment for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Objectives - To compare the progression free survival (FPS) of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract unfit for cisplatin based chemotherapy due to impaired renal function. - To evaluate the tumour response (ORR), overall survival (OS) and disease control rate (DCR) of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine - To assess the safety and toxicity of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine. - To investigate and compare Quality of life during treatment with vinflunine/gemcitabine and carboplatin/gemcitabine respectively.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Signed informed consent. Histological or cytological confirmed transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract (mixed histology including transitional cell carcinoma are allowed). Noncurable unresectable (T4b), locally advanced (lymph node positive (N+)) or metastatic (M1) urothelial carcinoma (including renal pelvic tumours, ureteral tumours, urinary bladder tumours and urethral primary tumours). No prior antineoplastic chemotherapy or other anticancer drugs. Patients who have received neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum containing chemotherapy and who are diagnosed with loco regional recurrent or metastatic disease after 6 months are eligible. Creatinine clearance 30 60 ml/min (measured by Iohexol or CrEDTA technique) ECOG/WHO Performance Status (PS) 01. •≥ 4 weeks since prior major surgery, ≥ 2 weeks since prior minor surgery (i.e. TURB) and ≥ 1 week since prior radiation therapy. Measurable and/or nonmeasurable disease using the RECIST v 1:1 criteria defined as: Measurable disease: lesions that can be measured in at least one dimension and which have not been previously irradiated. Longest diameter ≥10 mm or lymph nodes ≥15 mm in short axis with CT scan or MRI. Nonmeasurable disease: lesions which have not been previously irradiated, longest diameter &lt;10 mm or lymph nodes 1014 mm in short axis with CT scan or MRI, or truly non measurable lesions including bone lesions, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, and lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis. CNS metastases and/or leptomeningeal metastases are allowed provided these have been adequately treated with radiotherapy, are stable and not generating any related neurological symptoms. Spinal cord compression due to metastatic lesions is allowed provided adequate surgery and/or radiotherapy has been delivered, the metastases are stable and not generating any related neurological symptoms. No known or suspected allergy to the investigational agents or any agents given in association with this trial. 18 years of age or older. Fertile men and women of childbearing potential must use secure contraception (women intrauterine devices, hormonal contraceptives (contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices or injections with prolonged release), men condom and for a female partner as described above) from before 2 months entering the study until 6 months after end of chemotherapy. Exclusion Criteria Not fulfilling inclusion criteria as described above Pure nontransitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial. Pronounced hematuria in need of repeated blood transfusions, palliative radiotherapy to the bladder or palliative resection (TURB). Impaired bone marrow function defined as WBC &lt; 3.0 x 109/L, neutrophils &lt; 1.5 x 109/L, platelets &lt; 125 x 109/L, haemoglobin &lt; 100 g/L. Impaired liver function defined as serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or ASAT/ALAT &gt; 2.5 x ULN (&gt; 5 x ULN if known liver metastasis). Electrocardiogram (ECG) with significant modifications suggesting a high risk of occurrence of angina pectoris or high risk of arrhythmia. Other malignancies, except adequately treated basal carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or insitu cervix carcinoma or incidental prostate cancer (T1a, Gleason score ≤ 6, PSA &lt; 0.5 ng/ml), or any other tumour with a disease free survival of ≥ 5 years. History of serious or concurrent illness or uncontrolled medical disorder; any medical condition that might be aggravated by chemotherapy treatment or which could not be controlled; including, but not restricted to: Active infection requiring antibiotics within 2 weeks before the study inclusion, Unstable diabetes mellitus, Hypercalcaemia &gt;2.9 mmol/L (grade ≥ 2 according to CTCAE v 4.0), Concurrent congestive heart failure NYHA (class IIIIV), Unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 6 months and/or poorly controlled hypertension, QTc &gt; 450 ms at baseline, Inflammatory bowel disease, Peripheral neuropathy grade ≥ 2 according to CTCAE v 4.0, Patients who require treatment with ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, amprenavir, indinavir, rifampicin (any potent CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer) or phenytoin. Pregnant or lactating women. Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition which does not permit protocol compliance and medical followup.</criteria>
