	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to understand the feasibility of a text messaging intervention developed by the National Cancer Institute, known as Smokefreetxt, to improve smoking cessation among opiate and/or alcohol dependent participants discharged from an inpatient detoxification unit and enrolled in an office-based buprenorphine program patients (OBBP). Participants will be randomized to 1) treatment as usual (TAU) comprised of informational pamphlets and information for a 1800 quit line; and a prescription for a nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (i.e. nicotine replacement patches based on the quantity of baseline self-reported smoking, or nicotine replacement gum (2mg) #10, for 28 days which is offered routinely to all inpatients at Bellevue at the time of discharge) versus the SmokeFreeTXT intervention plus prescriptions for NRT.</brief_summary>
