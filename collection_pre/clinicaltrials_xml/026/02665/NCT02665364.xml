	<brief_summary>The safety and immunogenicity of the IFN-Kinoid (IFN-K) have been evaluated in a phase I clinical study conducted in subjects with SLE. Preliminary results were promising. The principal aim of the present study is to confirm the neutralization of the interferon gene signature and the clinical efficacy of IFN-K in subjects with SLE. In addition, the immune responses and the safety elicited by IFN-K will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
