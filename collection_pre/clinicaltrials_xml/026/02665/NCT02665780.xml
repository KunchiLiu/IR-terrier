	<brief_title>Assessing the Effect of Periodontal Debridement, Tongue Cleaning and Mouth Rinsing for the Treatment of Oral Malodour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of bad breath producing bacteria can be found in pockets around the gums and the top of the tongue. It is generally agreed that one of the most effective means of controlling the production of bad breath gases from these bacteria is their mechanical removal. Tongue cleaning has shown consistent results in the reduction of bad breath, while dental cleaning has shown positive, but less conclusive results. The addition of a mouth rinse to mechanical measures has shown medium-term effectiveness, however there is currently no information available that describes the long-term impact of mechanical and chemical measures for the treatment of bad breath and the appropriate interval for follow-up and on-going management to prevent difficult cases.</detailed_description>
