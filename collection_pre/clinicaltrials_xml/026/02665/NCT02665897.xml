	<brief_summary>In view of both endothelial injury in pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure and kidney impairment characteristics, a recent study demonstrated that the serum levels of NGAL increased at the end of the second trimester in women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia compared to the control group. This correlates well with the endothelial damage that occurs during pre-eclampsia and thus NGAL can be considered as a promising marker in predicting both early and late onset pre-eclampsia. It may be required to combine one or more biomarker with NGAL to increase the precision, and sensitivity for detection of risk and reliability of using biomarkers for pre-eclampsia.</brief_summary>
