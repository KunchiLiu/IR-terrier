	<brief_summary>Worldwide, about 50% of all new cases of HIV occur in youth between age 15 and 24 years. Studies in various countries show that both out of school and in school adolescents and youth are engaged in risky sexual behaviors. Peer-based interventions have become a common method to effect important health-related behavior changes and address the HIV/AIDS pandemic. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of peer education in improving HIV knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices among in-school adolescents</brief_summary>
