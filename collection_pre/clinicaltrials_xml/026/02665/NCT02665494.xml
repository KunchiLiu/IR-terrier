	<detailed_description>Patients will undergo basal blood sample exams regarding blood cell count, renal and liver function, tumor markers, inflammatory and metabolic state, along with a screening (and, if needed, a more in-depth laboratory analysis) for viral hepatitis infections. Information will be collected about radiological, clinical and pathological features of the neoplasm at time of diagnosis, as well, at a later time, about its natural history. A two-step data analysis will be performed: Task-1 analysis will define the risk factors landscape, Task-2 analysis will examine the influence of etiology on clinical outcomes. Anonymized data will be stored in a central database, kept at the Leading Centre.</detailed_description>
