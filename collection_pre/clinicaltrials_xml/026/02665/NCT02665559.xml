	<brief_summary>Testosterone deficiency is classically associated with the development of metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, erectile disorder and / or a reduced libido, a depressive syndrome and alteration of the quality of patients life. Chronicity of HIV infection leads to several disorders as fever, chronic stress, weight loss and cachexia which are the cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. On the other hand, abnormal secretion of cytokines, secondary to the infection may alter the Leydig cells causing a hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and disrupts steroidogenesis. Cases of testicular invasion by lymphoma or Kaposi's syndromes have also been described. The advent of antiretroviral therapy has reduced the prevalence of hypogonadism in patients infected with HIV that is currently about 20%. This prevalence remains about 20%, regardless of the antiretroviral therapy and CD4-T cell count. No study to our knowledge has so far assessed exhaustively the clinical features, biological, therapeutic and paraclinical of hypotestosteronemiae while assessing the level of total serum testosterone, SHBG and serum free testosterone, among HIV infected patients in the European population.</brief_summary>
