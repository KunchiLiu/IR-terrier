	<brief_summary>This trial will assess the effectiveness of a tailored message intervention on decreasing infant undervaccination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Delay of Vaccination in Children Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This intervention is based on the concept of "message tailoring," whereby each mother is provided with individually customized vaccine- related information that addresses their unique concerns, values, questions and logistical barriers. Message tailoring is an evidence-based health messaging strategy that has been shown to improve compliance with a wide variety of preventive health care behaviors among diverse patient populations. In this three-armed trial the investigator will examine how providing mothers with multiple "doses" of a tailored versus untailored version of our intervention compares with "usual care" for the impact on infant under-vaccination. Secondary outcomes will include maternal vaccine-related attitudes (including level of vaccine hesitancy), alignment of maternal values with provider recommendations, and self-efficacy for overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination.</detailed_description>
