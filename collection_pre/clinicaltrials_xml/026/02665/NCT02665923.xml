	<brief_summary>Ultrasound imaging will be used to (1) evaluate gastric antral volumes in children presenting for anesthesia who have been fasted, and (2) to evaluate time for gastric emptying in healthy, fasting newborns, and infants following feeding of clear liquids and/or milk (including breast or formula).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastric Emptying in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This dual-purpose study will have two wings. The first involves recruitment of fasted patients presenting for elective procedures at CHONY. These patients will undergo one ultrasound prior to their elective procedure after induction of general anesthesia. The second wing involves serial ultrasounds over several visits. Healthy newborns in the Newborn Nursery will be recruited to conduct this study. The initial pilot period will study a total of 30 healthy newborns who will be given formula feeding of known volume, and then serial ultrasound imaging of gastric antral volume will be performed until gastric emptying. Study willl perform follow up of these newborns at two later time intervals (between ages 4-6 months, and 9-12 months). The purpose of follow-up is to evaluate whether there are age-related changes in gastric emptying.</detailed_description>
