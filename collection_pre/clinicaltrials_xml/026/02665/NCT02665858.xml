	<brief_summary>Longitudinal clinical observation of optic nerve head, using slit lamp fundoscopy, guides therapy in pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients; however, it remains a limited method of producing quantitative data in evaluating in patients with IIH. In this study we intend to compare, by using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), the mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and total retinal thickness (RNFLT/TRT) of the optic nerve of newly diagnosed IIH children to a control group. This will provide a quantitative measure for follow-up and treatment of this patient group.</brief_summary>
