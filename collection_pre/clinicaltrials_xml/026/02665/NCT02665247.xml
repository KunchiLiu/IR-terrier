	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the impact of sleep workshops on sleep, mood, anxiety and well-being measures in a sample of college students. College students have a high prevalence of sleep problems including poor sleep hygiene, volitional sleep deprivation, and insomnia. Sleep disorders in college students negatively affect mood, social functioning, physical safety, and academic performance. Rarely recognized by the students themselves, these conditions are therefore often untreated. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive the College Sleep Improvement Plan (C-SIP) or a control session. Participants will be asked to track their sleep as well as complete questionnaires; a subset of participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor.</brief_summary>
