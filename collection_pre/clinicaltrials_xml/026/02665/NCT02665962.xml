	<brief_summary>80% of endometrial cancer patients are overweight or obese. Preclinical and clinical data have shown that caloric restriction (CR) protects against organ injury and decreases perioperative morbidity. This is a feasibility trial to evaluate the effect of a 6 week perioperative CR on surgical and patient-reported outcomes in 20 obese newly diagnosed endometrial cancer patients. The intervention will provide individualized CR program, meal replacement products and nutritional counselling sessions.</brief_summary>
