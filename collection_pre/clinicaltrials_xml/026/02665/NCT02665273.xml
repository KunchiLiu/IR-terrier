	<brief_title>Greater Occipital Nerve Block With Bupivacaine for Acute Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are testing the following hypothesis: In a population of patients who present to an ED with acute migraine and have been treated with parenteral metoclopramide unsuccessfully, bilateral greater occipital nerve blocks with bupivicaine will provide greater rates of short-term and sustained headache freedom than bupivacaine injected intradermally.</detailed_description>
