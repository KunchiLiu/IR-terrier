	<brief_summary>This study is being done to learn more about how changes in certain genes may be linked to cancer. Some people with cancer got their disease because they inherited an abnormal (mutated) gene. The researchers of this study want to better understand the risks that are linked to genetic changes in these less well-studied genes. By understanding these risks, we believe that doctors will be able to give better advice to families with mutations in these genes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROMPT (Prospective Registry of Multiplex Testing) is an Internet-based, patient-directed ascertainment study. It is a partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering, University of Pennsylvania, Mayo Clinic, and Dana Farber Cancer Institute in collaboration with Ambry Genetics, GeneDx, Myriad Genetics, Pathway Genomics, and Quest Laboratories (5 laboratories providing multiplex panel testing commercially).</detailed_description>
