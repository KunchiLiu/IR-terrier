	<brief_title>Early Goal Directed Sedation on Microcirculation in Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies suggest that early goal directed sedation might improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The investigators will conduct a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study to investigate the effect of early goal directed sedation on microcirculation in early septic shock patients with relative stable hemodynamics.</detailed_description>
