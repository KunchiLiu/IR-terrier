	<brief_summary>Insomnia is a commonly reported comorbidity for adolescents with psychiatric conditions. It is well-known that insomnia can exacerbate the concurrent psychiatric symptom load. Treatment of insomnia has been extensively examined in adults, but studies with adolescents are sparse. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT) in outpatients of Children and Youth Psychiatry. Twenty-one adolescents will be recruited and receive 7 weeks of iCBT. Outcome will be measured at pre treatment, at post treatment and at a three months follow-up. Weekly assessments will also be made during treatment on primary outcome and a presumed process variable constructed for the purpose of this trial.</brief_summary>
