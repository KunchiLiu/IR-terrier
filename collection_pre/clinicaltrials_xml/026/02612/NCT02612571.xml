	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to compare rates of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in professional wind versus non-wind instrument players in the Philadelphia Orchestra. A secondary objective is to evaluate intra-ocular pressure and choroidal thickness of wind instrument players under variable playing conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Rates of Glaucoma in Professional Wind Versus Non-Wind Instrument Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants of this study will be any current or retired member of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Approximately 100 participants will be divided into 2 groups: 1) wind instrument players and 2) non-wind instrument players. A wind instrument is defined as any instrument that contains a resonator, in which a column of air is set into resonation by the player blowing into a mouthpiece at one end of the resonator. A non-wind instrument is defined as any instrument that does not meet the wind instrument criteria. On the day of the eye examinations, the investigator will provide a brief overview to explain the purpose and goals of the study to all potential participants. The examination team will be set up in an adjoining room. Members of the orchestra will be able to visit the examination team at any time during their practice session. A trained technician will perform the following for both eyes for all participants:visual acuity,undilated fundus color photography and intra-ocular pressure measurement. The investigators will record the examination findings using a standard form. Demographic information, including ocular, medical, social, and family history, will be documented for all participants.</detailed_description>
