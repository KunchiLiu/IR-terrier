	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled therapeutic study in patients with confirmed diagnosis of NiemannPick disease type C (NPC). The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of arimoclomol (compared to placebo) when it is administered as an add-on therapy to the patient's current prescribed best standard of care; patient's standard of care may, or may not, include miglustat.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arimoclomol Prospective Study in Patients Diagnosed With NiemannPick Disease Type C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled therapeutic study in patients with confirmed diagnosis of NiemannPick disease type C (NPC). Patients must either 1) have completed Visit 2 (end of study [EOS]) of the CTORZYNPC001 study or 2) meet the eligibility criteria of this study including a requirement of stable treatment with miglustat for 6 months (if on miglustat therapy) prior to enrolment into the study. Aim: The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of arimoclomol (compared to placebo) when it is administered as an add-on therapy to the patient's current prescribed best standard of care; patient's standard of care may, or may not, include miglustat. Randomisation: Patients will be randomised to receive placebo or arimoclomol (with an allocation ratio of 1:2). Pharmacokinetic evaluation(age below 12): To confirm the selected dose, patients less than 12 years of age will undergo an arimoclomol single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation before randomisation and the start of continuous (multiple dosing) treatment. Early Escape Clause: In patients whose disease progression is too severe and/or too fast, the "early escape clause" will allow the Investigator to apply the escape route which implies that the patient can be treated with arimoclomol (as per blinded phase study schedule) and be followed up on an annual basis until arimoclomol has received EU MA or until the analysis of data from the controlled, 12 month blinded phase study period does not support the efficacy and/or safety of arimoclomol. Study duration: The duration of the blinded phase study period will be 12 months. Following this, all patients will be offered to continue into the extension phase of the study where every patient will receive arimoclomol and be followed up and attend site visits at 18 months and 24 months (after randomisation) and then on an annual basis thereafter.The extension phase runs until arimoclomol has received Regulatory Approval or until the analysis of data from the controlled, blinded phase 12 month study period does not support the efficacy and/or safety of arimoclomol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>EITHER NPC patients who have entered the CTORZYNPC001 study and who have completed Visit 2 (EOS) of the CTORZYNPC001 study. OR NPC patients who did not enter or complete the CTORZYNPC001 study but are fulfilling all of criteria listed below: ◦Diagnosis of NPC1 or NPC2; NPC diagnosis confirmed by: Genetically confirmed (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] sequence analysis) by mutations in both alleles of NPC1 or NPC2, OR Mutation in only one allele of NPC1 or NPC2 plus either positive filipin staining or elevated cholestane triol/oxysterols (&gt;2 x upper limit of normal). Males and females aged from 2 years to 18 years and 11 months; Treated or not treated with miglustat; If a patient is under prescribed treatment with miglustat, it has to be under stable dose of the medication for at least 6 continuous months prior to inclusion in the CTORZYNPC002 study; o If a patient has been discontinued from prescribed treatment with miglustat, they must have been discontinued for at least 3 continuous months prior to inclusion in the CTORZYNPC002 study; Body mass index (BMI) Z score ≥ 2 SD (standard deviation) for age, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) standards; Presenting at least one neurological symptom of the disease (for example, but not limited to, hearing loss, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, ataxia, dementia, dystonia, seizures, dysarthria, or dysphagia); Ability to walk either independently or with assistance. Written informed consent (and assent if appropriate to local laws and regulations) prior to any studyrelated procedures; Willing to participate in all aspects of trial design including blood sampling (PK, blood biomarkers and safety labs), skin biopsies and imaging (ultrasonography of the liver and spleen); Ability to travel to the corresponding clinical trial site at the scheduled visit times for evaluation and followup; All sexually active female patients of childbearing potential (postmenarchal) must use highly effective contraception during the study and until 1 week after the last dose of IMP. Highly effective birth control methods include: Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal); progestogenonly hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable); intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormonereleasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal occlusion; and vasectomised partner. All sexually active male patients with female partners of childbearing potential (postmenarchal) must use a condom with or without spermicide in addition to the birth control used by their partners during the study and until 3 months after the last dose of IMP. Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective birth control method only if it is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the study and for 1 week after the last dose of IMP (for female patients of childbearing potential) and for 3 months after the last dose of IMP (for male patients with female partners of childbearing potential). The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated by the Investigator in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. •Ability to comply with the protocolspecified procedures/evaluations and scheduled visits. Recipient of a liver transplant or planned liver transplantation; Severe liver insufficiency (defined as hepatic laboratory parameters, AST and/or ALT greater than threetimes the upper limit of normal for age and gender (central laboratory assessment); Renal insufficiency, with serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (central laboratory assessment); Known or suspected allergy or intolerance to the IMP (arimoclomol or constituents); In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient's clinical condition does not allow for the required blood collection and/or skin biopsies as per the protocolspecified procedures; Treatment with any investigational drug during the study or in the 4 weeks prior to entering the study. This includes treatment with any investigational drug during the study in an attempt to treat NPC; Pregnancy or breastfeeding; Current participation in another trial is not permitted unless it is a noninterventional study and the sole purpose of the trial is for longterm follow up/survival data (registry); For patients who have not completed the CTORZYNPC001 study, fulfilling any of the criteria listed below: Patients with uncontrolled severe epileptic seizures period (at least 3 consecutive severe epileptic seizures that required medication) within 2 months prior to the written consent. This includes patients with ongoing seizures that are not stable in frequency or type or duration over a 2 month period prior to enrolment, requiring change in dose of antiepileptic medication (other than adjustment for weight) over a 2 month period prior to enrolment, or requiring 3 or more antiepileptic medications to control seizures; Neurologically asymptomatic patients; Severe manifestations of NPC disease that would interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the requirements of this protocol; Treatment with any IMP within 4 weeks prior to the study enrolment.</criteria>
