	<brief_summary>Background Studies in the United Kingdom find the stratified care model of the STarT Back Tool (SBT) to be superior to usual care in primary care low back pain (LBP) patients. However, considerations on differences in health care and social systems across countries are required before taking steps towards any recommendations of implementing stratified care into other health care services. Objective To investigate the effectiveness of the stratified care model of the SBT, when embedded into the regional disease management programs on LBP in primary care as compared to current best practice care.</brief_summary>
