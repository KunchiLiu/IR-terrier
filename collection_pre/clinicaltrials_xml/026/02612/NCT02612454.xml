	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the long-term safety of dupilumab in pediatric patients with AD. The secondary objectives of the study are: - To assess the long-term efficacy of dupilumab in pediatric patients with AD - To assess the trough concentrations of functional dupilumab in serum and the immunogenicity in pediatric patients with AD after re-treatment with dupilumab.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key 1. Male or female, â‰¥6 to &lt;18 years of age at the time of screening 2. Participated in a prior dupilumab study in pediatric patients with AD and adequately completed the visits and assessments required for both the treatment and followup periods, as defined in the prior study protocol Key 1. Patients who, during their participation in a prior dupilumab study in pediatric patients with AD, developed a serious adverse event (SAE) potentially related to the study drug any adverse event (AE) that led to permanent study drug discontinuation in the prior dupilumab study, except if the AE was worsening AD, or if the patient received placebo (if known) 2. Patients, who during their participation in a prior dupilumab study in pediatric patients with AD, developed an AE that was deemed related to dupilumab and led to study treatment discontinuation, which in the opinion of the investigator or of the medical monitor could indicate that continued treatment with dupilumab may present an unreasonable risk for the patient 3. Treatment with an investigational drug, other than dupilumab, within 8 weeks or within 5 halflives (if known), whichever is longer, before the baseline visit 4. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 5. Known or suspected immunosuppression 6. Recent infections requiring antiinfectious treatment 7. Recent history or high risk of clinical endoparasitoses 8. High risk populations (low life expectancy, severe concomitant diseases, etc.) 9. Pregnant or breastfeeding women 10. Patients of reproductive potential and sexually active who are unwilling to use adequate contraception 11. Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine within 12 weeks before the baseline visit</criteria>
