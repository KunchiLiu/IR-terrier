	<criteria>For more information regarding BMS clinical trial participation, please visit www.BMSStudyConnect.com 1. All subjects must have documented disease progression per IMWG criteria during or after their last antimyeloma therapy. 2. ECOG Performance Status less than or equal to 2 3. Subject Reenrollment: This study permits the reenrollment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pretreatment failure (ie, has not been treated). If reenrolled, the subject must be reconsented. 4. EPd Cohort: must have received at least 1 but no greater than 2 prior lines of therapy (note: induction and stem cell transplants with or without maintenance therapy is considered 1 line of therapy) Subjects must have received prior treatment with a lenalidomidecontaining regimen for at least 2 consecutive cycles (full therapeutic dose) and must have been deemed as relapsed, refractory, or intolerant. Refractory is defined as progressing ontreatment or within 60 days of the last dose. 5. EN Cohort: Subjects must have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory (IMID) agent OR were doublerefractory to both an IMID and a PI. Refractory is defined as progressing ontreatment or within 60 days of the last dose. 1. Subjects with solitary bone or extramedullary plasmacytoma as the only evidence of plasma cells dyscrasia 2. Subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), primary amyloidosis, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or POEMS syndrome (plasma cell dyscrasia with poly neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes) 3. Subjects with Central Nervous System involvement with multiple myeloma Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply.</criteria>
