	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Pono Choices: A Culturally Responsive Teen Pregnancy and STI Prevention Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study used a cluster randomized controlled design to evaluate the impact of Pono Choices. Thirty-six middle schools in Hawaii were randomly assigned to participate as either a treatment or control school. Treatment school teachers were trained to deliver Pono Choices. Control school teachers did not receive training and chose their own middle school sexual health education curricula. Over 1,700 7th and 8th grade students in 34 Hawaii schools enrolled into the study. As part of the study, students were invited to participate in baseline and follow-up surveys. The student survey responses were used to determine the impact Pono Choices has on teen pregnancy and STI prevention measures.</detailed_description>
