	<brief_summary>Prospective, single-arm, cross-sectional, study to establish the effectiveness of MIAA to detect melanoma in pigmented lesions, compared to gold standard histological determination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melanoma Image Analysis Algorithm (MIAA) Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skin Analytics Limited have developed an algorithm (MIAA) which reviews photographs of pigmented lesions to determine whether melanoma is likely to be present. This study aims to establish how well MIAA determines the presence or absence of melanoma, compared to a biopsy. Pigmented lesions that a dermatologist has decided to biopsy, and are suitable for photographing, will be photographed up to five times in a single visit. Three different camera will be used, and two different dermoscopic lens attachments will be used on smartphone cameras. Images will be analysed by MIAA and the results compared to the biopsy result. Clinicians, patients and the statistical analysis team will be blinded to the result of MIAA. At least 65 pigmented lesions positive for melanoma (as determined by biopsy) are required, which is predicted to mean 1250 patients will be recruited.</detailed_description>
