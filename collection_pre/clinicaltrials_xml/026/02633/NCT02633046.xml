	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subjects must meet all of the following criteria for inclusion in the study at the Screening Visit/Visit 1 and the Baseline Visit/Visit 2. 1. Subjects must be adequately informed and understand the nature and risks of the study and must be able to provide a signature and date on the ICF. 2. Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age at Screening Visit/Visit 1 and can be male or female. 3. Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential (history of hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or are postmenopausal with no history of menstrual flow in the 12 months prior to Screening Visit/Visit 1), or if of childbearing potential must be nonpregnant, nonlactating and agree to use effective contraception with a male partner throughout study participation and for 4 weeks after ending study participation. Acceptable forms of contraception include hormonal measures (oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, injections), intrauterine devices, double barrier method (condom plus diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus spermicidal gel or foam), and abstinence. 4. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must have been surgically sterilized (vasectomy) or agree to use a double barrier for contraception (condom plus diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus spermicidal gel or foam) or remain abstinent throughout their study participation and for 4 weeks after ending study participation. 5. Subjects must have a history of primary FSGS confirmed by a renal biopsy ≤ 3 years prior to Screening Visit/Visit 1; or subjects must have a history of primary FSGS confirmed by biopsy performed between 3 to 5 years prior to Screening Visit/Visit 1 and, in the investigator's opinion, the subject has no signs or symptoms of other clinical diagnoses that could suggest a change in renal histology. Approval by the medical monitor (MM) is required prior to enrollment if renal biopsy was done 3 to 5 years prior to the Screening Visit/Visit 1. 6. Subjects must have a total urine protein creatinine ratio (uPCR) &gt; 3500 mg/g(396 mg/mmol) at Screening Visit/Visit 1. 7. Subjects must have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the Screening Visit/Visit 1 as calculated by the 4variable modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) study equation. 8. Subjects must have failed to achieve sustained CR or PR of proteinuria as determined by the investigator with ≥ 1 prior immunosuppressive therapy, or must have intolerance to ≥ 1 prior immunosuppressive therapy. 9. Subjects must have been treated with an ACEi, ARB, or DRI for ≥ 4 weeks prior to Screening Visit/Visit 1 and on stable maintenance dose(s) for ≥ 14 days prior to Screening Visit/Visit 1 and are expected to remain on that dose for the duration of the study or have a documented intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or direct renin inhibitor (DRI) with approval from the MM prior to enrollment. Subjects taking other antihypertensive medication(s), must be on a stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit/Visit 1. 10. Subjects must have a mean systolic blood pressure ≤ 150 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of ≤ 90 mm Hg determined by the average of ≥ 3 seated readings taken at least 5 minutes apart at Screening Visit/Visit 1 and at the Baseline Visit/Visit 2. 11. Subjects must be able to communicate effectively with study personnel. 12. Subjects must be able and willing to follow all protocol requirements and study restrictions. 13. Subjects must be able and willing to return for all study visits. Exclusion Criteria Subjects are ineligible for study participation if they meet any of the following criteria at the Screening Visit/Visit 1 or Baseline Visit/Visit 2. 1.

Any current congestive heart failure (defined as New York Heart Association Functional Class III to IV). Peptic ulcer (within 6 months prior to Screening Visit/Visit 1).
