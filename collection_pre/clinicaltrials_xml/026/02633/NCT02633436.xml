	<brief_summary>To explore the significance of Solute Carrier Family 1 Member 5 (SLC1A5) in the occurrence of esophageal cancer, by comparing the expression of SLC1A5 between esophageal cancer tissues and adjacent tissues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Research on the Role of SLC1A5 in the Development of Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an observational study. The investigators will aim to enroll 100 male and female adult patients (aged 18 years and over) of all ethnicities/races, who have been referred to the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University for esophageal cancer. The investigators will be using a standardized data collection form. This is an observational study in which standard of care will be practiced and the patients are not placed at additional risk from participating in this study. However, as the investigators are collecting data prospectively, all participants will sign consent. An attempt will be made to see if there is a correlation between the expression of SLC1A5 with esophageal cancer.</detailed_description>
