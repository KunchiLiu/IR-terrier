	<criteria>1. Healthy males and females aged more than or equal to 18 years 2. Clinical diagnosis of tinea pedis with lesions localized to the interdigital spaces or predominantly interdigital, but may extend to other areas of the foot (the noninterdigital lesions should not be hyperkeratotic, i.e., characteristic of tinea pedis moccasin), and provisionally confirmed at baseline by a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount preparation (i.e., skin scrapings from the target site are placed on a microscope slide with a drop of 10% KOH, and microscopic examination reveals segmented fungal hyphae) 3. The sum of the clinical signs and symptoms scores of the target lesion is at least 4, including a minimum score of at least 2 for erythema AND a minimum score of 2 for either scaling or pruritus (on a scale of 03, where 2 indicates moderate severity) 1. Pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant during the study period 2. Use of antipruritics, including antihistamines, within 72 hours prior to entry into the study 3. Use of topical corticosteroid, antibiotics or antifungal therapy within 2 weeks prior to entry into the study 4. Use of systemic (e.g., oral or injectable) corticosteroid, antibiotics or antifungal therapy within 1 month prior to entry into the study 5. Use of oral terbinafine or itraconazole within 2 months prior to entry into the study 6. Use of immunosuppressive medication or radiation therapy within 3 months prior to entry into the study. 7. Confluent, diffuse moccasintype tinea pedis of the entire plantar surface. 8. Presence of any other infection of the foot or other disease process that might confound the treatment evaluation 9. History of dermatophyte infections unresponsive to systemic or topical antifungal drugs 10. Known hypersensitivity to Naftifine Hydrochloride or to any component of the formulation</criteria>
