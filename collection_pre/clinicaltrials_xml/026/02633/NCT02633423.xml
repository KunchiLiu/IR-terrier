	<brief_title>Expiratory Flow Limitation and Mechanical Ventilation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction During general anesthesia a reduction of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) was observed. The reduction of FRC could imply that respiratory system closing capacity (CC) exceeds the FRC and leads to a phenomenon called expiratory flow limitation (EFL). Several factors contribute to the EFL phenomenon during general anesthesia, including anesthesia induction by itself. High oxygen concentrations, muscle paralysis, supine positioning, increased extravascular water because of perioperative fluid therapy and inflammatory response also play a role in this picture. Moreover cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with aortic cross-clamping, which is necessary for the majority of procedures in cardiac surgery, was associated with direct lung damage. Pulmonary atelectasis, apnea and ischemia during CPB and activation of proteolytic enzymes in the pulmonary circulation influence the incidence of postoperative pulmonary dysfunction after cardiac surgery. Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) test is a validated method to evaluate the presence of EFL during anesthesia. PEEP-test is a feasible and completely safe measure of the reduction of FRC in mechanically ventilated patients. Aim of the study will be to asses if mechanical ventilation during CPB in cardiac surgery could reduce the incidence of EFL in the post-CPB period. Primary end-point Primary end-point will be the incidence of EFL, assessed by a PEEP test, performed at different time-points in operating room. Co-primary end-point will be shunt fraction, determined before and after surgery. Secondary end-points Secondary end-points will include: - duration of mechanical ventilation; - ICU length of stay; - hospital length of stay. Materials and methods This will be a single center single-blind parallel group randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to three parallel arms with an allocation ratio 1:1:1, to receive one of three mechanical ventilation strategies during CPB. Patients that will match the following criteria at the preoperative evaluation will be recruited. Randomization and masking Patient will be randomized according to a computer-generated list of casual numbers. Information about patient allocation will be kept in closed opaque envelopes and nobody will know patient allocation before randomization. Patients will be blind to allocation. Ventilation protocol All patients will receive lung protective ventilation, with a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg of ideal body weight (IBW), a respiratory frequency titrated to maintain normocapnia and a PEEP of 0 cmH2O, Zero End-Expiratory Pressure (ZEEP) until CPB. After CPB patients will be ventilated with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) will never be higher than 80%, with the exception of the blood samples obtained for shunt fraction calculation. At moment of CPB, patients will be subsequently randomized into three arms: 1. Ventilation stop during CPB; 2. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) during CPB, with an airway pressure of 5 cmH2O; 3. Low tidal low frequency ventilation, with 5 acts per minute, with a tidal volume of 2-3 ml/kg of IBW and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. After CPB a single recruitment maneuver will be performed manually, in correspondence to the surgical de-airing procedure. Airway pressure will be kept at 40 cmH2O for at least 10 seconds. EFL determination EFL will be determined with the following procedure. PEEP value will be set to 3 cmH2O for 5 respiratory acts. A flow-volume loop will be visualized on the ventilator screen. Then expiratory resistance will be suddenly decreased by a subtraction of 3 cmH2O of PEEP. A patient will be judged having EFL when the subtraction of PEEP will not increase the expiratory flow when compared to the previous test breath. Otherwise a patient will not be considered having EFL, if the subtraction of 3 cmH2O of PEEP will increase expiratory flow. All loops will be saved in electronic format for further analysis. EFL will be determined at the following time-points: - after anesthesia induction; - after sternotomy; - during CPB, immediately before the recruitment maneuver; - after the recruitment maneuver; - before sternosynthesis; - before discharge from operating room. After ICU arrival a best PEEP will be determined in patients having EFL and set for all the postoperative ICU stay. The best PEEP will be defined as the PEEP value able to completely eliminate EFL, assessed with the same method of the PEEP-test. Patients without EFL at arrival in ICU will be ventilated with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Lung mechanics determination Quasi-static compliance of respiratory system (Cqst,rs) will be calculated as: Tidal volume / (end inspiratory plateau pressure - PEEPtot (ml/cmH2O) where PEEPtot is the end-expiratory pressure at period of no-flow. Measurement will be performed with an inspiratory pause of 60%. Airway resistance (Rmin,rs) will be calculated as: (Ppeak - P1) / V' where Ppeak is the peak inspiratory pressure, P1 is the airways pressure at the point of zero flow and V' is the inspiratory flow. Measurement will be performed with an inspiratory pause of 60%. Lung mechanics will be determinated immediately after every PEEP test execution. Dead space calculation Dead space fraction calculation will be performed with the Enghoff modification of the Bohr equation: Vd/Vt = (PaCO2-PECO2)/PaCO2 Where: - Vd is the dead space - Vt tidal volume - PECO2 is pressure of mean expired CO2 Shunt fraction calculation Shunt fraction will be determined before surgery and after surgery in operating room during general anesthesia, before patient discharge from operating room. Shunt fraction will be assessed as follows in all patients: Qs/Qt = (PAO2 - PaO2)*0,0031 / C(a-v mixed)O2 + [(PAO2 - PaO2)*0,0031] Where: - PAO2 is oxygen alveolar concentration; - PaO2 is oxygen arterial concentration; - C(a-v mixed)O2 is arterovenous difference in oxygen concentration; - 0,0031 is a conversion factor to volume percent for O2. Measure will be performed while breathing 100% oxygen for 20 minutes, to achieve a complete hemoglobin saturation. If a Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC) will be placed, according to clinical indications, shunt fraction will be calculated from the following formula: Qs/Qt = CcO2-CaO2 / CcO2-Cv(mixed)O2 * 100 Where: • CcO2 is pulmonary capillary blood O2 content, estimated with the following equation: CcO2 = (Hb * 1.34) + (0.0031 * PAO2); - CaO2 is arterial oxygen content; - Cv(mixed)O2 is oxygen content in blood samples obtained from the pulmonary artery; - PAO2 is alveolar oxygen partial pressure. Blood samples will be collected from arterial catheter and pulmonary artery catheter, under a FiO2 of 100% in the same moment. Furthermore Blood Gas Analyses (BGA) will be performed on arterial blood: - after anesthesia induction; - after sternotomy, together with heparinization; - before sternosynthesis, together with protamine administration; - before discharge from operating room. Sample size calculation Sample-size calculation was based on a two-sided alpha error of 0.05 and a 80% power (beta). On the basis of their experience and the few studies available, the investigators anticipate that the 50% of patients with ventilation stop during CPB will experience a EFL after CPB, while about the 25% of patients treated with CPAP and low tidal ventilation will have EFL, with a reduction of 50%. The investigators calculate that they will need a sample size of 43 patients per group, 129 in total. Including a drop-out fraction of 10%, the investigators calculate that they will be needing 144 patients to complete the trial. Data collection and analysis Data will be collected on the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF). In particular anamnestic information will be collected, data about surgery and post-operative clinical data, in particular respiratory parameters. Data will be analyzed with a professional statistical software. Dichotomous variables will be compared with the two-tailed Chi square test, using the Yates correction when appropriate. Continuous variables will be compared by analysis of variance or the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, when appropriate. Informed consent and trial conduction Each patients will provide informed consent. All parts of this trial will be conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) statement as well as Italian and international law on clinical research.</detailed_description>
