	<brief_summary>This study aimed to assess the correlation between the interleukin-10 (IL-10)-1082A/G polymorphism and idiopathic recurrent miscarriage (IRM) of Chinese Han. A total of 100 women with IRM and 100 control women with a successful pregnancy will be included in this study. Then genotyping will be performed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-10 Promoter-1082A/G Polymorphism and Idiopathic Recurrent Miscarriage Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a common occurrence in early pregnancy, IRM has been associated with multiple causes, among which the disorders of immune homeostasis between the fetus and the maternal immune system, maintained by cytokines from the complex regulatory network, are considered one of the potential etiological factors underlying IRM. The IL-10 polymorphism -1082A/G (rs1800896), which is located in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene, was reported to be implicated in the abnormal expression of IL-10 in IRM by some studies. However, no such reports about the association between IL-10 polymorphism -1082A/G and IRM risk in Chinese Han.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. women with more than three consecutive unexplained pregnancy losses before the 20th week; 2. Chinese Han Population; 3. Patients who signed informed consent. 1. Patients who had other highrisk factors which might relate with recurrent miscarriage, including: (1) Parental karyotype abnormalities: significant rearrangements (e.g. balanced translocations and mosaics) were considered abnormal. If either the patient (or her partner) had an abnormal karyotype, it was considered a parental karyotypic abnormality; (2) Genital tract abnormalities: Any congenital anatomical deformation of the genital tract was considered abnormal; intrauterine adhesions, endometriosis and hydrosalpinx were also considered abnormal; (3) alloimmune disorder; (4) Endocrine abnormalities: prolactin (PRL) level &gt;25 ng/ml, testosterone level &gt;2.6 nmol/L, thyroidstimulating hormone level &lt;0.30 mU/L or &gt;4.5 mU/L, free thyroxine (FT4) level &lt;8.36 nmol/L or &gt;29.6 nmol/L and free triiodothyronine (FT3) level &lt;1.84 nmol/L or &gt;7.39 nmol/L. Glucose level &gt; 126mg/dl; (5) Autoimmune disorders: Any positive results of Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACAIgG/IgM/IgA), antinuclear antibodies (ANAIgG), antiendometrium antibodies (AEAIgM), antiovary antibodies (AOAIgM), antisperm antibodies (ASAIgM), antithyroidin(TGAb), antithyroid peroxidase antibody(TPOAb) and/or antichorionic gonadotropin hormone antibody; (6) Hypercoagulation state: Ddimer levels &gt;260 ng/ml, fibrin degradation products (FDP) levels &gt;5 mg/L or antibeta 2glycoprotein I (antibeta 2GP1) levels &gt;15 U/ml; (7) Negative RH blood groups; (8) Abnormal semen routine results of patients husband. 2. Patients with serious diseases; 3. Patients with administration of contraceptive pills; 4. Patients participated in other randomized clinical research; 5. Patients could not be followedup of a long time or had poor compliance; 6. Patients with other factors that would affect the study result.</criteria>
