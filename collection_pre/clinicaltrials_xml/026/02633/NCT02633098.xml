	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of pre-operative artesunate given orally once a day for 14 days prior to surgery in patients with Stage II/III colorectal cancer. Artesunate is an established antimalarial drug with an excellent safety profile, is well tolerated and affordable. A number of laboratory studies and one small pilot clinical study in patients with colorectal cancer have shown that artesunate can reduce the activity of cancer cells. Two hundred patients diagnosed with operable colorectal cancer will be randomly allocated to receive oral artesunate 200mg daily or a matching placebo for 14 days prior to surgery. Patients will be followed up closely for 5 years to see if giving artesunate preoperatively reduces the risk of cancer returning after treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Pre-operative Artesunate in Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinins are a family of sesquiterpene trioxane anti-malarial agents derived from Sweet Wormwood (Artemisia annua L), a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Artesunate is a derivative of artemisinin that is converted into its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Artesunate is a widely used antimalarial with a good safety profile and oral route of administration. Artemisinins have demonstrated broad anti-cancer effects including pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastatic effects. Despite a multi-modality treatment approach to colorectal cancer, 5 year overall survival does not currently exceed 60%. Neoadjuvant pre-operative therapy may be more effective at eradicating micrometastases compared to adjuvant therapy delivered following the delay and immunological stress of surgery. However current neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens are often associated with significant side effects and may result in a delay in surgery whilst patients recover. A well tolerated, affordable, novel anticancer agent that could be given to patients whilst they wait for surgery, without causing a surgical delay due to treatment related toxicity, would have a significant clinical impact on patient care. In the NeoART trial, 200 patients with Stage II/III colorectal cancer planned for curative surgery, will be randomly allocated to receive either pre-operative oral artesunate 200mg once daily or matching placebo for two weeks prior to surgery. Patients will be followed up closely for 5 years following treatment to see if artesunate is associated with improved recurrence free survival. The safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant artesunate in colorectal cancer will also be further assessed.</detailed_description>
