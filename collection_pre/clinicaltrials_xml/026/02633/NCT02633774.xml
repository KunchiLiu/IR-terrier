	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with impaired cognitive function (CogF) and/or dementia, but it is unclear whether rhythm control of AF improves CogF or brain perfusion. The hypothesis is rhythm control of AF improves CogF by increasing brain perfusion with hemodynamic amelioration compared to AF state. We will randomize the patients with persistent AF to rhythm control group and rate control group, and check baseline and 3rd month cognitive function (K-MOCA score) and brain perfusion CT. K-MOCA score and brain perfusion CT findings will be compared between rhythm control group and rate control group of persistent AF.</brief_summary>
