Current or recent (within 10 days of enrolment) use of aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) or chronic use of other fulldose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with antiplatelet activity 7. Receiving any medications or substances that are strong or moderate inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) are prohibited =&lt; 7 days prior to registration 8. Receiving any medications or substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 use of inducers are prohibited =&lt; 7 days prior to registration 9. Inadequate coagulation parameters: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) &gt;1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or INR &gt;1.5 10. Inadequate liver function, defined as: serum (total) bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT &gt;2.5 x ULN 11. Inadequate renal function, defined as: serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl or &gt;177 micromol/l urine dipstick for proteinuria &gt;2+. Patients with &gt; o = 1+ proteinuria at baseline dipstick analysis must undergo a 24hour urine collection and must demonstrate ≤1g of protein in their 24hour urine collection. 12. Pregnancy or breastfeeding 13. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg on antihypertensive medications) 14. History of gross hemoptysis within 3 months prior to randomization unless definitively treated with surgery or radiation 15. History of any of the following within 6 months prior to randomisation: serious systemic disease, unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade 2 or greater Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), unstable symptomatic arrhythmia requiring medication, clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess 16. Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture 17. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or other serious or acute internal bleeding within 6 months prior to randomization 18. Central Nervous System (CNS) bleeding; history or clinical evidence of CNS stroke (hemorrhagic or thrombotic) within the last 6 months 19. Inpatient surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomization 20. Minor surgical procedure, fine needle aspirations or core biopsy within 7 days prior to randomization 21. Anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study 22. Inability to take oral medication or requirement for intravenous (IV) alimentation or total parenteral nutrition with lipids, or prior surgical procedures affecting absorption 23. Evidence of confusion or disorientation, or history of major psychiatric illness that may impair the patient's understanding of the Informed Consent Form or his/her ability to comply with study requirements 24. Any other invasive malignancies within 5 years (except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell skin cancer or surgically resected prostate cancer with normal PSA) 25. Brain metastasis 26. Patients who have had radiotherapy ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, but who are still experiencing acute toxic effects of radiotherapy 27. Known HIV positive patients (patients with both acute or chronic infection are excluded) 28. Active HBV or HCV infection (patients with chronic nonactive infection are eligible) 29. Any already known inflammatory changes of the surface of the eye at baseline 30. Any other concomitant pathologies or laboratory alterations that prevent or contraindicate the use of erlotinib or bevacizumab.</criteria>
