	<brief_title>Comparison of First Sense Breast Exam® to the University of Toledo Mammography and Biopsy Results</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate the First Sense Breast Exam® test and the analysis by Therma-Scan. The First Sense Breast Exam® test is an adjunct to a mammogram. Currently, mammography is the standard of care in screening for breast cancer, and manual thermology is an adjunctive screening method. All of the study costs will be incurred by the sponsor and the subject will incur no costs to participate in the study. The First Sense Tester is a non-significant risk device where the tester's imaging camera makes no contact with the subjects during the entire procedure.</detailed_description>
