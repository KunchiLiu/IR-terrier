	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ⅲ randomized, controlled, multi-center, trial comparing cisplatin plus docetaxel to cetuximab, cisplatin, and docetaxel induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation in previously untreated patients metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (mNPC) to determine whether the addition of cetuximab to induction chemotherapy and chemoradiation could improve therapeutic efficacy in mNPC, and investigate predictive and prognostic factors for mNPC.</brief_summary>
