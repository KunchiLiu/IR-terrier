	<brief_summary>The anteromedial (AM) portal technique was introduced to position the femoral tunnel in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to more closely replicate the original footprint compared to the transtibial (TT) approach.1-5 Few randomized trials have evaluated differences in these techniques with respect to clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are any differences in clinical outcome between the AM and TT approaches.</brief_summary>
