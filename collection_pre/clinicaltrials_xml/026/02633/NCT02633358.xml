	<brief_summary>Acute myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock trigger IL-6, the strong inflammatory response, result in multiple organ failure, even death. While therapeutic hypothermia,to expect the possibility of anti-inflammatory effect via IL-6 bi-phasic effect and IL-10 , to improve the multiple organ failure, to increase survival rate and well cerebral performance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-inflammatory Effect of Therapeutic Hypothermia in Acute Myocardial Infarction Complicated With Cardiogenic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite emergency coronary revascularization coupled with medical stabilization, intra-aortic balloon pump have significantly improved survival in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction, mortality still remains excessively high, being actually about 30-50%. Future research should focus on new therapeutic strategies, aimed to further decrease mortality rate of these patients or improve possible hospitalization and prognosis. Heart pumping failure result in cardiogenic shock. Increased LA filling pressure result in acute pulmonary edema, hypoxemic respiratory failure, even congestive kidney and congestive liver. Decreased stroke volume result in hypoperfusion obviously direct induce acute renal failure, disturbance consciousness and lactate accumulation, even, shock liver. Multiple organ failure is the major mortality in the patients suffered from cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. Cardiogenic shock remains the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction . Systemic inflammation , especially endovascular Interleukin-6, triggered by Tumor necrosis factor-alfa and Interleukin-1 beta result in inappropriate vasodilatation is observed in many patients with cardiogenic shock and may contribute to an excess mortality rate. In recent study, interleukin-6 represented a reliable independent early prognostic marker of 30-day mortality. Therapeutic hypothermia (34℃) increase stroke volume, reduce muscle oxygen consumption and enhance anti-inflammatory action . The mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect for therapeutic hypothermia in cardiogenic shock is still unclear, need to further study in clinical trial. Furthermore, this study will provide new strategy to increase survival rate in cardiogenic shock.</detailed_description>
