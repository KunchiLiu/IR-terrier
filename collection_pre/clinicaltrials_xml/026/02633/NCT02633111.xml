	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a blood test can accurately detect whether if the participant's lymphoma has come back after completion of initial chemotherapy treatment for their aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The purpose of the study is to see if MRD in blood samples can potentially replace CT scans after completion of chemotherapy in the future.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 years of age at time of signing informed consent Histologyconfirmed aggressive Bcell NonHodgkin lymphoma De novo diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (including all subtypes such as primary mediastinal Bcell lymphoma and Tcell rich Bcell lymphoma). According to the 2008 WHO Classification of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tumors. These would include double or triplehit diffuse large Bcell lymphomas with MYC/BCL2 and/or BCL6 gene rearrangements. These cases may be classified as high grade Bcell lymphomas according to the 2017 revision of the WHO Classification of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tumors. Recipient of frontline multiagent chemotherapy (for example, RCHOP, dose adjustedREPOCH, RCHOP/RICE, RCHOP+investigational agent, etc). Eligible patients will have recently received (â‰¤ 4 months from end of treatment assessment), be actively receiving, or planned to receive frontline chemotherapy in near future (within 3 months of signing consent). A frontline therapy program can include different sequential phases of treatment, including highdose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Required pretreatment test specimen from bone marrow, blood, lymph node, or alternate site to identify tumorspecific clonotype. Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule and all the protocol requirements, including surveillance imaging and MRD test specimen collection at specified time points. Patients receiving 2nd or greater line of therapy.</criteria>
