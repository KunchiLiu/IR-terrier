	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation remains one of the most common organ transplanted today but the surgical technique has changed very little from the original pelvic operation. The deceased donor renal transplant poses a particular challenge to the surgeon due to lack of detailed pre operative vascular assessment. The hemopatch is a promising new sealing synthetic hemostatIc agent with a novel dual mechanism of action that is more convenient to apply rather then using other hemostatic agents, which require warming and/or mixing.</brief_summary>
