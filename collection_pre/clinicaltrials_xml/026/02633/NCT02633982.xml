	<brief_summary>In atrial fibrillation patients,anticoagulant therapy with warfarin has an excellent stroke preventive. Meantime,Warfarin may also increase the risk of hemorrhagic events. Considering this,warfarin is a drug which puts a great burden on patients and medical providers. With the population aging, the number of non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients is increasing, and a necessity that not only specialist but also general practitioners. Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin is not easy for general practitioners and is not commonly used among general practioners. In such circumstances, Rivaroxaban,a new oral direct factor Xa inhibitor,has become available. Rivaroxaban is administrated once a day and exert an anti- coagulant effect soon after administration. It hardly reacts with foods or other drugs and therefore does not require regular monitoring. GENERAL study is to investigate the effectiveness of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients when it is prescribed by general practioners in real life settings.</brief_summary>
