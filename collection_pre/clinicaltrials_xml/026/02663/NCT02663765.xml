	<brief_summary>Antenatal care is a key strategy for reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality rate because adequate utilization of antenatal health care services is associated with improved maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The trend of maternal mortality in developing countries has been increasing and various international organizations have reported that an important factor related to maternal and infant mortality has been linked to lack of antenatal care. According to Federal Ministry of Health, some of the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth can be avoided if the pregnant woman attends antenatal regularly.
