	<brief_summary>This is a Phase IV randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 1000 individuals aged 18 years or older, with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) who meet all eligibility criteria in endemic regions. This study is designed to provide data on the effectiveness of early antifungal treatment (Fluconazole, 400 mg/day) for coccidioidomycosis pneumonia (also referred to as Valley Fever (VF) Pneumonia or acute onset valley fever) vs. placebo in subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia. Patients who are prescribed antibacterials by their health care provider for acute CAP will be randomized to receive either placebo or 400 mg/day of fluconazole for 42 days. The primary objective is to assess the clinical response of early empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole through Day 22 in subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia and are compliant with the study intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase IV randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 1000 individuals, aged 18 years or older, with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) who meet all eligibility criteria in endemic regions. This study is designed to provide data on the effectiveness of early antifungal treatment (Fluconazole, 400 mg/day) for coccidioidomycosis pneumonia (also referred to as Valley Fever (VF) Pneumonia or acute onset valley fever) vs. placebo in subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia. Patients who are prescribed antibacterials by their health care provider for acute CAP will be randomized to receive either placebo or 400 mg/day of fluconazole for 42 days. Blood work for serologic determination of coccidioidomycosis infection will be drawn at the time of randomization (Day 1), and again on Days 15, 22, 29. On Day 43, subjects will be informed of their coccidioidomycosis status and their treatment assignment. Those who receive placebo and are coccidioidomycosis negative will be dismissed from the study after the Day 43 visit; those who are coccidioidomycosis positive will be referred to a health care provider with the results of their serology testing and their treatment assignment for further treatment as indicated and will return for follow-up visits on Days 90 and 180. Those who receive fluconazole and are coccidioidomycosis negative will remain in the study for an additional 6 days for safety follow-up only; those who are coccidioidomycosis positive will be referred to a healthcare provider with the results of their serology testing and their treatment assignment for further treatment as indicated and will return at Days 90 and 180 and will be contacted via phone on Day 49. The study duration will be approximately 72 months, and the subject participant duration will be from 42 days to approximately 6 months. The primary clinical outcome will be time to achieve clinical response based on signs and symptoms of pneumonia via FLEET CAP score through Day 22. Secondary outcomes will be measured and include the time to clinical response among subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia through Day 43; the mean, median and quartiles for both individual components and composite symptom scores over the evaluable points during the duration of the study period; the mean, median and quartiles for responses to individual items and composite Extra-Pulmonary Symptom Scores in the absence of disseminated disease; the time missed from work or school and SF-12v2 and the incidence rates of all-cause mortality and hospitalization among subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia.</detailed_description>
