	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about the potential effects of visible light on the skin. More specifically, this study will examine whether an incandescent lamp (light bulb) or LED light bulb can cause skin to become darker. Investigators will determine the minimum threshold dose required to achieve immediate pigmentation darkening (IPD), persistent pigmentation darkening (PPD), and delayed tanning (DT) for Fitzpatrick skin types IV - VI utilizing two visible light sources.</brief_summary>
