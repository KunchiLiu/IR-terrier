Approximately 20 patients will be administrated each study drug once every week as an iv infusion for 24 weeks. Efficacy of GC1111 will be evaluated in Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), urine Glycosaminoglycans(uGAG), liver and spleen volume, percent predicted Forced Vital Capacity(FVC), and cardiac size and function. Also immunogenicity, Pharmacokinetics(PK) and safety will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
