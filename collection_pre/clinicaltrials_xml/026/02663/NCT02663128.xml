	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure how much of a new tablet formulation of AZD3293 gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it, compared to the current tablet formulation of AZD3293. The effect of a high fat meal on how quickly the body absorbs the new tablet formulation will also be evaluated. In addition any side effects of the study drug using both the new and current tablet formulations will be evaluated. The study will last about 22 days, with screening required within 30 days prior to the start of the study.</brief_summary>
