	<brief_summary>The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration. In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical structure carrying the patient's genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody floats around in the blood and can detect and stick to cancer cells called lymphoma cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it is now joined to the T cells. Only the part of the antibody that sticks to the lymphoma cells is attached to the T cells instead of the entire antibody. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown. The purpose of this research study is to determine a safe dose of the ATLCAR.CD30 cells that can be given to subjects after undergoing an autologous transplant. This is the first step in determining whether giving ATLCAR.CD30 cells to others with lymphoma in the future will help them. The researchers also want to find out what side effects patients will have after they receive the ATLCAR.CD30 cells post-transplant. This study will also look at other effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on your cancer and how long they will survive in your body.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective - To determine the safety and tolerability and to estimate the MTD of ATLCAR.CD30 post ASCT in patients with CD30+ lymphoma at high risk for relapse Secondary Objectives - To measure the survival of ATLCAR.CD30 in vivo - To estimate PFS after infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 post ASCT in patients with CD30+ lymphoma at high risk for relapse - To determine the overall survival after infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 post ASCT in patients with CD30+ lymphoma at high risk for relapse ENDPOINTS Primary Endpoint - Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0). The MTD will be based on the rate of dose-limiting toxicity Secondary (Clinical) Endpoint - PFS is defined from day of ASCT to relapse (in patients with a documented complete response after ASCT) or progression (in patients with documented stable disease or partial response after ASCT), or death as a result of any cause as per the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma - Overall survival will be measured from the date of administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL to date of death OUTLINE Patients scheduled to undergo an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for treatment of lymphoma will be approached for consent to screening and potential enrollment into LCCC1524. Peripheral blood cells will be collected from consenting patients who meet eligibility for cell procurement for creation of ATLCAR.CD30 cells prior to ASCT. The ASCT, including mobilization and collection of PBSCs, administration of myeloablative therapy, reinfusion of PBSCs and supportive care following transplant will be as per routine standard of care, and not expected to be impacted by enrollment into LCCC1524. Post ASCT, patients who meet eligibility criteria for treatment will receive one infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 cells once there is evidence of hematologic recovery. Research personnel will keep track of any patients who undergo procurement but do not undergo treatment with ATLCAR.CD30 cells, and the reason for withholding treatment. Cell Procurement Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL total (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained for subjects for cell procurement. In patients with low (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry less than 200/μl) T-cell count in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes. For pediatric patients (patients under 18 years of age), the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 mL (less than 1 teaspoon per 2.2 lbs. that the child weighs. ATLCAR.CD30 Cells Administration Post ASCT, once the patient has started to experience hematologic recovery (defined as ANC ≥500 cells/mm3 for 3 consecutive days, AND platelet count ≥25 cells/mm3 without transfusion over the preceding 5 days, AND Hg ≥8g/dL without transfusion support over preceding 5 days), . This will generally occur between 14 and 20 days following infusion of autologous stem cells following high-dose chemotherapy. Duration of Therapy Therapy in LCCC1524 involves just one infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 cells. Treatment with one infusion will be administered unless: - Patient decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR - General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. Duration of Follow-Up Patients will be followed for up to 15 years or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.</detailed_description>
