	<brief_summary>Hydrocephalus is a disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid production, flow and absorption leading to intracranial hypertension. Assessment of the change in intracranial pressure after ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery is important in guiding appropriate postoperative management. The optic nerve sheath diameter measured using ultrasonography has been verified as a non-invasive indicator of intracranial hypertension in various clinical studies. The investigators hypothesized that a change in optic nerve sheath diameter detected through ultrasonography could help ascertain a reduction in intracranial pressure following ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery in adult patients without the risk of serious complications.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patients (2090 years of age, ASA physical status 3 or less) who are scheduled for elective ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery with noncommunicating hydrocephalus and communicating hydrocephalus except for normalpressure hydrocephalus Noncommunicating hydrocephalus is defined as a pattern of ventricular system or at the level of the fourth ventricle's outlets by lesions including tumor, giant aneurysm, or aqueductal stenosis. Communicating hydrocephalus is defined as paraventricular enlargement resulting from postoperative complication after cranial surgery, meningitis, subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage.
