	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop and assess the efficacy of an integrated strategy that includes feasible and scalable interventions to identify, recruit, link to care, retain in care, attain, and maintain viral suppression among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States (US).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Recruitment, Linkage to Care and Treatment for HIV-Infected MSM in the United States</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will use deep-chain respondent driven sampling (DC-RDS) to identify and recruit HIV-infected MSM who are not virally suppressed. A subset of these men will be enrolled into one of two study arms. The intervention arm will provide a Case Manager (CM) intervention package designed to enhance linkage to care, antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation, treatment adherence and retention in care. The control arm will provide the standard of care (SOC) for linkage to care, initiation of ART, treatment adherence and retention in care. The primary outcome of the study is viral suppression 24 months after enrollment. Phylogenetic methods will be used to evaluate the relationship between social and sexual networks identified through DC-RDS and viral networks. Mathematical modeling will be performed using demographic, behavioral, and clinical data generated from this study and other sources to estimate the population-level impact of the CM intervention on HIV incidence and to estimate the level of identification, linkage, ART coverage and viral suppression that would be required to achieve a substantial reduction in HIV incidence among MSM in the US settings where the study is conducted.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Individuals who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for inclusion in the study (screening, CM intervention arm and SOC control arm): Biological male (currently and at birth) Selfreport of history of anal intercourse with another man within the last 6 months 16 years or older (At sites with IRB approval, MSM age 1617 years old can be recruited and enrolled if they are willing and able to provide written assent, and if a parent or legal guardian is willing and able to provide written informed consent.) In addition to the criteria above, individuals who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment into the CM intervention and SOC control arms: HIVinfected, as defined in the HPTN 078 StudySpecific Procedures (SSP) Manual Not virally suppressed (defined as HIV VL &gt; 1000 copies/ml, note that this VL cutoff is being used as an indicator of adherence or resistance issues for study inclusion only) Can receive care at one of the participating clinics (listed in the HPTN 078 SSP Manual) No current plan to relocate in the 24 months following enrollment Individuals who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study (screening, CM intervention arm and SOC control arm): Unable or unwilling to provide consent (or assent for a minor with parent or legal guardian consent) for study participation Transgender women Active or previous participation in an HIV vaccine trial, unless evidence can be provided documenting randomization to the placebo arm. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator of Record (IoR), would make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives. In addition to the criteria above, individuals who meet any of the following criteria are excluded from enrollment into the CM intervention and SOC control arms: â€¢ Current participation in a linkage or ART adherence study</criteria>
