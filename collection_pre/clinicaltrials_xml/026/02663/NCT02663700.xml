	<detailed_description>This study is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial of Sanaria's irradiated sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ vaccine). The primary objective of this protocol is to determine the safety and reactogenicity of the PfSPZ Vaccine in malaria-experienced healthy adults. The secondary protocol objective is to evaluate vaccine-induced immune responses, including but not limited to, anti-CSP antibody and T cell responses against whole P. falciparum sporozoites and a variety of P. falciparum antigens from different life cycle stages. The study duration shall be 34 months and subject participation duration shall be 15-26 months.</detailed_description>

Appear to be in generally good health based on clinical and laboratory investigation 1. Previous vaccination with an investigational malaria vaccine 2. Use of an investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days before the first study vaccination, or planned use up to 30 days after last vaccination 3. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months before the first vaccination. This includes any dose level of oral steroids, but not inhaled steroids or topical steroids. 4. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before the first study vaccination with the exception of tetanus toxoid 5. Confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition 6. Confirmed or suspected autoimmune disease 7. History of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to artesunate and artemisinin derivatives, vaccinations or to any vaccine component 8. History of serious allergic reactions to any substance, requiring hospitalization or emergent medical care 9. History of allergy to any component of the vaccine formulation, including human serum albumin 10. Use or planned use of any drug with antimalarial activity during the course of the study except for antimalarial medication administered by study clinicians 11. History of splenectomy 12. Confirmed or suspected pregnancy or current breastfeeding 13. Laboratory evidence of liver disease (ALT &gt; 1.25 x upper limit of normal) 14. Laboratory evidence of renal disease (serum or plasma creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal) 15. Laboratory evidence of hematologic disease (platelet count &lt;115,000/mm^3, or hemoglobin &lt;11.2 g/dL for males and &lt;9.5 g/dL for females). 16. Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C virus (hepatitis C antibody) 17. Seropositive for HIV 18. Sickle cell trait carriage or sickle cell disease 19. Administration of immunoglobulin and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first study vaccination or planned administration during the study period. 20. Simultaneous participation in any other interventional clinical trial 21. Acute or chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal or neurological condition, severe malnutrition, or any other clinical findings that may increase the risk of participating in the study, as determined by the PI 22. Other condition that in the opinion of the PI would jeopardize the safety or rights of a participant in the trial or would render the participant unable to comply with the protocol</criteria>
