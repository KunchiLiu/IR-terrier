	<brief_summary>Capacity on intensive care units is limited but inevitable for high risk surgery and/or high risk patients i.e. patients with severe preconditions. Contrary, if there is no capacity on an ICU elective surgery has to be postponed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current allocation process of ICU capacities and analyze parameters important for ICU admission in an university hospital in Germany. In a second phase a risk score for ICU admission shall be invented from parameters obtained during phase one (ICU-Risk-Score). This new score will then be evaluated in a third phase of the project.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Of An ICU Risk Score</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Capacity on intensive care units is limited but inevitable for high risk surgery and/or high risk patients. Contrary, if there is no capacity on an ICU elective surgery has to be postponed. It is one of the core duties of Anesthesiologists in our hospital to identify patients with high risk for a post-surgery ICU stay upon hospital admission. We do know that there is two factors influencing the possibility of an ICU admission: The patient centered risk i.e. severe preconditions and the surgery centered risk with high possibility for perioperative complications i.e. bleeding, hemodynamic instability, pulmonary complications etc.. However, we do not know what these factors look like exactly and more importantly, how they are evaluated and weighed against each other. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current allocation process of ICU capacities and analyze parameters important for ICU admission in an university hospital in Germany. This evaluation will be fulfilled by a data collection sheet completed by Anesthesiologists performing anesthesia in all elective and emergency surgery during a specific period of time. In a second phase a risk score for ICU admission shall be invented from parameters obtained during phase one (ICU-Risk-Score). This new score will then be evaluated in a third phase of the project.</detailed_description>
