	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel-group, Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PCC plus bevacizumab and CA4P versus PCC plus bevacizumab and placebo in subjects with platinum-resistant ovarian cancers (prOC). Subjects with platinum-resistant, recurrent, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer will be randomized 1:1 to receive PCC plus bevacizumab and CA4P or PCC plus bevacizumab and placebo. Subjects will be stratified by selected chemotherapy (PLD vs. paclitaxel), platinum free interval (&lt; 3 vs. 3 to 6 months from last platinum therapy to subsequent progression), and line of therapy (2nd vs. 3rd). This is a 2-part study, consisting of a Phase 2, exploratory study (Part 1) followed by a Phase 3, pivotal study (Part 2). Both parts of the study will have similar overall design. Approximately 80 subjects will be randomized into Part 1 and approximately 356 subjects will be randomized into Part 2.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel-group, Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PCC plus bevacizumab and CA4P versus PCC plus bevacizumab and placebo in subjects with platinum-resistant ovarian cancers (prOC). Subjects with platinum-resistant, recurrent, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer will be randomized 1:1 to receive PCC plus bevacizumab and CA4P or PCC plus bevacizumab and placebo. Subjects will be stratified by selected chemotherapy (PLD vs. paclitaxel), platinum free interval (&lt; 3 vs. 3 to 6 months from last platinum therapy to subsequent progression), and line of therapy (2nd vs. 3rd). This is a 2-part study, consisting of a Phase 2, exploratory study (Part 1) followed by a Phase 3, pivotal study (Part 2). Both parts of the study will have similar overall design. Approximately 80 subjects will be randomized into Part 1 and approximately 356 subjects will be randomized into Part 2. All subjects randomized will receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) on Days 1 and 15, repeated every 4 weeks (q4wk) and PCC with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22, repeated q4wk, or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 8, 15, repeated q4wk or PLD 40 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, repeated q4wk. Subjects in the Treatment Arm will also receive CA4P 60 mg/m2 on the same day as bevacizumab (Days 1 and 15, repeated q4wk), while subjects in the Control Arm will receive placebo on those days. Order of dosing will follow the guidance listed below during this study when bevacizumab and CA4P / Placebo are dosed the same day as PCC, - Bevacizumab followed by CA4P / Placebo followed after 1-3 hours by paclitaxel, - PLD followed by bevacizumab followed by CA4P / Placebo Subjects will continue randomized treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor discontinues study for any reason. Subjects will undergo tumor assessments (RECIST) at baseline and every 8 weeks and CA-125 levels at baseline and every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint is PFS. Secondary endpoints include ORR, OS, proportion of subjects who remain progression free at 6, 9, and 12 months, and safety. Endpoints will be compared between the Treatment Arm and the Control arm. The study duration is estimated to last approximately 3 years. This study will have 2 parts with the same overall design. Part 1 will enroll up to approximately 80 subjects and will include multiple interim analyses to test the safety and efficacy assumptions in this specific subject population. Upon meeting certain efficacy criteria in Part 1, the protocol will be amended and additional sites added in order to enroll an additional 356 subjects into Part 2 of the study. Subjects enrolled in Part 2 will be analyzed separately and used as a stand-alone confirmatory efficacy study.</detailed_description>

Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer in recurrent stage 5. prOC (platinumresistant ovarian cancers) defined as progression within &gt;1 to &lt;6 months of receiving last platinumbased therapy 6.

Surgery for brain metastasis must be &gt; 8 weeks from study entry 10. Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL without transfusions or growth factors 11.

For example, a patient who failed bevacizumab + weekly paclitaxel would be allowed to enroll in FOCUS only if they are assigned to bevacizumab + PLD for the study. 3.
