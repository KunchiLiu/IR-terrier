	<detailed_description>The study objective is to collect data to assess the accuracy and reliability of Earlysense contactless monitoring for blood pressure monitoring vs. gold reference methods such as ABPM (Ambulatory blood pressure measurement) for patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine department and vs. Arterial Line measurements for patients hospitalized in ICU. In addition the collected data will be used to further enhance and improve the existing algorithms.</detailed_description>
