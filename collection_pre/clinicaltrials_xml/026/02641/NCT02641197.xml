	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to define the repeatability and reproducibility of quantifying flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery (BA) using the AngioDefender (AD) methodology. Repeatability will be assessed by repeat AD testing of the same subject 1 hour apart, using the same AD device and operator. Reproducibility will be assessed by comparing FMD scores obtained for the same subject, but using different AD devices and operators.</brief_summary>
