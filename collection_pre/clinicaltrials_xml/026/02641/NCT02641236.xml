	<brief_summary>This research study is for participants who are undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and are at risk for developing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a complication of HSCT in which immune cells from the donor cause inflammation and injury to tissues and organs of the HSCT recipient. Vancomycin-polymyxin B (commonly called "vancopoly") is an oral antibiotic that is given to people undergoing allogeneic HSCT as a preventive measure for acute GVHD. This research study is studying the effects of vancopoly on the microorganisms living in the intestine during and after stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gut Decontamination In Pediatric Allogeneic Hematopoietic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase 2 clinical trial. Phase 2 clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. Pre-clinical studies performed in the 1970's showed that killing all the bacteria in the intestine with oral antibiotics could decrease the risk of acute GVHD following allogeneic HSCT. Based on this observation, many stem cell transplant centers adopted the practice of "gut decontamination" with oral antibiotics as a preventive measure for acute GVHD. There is no standard regimen for gut decontamination between transplant centers, and there are no definitive human studies showing that gut decontamination is beneficial for lowering the risk of acute GVHD. Recent studies in adult patients undergoing stem cell transplant indicate that the types of bacteria living in the intestine can influence bone marrow transplant outcomes such as survival and development of acute GVHD. Some types of bacteria may be protective against GVHD and others may increase the risk of GVHD. Based on this newer research, it is possible that the practice of gut decontamination ("vancopolys") may not be beneficial for HSCT patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria for Patients Undergoing Allogeneic HSCT Recipient of 10/10 (HLAA, B, C, DRB1, DQB1) matched bone marrow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) OR 6/6 (HLAA, B, DR) matched cord blood allogeneic HSCT. Participants may have underlying malignant or nonmalignant hematologic disease, except for primary immunodeficiency, as the indication for their allogeneic HSCT. Participants must receive a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in the conditioning regimen is permitted. Graftversushost disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with a calcineurin inhibitor and shortcourse methotrexate with or without steroids. Age ≥ 4 years old and toilettrained. Participants must be able to deposit stool samples directly into stool collection containers. Stool specimens from diapers are difficult to obtain and are prone to more sampling error, particularly for loose or liquid stools which are common in the peritransplant period. Lansky/Karnofsky performance status ≥60% (see Appendix A) Ability to understand and/or the willingness of their parent or legally authorized representative to sign a written informed consent document Eligibility Criteria for Healthy Bone Marrow Donors Healthy individuals, ages ≥ 4 years and toilettrained, who have been identified by BCH or DFCI providers as fullymatched, sibling bone marrow donors for transplantation will also be eligible to participate in this study. Patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for correction of a primary immunodeficiency disorder (e.g. SCID). Recipients of mismatched allogeneic HSCT. Patients receiving a reducedintensity (nonmyeloablative) conditioning regimen. Patients with age ≤ 10 years undergoing HSCT with a matched sibling donor. These patients are at very low risk of acute GVHD and do not receive gut decontamination per our institutional standard practice. Participants receiving GVHD prophylaxis with drugs other than calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate or steroids. History of allergic reactions attributed to oral vancomycin or oral polymyxin B. Participants undergoing active therapy for immunemediated or infectious colitis upon admission for allogeneic HSCT. Participants receiving antibiotic therapy for treatment of a bacterial infection or bacterial prophylaxis upon admission for allogeneic HSCT. Use of any agent (e.g. sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is permitted. Concurrent use of antifungal and antiviral therapies is also permitted. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.</criteria>
