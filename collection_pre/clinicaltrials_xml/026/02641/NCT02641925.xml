	<brief_summary>Many features of the metabolic syndrome are associated with insulin resistance. And, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are related to visceral obesity. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that visceral fat removal (omentectomy) can make favorable results for the insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. As the omentectomy is optional procedure during a surgery for early gastric cancer, the investigators will divide patients randomly into two groups, total omentectomy group and omentum preserving group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omentectomy for Metabolic Syndrome in Gastric Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will compare the change of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and improvement of metabolic syndrome between total omentectomy and omentum preserving group.</detailed_description>
