	<brief_summary>Interval colon cancers are an important clinical issue. Literature dealing with technics and quality of polypectomy is scarce. A recent paper from Pohl et al focused on non-pedunculated polyps of 5-20 mm, evaluating non complete polypectomy and factors related to it, revealing that 10% of these polyps were not completely resected. This fact was attributed to size and histology (the majority of non completely resected ones, were polyps of 10-20 mm and with serrated characteristics at the histology). In this study the investigators want to evaluate the radical resection of non-pedunculated polyps of 5-20 mm by performing biopsies on the margins immediately after polypectomy, to establish if the use of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) could be useful in the definition of the margins of the lesion before polypectomy.</brief_summary>
