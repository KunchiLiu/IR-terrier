	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety of Guselkumab in Participants With Palmoplantar Pustulosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), multicenter (when more than one hospital works on a medical research study) placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study) study in participants with palmoplantar pustulosis. The study will consist of 3 phases: screening phase (up to 6 weeks), treatment period (week 0 - week 60) and observational period (up to week 84). Participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (200 milligram [mg] guselkumab, 100 mg guselkumab or placebo group) using a stratified block randomization method in a 1:1:1 ratio at Week 0 and Group III (placebo) participants will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups at Week 16. Participants will primarily be assessed for change from baseline in Palmo-Plantar Pustular Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) total score at Week 16. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
