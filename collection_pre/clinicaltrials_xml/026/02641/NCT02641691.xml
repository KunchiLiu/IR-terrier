	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to look at how tumors responds to a short course of radiation (5 days) followed by 4 cycles of chemotherapy. The standard treatment for people with stage I rectal cancer is complete surgical removal of the tumor and associated area, which often means the creation of a permanent ostomy. Recent research has shown that the use of an organ preservation strategy has shown benefits in people with more advanced rectal cancers, and so the investigators propose to use a similar treatment strategy in this study to see if non-operative or less drastic operative therapy (and potentially avoiding a permanent ostomy) is feasible.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of biopsy proven stage I adenocarcinoma of the rectum; staging must also be based on multidisciplinary evaluation including MRI and/or endorectal ultrasound Entire lesion visualized on rigid proctoscopy Tumor ≤ 8 cm from anal verge ECOG performance status 02 At least 18 years of age Adequate bone marrow function defined as: ANC &gt; 1,500 cells/mm3 Hgb &gt; 8 g/dl platelets &gt;100,000 cells/mm3 Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Able to understand and willing to sign an IRBapproved written informed consent document. No visible tumor present Prior chemotherapy or extirpative surgery for rectal cancer. A history of other malignancy ≤ 3 years previous with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or prostate cancer treated without radiotherapy. Currently receiving any investigational agents. A history of allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 5FU, oxaliplatin, or leucovorin. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry. Known HIVpositivity and on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the study drugs. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.</criteria>
