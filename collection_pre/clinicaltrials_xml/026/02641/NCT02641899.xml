	<brief_title>Study of the Effects of ITCA 650 on Gastric Emptying and Interaction of ITCA 650 on 4 Commonly Studied Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acetaminophen will be use to assess the effect of ITCA 650 on the rate of gastric emptying. Interactions between ITCA 650 and the medications lisinopril, digoxin, atorvastatin, and warfarin will also be studied.</detailed_description>

History of hypersensitivity to exenatide. Contraindications or warnings according to the specific label(s) for acetaminophen, atorvastatin, lisinopril, digoxin or warfarin therapy.
