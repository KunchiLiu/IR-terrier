	<brief_title>Effect of Intraoperative Dexmedetomidine on Development of Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy may lead to the renal hypoperfusion, systemic inflammatory response, and oxidative stress. Dexmedetomidine has been known to protect the kidney against inflammation and oxidative stress in diverse clinical settings. It may also enhance a renal perfusion by inhibition of renal sympathoexcitation. We hypothesized administration of dexmedetomidine might protect the kidney in patients undergoing cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
