	<brief_summary>It's already known the efficacy of Gait Analysis (GA) on evaluating gait modification on Parkinson's Disease (PD) Patients (1). On the other hand Proprioceptive Focal Stimulation seems be useful in symptoms amelioration in several neurological disease. Few studies have been performed in Parkinson's disease. A total of 126 patients suffering from PD will be recruited in 6 italian neurological centers. The study will be a cross-over multicenter study with the randomization of the sequence. The patients will be randomly assigned to 2 groups receiving for 8 weeks either the Equistasi medical device, or an equivalent placebo. Gait analysis will be recorded in each patient at the beginning and at the end of the treatment assigned. After 4 weeks of wash-out, the treatment will be crossed and a new gait analysis recording will be performed. Finally a last recording will be taken at the end of the last 8 weeks. Secondary outcome will be the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale), PDQ-39 (Parkinson Disease 39 Questionnaire ), ABC (Activity Specific Balance Confidence Scale).</brief_summary>
