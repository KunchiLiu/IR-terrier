	<brief_summary>There is currently no established treatment for paroxysmal hypertension, but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors showed good effect in previous reports. This double-blind, placebo controlled, prospective multicenter clinical trial will assess the efficacy of sertraline on cessation or reduction of symptoms of paroxysmal arterial hypertension. 136 patients with documented hypertensive paroxysms with abrupt elevations of blood pressure and distressful physical symptoms will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive sertraline, 50 mg daily, or matching placebo as an add-on to their chronic medication. Effect of the treatment on patient symptoms, office and ambulatory blood pressure and side effects will be evaluated after 3 months. If proven effective, sertraline might become a standard treatment for this condition.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study will enroll adult patients (age &gt;18 years) with hypertensive paroxysms during the past 6 months (preferably during the past 6 weeks) abrupt elevations of systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥20% compared to previous measured systolic BP value before paroxysm, or ≥20% compared to mean systolic BP on 24hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), or ≥20% compared to measured office systolic BP, documented by a clinician or home blood pressure monitor, requiring physician or emergency room visit or the use of any rescue antihypertensive medication. Hypertensive paroxysms may be accompanied by abrupt onset of one or more distressful physical symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, flushing, and diaphoresis. Pregnancy or breastfeeding, hypersensitivity to sertraline (Zoloft®) or of the the components of this drug. Current use of sertraline or any other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), monoamin oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, selegiline, moclobemide, linezolide, pimozide. Current use of other serotoninergic drugs (eg. tryptofane, triptane and other 5HT agonists), tramadol or dopamine antagonists (including antipsychotics).</criteria>
