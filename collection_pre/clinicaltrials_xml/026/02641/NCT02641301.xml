	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether sustained release morphine pharmacokinetics parameters in patients undergone roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) differ from subjects who did not. Our hypothesis is that exposure is comparable. Indeed, in the Study OBEMO (Determinants of Oral Morphine Answer Among Obese Patients Before and After Gastric Bypass; NCT00943969) the investigators observed changes in pharmacokinetics parameters for immediate release morphine, probably due to an earlier absorption of the morphine, in agreement with the expected clinical effect of this formulation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an open label study with two arms: patients undergone roux-en-y gastric bypass and volunteers who did not matched by sex, age and Body Mass Index (BMI). In the pharmacokinetic visit the subject takes an oral administration of sustained release morphine, 30 mg, then 11 samples are collected during 12 hours.</detailed_description>
