	<brief_summary>CVXL-0107 a glutamate release inhibitor, has shown evidence of antiparkinsonian and antidyskinetic activity in a macaque model and has shown a significant effect on the UPDRS-III (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) while "ON", as well as an increase of "ON-time" without dyskinesia or without troublesome dyskinesia in a previous phase 2a proof of concept study. This study will confirm the efficacy of CVXL-0107 in combination with optimal dose of levodopa on motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Phase IIa Study of CVXL-0107 in Advanced Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase IIa study, 1:1 randomized, double blind placebo- controlled, with cross-over. Each volunteer patient will be randomly assigned to receive CVXL-0107 or placebo as add-on PD therapy and crossed-over to the other arm in the second sequence of the study. They will be assessed during an acute levodopa challenge test with one intake of the study drug or placebo with a supra-optimal dose of levodopa after 2 weeks of daily treatment with the same study drug or placebo. Patients will be cross-overed to the other treatment and reassessed during a second acute levodopa challenge test after 2 weeks of daily treatment with the study drug or the placebo. The study will evaluate the anti-PD and the anti-dyskinesia efficacy of CVXL-0107 as measured by MDS-UPDRS part III (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and on levodopa-induced dyskinesia as measured by the AIMS (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale).</detailed_description>
