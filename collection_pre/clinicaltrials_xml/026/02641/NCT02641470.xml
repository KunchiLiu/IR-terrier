	<brief_summary>Asthenopia or eye strain describes nonspecific symptoms of an eye when it is tired from intensive work. Vaccinium uliginosum is a flowering plant in the genus Vaccinium. This plant is native to cool temperature regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Considering its antioxidative ingredients, the extract of Vaccinium uliginosum is expected to play a significant role in treating various ocular pathologies. The investigators performed a randomized, case-controlled study in healthy subjects and investigated the protective effect of Vaccinium uliginosum extract (DA-9301) on tablet computer-induced asthenopia.</brief_summary>
