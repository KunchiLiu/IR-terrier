	<brief_title>Modulation of STAT3 Signaling With Siltuximab in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single center, non-randomized (patients are not assigned by chance to treatment groups), Mechanistic Study (a study that focuses on the biologic activity of the drug, rather than on disease treatment). Up to 10 patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) will be enrolled in the study. Participants will receive a single dose of siltuximab and blood samples will be obtained a total of 6 times until 12 weeks after dosing. Cells will be isolated from the blood samples and used to measure specific activities of cells in the immune system. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination will be performed throughout the study. The end of study is the date of the last assessment for the last patient.</detailed_description>
