	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety between docetaxel combined with doxorubicin (epirubicin) and cyclophosphamide followed by gemcitabine combined with cisplatin and doxorubicin (epirubicin) combined with cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel for high risk triple negative breast cancer predicted by the mRNA-lncRNA integrated signature and validation the efficacy of the signature.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TA(E)C-GP Versus A(E)C-T for the High Risk TNBC Patients and Validation of the mRNA-lncRNA Signature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. Chemotherapy is the current mainstay of treatment. The treatment of patients with TNBC has been challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease and the absence of well-defined molecular targets. The investigators' previous study has successfully identified and independently validated prognostic and predictive RNA signatures for TNBC, which could be used to classify TNBC patients into high- or low-risk of recurrence. This study is intended to further validate the efficacy of the mRNA-lncRNA signature and also explore better chemotherapy for the predicted high risk TNBC patients. The current study is designed to validation the efficacy of the mRNA-lncRNA signature and evaluate the efficacy and safety between docetaxel combined with doxorubicin (epirubicin) and cyclophosphamide followed by gemcitabine combined with cisplatin and doxorubicin (epirubicin) combined with cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel for high risk triple negative breast cancer predicted by the integrated signature. Primary endpoint for the study: recurrence free survival; second endpoint for the study: safety, disease free survival and overall survival; This open multi-center prospective randomized control study includes TNBC patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. All eligible patients' tumor samples were tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recurrence risks were predicted using the mRNA-lncRNA signature. Patients with high recurrence risk were randomized to Group A or Group B to receive respective chemotherapy. Among which Group A: TA(E)C x 4 cycles to GP x 4 cycles (docetaxel + doxorubicin (epirubicin) + cyclophosphamide to gemcitabine + cisplatin), docetaxel: 75 mg/m2 IV on day 1; doxorubicin: 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 or epirubicin 75 mg/m2 IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide: 500 mg/m2 IV on day 1; gemcitabine: 1250 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and 8; cisplatin: 75 mg/m2 IV on day 1, dosing interval is 21 days. Group B: A(E)C x 4 cycles to T x 4 cycles (doxorubicin (epirubicin) + cyclophosphamide to docetaxel), doxorubicin: 60 mg/m2 IV on day 1 or epirubicin 90 mg/m2 IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide: 600 mg/m2 IV on day 1; docetaxel: 100 mg/m2 IV on day 1, dosing interval is 21 days. Patients with low recurrence risk received chemotherapy in Group C: A(E)C x 4 cycles to T x 4 cycles (doxorubicin (epirubicin) + cyclophosphamide to docetaxel), doxorubicin: 60 mg/m2 IV on day 1 or epirubicin 90 mg/m2 IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide: 600 mg/m2 IV on day 1; docetaxel: 100 mg/m2 IV on day 1, dosing interval is 21 days.</detailed_description>
