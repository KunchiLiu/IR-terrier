	<brief_summary>For patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty, does the use of Aspirin alone compared to using Aspirin along with a mobile compression device provide equivocal results for preventing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after total joint arthroplasty? The investigator will evaluate the prevention of DVT/PE after total hip and knee arthroplasty will be evaluated to see if there is a decreased risk of bleeding while continuing to prevent thromboembolic disease. The equivalency of using the mobile compression devices with aspirin compared to aspirin alone in patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty will be evaluated. A previous study has shown that patient compliance with the pneumatic compression device is less than 80%.</brief_summary>
