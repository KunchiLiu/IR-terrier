	<brief_summary>This prospective study evaluates the methodology and results of epicardial mapping/ablation in a large series of consecutive selected BrS patients and to verify if RFA could normalize the consequences of a genetic disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epicardial Ablation in Brugada Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present Registry is designed as a prospective, monocentric study. All patients referred to the Arrhythmology Department of IRCCS Policlinico San Donato Milanese, University- Hospital, for the management of BrS and fulfilling the selection criteria will be invited to participate in the study and will be asked their written consent to the participation in the trial. Mapping and RFA procedure will be performed following a standardized procedure in hospital settings. Patients will be monitored for at least 3 days after procedure. Before hospital discharge, echocardiography and 12-lead ECG will be performed in all patients. An ajmaline test will be systematically performed after the procedure and thereafter at 3, 6, and 12 months after ablation. Patients will be followed up clinically after procedure as per normal clinical practice. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months. 12-lead ECG and ICD interrogation will be performed at each follow-up visits. Patients will be instructed to immediately contact the center in case of symptoms suggestive of ventricular arrhythmias. Documentation for intercurrent events will be requested and collected.</detailed_description>
