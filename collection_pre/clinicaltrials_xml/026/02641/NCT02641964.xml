	<brief_title>Risk Factors for ARDS in Patients With Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using electronic patient data monitoring systems, the investigators reviewed all patients with a diagnosis of pancreatitis admitted to surgical wards or ICUs at the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University and Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command from January 1, 2009, to October 31, 2015. Inclusion criteria were adult patients (age &gt;18 years) with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria were as follows : 1) lack of radiologic evidence to diagnose acute necrotizing pancreatitis, 2) presence of ARDS before admission to hospitals, 3) unable to partner treatment and leaving hospitals, 4) transferring to the investigators' hospitals after treatment, 5) missing other necessary data, and 6) pregnancy. For enrolled patients, general clinical characteristics were collected. Patients were categorized into two groups according to ARDS or non-ARDS, and the differences of these characteristics between two groups were evaluated. Potential risk factors were collected and studied by using multiple logistic regression analysis.</detailed_description>
