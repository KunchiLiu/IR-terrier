	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the chemotherapy-free combination of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab (GA 101) in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) and a high tumor burden. Primary endpoint to be observed for this is the rate of progression free survival one year after start of therapy. Hypothesis The hypothesis of the study is that ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab will achieve response rates (CR and PR), rates of MRD negativity and PFS which are comparable to currently used standard rituximab-chemotherapy combinations such as R-CHOP or R-bendamustine in subjects with previously untreated FL and a high tumor burden.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, multicenter phase 2 study in up to 98 subjects with previously untreated FL and a high tumor burden in advanced stages and in need of therapy. The study will include a central monitoring of MRD by PCR, a central pathologic review and complimentary research projects including monitoring of immune response. The study therapy comprises an initial 6 cycles of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab followed by an additional 24 months of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab maintenance. In patients being MRD negative at 30 months, i.e. at the end of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab maintenance, and without clinical progression no further treatment is given while MRD monitoring is continued. MRD monitoring will be regularly performed on peripheral blood samples collected before the start of therapy and at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 30 respectively. Subsequently, MRD analyses will be performed every 6 months until clinical progression of the disease or for a maximum of 4 years (until the end of the study). If MRD assessment on peripheral blood samples turns from positive to negative within the first 30 months, confirmatory blood and bone marrow samples should be taken 6 months thereafter. In patients remaining MRD positive at 30 months without clinical progression, single agent ibrutinib therapy is continued for another 12 months. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be formed and constituted. The independent DMC will review the safety of the treatment and make recommendations as to the further conduct of the study. The data generated by this phase II study should serve as the basis for a subsequent randomized phase III study comparing the chemotherapy-free combination of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab with standard immune-chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
