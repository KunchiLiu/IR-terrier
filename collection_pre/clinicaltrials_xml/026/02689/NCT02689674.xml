	<brief_summary>Primary objective #1: Determine the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC in the full study sample with regard to treatment engagement over weeks 1-12 and alcohol use over weeks 1-24. Hypothesis 1: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with the patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce higher rates of treatment engagement than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only (e.g., MI-IOP). Hypothesis 2: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with the patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce better alcohol use outcomes than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only (MI-IOP). Secondary analysis 1: Among the Non-engaged patients, determine rates of selection of each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and alcohol use outcomes in each option. Secondary analysis 2: Among the Engaged patients, determine rates of selection of each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and alcohol use outcomes in each option. Primary objective #2: Determine whether the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC varies as a function of engagement group, with regard to treatment engagement over weeks 1-12 and alcohol use outcomes over weeks 1-24. Hypothesis 1: The predicted main effect on retention favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among those in the Engaged group. Hypothesis 2: The predicted main effect on cocaine use outcomes favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among those in the Engaged group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3. Secondary objective #1: Examine outcomes on three secondary measures: percent days abstinent from all substances, negaÂ¬tive consequences of alcohol use, and HIV high risk behaviors. Hypothesis 1: Outcomes on the secondary measures will be better in MI-PC than in MI-IOP. 4. Secondary objective #2: Test hypotheses concerning potential mediators of the predicted main effect favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP. Hypothesis 1: The predicted advantage of MI-PC over MI-IOP will be mediated by greater increases in motivation, self-efficacy, commitment to abstinence, and self-help involvement in MI-PC. 5. Secondary objective #3: Test hypotheses concerning effect of additional MI intervention after initial non-engagement persists through 12 weeks. Hypothesis 1: A second telephone MI intervention will produce higher rates of subsequent engagement and less alcohol use than no further MI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>meet DSMIV criteria for lifetime alcohol dependence and have used alcohol in the prior 6 months; be &gt; 18 years of age; be judged clinically appropriate for IOP (e.g., no current psychotic disorder or evidence of severe dementia, and no acute medical problem requiring inpatient treatment; have no regular IV heroin use during the past year; have access to a telephone; be willing to be randomized and participate in research; be required to be metropolitan area residents, and be able to provide the name, verified telephone number, and address of at least two contacts who can provide locator information on the patient during followup. We will include patients with dependence on other substances, provided that they are alcohol dependent and meet other inclusion criteria. have a current psychotic disorder (as assessed with the psychotic screen from the MINI) or evidence of dementia severe enough to prevent participation in outpatient treatment; have acute medical problem requiring immediate inpatient treatment; or are currently participating in methadone or other forms of DA treatment, other than IOP.</criteria>
