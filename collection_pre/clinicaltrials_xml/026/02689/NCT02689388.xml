	<brief_summary>Post-operative delirium is common after hip fracture surgery and is associated with increased length of hospital stay, delayed recovery and increased mortality. Post-operative delirium can also decrease patients' quality of life and can increase treatment costs. Anaesthesia and pain relief (analgesia) treatments may also influence the incidence of delirium, but more research is needed into which techniques are effective in improving patient outcomes and decreasing treatment costs. Use of opioids intra-operatively has been associated with increased delirium, so using regional analgesia instead may decrease the incidence of delirium in patients after surgery compared with systemic analgesia. Both regional analgesia (nerve block) and opiod analgesia are common practices for managing patients pain. This study compares these to practice to determine the incidence of delirium following hip fracture surgery</brief_summary>
