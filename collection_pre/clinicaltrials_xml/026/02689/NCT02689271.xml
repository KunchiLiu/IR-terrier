	<detailed_description>Patients will undergo an advanced diffusion-weighted MRI sequence called VERDICT with the intention of better characterising prostate cancer. A panel of serum and urine biomarkers will also be analysed, which we hope will predict those patients who go on have a positive MRI. OBJECTIVES: - To establish a fluidic marker - prostate MRI paradigm which: (i) utilises fluidic markers to rationalise selection of patients with significant prostate cancer; and (ii) improves the diagnostic accuracy of imaging over and above standard multiparametric (mp) MRI - Enable a pathway for rapid clinical evaluation of emerging fluidic markers and exosomes - Assess the repeatability of VERDICT MRI - Ascertain whether VERDICT derived quantitative parameters correlate with quantitative histological parameters - Develop a database of fluidic marker and VERDICT characterised, mp-MRI, histologically validated patients for subsequent exploratory and longitudinal outcome analysis</detailed_description>
