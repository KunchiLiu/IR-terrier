	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of preoperative remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) on organ damage and the functional characteristics of arteries in patients undergoing vascular surgery. In addition, we investigate the connection between RIPC and changes in the functional characteristics of arteries and low molecular weight metabolites.</brief_summary>
