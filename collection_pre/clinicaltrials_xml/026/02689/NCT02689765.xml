	<brief_summary>Metabolic problems represent one of the major health concerns which are attractive for being addressed by nutritional interventions, as these are directly connected to dietary habits.Anthocyans possess cardiovascular disease prevention, obesity control, and diabetes alleviation properties, but association between anthocyans and prediabetes need to be more firmly understood and established from robust clinical data. However, there is little human research that has reported on the efficacy of increased anthocyans bioactive consumption on insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Anthocyanins on Metabolic Profiles in Subjects With Pre-diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to conduct a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to characterize the potential effects of anthocyans, purified from bilberries and blackcurrants, on metabolic abnormalities commonly associated with type 2 pre-diabetes.</detailed_description>
