	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a combination of enzalutamide and paclitaxel can help to control triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by shrinking the tumors in the breast and/or lymph nodes before they are surgically removed. The safety of this treatment combination will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IIB Neoadjuvant Enzalutamide (ZT) Plus Taxol for Androgen Receptor (AR)-Positive Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (AR+ TNBC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will take enzalutamide by mouth every day for 12 study cycles. Each cycle is 7 days (1 week). On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 2 hours. If you have side effects, the study doctor may decide to lower your study drug dose level or have you stop taking the drug for a short time. If your dosing is stopped, you may be able to restart the study drug later at the same dose or a lower dose. The study doctor will discuss this with you. Study Visits: Before treatment begins, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for biomarker testing (including genetic biomarkers). Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug. On Day 1 of each cycle: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 1 of Cycle 7, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for CTC and biomarker tests. Any time during the 12 study cycles, you may have imaging scans (the same ones that were performed at Screening) to check the status of the disease, if the doctor thinks they are needed. At the end of 12 cycles: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, CTC tests, and biomarker testing. - You will have imaging scans of the breast and lymph nodes to check the status of the disease. After 12 cycles of study drugs on this study, you may then have surgery to remove the tumor(s). You will be given a surgery consent form that describes the procedure and its risks. If you do not have surgery, you may still have a lymph node biopsy or removal, based on standard care. Your doctor can discuss this with you. Leftover tissue/blood from study testing will be banked at MD Anderson. Before your samples can be used for research, the researchers must get approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD Anderson. The IRB is a committee of doctors, researchers, and community members. The IRB is responsible for protecting study participants and making sure all research is safe and ethical. Your samples will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked to your samples. Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code numbers and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the samples to be updated as needed. Length of Treatment: You may receive up to 12 cycles of chemotherapy. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit. Follow-Up: Within 30 days (+/- 3 days) after surgery/biopsy, you will have a follow-up visit. During this visit, you will be asked about how you are doing, and blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This is an investigational study. Paclitaxel is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer that does not respond to chemotherapy. Enzalutamide is not FDA-approved for breast cancer. It is currently being used for research purposes only in breast cancer patients. The study doctor can explain how these study drugs are designed to work. Up to 37 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must be willing to sign the protocolspecific written informed consent. 2. Patients with histologically confirmed intact primary cancer that is confirmed invasive carcinoma of the breast with at least 1.0 cm of residual disease as measured by mammography, ultrasound, or breast MRI after neoadjuvant anthracycline based chemotherapy. 3. Patients must have triplenegative breast cancer defined as ER&lt;10%; PR&lt;10% by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2 01+ by IHC or 2+, FISH nonamplified. 4. Androgen Receptor will be quantified using a CLIAcompliant assay for AR with the initial biopsy specimen. AR positivity is defined as &gt;/= 10% of nuclear staining. 5. Patient's disease state must be AJCC 7th edition stage IIII. 6. Men or women must be 18 years of age or older. 7. Patients must have a performance status of 0 1 on the ECOG performance scale. 8. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test must be done within 72 hours before the first dose of the study medication for women of childbearing potential as per institutional guidelines. Postmenopausal women (defines as no menses for at least 1 year) and surgically sterilized women are not required to undergo pregnancy test. 9. Men on study must use a condom if having sex with a pregnant woman. 10. Male patients and his female partner who is of childbearing potential must use 2 acceptable methods of birth control (one of which must include a condom as a barrier method of contraception) starting at screening and continuing throughout the study period and for 3 months after final study drug administration. 11. Patient must have adequate organ function as determined by the following laboratory values: 1) Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= to 1,500 /uL 2) Platelets &gt;/= to 100,000 / uL 3) Hemoglobin &gt;/= to 9 g/dL 4) Creatinine clearance &gt;/= to 50 ml/min 5) Total bilirubin &lt;/= to 1.5 X ULN 6) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;/= to 2.5 X ULN. 1. Patients who have received previous antitumor therapies (other than anthracyclinebased neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the current cancer event). 2. Breastfeeding at screening or planning to become pregnant during the course of therapy. 3. Patients who have had major surgery within 21 days before Cycle 1, Day 1. 4. Patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel that did not resolve with pre medication. 5. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% or 10% decrease from baseline on echocardiogram after anthracycline based chemotherapy. 6. Patients with gastrointestinal impairment that would affect the absorption of Enzalutamide or previous history of colitis. 7. Subjects requiring daily corticosteroids, other than those given as premedication for the anthracyclinebased chemotherapy. 8. Patients with known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease. 9. History of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior cortical stroke, significant brain trauma) at any time in the past.
