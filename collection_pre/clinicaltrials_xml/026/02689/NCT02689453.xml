	<brief_summary>Background: Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a rare blood cancer. Researchers want to see if a combination of two drugs - recombinant human interleukin 15 (rhIL-15) and alemtuzumab - is a better treatment for ATL. Objectives: To test if giving rhIL-15 combined with alemtuzumab improves the outcome of therapy for ATL. Also, to determine the safe dose of this combination and identify side effects and effects on the immune system. Eligibility: Adults 18 years and older with chronic or acute ATL who have not been helped by other treatments. Design: Participants will be screened with tests that are mostly part of their usual cancer care. They will sign a separate consent form for this. Weeks 1 and 2: Participants will have a total of 10 visits. They will: - Get rhIL-15 under the skin by needle. - Have a physical exam and vital signs measured. - Give blood samples. - Answer questions about their health and their medicines. Week 3: Participants will stay in the clinic. They will: - Get alemtuzumab infusions in a vein through a small catheter on days 1, 2, 3, and 5.. - Take medicines to decrease side effects. - Have a computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate the treatment. - Have a physical exam and vital signs measured. - Give blood samples. Answer questions about their health and medicines. Weeks 4, 5, and 6 will repeat week 3, without the CT scan. Some patients will just have outpatient visits these weeks. After treatment, participants will have follow-up visits every few months for up to 2 years. At these visits, participants will give blood samples and have CT scans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Recombinant Human IL-15 (s.c. rhIL-15) and Alemtuzumab for People With Refractory or Relapsed Chronic and Acute Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - A previously reported Lymphoid Malignancies Branch (LYMB) trial administering alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1) to patients with chronic, acute and lymphomatous subtype HTLV-1 associated ATL showed appreciable initial activity but no clear long-term impact. - Overall response rate of 52% (n=15) in 29 patients. - Median duration of response 3.4 months. - Median overall survival 5.9 months. - Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells acting as the effector cells is alemtuzumab s primary in vivo mechanism of action for depleting malignant leukemic or lymphomatous cells. - The immunologic effects of Interleukin-15 (IL-15), a stimulatory cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and long-term CD8+ memory Tcells, has been assessed in several phase I trials in cancer patients. - Administration of recombinant human (rh) IL-15 as an intravenous bolus (IVB), continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) or subcutaneous injections (SC) into adult cancer patients has produced 5 to 50 fold expansion in the number of circulating NK cells at well tolerated doses in these patients. - Preclinical murine lymphoid malignancy models have shown efficacy from the administration of IL-15 and monoclonal antibodies. - In a syngeneic model, immunocompetent mice bearing an EL4 cell line transfected with human CD20 showed increased ADCC and improved survival for the mice treated with IL-15 and rituximab compared to mice treated with either agent alone or to controls. - In xenograft human MET-1 model, mice treated with alemtuzumab and IL-15 also had improved survival. Objective: -Determine the safety, toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of s.c. rhIL-15 administered in combination with standard three times per week IV alemtuzumab treatment. Eligibility: - Age greater than or equal to 18 years old - ECOG Performance Status less than or equal to 1 - Diagnosis of chronic or acute adult T-cell leukemia - ATL (CD3lowCD4+ CD25high) cells express CD52 - Measurable or evaluable disease (patients with &gt; 10% of their circulating lymphocytes classic ATL CD3low CD4+ CD25+ phenotype are considered measureable) - Normal organ and bone marrow function Design: - This is a single institution nonrandomized Phase I dose escalation study evaluating increasing doses of SC rhIL-15 in combination with alemtuzumab using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation. - Treatment Schedule - rhIL-15 weeks 1 and 2 (s.c. Monday through Friday) all dosing cohorts. - Alemtuzumab initiation dosing week 3 (day 1: 3mg, day 2: 10mg, day 3: 30mg and day 5: 30mg IV over 2 hours). The escalating doses are indicated by down arrows in the Schema below. - Standard alemtuzumab weeks 4, 5, and 6: 30 mg three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday.) - rhIL-15 dose levels - Cohort 1-1 mcg/kg/dose - Cohort 2-2 mcg/kg/dose - Cohort 3-3 mcg/kg/dose - Up to 24 patients will be enrolled in this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Age greater than or equal to 18 years; after that there is no upper age limit. Patients diagnosed with chronic or acute leukemia forms of HTLV1 associated adult Tcell leukemia validated by the Pathology Department NCI More than 50% of the circulating CD4+ CD25+ cells must express CD52. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease. All patients with greater than 10% abnormal CD4+ homogeneous strongly CD2+ expressing cells among the PBMCs in the peripheral blood will be deemed to have evaluable disease. Patients must have a life expectancy of greater than or equal to 2 months. Patients must have been refractory or relapsed following front line therapy for ATL. Patients must have recovered to less than grade 1 CTCAEv4 from toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy and must not have had major surgery, chemotherapy, radiation or biologic therapy within 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment. DLCO/VA and FEV 1.0 &gt; 50% of predicted on pulmonary function tests. Serum creatinine of less than or equal to1.5 x the upper limit of normal. AST and ALT &lt; 3 x the upper limit of normal. Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm^3 and platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3. ECOG less than or equal to 1. Patients must be able to understand and sign an Informed Consent Form. All patients must use adequate contraception during participation in this trial and for 3 months following completing therapy. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients who have received any systemic corticosteroid therapy within 4 weeks prior to the start of therapy, with the exception of physiological replacement doses of cortisone acetate or equivalent. Clinical evidence of (parenchymal or meningeal) CNS involvement or metastasis. In subjects suspected of having CNS disease, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and lumbar puncture should be done to confirm. Documented HIV, active bacterial infections, active or chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C. Positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e., HBsAb positive and HBcAb negative) or a fully resolved acute hepatitis B infection is not an exclusion criterion. Positive hepatitis C serology is an exclusion criterion. Concurrent anticancer therapy (including other investigational agents). History of severe asthma or presently on chronic inhaled corticosteroid medications (patients with a history of mild asthma not requiring therapy are eligible). Patients with smoldering and lymphomatous ATL. HIVpositive patients are excluded from the study. Alemtuzumab may produce a different pattern of toxicities in patients with HIV infection; in addition the depletion of Tcells produced by alemtuzumab may have adverse effects on HIVpositive individuals. Pregnant or nursing patients. Patients who have previously received alemtuzumab are ineligible. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, cognitive impairment, active substance abuse, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the view of the Investigator, would preclude safe treatment or the ability to give informed consent and limit compliance with study requirements.</criteria>
