	<brief_summary>A well-designed pharmacokinetics (PK) study may identify the physiologic basis for observed differences in levonorgestrel emergency contraception (LNG-EC) and ulipristal acetate emergency contraception (UPA-EC) failure rates in women with normal and obese BMI. The investigators propose a study to compare serum LNG and UPA levels after administration of a single-dose of LNG-EC or UPA-EC. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference in PK parameters between women with normal BMI and obese women.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible women will present to the division research office, at which time a history and physical exam will be completed. Each participant's BMI will be confirmed and she will be assigned to one of two BMI groups (18.5-24.9 versus 30-39.9). At the conclusion of the enrollment visit, the research coordinator will randomize each woman to receive a single-dose pill of either levonorgestrel 1.5mg (like Plan B One-Step® or its generic formulations) or ulipristal acetate 30mg (ellaOne®) on two separate occasions.</detailed_description>
