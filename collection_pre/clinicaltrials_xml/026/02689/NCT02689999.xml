	<brief_summary>It is planned to investigate the effect of dexrabeprazole on gastric acid primarily, and then gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms, intraesophageal acidity (reflux) and impedance kinetics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Dexrabeprazole on Intragastric and Intraesophageal Acidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participants will be on one week medication after two-weeks observation period. Intragastric and intraesophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (pH-MII) monitoring will be performed before and after medication. The pre- and post-treatment data will be compared. The safety tests will be performed during study in terms of possible side effects.</detailed_description>
