	<brief_summary>This study offers remote monitoring devices for weight and medication adherence, combined with behavioral economic approaches, to patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of enrollment processes and intervention roll-out to inform a randomized controlled trial, to estimate the readmission rate of participants, and to assess if and how managing clinicians respond to weight gain alerts entered into a participant's electronic medical record.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Automated Hovering for Congestive Heart Failure Patients: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of this study are: (1) To leverage access to the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) CHF clinic, PennChart (electronic medical record system) resources for identifying eligible patients, and the Way to Health (WTH) platform to launch a pilot study that will inform a randomized controlled trial; (2) to evaluate the feasibility of the enrollment processes and intervention roll-out to inform a randomized controlled trial; (3) to estimate the readmission rate of participants; and, (4) to assess if and how managing physicians respond to weight gain alerts entered into participant charts in PennChart. In this pilot study, no randomization will occur and all participants will receive the intervention.</detailed_description>
