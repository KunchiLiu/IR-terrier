The enrollment for participants in the study will start after the relevant ethical and regulatory approvals and will have an estimated duration of 18 months. One hundred and forty-four participants with T2DM according to the criteria of ADA who consent to participation in the study by signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be enrolled in the study. In order to be enrolled, the patients must meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The eligible participants will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive evogliptin (EVO) at the doses of 2.5 mg/day (N = 36), 5.0 mg/day (N = 36) or 10 mg/day (N = 36) or sitagliptin (SITA) at the dose of 100 mg/day (N = 36), as a single daily dose, for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
