	<criteria>Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be considered eligible to participate in the study: 1. Be scheduled to undergo abdominoplasty surgery that is amenable to treatment with a long acting local anesthetic as per the anesthesia protocol 2. Be American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical Class I or II 3. Subjects 18 years of age or older 4. Have clinical laboratory values that are within normal limits (WNL); subjects with AST/ALT &lt; 3 x ULN, and/or creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN are acceptable. 5. Have a body mass index â‰¤ 30 kg/m2 6. Female subjects are eligible only if all of the following apply: Not pregnant (female subject of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy tests at screening and negative urine pregnancy test before surgery) Not lactating Not planning to become pregnant during the study Be surgically sterile; or at least two years postmenopausal; or have a monogamous partner who is surgically sterile; or is practicing doublebarrier contraception; or practicing abstinence (must agree to use doublebarrier contraception in the event of sexual activity); or using an insertable, injectable, transdermal, or combination oral contraceptive approved by the FDA for greater than 2 months prior to screening visits and commits to the use of an acceptable form of birth control for the duration of the study 7. Male subjects must be surgically sterile (biologically or surgically) or commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study 8. Does NOT have, as determined by the investigator or the study's medical monitor, a history or clinical manifestations of significant renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or other condition that would preclude participation in the study 9. Must be able to understand study procedures and be willing to comply and give informed consent for the conduct of all study procedures, using an IRB approved consent Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in the study: 1. Have a contraindication or be allergic to any medication to be used during the trial period 2. Have another painful physical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may confound the assessments of postoperative pain 3. Have a history of migraine or frequent headaches, seizures, or are currently taking anticonvulsants 4. Currently taking analgesics for a chronically painful condition, or has taken long acting opioids within 3 days of surgery, or taken any opioids within 24 hours of surgery 5. Previous abdominal surgery, as determined by the investigator, that would preclude participation in the study 6. Subjects that require liposuction as part of the abdominoplasty procedure in Part A of the protocol 7. Subjects that are to have ancillary procedures performed during the abdominoplasty surgery that are unrelated to the abdominal area (breast reduction, breast augmentation, etc.) 8. Subjects unable to discontinue medications that have not been at a stable dose for at least 14 days prior to the scheduled abdominoplasty procedure and before dosing with investigational product 9. Subjects taking the following medications; anticonvulsants, sedatives (including benzodiazepines) corticosteroids (by any means of administration), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) within 24 hours of study drug dosing, morphine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), neuroleptics, or serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Gabapentin and pregabalin are not permitted 10. Have a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse 11. Have positive results on the alcohol breath test indicative of alcohol abuse or urine drug screen indicative of illicit drug use (unless results can be explained by a current prescription or acceptable overthecounter medication at screening as determined by the investigator). The urine drug screen prior to surgery must be negative 12. Have evidence of a clinically significant 12lead ECG abnormality according to the judgment of the investigator 13. Have received any investigational product within 30 days before start of study 14. Have previously received HTX011 in clinical trials 15. Experiences a clinically significant event during surgery prior to the administration of the investigational product (e.g., excessive bleeding, hemodynamic instability) that would render the subject medically unstable, complicate their postsurgical course, or significantly increase the risk of study drug administration as per the judgment of the investigator. This will result in the subject being reported as randomized, not treated. 16. Subjects with sleep apnea or are on home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 17. Subjects who are receiving oxygen therapy at the time of screening</criteria>
