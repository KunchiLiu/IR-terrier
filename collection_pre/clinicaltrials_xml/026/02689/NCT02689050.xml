	<brief_summary>EUS-FNA is the recommended diagnostic examination of choice when patients present with suspected lower mediastinal lymph nodes on imaging. EUS-FNA is minimal invasive and low in costs, and although it has a good record in detecting diseases (eg confirm a nodal metastasis or granulomas) it has limitations in excluding diseases (missing metastases/ or granulomas) resulting in a false negative rate of 15-20%. Substantial limitations that most likely can be attributed to areas within the node that are not sampled during EUS-FNA tissue acquisition. Improved needle based EBUS/ EUS guided nodal diagnostics might result in improved quality of the fine needle aspirations, reduce in surgical diagnostic procedures , reduced costs and result in a shorter timebefore-treatment interval.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Needle based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) is a modern imaging technique, compatible with the conventional diagnostic aspiration needle, that uses an excitation laser light to create 'real-time' microscopic images of tissues. Therefore this technique provides additional information regarding the nodal status and could therefore improve the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA. Specifically, we will describe the nCLE image characteristics of lymph nodes involved in lung cancer and sarcoidosis as well as in healthy lymph nodes. Improved characterization of mediastinal nodes might lead to improved diagnosis.</detailed_description>
