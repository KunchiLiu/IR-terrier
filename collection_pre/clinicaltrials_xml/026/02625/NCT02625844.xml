	<brief_summary>This study is to document the time spent by health care personnel on anemia-related tasks, including preparation, distribution and administration of monopegylated epoetin beta (Mircera) or other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients with end stage renal disease in hemodialysis centers in Croatia. The total average time will be determined for the same number of patients on monopegylated epoetin beta and patients on other ESAs. In addition, qualitative information will be obtained on changes in practice patterns that may have occurred with the introduction of monopegylated epoetin beta.</brief_summary>
