	<brief_title>Pilot RCT Comparing Effectiveness of Two Decision Aids for Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot RCT study is to examine the comparative effectiveness of two decision aids for hip and knee osteoarthritis. The vendors employ different design features (e.g. use of video for patient narratives, interactive values clarification exercise) and the study will examine the relative impact of the different features on decision quality. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of two decision aids before their upcoming clinic visit with a participating provider. Immediately before the visit, participants will complete a short questionnaire about the decision aid. This pilot study will assist with determining the potential difference between these two decision aids on improving knowledge and use of decision aids.</detailed_description>
