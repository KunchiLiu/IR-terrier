	<brief_summary>This is a multi-site, dispensing, 4-visit, 2-arm parallel group, randomized, double-masked clinical trial using a Vistakon investigational contact lens (test) and a marketed monthly replacement contact lens (control). Each subject will be assigned randomly to either the test or control lens to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of the investigational contact lens compared to the marketed contact lens over a period of six months of lens wear.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and receive a fully executed copy of the form. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical protocol. The subject must be at least 18 years of age. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range of 1.00 to 6.00 in each eye. The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤ 1.00 Diopters (D) in each eye. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye. The subject should own a wearable pair of spectacles and bring to initial visit. The subject must be an adapted frequent replacement daily wear spherical silicone hydrogel soft contact lens wearer in both eyes. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any type). The subject must have enrolled and completed all visits in clinical study CR5726. Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued). Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere with contact lens wear. This may include, but not be limited to, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, recurrent herpes simplex/zoster, Sjögren's syndrome, xerophthalmia, acne rosacea, StevensJohnson syndrome, and immunosuppressive diseases or any infectious diseases (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis). Use of any of the following medications within 1 week prior to enrollment: oral retinoid isotretinoin (e.g., Accutane), oral tetracyclines, topical scopolamine, oral phenothiazines (e.g. Haldol, Mellaril, Thorazine, Elavil, Pamelor, Compazine), oral and ophthalmic Betaadrenergic blockers (e.g., Propranolol, Timolol, and Practolol), systemic steroids, and any prescribed or OTC ocular medication. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laserassisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), etc.) Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lensrelated corneal inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear. Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to OptiFree® PureMoist® multipurpose care solution or EyeCept rewetting drop solution Any ocular infection, allergy or clinically significant ocular disease (e.g., corneal edema, uveitis, severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca, ocular hypertension), or ocular conditions (e.g. strabismus), which might interfere with the study. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. Daily disposables, extended wear, monovision or multifocal contact lens correction. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus. Employee or relative of employees of sponsor or investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician)</criteria>
