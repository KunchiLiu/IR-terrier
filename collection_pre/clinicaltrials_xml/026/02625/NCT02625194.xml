	<brief_summary>This study investigate the utility of continuous oxygen insufflation during fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided intubation. One group receives oxygen via suction channel of fiberoptic bronchoscope during intubation. The other group does not receive oxygen during fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided intubation. Then, the velocity of deoxygenation difference of PaO2(baseline</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Utility of Oxygen Insufflation During Flexible Fiberoptic Bronchoscope-guided Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided intubation is a gold standard for intubation of a patient with anticipating difficult airway. This technique takes several minutes without oxygen supply, which results in hypoxia when it prolonged. If continuous supply of oxygen during procedure improve the oxygenation, we can reduce the risk of hypoxemia and increase the safety margin during procedure.</detailed_description>
