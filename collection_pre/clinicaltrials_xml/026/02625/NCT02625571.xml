	<brief_summary>A significant minority of children (ages 5-12) display problematic sexual behavior and the persistence of this behavior is oftentimes as stable as other child behavior problems, such as aggression and defiance. Unfortunately, the only tested intervention protocols for these concerns utilize a group treatment modality that is not feasible in most community treatment settings. This project will define and pilot test an intervention for child sexual behavior problems that is applicable in most settings and can be easily disseminated as a first step toward validation in larger clinical trials.</brief_summary>
