	<detailed_description>Multidisciplinary cohort studies of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) followed from childhood to adulthood exist abroad but not in France. The objective of the ELENA French Cohort is to study the developmental trajectories of children and adolescents with ASD and their risk or protective associated factors. This is an open, prospective and multicenter cohort study, including children and adolescents under 16 years of age with ASD recruited from services specialized in the assessment of developmental disorders. The patients will be monitored every 18 months for at least 36 months and during a maximum of 10 years. Clinical, social, environmental, and genetic data, as well as data relating to the parental quality of life will be collected. The primary endpoint will be the adaptive level in three domains of the Vineland II (Communication, Socialization and Daily living skills). The secondary endpoints will be parental quality of life, comorbidities, interventions and severity of ASD. The inclusion of 900 patients over a 10-year period is expected. This cohort should contribute to a better knowledge of the child with ASD's development, taking into account his physical, social and familial environment, the type of interventions and some genetic components. It should also lay the foundations for a national network of professionals working in the field of autism research by offering them a common tool for promoting translational studies.</detailed_description>
