	<brief_title>Early Follicular Phase vs Lutheal Phase Ovarian Stimulation in Bologna Criteria IVF/ICSI Cycles (LUTEAL Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two arms is established, the study group that will start ovarian stimulation in the luteal phase and the control group that will start ovarian stimulation in the follicular phase. The randomization will be made in the 2-3 day of the menstrual cycle, according to a list of random allocation of treatments. After check that there is no contraindication to start the stimulation, the patients will be assigned to the treatment group. The patients in the control group (follicular phase group) will start stimulation with two vials of 150 IU recombinant FSH + 75 IU recombinant LH (Pergoveris® 150/75). The patients in the study group (luteal phase group) will perform daily urine LH test from day 7th of the cycle and will start the administration of 150 IU recombinant FSH + 75 IU recombinant LH (Pergoveris® 150/75) at two vials daily from the 4th day of the LH positive test. Antagonist cetrorelix acetate (Cetrotide® ) administration will start when the largest follicle shall be equal or greater than 14 mm. From this moment controls every 24-72 hours with foliculometría by ultrasound and blood hormone analysis with determination of estradiol and progesterone. For the final oocyte maturation 2 vials daily of 0.2 mg triptorelin acetate (Decapeptyl®) is administered. Oocyte collection will be made by transvaginal ultrasound-guided puncture according to IB protocol The dosages and protocols used will be the usual for patients with diagnostic of poor ovarian response.</detailed_description>
