	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) has a very poor prognosis and high mortality. To improve the early diagnosis of ARDS, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers of ARDS. The goal of this project is to find a series novel biomarkers by differential proteomic techniques that can improve the early diagnosis and develop a more efficient therapy to enhance ARDS patient survival rate. Clinical data and blood sample were recorded before treatment and after treatment. Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III) scores were calculated at enrolment. Studying blood specimens from different period ARDS patients by proteomic analysis. It can provide information on a complex composition of proteins that are differentially expressed, which could be used for discovering high sensitivity and specificity ARDS biomarker.</detailed_description>
