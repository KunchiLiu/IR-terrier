	<brief_summary>In this study, participants with high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) therapy and who are considered ineligible for or have refused to undergo radical cystectomy, will receive pembrolizumab therapy. The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with pembrolizumab will result in a clinically meaningful response.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed diagnosis of high risk nonmuscleinvasive (T1, high grade Ta and / or carcinoma in situ) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (mixed histology tumors allowed if transitional cell histology is predominant histology) Absence of resectable disease after at least 2 cystoscopy /transurethral resection (TURBT) procedures (residual CIS acceptable) BCGunresponsive high risk nonmuscleinvasive bladder cancer after treatment with adequate BCG therapy Ineligible for radical cystectomy or refusal of radical cystectomy Available tissue from a newly obtained core biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Adequate organ function Female participants of childbearing potential have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test and must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception Male participants must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception Exclusion criteria: Muscleinvasive, locally advanced nonresectable, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (i.e., T2, T3, T4, and / or stage IV) Concurrent extravesical (i.e., urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis) nonmuscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium Currently participating or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or received investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment Received intervening intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy from the time of most recent cystoscopy / TURBT to starting study treatment Received prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to starting study treatment or not recovered from adverse events due to a previously administered agent Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment excepting basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer. A history of prostate cancer that was treated with definitive intent (surgically or through radiation therapy) is acceptable Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years Evidence of interstitial lung disease or active noninfectious pneumonitis Active infection requiring systemic therapy Pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of the trial through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment Prior therapy with an antiprogrammed cell death 1 (PD1), antiPDligand 2 (L2) agent, or with an agent directed to another coinhibitory Tcell receptor Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Known active Hepatitis B or C infection Received a live virus vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study treatment</criteria>
