	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the tolerability and safety of SAR438544 after single ascending subcutaneous (SC) doses in healthy subjects and in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients. Secondary Objective: To assess the preliminary pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of SAR438544 after single ascending SC doses in healthy subjects and in T1DM patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Escalating Doses of SAR438544 in Comparison to Placebo and Glucagon in Healthy Subjects and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy subjects: The total duration of study per subject is up to 4.5 weeks with 2 to 21 days screening period, 1 day for treatment, and 7 days (+/- 1 day) follow-up after IMP administration. T1DM patients: The total duration of study per patient is up to 5.5 weeks with 3 to 28 days screening period, 1 day for treatment, and 7 days (+/- 1 day) follow-up after IMP administration. One or more interim analyses may be performed to support decisions for the next steps of the study.</detailed_description>

Certified as healthy by a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history and complete physical examination). Female subject must use a double contraception method, including a highly effective method of birth control, except if she has undergone sterilization defined as tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, and bilateral tubal ligation at least 3 months earlier or is postmenopausal. The accepted double contraception methods include the use of intrauterine device or hormonal contraception started at least 30 days prior to the screening start and continued for at least 3 months after IMP dosing in addition to one of the following contraceptive options: (1) condom plus spermicide; (2) diaphragm plus spermicide or cervical/vault cap plus spermicide. Menopause is defined as being amenorrheic for at least 2 years with plasma FSH level &gt;30 UI/L in women older than 40 years of age Having given written informed consent prior to undertaking any studyrelated procedure. Not under any administrative or legal supervision. Male subject, whose partners are of childbearing potential (including lactating women), must accept to use, during sexual intercourse, a double contraception method according to the following algorithm: (condom, diaphragm or cervical cap, plus spermicide) plus (intrauterine device or hormonal contraceptive) from the inclusion up to 3 months after the last dosing (except if sterilized). Male subject, whose partners are pregnant, must use, during sexual intercourse, a condom from the inclusion up to 3 months after the last dosing. Male subject has agreed not to donate sperm from the inclusion up to 3 months after the last dosing. T1DM patients: Male or female patients, between 18 and 60 years of age, inclusive, with T1DM for at least one year, as defined by the American Diabetes Association. Total (basal+short acting) daily insulin dose of &lt;1.2 U/kg/day. Body weight between 50.0 and 110 kg, inclusive, the BMI between 18.5 and 30.0 kg/m^2, inclusive. Fasting serum Cpeptide &lt;0.3 nmol/L. Glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤75 mmol/mol (≤9%). Stable insulin regimen for at least 2 months prior to study and selfmonitoring of blood glucose before screening visit. Certified as otherwise healthy for T1DM by assessment of medical history and physical examination (cardiovascular system, chest and lungs, thyroid, abdomen, nervous system, skin and mucosae, and musculoskeletal system), unless the Investigator considers any abnormality to be clinically irrelevant and not interfering with the conduct of the study. Female subject must use a double contraception method, including a highly effective method of birth control, except if she has undergone sterilization defined as tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, and bilateral tubal ligation at least 3 months earlier or is postmenopausal. The accepted double contraception methods include the use of intrauterine device or hormonal contraception started at least 30 days prior to the screening start and continued for at least 3 months after IMP dosing in addition to one of the following contraceptive options: (1) condom plus spermicide; (2) diaphragm plus spermicide or cervical/vault cap plus spermicide.
