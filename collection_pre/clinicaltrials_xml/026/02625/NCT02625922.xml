	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled, Phase II clinical study to evaluate the effect of serelaxin versus placebo (both in addition to SoC) on the release of hs-cTnI, in patients with CHF after an exercise testing session.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Male or female ≥ 18 years of age, with body weight ≤ 160 Kg Diagnosis of stable CHF: New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class II/III. Receiving guidelinerecommended treatment for CHF. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45%, obtained within the last 3 months prior to screening. NTproBNP &gt; 300 ng/L in sinus rhythm or &gt; 900 ng/L if not in sinus rhythm (determined locally). Ability to exercise for at least 10 to 12 minutes based on investigator's judgment. Systolic BP ≥ 125 mm Hg at randomization Renal function defined as an eGFR of ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m^2 at screening (sMDRD formula). Key Dyspnea primarily due to noncardiac causes. Increased risk of developing hypotension during vasodilator therapy according to investigators judgement. Any contraindication for exercise testing and spirometry. Stopping of the spiroergometry at screening according to the stopping rules, unless the patient has reached maximum exercise capacity defined as carbon dioxide production/oxygen consumption (VCO2/VO2) &gt; 1.05. Change in guidelinerecommended CHF treatment within 1 month prior to screening.</criteria>
