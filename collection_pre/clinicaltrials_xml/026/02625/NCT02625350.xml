	<brief_summary>Glycemic index is commonly used as a method to determine the effect of a food to blood glucose. Despite its carbohydrate and fat content, instant noodle is very popular in Asia, including Indonesia. Based on the serving method, there are instant noodle without and with soup. Studies have shown that water content of a meal may influence glycemic response of the meal and thus have an effect on the result of GI measurement. However none specifically studied instant noodles nor the additional water content as soup (not incorporated in the food matrix). Therefore, this study aims to determine whether the serving method of instant noodle (with and without soup) may influence the glycemic response and glycemic index value of the meal.</brief_summary>
