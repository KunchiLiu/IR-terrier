	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find and evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JNJ-64041809, a live attenuated double deleted (LADD) Listeria monocytogenes (bacteria in which two virulence genes, which encode molecules that help cause disease, have been removed) when administered intravenously to participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Immunogenicity of JNJ-64041809, a Live Attenuated Double-deleted Listeria Immunotherapy, in Participants With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicenter and 2-part study. The Part 1 of study will be Dose Escalation phase to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety and pharmacodynamic assessments and Part 2 will be Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate 2 expansion cohorts (Cohort 2A and 2B) after the RP2D for JNJ-64041809 is determined in Part 1. The study will consist of a Screening Period (from signing of informed consent until immediately before the first dose), an open-label Treatment Period (from the first dose of study drug until the End-of-Treatment Visit); and a Post treatment Follow-up Period (after the End-of Treatment Visit until study discontinuation). Participants will be primarily evaluated for RP2D. Participants safety will be evaluated throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with progressive metastatic disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, requires initiation of new treatment. The assessment of disease progression can be based on either PSA rise, new or progressive soft tissue disease (based on computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scans), or new or progressive bony disease based on radionuclide bone scan or 18Fsodium fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography [NaF PET/CT] scans). Participants being considered for Cohort 2B must, in addition, have primary or metastatic lesions amenable to tumor biopsies Must have received at least 2 prior approved therapies Ongoing androgen depletion therapy with a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone analog or inhibitor, or orchiectomy (surgical or medical castration) Serum testosterone levels less than (&lt;) 50 nanogram per deciliter (ng/dL) determined within 4 weeks prior to start of study drug For participants previously treated with first generation antiandrogens (ie, flutamide, nilutamide, or bicalutamide), discontinuation of flutamide or nilutamide therapy must occur greater than (&gt;) 4 weeks (&gt;6 weeks for bicalutamide) prior to start of study drug with no evidence of an antiandrogen withdrawal response (no decline in serum PSA) Untreated brain metastases. Participants must have completed treatment for brain metastasis, and be neurologically stable off steroids, for at least 28 days prior to first dose of study drug Untreated spinal cord compression History of listeriosis or vaccination with a listeriabased vaccine or prophylactic vaccine (example influenza, pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis [dTP/dTAP]) within 28 days of study treatment Known allergy to both penicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Participants who are allergic to only one of these antibiotics are allowed to enroll Concurrent treatment with anti Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha therapies, systemic corticosteroids (prednisone dose &gt;10 mg per day or equivalent) or other immune suppressive drugs within the 2 weeks prior to Screening. Steroids that are topical, inhaled, nasal (spray), or ophthalmic solution are permitted</criteria>
