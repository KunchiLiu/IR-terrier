	<brief_summary>Target of the study is to evaluate the reduction accuracy of 3D computer-planned osteotomies that are performed with patient-specific instruments. Due to the higher accuracy achieved it is expected that complaints can be resolved or effectively revealed. The Research hypothesis to prove is "The medical product permits the surgical reduction of deformed bones of the hand and forearm (radius, ulna, distal humerus, carpal, metacarpal, and finger bones) by corrective osteotomy within an accuracy of 2 mm and 2ยบ. Secondary outcome is an assessment of the surgical outcome using the "Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand" (DASH) and the "Patient related wrist Evaluation" (PRWE) scores.</brief_summary>
