	<brief_summary>During laparoscopy pneumoperitoneum creates the necessary space in which to perform the operation. Growing evidence in general surgery has shown that reduction of intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopy is related to improved postoperative outcomes, decreased pain perception, length of hospital stay, and analgesic rescue dosage in patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures using low pneumoperitoneum pressure (LPP) compared with standard pneumoperitoneum pressure (SPP). Aim of the study is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of LPP during performance of Single Port Access Laparoscopy for benign adnexal pathologies.</brief_summary>
