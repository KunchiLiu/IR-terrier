	<brief_summary>This multicenter, prospectively designed study examines whether the Prosigna score influences physician and patient adjuvant treatment selection over and above currently used prognostic factors. This study also examines the impact of the test results on patients' reported outcomes, including their decisional conflict status and anxiety levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Observational Study Evaluating Treatment Decision Impact of ProsignaÂ® in Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the extent to which the Prosigna test results affect the medical oncologist's treatment recommendations regarding adjuvant chemotherapy and actual treatments received for patients with early stage breast cancer conventionally considered candidates for genomic testing based on current treatment guidelines. The oncologist's initial recommendations will be based on the utilization of tools or algorithms based on clinical and pathologic factors. No genomic tools will be used in the initial assessment. Changes in recommendation after availability of Prosigna test results will include (1) hormonal therapy alone or (2) hormonal therapy plus chemotherapy, and (3) changes in types of chemotherapy if chemotherapy was recommended before and after the test.</detailed_description>
