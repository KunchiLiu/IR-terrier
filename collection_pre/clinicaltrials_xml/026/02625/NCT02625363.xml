	<brief_summary>Glycemic index concept is widely used to determine impact of a food to blood glucose. Several studies showed that water content and intake after meal may influence glycemic response of the meal and thus have an effect on the result of GI measurement. Currently these studies found conflicting results. Therefore, this study aims to determine whether water intake, specifically after meal, may influence the glycemic response and glycemic index value of the meal.</brief_summary>
