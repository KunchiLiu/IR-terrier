	<brief_title>Efficacy of Urinary Vs Recombinant FSH in Oocyte Donors Based on Receptor N680S FSH Gene Polymorphism (Genodon Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to determine whether the number of oocytes obtained in women oocyte donors may be different with the use of rFSH or uFSH based on receptor N680S FSHR gene polymorphism. This is an exploratory, prospective, randomized, comparative, open trial with control group treated according to the usual therapeutic approach in our institution for ovarian stimulation for oocyte donors prospective exploratory study control group . Three groups will be set based on follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) genotype for the polymorphism N680: Group SS (Ser/Ser), group SN (Ser/Asn) and group NN (Asn/Asn). Donor members of each group will be randomly assigned to receive daily 225 IU of recombinant or urinary FSH for controlled ovarian stimulation protocol with antagonists. To avoid unintentional bias, allocation to treatment group will take place at the time in which ovarian stimulation according begins with a list of random allocation of treatments for each of the groups (SS , SN and NN) that will be associated the code of the patient and are prepared and will be available before the start of the study. The code assignment and treatment of the patient will consecutively in the order of the list and must be recorded in the medical history of the patient. The next scheduled patient will be assigned to the code and the next immediate treatment in this list. The protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation in oocyte donors, will be performed always according to the usual protocol in the Instituto Bernabeu.</detailed_description>
