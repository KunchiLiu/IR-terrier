	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to administer acetaminophen (Tylenol) for the treatment of fever in laboring patients by either an oral or intravenous (IV) route. The investigators want to see if the maternal fever will decrease faster with the IV or the oral dose. The investigators also want to look at other outcomes such as the cesarean section rate, the rate of neonatal intensive care unit admissions in both groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduction of Intrapartum Fever With Intravenous Acetaminophen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, controlled, study of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (OFIRMEV) versus orally administrated acetaminophen for the reduction of intrapartum maternal fever and fetal tachycardia. Compared to oral acetaminophen, intravenous acetaminophen has increased bioavailability and more rapid onset of action. IV acetaminophen has been used successfully in the management of fever in post-operative patients. Additionally, intravenous acetaminophen has also been used in the intrapartum setting for management of pain.However, the use of intravenous acetaminophen for the treatment of maternal temperature and subsequent fetal tachycardia, has not yet been evaluated. The study will have two arms that will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. A double dummy, double blind, comparator controlled study design will be utilized. After inclusion criteria have been satisfied, subjects in the control arm will receive an oral dose 1000 mg acetaminophen and an intravenous placebo resembling Ofirmev. The subjects in the experimental arm will receive 1000 mg of IV Ofirmev and an oral placebo resembling acetaminophen. Both groups will receive standard obstetrical care, continuous fetal monitoring, and antibiotics if there is suspected chorioamnionitis. The blinding technique will eliminate provider bias.</detailed_description>
