	<brief_summary>Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are one of the leading causes of coronary artery disease mortality, and among the top reasons for health care utilization in Canada. Physical activity counselling is a core component of secondary prevention interventions because increased physical activity is associated with reduced mortality risk, improved quality of life, reduced coronary risk factors, and reduced health care utilization. Despite these health benefits, between 40% and 60% of patients after an ACS event are insufficiently active. Web-based interventions offer innovative alternatives for intervention delivery via the Internet in secondary prevention. However, there is a paucity of randomized controlled trials testing, in ACS patients, computer-tailored interventions that include videos within the tailored algorithm. The purpose of this multicenter randomized controlled trial is to test a web-based intervention, TAVIEenM@RCHE, that uses tailored-videos of a nurse, the 'virtual nurse', aimed at increasing physical activity through walking in ACS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Web-Based Tailored Nursing Intervention to Increase Walking in Patients After an Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After baseline data is collected, the participants (N = 148) will be randomized to either one of two groups: 1) access to the 4-week TAVIEenM@RCHE intervention with an additional "booster" at 8 weeks (experimental group) or 2) access to a list of publicly available websites (control group). Participants will be included if they report insufficient levels of physical activity prior hospitalization, and they have no serious medical conditions impeding adherence to moderate-intensity physical activity. Data collection will occur at recruitment (in-hospital), at baseline (home 3 weeks post-hospital discharge), and at 5 and 12 weeks post baseline. The data analysis will be consistent with intention-to-treat principles. Baseline characteristics will be compared using descriptive statistics to identify trends in group imbalances. For the analysis of the primary outcome of change in steps per day between baseline and 12 weeks, and the secondary outcome of change in steps per day between baseline and 5 weeks, a repeated measures ANCOVA model will compare the adjusted differences between the experimental and control groups at a significance of 0.05. For the analysis of the two secondary outcomes of change in energy expenditure in walking and in moderate-intensity physical activity between baseline and 5 weeks, and between baseline and 12 weeks, a repeated measures MANCOVA model will compare the adjusted differences between the experimental and control groups at a significance of 0.05.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Discharged 3 weeks home post ACSrelated hospitalization from a coronary care unit (CCU). 2. No serious medical condition exists that would impede adhering to moderateintensity physical activity. Medical conditions include, for instance, incapacitating chronic pain, paralysis, equilibrium problems, diabetic ulcers, fluid restrictions, dyspnea, home oxygen dependency, cancer and others. Also, no environmental restrictions that would impede walking. 3. Receives usual care followup post ACSrelated hospitalization. 4. Reported access to any computer device that has a USB port and this computer is connected to the Internet to allow upload of data from the accelerometer, and has speaker or headphones to enable listening to the intervention on the computer device of choice. 5. Reported ability to read and speak French. 1. Reported sufficient physical activity during 6 months prior to hospitalization: performed at least 150 minutes of moderateintensity physical activity per week (30 minutes five days a week) or at least 75 minutes per week of vigorousintensity physical activity (25 minutes three days a week). 2. Indicated in the medical chart or reported by staff, physical or psychological/cognitive that would make it impossible for the patient to provide informed consent. 3. Documented New York Heart Association Class III to IV heart failure. 4. Involved in other intensive regular clinical followup during TAVIEenM@RCHE.</criteria>
