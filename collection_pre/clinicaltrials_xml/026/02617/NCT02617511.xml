	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (combined eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid [EPA/DHA] supplement) augments the effects of a 12-week resistance training program in older men. Outcome variables include inflammatory biomarkers in the systemic circulation, body composition and performance measures. The specific inflammatory markers in the blood include: C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6. Remaining parameters include: body composition (as assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), muscle strength (as assessed by chest press and leg press one-repetition maximum strength tests), and functional ability (as assessed by timed up and go test as well as the 6-minute walking test).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary: Sarcopenia is a prevalent health concern for many older individuals and finding strategies to ameliorate and reduce the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength is deemed important for maintaining functional ability and independence as individual's age. Currently, resistance training is considered the standard of care for inducing an anabolic stimulus and preserving as well as enhancing muscle mass and strength in aged individuals. One mechanism whereby older adults seem to lose muscle mass with age is via chronic low grade inflammation. Finding complementary strategies to reduce inflammation, while at the same time building skeletal muscle mass and strength, is considered essential for combating the increased prevalence of sarcopenia observed as the population ages. Using nutritional supplementation strategies, such as omega-3 fatty acids, seems to provide an effect in not only reducing inflammation but also acting as an anabolic stimulus for skeletal muscle growth. It is not known whether or not providing omega-3 fatty acids (in the form of EPA/DHA supplementation) along with resistance training will result in a greater increase in skeletal muscle mass and strength than resistance training alone in an older population. Hypotheses: The primary hypothesis of this research project is that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and resistance training for 12 weeks will decrease markers of inflammation more so than resistance training and placebo in a cohort of older adults. A secondary hypothesis of the project is that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and resistance training for 12 weeks will provide for a greater increase in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and functional ability than resistance training and placebo in a cohort of older adults.</detailed_description>
