	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to demonstrate the high level of biosimilarity between MabionCD20 (MABION SA) and the reference product: MabThera (rituximab by Hoffman-La Roche) in patients with CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MabionCD20® Compared to MabThera® in Lymphoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who meet criteria for participation in this study receive 8 intravenous infusions of MabionCD20® or MabThera® 21 days interval in combination with standard dosage regimen of CHOP. The duration of the study is 12 months. The treatment and observation period will last 26 weeks starting from Day 1, until Week 26 - one month after last IMP infusion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histological confirmed CD20 (cluster of differentiation 20) positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 2. Patients that had been diagnosed according to the WHO classification; 3. Performance status ≤ 2 on the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) / WHO (world Health Organization) scale, performance status of 3 will be accepted if impairment is caused by DLBCL complications and improvement is expected once therapy is initiated; 1. Life expectance less than 6 months; 2. Any chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, investigational or hormonal therapy for treatment of lymphoma within 28 days prior to treatment; 3. Rituximab, other antiCD20 mAb (Monoclonal Antibodies) drug treatment, treatment with any cell depleting therapies e.g., antiCD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) antiCD5 (cluster of differentiation 5), antiCD3 (cluster of differentiation 3), antiCD19 (cluster of differentiation 19), anti CD11 (cluster of differentiation 11), antiCD22 (cluster of differentiation 11), BLys/BAFF (B Lymphocyte Stimulator/Bcell activating factor) within 1,5 years before screening;</criteria>
