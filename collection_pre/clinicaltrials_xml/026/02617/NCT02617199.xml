	<brief_summary>Acute pancreatitis is a common urgency with a mortality rate of up to 30% , decreased blood flow in the pancreatic microcirculation. It seems to be the main cause of the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis. Today, there have been many attempts in the management of pancreatitis but no established management seems to be ideal. The epidural block is an anesthetic technique used to provide highly peri and post-operative analgesia, also plays an important role in improving the gastrointestinal vascular perfusion (due to sympathetic blockade that this technique produces) so this anesthetic technique is proposed as an alternative to both clinical treatment as an analgesic for acute pancreatitis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective of the study is to evaluate the therapeutic effects of epidural block in patients with acute pancreatitis, comparing day hospital stay among patients receiving intravenous analgesic treatment and patients who are undergoing epidural block. It is a (prospective, comparative, longitudinal, experimental, randomized) controlled clinical trial. They include patients who are diagnosed with acute pancreatitis at the Naval General Hospital of High Specialty. Two groups were taken by random assignment.</detailed_description>
