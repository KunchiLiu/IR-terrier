	<brief_summary>The United Nation's International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) is supporting Saba Shikha Abihyan (SSA) (Education-for-All Mission) of the Government of Assam (GoA) under their Water-Sanitation-Hygiene in School (WinS) program to improve WASH facilities, practices and institutionalize WASH in school settings. Under the WinS program, UNICEF piloted a group hand washing program in 100 elementary schools. Multiple past studies have shown that handwashing is an effective intervention to reduce diarrheal diseases and respiratory tract infections, but the evidence on the interventions or programs that can achieve this behavior change is mixed and limited in case of school setting. The main objective of Daily Handwashing for an Ailment-free Life (DHaAL) program was to institutionalize handwashing with soap before consuming mid-day meals and after using toilets among elementary school students. DHaAL is implemented on the Mid-day Meal platform where free meals are given to all students attending government schools. In addition to the standard DHaAL intervention, several pilot phase schools also received an additional program for a holistic and participatory development of school systems for health, nutrition, learning outcomes and wellbeing of children called Child Friendly School System (CFSS). Although CFSS is not a WASH intervention it can develop systems and processes and offer longer support from and implementing agencies which help DHaAL Intervention also. This evaluation study seeks to answer whether DHaAL improved handwashing practice before the mid-day meals in rural lower primary schools as a primary research question. The intermediate outputs and secondary outcomes evaluated in this study include functionality of handwashing infrastructure at school, handwashing practice after toilet use, and availability of and use of handwashing facilities at homes (indirect effect). The evaluation study has other supplemental operations research objectives to help improve the program in future.</brief_summary>
