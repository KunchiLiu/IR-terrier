	<brief_summary>Recent studies show that many Type 1 diabetes patients have remaining endogenous insulin production, albeit at low levels. Finding means to increase this production would be of tremendous interest, since residual C-peptide concentrations &gt;0.1 nmol/l previously have been shown to markedly lower HbA1c, decrease blood glucose fluctuations and diminish the risk of ketoacidosis. It also substantially reduces the risks of severe hypoglycemic events and late complications. Liraglutide may through its incretin effect directly potentiate beta-cell function, but also holds the potential to be mitogenic for these cells. The hypothesis of the present trial is that treatment with liraglutide will not only have a direct effect on beta-cell function, which is more or less immediately observed, but also progressively improve C-peptide concentrations over time.</brief_summary>
