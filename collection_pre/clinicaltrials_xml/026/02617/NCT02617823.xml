	<brief_title>Influence of Maternal Postioning on Spread of Local Anesthetic After Epidural Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnant women requesting epidural analgesia will be randomized to either left lateral or semi-recumbent position for 30 minutes after the first epidural bolus-injection. After 30 minutes, the clinical effect of the analgesia will be evaluated by an anesthesiologist if available or by a midwife if the anesthesiologist is unavailable. The study-period is concluded thereafter and further positioning is optional. Maternal and fetal wellbeing are continuously being monitored during the study period and complications/interventions registered. APGAR and CTG results during the intervention will be registered and evaluated at a later stage.</detailed_description>
