	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients with glioblastoma that is MGMT-unmethylated (the MGMT gene is not altered by a chemical change). Patients will receive Nivolumab every two weeks in addition to radiation therapy, and then every four weeks. They will be compared to patients receiving standard therapy with temozolomide in addition to radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
