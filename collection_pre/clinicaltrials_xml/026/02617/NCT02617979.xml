	<brief_summary>The study of readmission is in its infancy in the surgical world, and there are no prospective studies, to the investigators' knowledge, evaluating the efficacy of interventions on preventing readmission following pancreatectomy. Undoubtedly, patients and their caregivers will play a key role in any useful intervention to reduce readmission. Therefore, the investigators' approach is to target perioperative education and engagement of patients and their caregivers in the postoperative recovery of pancreatectomy patients.</brief_summary>
