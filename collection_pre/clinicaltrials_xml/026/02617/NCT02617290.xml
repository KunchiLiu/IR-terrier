	<brief_summary>The new P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel (Efient®-Effient®) and ticagrelor (Brilique®-Brilinta®) have shown promising results in the respective TRITON and PLATO trials making of prasugrel and ticagrelor recommended first line treatments for acute coronary syndrome ACS (ESC Guidelines: Class 1 LOE B). These two drugs showed superiority over clopidogrel in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), by the dramatic diminution of stent thrombosis, the reduction in death or Myocardial Infarction (MI) as well as the reduction in death in a meta-analysis. The field of elective PCI (stable patients) has not been studied with these 2 new drugs and clopidogrel remains the standard of care. However, off-label use of prasugrel and ticagrelor is increasing in patients undergoing high risk elective PCI (left main, diabetics, multiple stenting, high risk of stent thrombosis, no clopidogrel pretreatment…) but is not supported by scientific evidence. More than half of PCI patients undergo elective stenting for proven ischemia and/or stable angina, a relatively safe procedure with the use of the latest generation of stents. However complications remain either frequent when considering PCI-related myonecrosis/myocardial injury that have been linked to the prognosis of patients or rare but serious when considering stent thrombosis, Q wave MI or stroke, leaving room for improvement with these two newest drugs. The investigators propose to perform a multicenter international study in stable patients undergoing elective PCI with a randomization between clopidogrel and ticagrelor. The investigators hypothesize that this study will show superiority of the new P2Y12 inhibitor over clopidogrel in elective PCI on the primary ischemic endpoint (peri-procedural MI and myocardial injury) without significant excess bleeding (BARC definition).</brief_summary>
