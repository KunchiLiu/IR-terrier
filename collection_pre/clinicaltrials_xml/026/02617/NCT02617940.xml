	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral hygiene orientation singly, compared to resin-based sealants in controlling occlusal cavitated enamel lesions on primary and permanent molars. For this, 273 occlusal surfaces of primary molars and 273 occlusal surfaces of first permanent molars on 4-9 years-old children with an enamel cavitated lesion will be selected in 9 cities of Brazil. The surfaces will be randomly divides into 2 groups: oral hygiene orientation and resin-based sealant. The surfaces will be evaluated after 6 and 12 months regarding clinical and radiographic lesions progression. The costs and cost-efficacy of these treatments, children's discomfort, parents'/guardians' satisfaction and impact on quality of life will also be investigated. Poisson regression analysis will be performed in order to compare the groups, through clinical and radiographic criteria. This test will also be used to assess the association between the group and patient discomfort and parents' satisfaction. Time, costs and impact on quality of life of the treatments will be compared by Student's t test. For all analyses, the significance level will be set at 5%.</brief_summary>
