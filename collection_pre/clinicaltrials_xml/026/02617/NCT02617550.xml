	<brief_summary>This study is intended to investigate the effect of nitroglycerin on vericiguat in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Nitroglycerin is the standard therapy to treat acute crisis of angina. Thus there is a high likelihood of co-administration of both drugs in the target indication of vericiguat, worsening heart failure (HF). Therefore, it is important to investigate the safety and tolerability of vericiguat and nitroglycerin, which may be used as unprescribed on-demand treatment by patients with acute episodes of angina pectoris.</brief_summary>
