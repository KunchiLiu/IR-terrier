	<brief_title>Dedicated Sheath Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, prospective, single arm clinical study. Up to 15 patients undergoing valvular intervention will be enrolled. Follow up will take place at 1, 6 and 24 hours post procedure. No follow up visits are required. During the study, the patient will undergo the following tests: - Physical examination (includes blood pressure, age, height, weight). - Echo assessments prior to procedure. - Hemodynamic study prior and post BAV. - Full blood count - Angiography</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age â‰¥ 18 years. Patient understands the implications of participating in the study and provides written informed consent. The patient has an indication for balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). Peripheral vessel anatomy or peripheral vascular disease that would preclude the insertion of the 12 Fr. sheath. Any illness or condition which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the interpretation of the study results.</criteria>
