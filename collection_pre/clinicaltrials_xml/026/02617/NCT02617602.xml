	<brief_summary>Goal directed therapy (GDT) utilises various monitoring techniques to assess cardiovascular performance and allows for timely interventions based on predetermined algorithms. The aim of this prospective randomised study is to evaluate the effect of GDT on major complications in children undergoing radical correction of congenital heart defects, complicated by acute heart failure. Goal directed therapy will be implemented with the aid of transpulmonary thermodilution and based on predetermined algorithms.</brief_summary>
