	<brief_title>Spot tm Tattooing of Biopsied Axillary Lymph Nodes With Ultrasound Guided in Breast Cancer Patients Prior to Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part of the diagnostic tests for breast cancer sometimes necessary to perform a FNA or Core biopsy to a suspicious axillary lymph node. Presently there is no possibility to identify the examined gland at the surgery. If the gland was infected it's most important to remove it. The only technique that exists today is marking with a metal clip and the use of this technique is not profit, partly because of technical difficulties. In this trial the investigator will use a special ink which will be injected to the axillary lymph node during the biopsy and latter on the surgery the investigator will try to assess the ability to identify the marked gland.</detailed_description>
