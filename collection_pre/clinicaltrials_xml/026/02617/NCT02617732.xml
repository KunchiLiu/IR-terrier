	<brief_title>Effects of Tianqi Capsule on Glucose Variability in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes has become a threat to human health and an independent risk factor to macrovascular and microvascular diseases. Large prospective clinical studies have shown a strong relationship between time-averaged mean levels of glycemia as measured by HbA1c and diabetes complications. However, in recent years several pieces of evidence indicated that glucose variability may also contribute to the development of diabetes complications. Thus, glucose variability may become a new target in treatment of diabetes. Traditional Chinese medicine，a kind of multitargeted compound, may contribute to maintaining blood glucose homeostasis in diabetes. Tianqi capsule(Chinese herbs extract) is a Chinese patent medicine approved to treat T2DM in China. Previous clinical studies have shown that Tianqi capsule could lower blood glucose measured by HbA1c. What's more, Tianqi capsule has also been proved to improve the glycometabolism and lipid metabolism in T2DM and IGT. This research adopts a randomized, open, parallel double blind, placebo controlled clinical method. The patients, meeting eligibility criteria, are divided into experimental group and placebo group and treated for 12 weeks . A main outcome，glucose variability is detected by continuous blood glucose monitoring system which could obtain continuous and comprehensive blood glucose by "glucose sensor". The influence of Tianqi capsule on glucose variability in type 2 diabetes will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
