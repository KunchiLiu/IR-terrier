	<brief_title>Objective Diagnosis Method and Efficacy of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as a Treatment for Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tinnitus is defined as the subjective perception of a sound in the absence of any physical sound. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of tinnitus is so difficult. So, Investigators measure auditory ERP through autonomously developed system to make a objective diagnosis tinnitus. Moreover, patients undergo continuous resting EEG measurement. In this study investigators examined the efficacy of rTMS treatment for tinnitus and check into changes in brain connectivity or auditory task with ERP, continuous resting EEG before and after rTMS. And develop a new test that can detect tinnitus objectively in humans, using the prepulse gap paradigm</detailed_description>
