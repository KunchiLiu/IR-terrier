	<brief_summary>Pump therapy is gaining popularity as a treatment mode for patients with type 1 diabetes. Utilizing pump therapy requires the development and application of a new spectrum of theoretical knowledge and practical skills by the patient. Furthermore, occasionally there is a need to tailor the pump settings, i.e. the insulin correction factor, carbohydrate ratio, basal plan and insulin activity time, in order to optimize and improve glucose control. These adjustments are based on collected information including insulin delivery, blood glucose measurements, continuous glucose monitoring data, meals and so on. Analyzing this multitude of information and data is overwhelming for many of the patients, caregivers and health care providers. Unfortunately, not all physicians have the needed expertise to fully fulfill this task, and for those who do, it is time consuming. Thus, a summary of the data with insulin dose adjustment suggestions is missing. An automated tool for pump setting adjustments will improve glycemic control without escalating the burden on patients and the health care system. Such advisor can assist the professional team during routine follow-up and the patients between visits. To address this challenge, the investigators developed the MD-Logic Pump Advisor (MDPA), which automatically analyses treatment information, learns patient's needs and accordingly suggests adjustments in insulin dosing. The MDPA uses information gathered from glucose monitoring, insulin dosing and meal data during daily routine home care. Following a 5 minute data collection and analysis, the algorithm learns and suggests pump-setting changes for optimization of glucose control. The objective of the research project, called MD-Logic Advise4U, is to test the MD-Logic pump advisor in a clinical study. The study will generate data necessary to address the safety, reliability, and efficacy of this algorithm</brief_summary>
