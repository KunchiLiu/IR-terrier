	<brief_summary>Falls are an important risk factor for fragility fractures. Both are associated with the ageing process and as they rise also increase the risk of mortality, disability and dependency. Interventions to prevent falls have been based on multifactorial approaches but the outcomes have shown little effectiveness. Lately, it is being recommended interventions which foster physical exercise incorporating it to daily life activities. The OTAGO exercise programme is based on easy physical exercises for older adults and has shown cost-effective outcomes for falls prevention and its consequences.</brief_summary>
