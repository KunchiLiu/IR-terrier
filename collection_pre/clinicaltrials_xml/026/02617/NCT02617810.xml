	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate effect of multiple-dose administration of JNJ-42847922 on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam and single-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of (R)- and (S)-warfarin after oral administration of racemic warfarin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effect of Multiple-Dose Administration of JNJ-42847922 on Midazolam and Warfarin in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, fixed-sequence, study of JNJ-42847922 in healthy participants. The study consists of 3 Phases: Screening Phase (28 Days), open-label treatment Phase (40 Days) and follow up visit (7 to 14 Days after last study procedure). The duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 82 Days. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

In addition, participants must have coagulation test results [(prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)] within clinically acceptable limits at Screening as deemed appropriate by the Investigator Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs, or 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening or Day 1 of the first treatment period as deemed appropriate by the Investigator Participants who are homozygous or heterozygous for CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 alleles Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication (including vitamins and herbal supplements), except for acetaminophen, within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug is scheduled until completion of the study. In addition, participants will be excluded if they have used medications known to affect coagulation or modulate CYP2C9 or VKORC1 within 28 days of study admission</criteria>
