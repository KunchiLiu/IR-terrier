	<brief_title>Increasing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trials are essential to scientific discovery and are critical to translating research in to practice. Despite their significance, clinical trial participation rates remain low, especially among underrepresented minority groups. Several barriers exist to minority group participation in clinical trial, one of which lack of awareness about clinical trials. Video educational programs show promise as an effective strategy to increase knowledge and clinical trial participation. The specific aims are as follows: 1. Measure the effects of an office-based, clinical trial education video on clinical trial knowledge and enrollment in clinical trials, in a clinical sample with no previous history of clinical trial participation. 2. Determine the feasibility of implementing an office-based video educational program.</detailed_description>
