	<brief_title>Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy Study of RGN-259 Ophthalmic Solutions for Neurotrophic Keratopathy : SEER-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurotrophic keratopathy (NK) is a degenerative corneal disease that occurs as a result of partial or total impairment of trigeminal innervation. The resulting loss of corneal sensitivity (anesthesia) leads to a reduction in lacrimation and a decline in status, metabolism, and mitosis of corneal epithelial cells. Previous studies (physician-sponsored studies) used to treat to nine patients with NK, six of whom had discrete geographic, non-healing lesions, and three of whom had punctate lesions and the study result reported.</detailed_description>
