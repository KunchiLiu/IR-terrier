	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of induction treatment with obinutuzumab, polatuzumab vedotin, and lenalidomide in participants with relapsed or refractory FL or DLBCL. Participants with FL who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at the end of induction therapy will receive post-induction treatment with obinutuzumab and lenalidomide, and participants with DLBCL who achieve CR or PR at the end of induction will also be eligible for post-induction treatment.</brief_summary>
