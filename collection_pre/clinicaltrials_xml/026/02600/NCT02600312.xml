	<brief_summary>The Oxiris® filter is a registered product for CRRT already safely used in routine care. In in vitro experiments, the Oxiris® filter has been demonstrated to adsorb endotoxin and cytokines. Compared to conventional filters this may be advantageous in patients with severe sepsis but neither decreased levels of endotoxin and cytokines nor an improved outcome has been demonstrated with clinical use. But there are so far little clinical data on the oXiris® filter on humans. The oXiris® filter will be investigated in a double blind randomized crossover setting against a traditional filter (ST150). Either filter will be used for 24 hours after which it will be changed to the opposite filter for another 24 hours. Arterial blood samples will be drawn at start and then 1, 3, 8, 16 and 24 hours after the start of each filter, and analyzed for endotoxin (EAA assay), TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 (ELISA) levels. Standard blood tests will be analyzed simultaneously. Data concerning mode and settings of CRRT, heart rate, blood pressure, medication, data concerning ventilatory support and pathogen will be registered. Primary endpoint: Levels of endotoxin and cytokines will be compared using Student's paired t-test on AUC values for each 24-hour period.</brief_summary>
