	<brief_summary>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease. Respiratory therapy is always recommended to the CF patient with pulmonary involvement and has differents techniques and devices, however, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the techniques used, there is a need to determine the applicability of the therapeutic resources used. Therefore, the aim of the study is to determine the short-term effectiveness of ELTGOL on Average Electrical Impedance on the End of Expiration (MIEFE) pulmonary, assessed by Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) in individuals with CF through a clinical trial randomized crossover. Volunteers will be included with FC with moderate to severe lung disease with chest ≥ 74 cm that do not show: episode of pulmonary infectious exacerbations in the last four weeks or during the study period; cor pulmonale; facial deformity that causes air leakage; facial trauma and recent face or esophagus surgery; chest pain; hemoptysis in the last week; continued use of supplemental oxygen (&gt; 8 hours / day); hemoptysis; hemodynamic instability and do not understand the use and command of the techniques used. The sample is selected by convenience from the database of individuals assisted data in Integrative Medicine Institute Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP). The research will be developed in three phases, divided into three days with an interval of at least 48 hours between phases. The first day will undergo initial assessment and in the days following the intervention by day, ELTGOL or Acapella, in a randomized order.</brief_summary>
