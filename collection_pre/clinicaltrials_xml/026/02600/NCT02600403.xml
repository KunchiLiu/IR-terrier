	<brief_title>Are There Changes in the Nerve Fiber Layer (NFL) After Lowering of Eye Pressure?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma exhibits characteristic changes to the optic nerve in the back of the eye. The optic nerve is formed when fibers that overlay the retina come together. This layer is called the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a machine that scans the eyes and has the capability of measuring the thickness of the various layers of the retina and NFL. This gives doctors very important anatomical information. Heidelberg Engineering has introduced Spectralis OCT and Carl Zeiss Meditec has introduced Cirrus OCT. VEP (visual evoked potential) is an imaging system that measures the electrical signal from the eye to the brain by using electrodes placed on the forehead and back of the head. This is similar in principal to an electrocardiogram of the heart. Visual field testing is done to evaluate the extent of side vision loss a patient has with various diseases of the eye, including glaucoma. (This is testing which is done while you stare at a small light directly in front of your eye while lights are flashing one at a time in every direction on a screen surrounding the central light. You will be asked to push a button each time you see a flash "out of the corner of your eye"). Lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye has been shown to result in reversal of glaucoma changes of the optic nerve in some patients. It has also been suggested that improvement in function (visual field) has been associated with this improved optic nerve appearance. This study provides evidence for structural disc cupping reversal following IOP lowering interventions. These changes were not related to the amount of pressure lowering. While there was evidence of functional improvement as measured by VF testing, VEP was unable to detect any reversible changes.</detailed_description>
