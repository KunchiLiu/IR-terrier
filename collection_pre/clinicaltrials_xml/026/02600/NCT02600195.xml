	<brief_title>Reduction of Infection in Neonatal Intensive Care Units Using the Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following randomization into two groups, the intervention NICUs (n = 12) will receive training in the EPIQ method and then develop, implement, and document evidence-based practice changes to reduce hospital-acquired infection. Compliance with practice changes and neonatal outcomes will be monitored. NICUs will receive quarterly feedback on their progress, as well as access to implementation support. Control NICUs (n = 12) will collect neonatal data and continue to provide standard care. Study subjects will be all preterm infants born at &lt;34 weeks' gestation and admitted to participating NICUs during the trial (estimated n = 5,200 per year). Data analysis will be conducted to compare neonatal outcomes and health-care resources used between the intervention and control groups.</detailed_description>
