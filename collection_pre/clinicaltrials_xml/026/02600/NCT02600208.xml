	<brief_summary>This is a single arm pilot study for patients with hematologic malignancies with alternative donor sources receiving unrelated or partially matched related/Haploidentical mobilized peripheral stem cells (PSCs) using the CliniMACS system for Alpha Beta T cell depletion plus CD19+ B cell depletion to determine efficacy as determined by engraftment and GVHD, and one year leukemia free survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation for Hematologic Malignancies With Alpha Beta TCell and B Cell Depletion Using the CliniMACS Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new method of T cell depletion using the Miltenyi CliniMACS™ device for patients undergoing a peripheral stem cell transplant utilizing either a unrelated donor or partially matched/haploidentical related donor. This new method is called α/β (alpha/beta) T cell depletion and CD19+ B cell depletion. This pilot study will evaluate if this new method of T cell and B cell depletion is a more effective way of removing T cells thus reducing the risk of severe acute and chronic GVHD and result in a durable engraftment.</detailed_description>
