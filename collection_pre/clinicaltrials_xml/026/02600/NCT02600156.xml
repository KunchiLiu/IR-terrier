	<brief_title>Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is being done to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-guided focal laser therapy with the Visualase Thermal Therapy System to treat low-risk prostate cancer tumors. Unlike surgery or radiotherapy which affects a large portion of the prostate or the entire organ, localized or focal therapy is intended to treat a small portion of tissue in which the cancer has been found by biopsy.</detailed_description>
