	<brief_summary>Heart failure (HF) is configured major problem for public health in the country. Affected individuals may experience fatigue, dyspnea, respiratory muscle weakness, overstimulation of the sympathetic myocardial activity, among others. In relation to the treatment of patients with heart failure with symptoms mentioned above a great alternative is the implantation of cardiac rehabilitation programs, these programs can also be associated with other muscle training measures, among these there is inspiratory muscle training (IMT), as the weakness of these muscles is rather found in this population and this directly related to signs and symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training associated with a cardiac rehabilitation program in the modulation of sympathetic myocardial activity and maximal and submaximal functional capacity of patients with HF between 21-60 years. METHODOLOGY: This is a clinical trial, controlled, randomized, double-blind being developed in partnership with the Department of Physical Therapy, Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) and the Hospital das Clinicas (HC) of Pernambuco, whose patients will be accrued on the Recife's main referral centers in caring for patients with heart failure. Patients will undergo the evaluation of pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength (spirometry and digital Manovacuometry) as well as on the functional capacity (Ergospirometry), cardiac innervation (myocardial scintigraphy), mobility and diaphragm thickness (ultrasound) and quality of life. After the evaluation will be randomly allocated into two groups: The control group will perform cardiac rehabilitation associated with the Sham of IMT, and the experimental group cardiac rehabilitation associated with the IMT at 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure. The intervention will last three months for both groups and after this phase patients will be submitted again to the assessment tools. EXPECTED RESULTS: To clarify the association between physical exercise associated with specific respiratory training in modulating the autonomic nervous system of patients with HF and what the relationship with reflected cardiorespiratory fitness in maximal and submaximal functional capacity.</brief_summary>
