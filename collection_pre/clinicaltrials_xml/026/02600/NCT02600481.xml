	<brief_title>Impacts of Different Pressure Pneumoperitoneum on Myocardial and Pulmonary Injuries After Robot-assisted Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of this study is based on several studies reported that increased postoperative troponin T(TnT) level was significantly associated with 30-day mortality, and some other reports showed that low-pressure pneumoperitoneum had better haemodynamic outcome than that of standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum. Hence, we hypothesize that different pneumoperitoneal pressure may lead to different levels of TnT after prolonged robot-assisted surgeries. This clinical trial will be conducted in Huadong Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University and Ruijin Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine,both are tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China. After signing the Informed Consent, subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to low- or standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum group.The randomization plans will be implemented using statistical software R, and will be stored in an online database.These subjects will be recruited from January 1st 2016 to December 31st 2017. TnT is set as the primary endpoint for this trial to evaluate the myocardial injuries, and will be measured for each patient who will undergo in-patient robot-assisted urological surgery within 24 hours postoperatively using the fourth-generation high-sensitivity TnT assay. The total sample size will be 280.With 140 patients in each of the two treatment groups, the power will be at least 0.70 to detect an increment of TnT level among 80% of subjects.Chest CT scan is used to diagnose the pulmonary complications on the third day postoperatively. Data will be collected to analysize whether prolonged different intraperitoneal pressure has different impacts on cardiopulmonary injuries.</detailed_description>
