	<brief_summary>As cancer mortality rates improve in Asia, there is an increasing focus on patient-reported outcomes and survivorship issues. In view of the numerous medication and psychosocial issues that are commonly faced by early-stage breast cancer survivors, it deems important to develop and conduct specific interventional programs to mitigate these problems. In the literature, it is well recognized that psychosocial interventions are effective to manage emotional distress and quality of life, with the evidence clearly clustered in studies on female patients with breast cancer. One meta-analysis suggested that psycho-oncologic interventions including individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, psychoeducation, relaxing training can produce positive effects on emotional distress, anxiety and depression, and health-related QOL. The investigators hypothesize that a significant reduction in anxiety, improvement of cognition and improvement of health-related quality of life among those who receive psycho-education, in comparison to those in the usual care. Hence, this randomized trial is designed to assess the effectiveness of a psycho-educational group (PEG) intervention on supportive care and survivorship issues, which include anxiety, depression, cognitive function, toxicities management of cancer- or treatment- related physical symptoms, and health-related quality of life in early-stage breast cancer patients.</brief_summary>
