	<brief_summary>Radio(chemo)therapy is the standard therapy for both, brain tumors and brain metastases. Neurological decline is observed in these patients and tumor progression or radiotherapy side effects have been made responsible for this. However CMV encephalitis may also be a reason. Therefore the investigators aim to analyze the CMV status in patients during and after radio(chemo)therapy. It will be checked by CMV-DNA (PCR analysis) and CMV antibodies (IgG and IgM ELISA) in the blood of the patients. These findings will be correlated with changes in the brain, visualized by MRI. In addition a detailed immunophenotyping in the peripheral blood will be performed.</brief_summary>
