	<brief_summary>Patients with acute back pain (&lt;6 weeks) presenting at their general practitioner will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all inclusion criteria and showing no exclusion criteria will fill out the Heidelberg short questionnaire (HKF-R10) and the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool. These two questionnaires categorize back pain patients into individuals at risk of chronic back pain and those not at risk. Furthermore, data concerning pain location, severity, duration and impairment will be collected. Study participants will receive standard care treatment prescribed by their general practitioner. Six months later, study participants will receive a questionnaire in order to collect data concerning their present pain situation. Patients with relevant impairment in their activities of daily living as a result of back pain will be categorized as individuals with chronic back pain. Categorization at six months will be compared with the categorization at presentation.</brief_summary>
