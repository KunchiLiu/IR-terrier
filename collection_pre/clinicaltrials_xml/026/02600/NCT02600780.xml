	<brief_summary>Febuxostat is a potent, nonpurine, selective inhibitor of Xanthine oxidase that exhibits antihyperuricemic activity by reducing the formation of uric acid. The investigators conducted an interventional, two-arm, randomized, open label pilot study on patients with serum urate level ≥ 6.8 mg/dL. Patients were treated with Febuxostat 40 mg Tablets or Allopurinol 300 mg Tablets once daily dose for 90 days to determine the efficacy and safety of Febuxostat in comparison with Allopurinol in Hyperuricemic Subjects with or without Gout.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zurig (Febuxostat) 40mg Efficacy and Safety Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with hyperuricemia (with or without Gout) were randomized into two groups. One was treated with Febuxostat 40 mg Tablets and other with Allopurinol 300 mg Tablets once daily for 3 months period. Gender, age, height, weight, creatinine and ALT levels, co-morbidities and other complications were monitored at screening and as per eligibility criteria 50 patients were enrolled in the study. Efficacy was determined by monitoring serum uric acid levels during and at the end of treatment. The safety profile has also been monitored during the treatment period. Investigator collected and recorded all the data of visits in CRF which was analyzed through SPSS version 20.</detailed_description>
