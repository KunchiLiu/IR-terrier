	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) in patients undergoing heart surgery of valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft on the variables clinics, cardiorespiratory and physical functional.These individuals were randomized to compose the control group (GC) and the BiPAP group (GBiPAP). The routine physical therapy was performed in both groups and in the BiPAPG two daily sessions of 20 minutes were applied with positive expiratory pressure of 10cmH2O and inspiratory of 15cmH2O. To verify the effect of this intervention, before and after the protocol patients underwent the following evaluations: the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), the heart rate variability, the manovacuometry, and cirtometry in the axillary line, umbilical line and the xiphoid appendix.</detailed_description>
