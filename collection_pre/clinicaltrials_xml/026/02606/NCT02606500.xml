	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to determine, whether clinical efficacy of 150 mcg of Corifollitropin alfa is the same in normal weighing and obese women. Furthermore, investigators want to determine whether oocytes retrieved from normal weighing and obese women, after COH using 150 mcg of Corifollitropin alfa, are of same quality on the molecular level.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Corifollitropin Alfa in Obese Women in Terms of Clinical and Molecular Parameters of IVF Success</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dosage of Corifollitropin alfa used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) is adjusted according to the patient's body weight. Meaning, in women with a body weight â‰¤ 60 kg, a single dose of 100 mcg of Corifollitropin alfa is administered for COH and in women with a body weight &gt; 60 kg, a single dose of 150 micrograms of Corifollitropin alfa is administered for COH. These two protocols are comparable in safety and efficacy of follicular stimulation. On the other hand, knowledge about the clinical efficacy of 150 mcg of Corifollitropin alfa in obese women (BMI&gt;30 kg/m2) is lacking. Cumulus cells (CC) surround the oocyte and bi-directional communication between oocyte and CC is necessary for the development of mature and quality oocytes. It has been proposed, that analysis of genes, expressed in CC, can serve as an objective indicator of the oocyte's maturity and developmental potential. Expression of genes in CC as hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), versican (VCAN), progesterone receptor (PR), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), serine protease inhibitor E2 (SERPINE2), glutathione peroxidase (GPX3), pentraxin 3(PTX3) was reported to correlate with oocyte maturity and developmental potential. The effect of Corifollitropin alfa on expression of these genes however, is unknown.</detailed_description>
