	<brief_summary>Stress urinary incontinence related to intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) is a severe form of incontinence that may have a major impact on the quality of life. The main treatment is surgical and consists in the implantation of medical devices such as the artificial urinary sphincter, adjustable continence therapy, compressive sling, or injection of bulking agent. The investigator has developed a new therapeutic strategy for ISD that consist to implant myofibers with their attached satellite cells (the main source of muscle progenitor cells) at the vicinity of the striated urethral sphincter. The principle of this method relies on the in vivo activation of satellite cells leading to the formation of regenerated myofibers (myotubes) generating a distinct and tonic muscular activity . The proof of concept was investigated in a Phase I clinical trial: Investigator found that the periurethral implantation of myofiber strips around the urethra generated an electromyographic activity improving urethral closure pressure in women with severe urinary incontinence associated to ISD. In this previous study, the technique of myofiber implantation was invasive, as it required a surgical approach and dissection of the urethra to place the myofiber. For the clinical trial IPSMA, the investigator sought to optimize the myofiber transplantation process using a method injection of myofibers core obtained by hydro-dissection. The injection technique is performed percutaneously under fluoroscopic and endoscopic control and does not require a surgical approach of the urethra. This clinical trial is prospective, open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, single-center for the first stage and multicenter for the second stage, of 13 months for each patient aims to assess the efficacy and safety of IPSMA in the treatment of urinary incontinence in women with ISD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator chose an assessment method in 2 stages according to the Simon plane . A total of 38 patients are needed. Assuming a ratio of 10% of lost patients or for which the primary endpoint was not evaluable, 4 additional patients will be included totaling 42 patients will be included. This trial is single-center for the first stage and multicenter for the second stage. 11 patients will be included in the first stage and 31 patients in the second stage.</detailed_description>
