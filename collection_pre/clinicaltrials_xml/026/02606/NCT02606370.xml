	<brief_title>Effects of Unstable Shoes on Trunk Muscle Activity, Lumbar Spine Kinematics and Pain in Patients With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: An unstable shoe was developed as a walking device to strengthen the lower extremity muscles and reduce joint loading. A large number of studies have reported increased electromyographic (EMG) activity throughout the gait cycle in most of the lower limb muscles, and significant kinematic changes in the lower extremity. However, no studies have investigated the effects of wearing (1 month) unstable shoes on 1) spine kinematics, 2) trunk muscle activity and 3) Low Back Pain (LBP) during gait in Patients with chronic LBP. Aim: To compare trunk muscle activity, lumbar spine range of motion (ROM) and LBP during gait using an unstable shoe (Intervention group) and a conventional stable control shoe (Control Group). Design: Randomized Controlled Trial. Setting: A Biomechanics laboratory. Population: Patients with Low Back Pain.</detailed_description>
