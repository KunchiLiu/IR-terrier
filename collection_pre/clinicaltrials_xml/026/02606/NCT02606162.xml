	<brief_title>Outcomes of Severe Osteoporotic Fractures Hospitalized in France: the CROSS Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In France, the burden of osteoporotic fractures has been studied using cross sectional data from the French hospital national database. The availability of fracture liaison service in the main French cities allows the recruitment of a high number of these targeted patients. A large national multicenter, longitudinal, prospective cohort of patients hospitalized for severe osteoporotic fracture, the CROSS cohort ("Cohorte sur les Risques d'une OStéoporose Sévère"), in order to update data on prognosis (refracture, mortality), epidemiology and of severe osteoporotic fractures.</detailed_description>

Vertebral fractures have to be confirmed by an X ray examination. To be eligible for the study the patient has to be included and interviewed within 6 weeks of the fracture event. Informed and free consent given and form signed and dated Non severe fracture (for example wrist fracture), pathological fractures, high trauma fractures and per prosthetic fractures.
