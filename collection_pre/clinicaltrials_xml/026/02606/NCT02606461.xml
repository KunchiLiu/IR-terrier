	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2-3 study of patients diagnosed with advanced unresectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Approximately 245 total patients will be randomized to study treatment (selinexor or placebo).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor in Advanced Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the Phase 2 portion of the study, approximately 50 patients will be randomized to selinexor (60 mg) or placebo at a 1:1 allocation ratio. In the Phase 3 portion of the study, approximately 195 patients will be randomized to selinexor (60 mg) or placebo with a 2:1 allocation ratio. Patients who progress during the blinded portion of the study will be unblinded and if receiving: - placebo, may cross over to open-label selinexor (60mg twice weekly) - selinexor, will be withdrawn from further treatment and followed for survival Study treatment will be given twice weekly on Day 1 and Day 3 during Weeks 1-6 of each six-week (42 day) cycle until disease progression or intolerability. Treatment will continue until one or more of the following occurs: - Disease progression, as defined by WHO criteria - Clinical progression, as determined by the treating physician - Unacceptable AEs or failure to tolerate study treatment - Patient withdrawal - Patient discontinuation due to non-compliance</detailed_description>

Must have had at least one (1) prior line of systemic therapy for liposarcoma (no maximum number) 7. If patient received any previous systemic therapy, the last dose must have been ≥ 21 days prior to randomization (or ≥ 5 halflives of that drug whichever is shorter) with all clinically significant therapy related toxicities having resolved to less than or equal to Grade 1 1. Patients with pure WDLS, myxoid/round cell or pleomorphic tumor histologic subtypes. 2. Known active Hepatitis B (HepB), Hepatitis C (HepC) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 3.
