	<brief_summary>With the improvement of living level, the incidence rates of diabetes, obesity, and hypertension in China increased quickly, which are 11.6%, 7.1% and 18.8% respectively, according to the newly investigated data. The clustering of diabetes, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia increases the risk of cardiovascular events for patients. GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide-1) is a kind of incretin discovered in recent years. It was reported that beside its hypoglycemic and losing weight effects, activator of GLP-1 receptor could decrease blood pressure and improve lipid metabolism. Sleeve gastrectomy can improve the level of blood glucose and serum lipid of type 2 diabetic rats by ameliorate insulin level and insulin resistance, which may be related with the change of gastrointestinal hormones such as ghrelin and GLP-1. So, intervention of gastrointestinal tract and gastrointestinal hormone secretion may be a new therapy for glycolipids disorder and vascular complications. But, it is lack of evidence-based medicine proof on the relationship between prokinetic drug and glycolipids metabolism. So, the investigators designed a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo control study, and try to evaluate the effects of prokinetic drug (Mosapride) on the blood glucose and serum lipid in type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
