	<brief_summary>Patients that are either scheduled to undergo or have undergone an achalasia procedure at the Mayo Clinic Rochester are asked to participate. The purpose of this study is to gather information and determine if one of these procedures is superior to the other.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Achalasia Patient Reported Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, non-inferiority trial that has been created to compare results of achalasia procedures including but not limited to: POEM + Partial Fundoplication (PF), POEM and Laparoscopic Modified Heller Myotomy + PF and POEM + Peroral Plication of the esophagus. Using a set of consistent evaluation tools for patients undergoing treatment for achalasia allows a standardized evaluation and comparison of these groups of patients. The long term and comparative POEM procedure outcomes are not currently known. Patients undergoing POEM, fundoplication, and/or laparoscopic myotomy report having varying degrees of symptoms of reflux, dysphagia, and pain. Providers also note varying degrees of esophagitis by endoscopy, reflux by impedance or pH scoring, and recurrence by repeat manometry. Many of these issues can be quantified using pH probe testing, upper GI endoscopy, high resolution manometry, CT scans, Endoflip device and esophagrams. There are various validated questionnaires that have been used to assess problem areas of reflux, dysphagia, and pain such as the Promis Global Health Score, Ekhardt Score, Mayo GER Score, Modified Dysphagia Questionnaire-30 Day, Zubrod Score, and pain scale. Each of these symptoms, tests, and questionnaires contributes to the provider's understanding of the patient's postoperative outcome.</detailed_description>
