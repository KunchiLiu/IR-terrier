	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm trial of pamrevlumab (FG-3019) to estimate pamrevlumab's safety and efficacy in non-ambulatory subjects with DMD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Pamrevlumab (FG-3019), in Non-Ambulatory Subjects With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject will receive pamrevlumab (35 mg/kg) every two weeks by intravenous infusion for at least one year. Subjects may continue on the study for an additional 6 months (for a total of a year and a half) if their pulmonary function tests show stabilization or improvement in the first 52 weeks of treatment and the FibroGen Medical Monitor approves of their continuing. All subjects will be closely monitored for safety. Efficacy assessments will be performed routinely over the course of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At least 12 years of age Written consent/assent by patient and/or legal guardian as per regional and/or IRB requirements Nonambulatory Brooke Score for Arms and Shoulders ≤5 Diagnosis of DMD by medical history and confirmed Duchenne mutation in available genetic testing using a validated genetic test Able to perform spirometry Able to undergo cardiac and extremity (upper arm) MRI Percent predicted FVC between 40 and 90, inclusive At least one historical FVC% predicted value within 18 months of baseline Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;45% as determined by cardiac MRI at screening or within 3 months prior to day 0 Subjects currently receiving heart failure cardiac medications (e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensinreceptor blockers, and betablockers) must achieve a stable regimen for at least 3 months prior to screening On a stable dose of corticosteroids for a minimum of 6 months prior to screening with no substantial change in dosage for a minimum of 3 months (except for adjustments for changes in body weight) prior to screening and no foreseen change in corticosteroid use during the course of study participation Received pneumococcal vaccine and is receiving annual influenza vaccinations Adequate renal function: cystatin C ≤1.4 mg/L Adequate hematological function 1. Platelets &gt;100,000/mcL 2. Hemoglobin &gt;12 g/dL 3. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500/μL Adequate hepatic function 1. No history or evidence of liver disease 2. Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) ≤3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 3. Total bilirubin ≤1.5xULN If sexually active, will use medically accepted contraceptives during participation in the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug Requires ≥16 hours continuous ventilation Prior or ongoing medical condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the subject, makes it unlikely that the course of 78 weeks of treatment and followup would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study results Anticipated spine surgery within 78 weeks Severe uncontrolled heart disease 1. Need for intravenous diuretics or inotropic support within 3 months prior to screening 2. Hospitalization for a heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmia in last 3 months Arrhythmia requiring antiarrhythmic therapy Hospitalization due to respiratory failure in the last 6 weeks Poorly controlled asthma or underlying lung disease such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia Known or suspected active hepatitis B or C or history of HIV BMI ≥40 kg/m^2 or weight &gt;117 kg Exposure to another investigational drug within 28 days prior to start of study treatment Exposure to another investigational drug or another approved product for DMD (e.g. eteplirsen) within 28 days prior to start of study treatment (or 5 halflives of the product whichever is longer) prior to first screening visit with the exception of deflazacort. Use of deflazacort if regarded by the principal investigator as standard of care is allowed.</criteria>
