	<brief_summary>The study will consist of 2 parts: Part I (Dose Escalation) and Part II (Dose Expansion). In Part I, patients will participate in single, multiple, and long-term dosing periods using EPI-506 to determine safety, pharmacokinetics, the maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary indications of anti-tumor activity. Part I is an open-label, adaptive 3 + 3 design, dose-escalation study. Approximately six dose levels of EPI-506 will be studied, beginning at 80 mg/day. Enrolled patients may be allowed to escalate to a subsequent dose cohort after their initial twelve weeks. In Part II, 3 patient populations; post-abiraterone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) but enzalutamide-naïve, post-enzalutamide mCRPC but abiraterone-naïve, and post-abiraterone and enzalutamide mCRPC will be studied at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in Part I over 12 weeks of daily dosing. Approximately 120 patients (40 in each cohort) will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
