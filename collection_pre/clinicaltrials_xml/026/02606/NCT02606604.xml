	<brief_title>Effects of Functional Electrical Stimulation Cycling Versus Cycling Only on Walking and Quality of Life in MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is a rehabilitation tool that stimulates nerves via electrical current, causing muscles to contract. When FES is appled to leg muscles during stationary cycling the legs move in a fixed rhythmical pattern. Previous studies have demonstrated that FES during cycling is a safe and effective exercise for individuals recovering from spinal cord injury or stroke, but few have applied this tool to a progressive disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of this study is to assess the immediate and short-term effect of an 8-week training program comparing FES lower extremity cycling to cycling without FES. Twenty volunteers with MS will participate. They will be randomly assigned to a training group. This study examine the effects of training on quality of life, endurance, walking speed, and step quality. Participants will sign an informed consent and complete a questionnaire that includes medical history and demographic data. Before training, immediately after training finishes and one month after training, self-report questionnaires, timed walking tests will be completed. During the walking tests, step quality and speed will be measured with a sensor that is worn on a belt</detailed_description>
