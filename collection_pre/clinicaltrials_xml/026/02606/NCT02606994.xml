	<brief_title>Effect of Over-the-counter Toothpastes on Chemotherapy-induced Oral Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pilot study showed that patients with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis experienced accelerated healing of their oral mucositis by brushing with Oral Defense Toothpaste. In this study, participants experiencing up to grade 2 chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis will be split into two arms. The first arm (test arm) will receive Oral Defense Toothpaste and be required to brush three times per day, for 15 days. The second arm (control arm) will receive Crest Toothpaste and be required to brush three times per day, for 15 days. Patients in the control arm will be provided Magic Mouth Rinse, if needed. Healing of oral mucositis lesions will be evaluated at days 3, 7, and 15. Quality of life assessment (determination of pain/loss of oral function) will be determined using a daily questionnaire.</detailed_description>
