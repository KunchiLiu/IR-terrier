	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: -To assess the change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes patients on OAD agent in Jordan after 6 months of treatment with basal insulin (Insulin glargine). Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the percentage of patients achieving target of HbA1c ˂7%. - To evaluate the change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG). - To assess the following safety criteria: hypoglycemic events, body weight changes, and overall safety. - Describe the titration process: changes in glargine insulin dose at 3 months and 6 months, changes in the titration doses used (if any), and time to reach control.</brief_summary>
