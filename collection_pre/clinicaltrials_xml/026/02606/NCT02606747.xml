	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the balance ability of DPN (diabetic peripheral neuropathy)patients, which will help us to understand the relationship between peripheral and central nervous system, in order to early diagnosis and prevent the fall in DPN patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Balance Control Mechanism of DPN Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DPN is one of the most common complications of diabetes. The clinical manifestation of DPN contains sensory reduction, pain, muscle wastage and so on. Sensory and motor nervous are one of the most important factors in balance control, the reduction of balance ability will result in high risk of fall. Most studies about DPN are focus on peripheral nervous, however, the central nervous system may also be involved in DPN patients. In this study, force platform, proprioception test and fMRI will be used to evaluate balance ability, proprioception and the brain function information of DPN patients, which will help to understand the relationship between peripheral and central nervous system.</detailed_description>
