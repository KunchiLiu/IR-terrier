	<brief_summary>This pilot observational study will assess changes in pH /PaO2 /PaCO2, Respiratory Rate and device CO2 clearance in the first 24 hours of Extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) following tidal volume (Vt), and plateau pressure reduction in patients with mild to moderate ARDS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Flow CO2 Removal for Mild to Moderate ARDS With PRISMALUNG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) with a low-flow CO2 removal device (Prismalung, Gambro-Baxter) integrated on the Prismaflex platform (Gambro-Baxter) allows tidal volume (Vt) and plateau pressure reduction in patients with mild to moderate ARDS. This pilot observational study will assess changes in pH /PaO2 /PaCO2, Respiratory Rate and device CO2 clearance in the first 24 hours of ECCO2R following Vt and plateau pressure reduction in patients with mild to moderate ARDS. Safety variables during treatment will also be analyzed. A series of 20 consecutive patients will be included in this observational study.</detailed_description>
