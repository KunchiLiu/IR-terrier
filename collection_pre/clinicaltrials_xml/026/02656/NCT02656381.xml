	<brief_summary>Background: Uveitis is a serious eye disease that can cause vision loss. Treatment sometimes causes serious side effects or does not work. Researchers want to learn more about uveitis and why some people develop it. Objective: To learn clinical and genetic factors that may make people develop uveitis and influence how they respond to treatment. Eligibility: People ages 8 and older who have uveitis, scleritis, inflammatory eye disease, or a disease related to eye inflammation Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical exam Eye exam Participation lasts up to 10 years. The clinic visit schedule varies depending on participants eye disease: Baseline visit with annual follow-ups Baseline visit, visits at months 3 and 6, and annual follow-ups Another schedule set by the researcher Depending on participants eye disease, tests during each visit could include: Fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography: Dye is injected through a needle in the arm and flows through the blood vessels in the eye. A camera takes pictures of the eye. Electroretinography: Participants sit in the dark with their eyes patched. After 30 minutes, numbing drops and contact lenses are put in the eyes. Then, the retina is stimulated with flashing lights. Perimetry: Participants look into a bowl or lens and press a button when they see a light. Conjunctival or corneal biopsy, or skin biopsy: A small piece of tissue is removed. Anterior chamber tap: A needle enters the eye to remove fluid. Blood and urine tests Saliva, stool, hair, or tear samples Cotton swab of the inside of the cheek. During the study, participants may need immunosuppressive treatment, such as drugs or injections in or around the eyes depending on their disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uveitis/Intraocular Inflammatory Disease Biobank (iBank)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveitis refers to a large group of intraocular inflammatory diseases that can cause devastating visual loss in adults and children. This study establishes a clinical database and biospecimen repository for the identification of novel factors relevant to the pathogenesis, progression, and response to treatment of a wide spectrum of uveitic conditions. Objectives: This study provides for standardized collection of longitudinal clinical data and for serial collection, processing, and storage of a variety of biospecimens. The clinical data set and biospecimen repository will be used to identify novel genetic factors, biomarkers, and experimental models associated with pathogenesis, progression, and response to treatment for various ocular and systemic conditions where inflammation of the uveal tract is present. Study Population: The study plans to accrue 500 participants with uveitis or related diseases. This will not be restricted by anatomical location or etiology with the inclusion of both idiopathic cases, infectious uveitis, scleritis and those cases linked to a disease known to be associated with an increased risk of intraocular inflammation (e.g., sarcoidosis, Beh(SqrRoot)(Beta)et's disease and multiple sclerosis (MS) and lymphoma). Design: This is a prospective observational study of participants with intraocular inflammatory diseases incorporating: 1. A standardized follow-up and testing schedule with standard-of-care management of eye diseases; and 2. Collection of biospecimens for research purposes for which sampling does not incur more than minimal risk to participants. Outcome Measures: Outcome measures include the interaction of key parameters of disease phenotype (such as visual acuity and ocular imaging features) with genetic variants and other biomarkers identified from biospecimens and the characterization of new experimental models of eye health and disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants will be eligible if they: 1. Have a diagnosis of uveitis, scleritis or a disease known to be associated with intraocular inflammation, (e.g., Beh(SqrRoot)(Beta)et s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) and lymphoma). 2. Are 8 years of age or older. 3. For participants 18 years of age and older: Are willing to give informed consent that includes collection and study of at least one peripheral blood sample. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants will not be eligible if they: 1. Are unable to understand and sign the informed consent form. 2. Are unable or unwilling to give informed consent that includes use of NIH medical records and clinical samples for current and future research related to vision and diseases affecting the eyes. 3. Have a systemic disease that compromises the ability to provide adequate ophthalmologic examination or treatment as determined by the investigator. 4. Have inactive anterior uveitis or quiescent infectious uveitis not requiring such regimented and intensive standardized testing as determined by the Investigator. 5. Have end stage or chronic quiescent changes in the setting of an established infectious etiology, such as an old ocular toxoplasma scar (participants with active intraocular inflammation due to infection will be recruited).</criteria>
