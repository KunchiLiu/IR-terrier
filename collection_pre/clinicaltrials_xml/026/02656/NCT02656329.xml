	<brief_summary>This is an event-driven Phase IIIb, multicentre, randomised, clinical study to demonstrate the efficacy of AdreView™ imaging for appropriately guiding the decision of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation, in New York Health Association (NYHA) class II and III heart failure patients with 30%≤left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)≤35%%, and in particular, for identifying patients who are at low risk for sudden cardiac death and who would not benefit, or may suffer harm, from implantation of an ICD device.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients ≥18 years of age at the time dated informed consent is obtained. Female patients must be premenarchal, surgically sterile (had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy), postmenopausal (cessation of menses for more than 1 year), nonlactating, or, if of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test with the results known prior to AdreView (Iobenguane I123 Injection) administration) is negative. Patients willing and able to comply with all study procedures and a signed and dated informed consent is obtained before any studyprocedure is carried out. Heart failure NYHA classes II or III for symptoms, patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease, eligible for ICD implantation as per each site's standard of practice. Heart failure NYHA classes II or III for symptoms, patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease, eligible for ICD implantation as per each site's standard of practice. Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease of at least 3 months duration. 30%≤LVEF≤35%, performed within 3 months before or at time of enrolment, as measured by radionuclide ventriculography, or electrocardiogram [ECG]gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging [MPI], or magnetic resonance imaging [MR], computed tomography [CT], or 3D or 2D echocardiography [Simpson's or multidisc method only, Mmode echocardiography is not accepted]. In case LVEF measurement is performed within 3 months before enrolment, measurement should be performed at least 40 days after a hospitalisation for HF or acute coronary syndrome (including myocardial infarction), and to be valid, method of measurement should be in accordance with the protocol and the imaging exam should be made available to the Sponsor in digital format. In case several valid LVEF measurements are available, the closest to enrolment will be used for inclusion determination. Clinically stable heart failure in the medical judgment of the investigator (i.e. no significant changes in medication, no worsening of symptoms, no unscheduled visits to the doctor's office) for the past 30 days and no hospitalisation for heart failure or acute coronary syndrome (including myocardial infarction) in the past 40 days. Reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for at least 1 year. Patients with existing ICD or patient having an indication of ICD implantation for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Hospitalisation for HF or for acute coronary syndrome in the previous 40 days. Patients where a cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is planned or indicated. Other indication for placement of device (sustained ventricular tachycardia, resuscitated sudden death, need for atrioventricular pacing). NYHA class I or class IV symptoms at the time of study entry. Patient with chronic renal insufficiency defined as serum creatinine ≥ 3 mg/dl (or 265.2 µmol/L). American College of CollegeAmerican Heart Association (ACCAHA) class III or class IV (unstable) angina. Known or suspected hypersensitivity/allergy to Iobenguane or to any of the excipients an Adreview (Iobenguane I131 injection). Patient who is pregnant or plans to become pregnant within 2 weeks after AdreView (Iobenguane I123 Injection) administration. Patient who has used any medication in the 2 weeks before AdreView (Iobenguane I123 Injection) that could interfere with the test: e.g. but not limited to amitriptyline or derivatives, imipramine or derivatives, other antidepressants or drugs known or suspected to inhibit the norepinephrine transporter, antihypertensives that deplete norepinephrine stores or inhibit reuptake, sympathomimetic amines or cocaine. Patients that have a medical condition that could interfere with the AdreView test (e.g. but not limited to left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or prior heart transplant). Patients who participated in a clinical study involving a drug or device within 30 days prior to study entry and patients participating in any other clinical study. Patients having serious noncardiac medical condition associated with significant elevation of plasma catecholamines, including pheochromocytoma. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of (or being treated for) Parkinson's disease or Multiple System Atrophy. The patient has participated in a research study using ionizing radiation in the previous 12 months. The patient has participated in a research study using ionizing radiation in the previous 12 months.</criteria>
