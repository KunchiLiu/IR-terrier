	<brief_summary>We will investigate whether measurement of the change in thickness of the diaphragm during the respiratory cycle by ultrasound can predict extubation success in a 48 hour window. We will also asses whether this is only possible on low levels of pressure support as has been shown previously, or if this technique retains its predictive power at higher levels of pressure support.</brief_summary>
