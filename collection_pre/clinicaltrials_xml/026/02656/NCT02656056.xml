	<brief_summary>The consumption of fermented soy foods can alter the human microbiome and may confer health benefits. Researchers propose a line of inquiry to assess the effects of Q-Can Plus ("QC") fermented soy beverage in humans, assessing immunological, microbiological, and clinical parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing the Role of a Fermented Soy Extract in Inflammation and the Human Microbiome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will start with a detailed testing of the microorganisms present in the QC fermented soy liquid, using deep sequencing. Subsequently, the researchers will determine the effect of the QC fermented soy product on the microbiome and inflammation in lean and obese individuals, as obese individuals are known to have dysbiosis. The work on inflammatory changes will be supplemented by studies to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanistic pathways responsible for the biological action of QC fermented soy liquid.</detailed_description>
