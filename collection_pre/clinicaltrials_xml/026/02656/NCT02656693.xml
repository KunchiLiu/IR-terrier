	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to adapt an evidence-based online weight management program and integrate it with population management support from primary care practices. Investigators then will conduct a three-arm, cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of 1) the combined intervention (online weight management program plus population management support) with 2) the stand-alone online weight management program and with 3) usual care, among overweight and obese primary care patients with type 2 diabetes or hypertension. The specific aims are: 1. a. To adapt an online weight management program and integrate it with population management support, incorporating input from patients, primary care clinicians, and other stakeholders; afterward, investigators will acquire feedback on the positive and negative aspects of the intervention. b. To compare the effectiveness of the combined intervention (online weight management program plus population management support) with the stand-alone online program and with usual care. Hypothesis 1: The combined intervention will lead to greater weight loss at 12 months compared with the stand-alone online program and with usual care. 2. To identify mediators of the combined intervention and the stand-alone online program. Hypothesis 2: The effects of the combined intervention and the stand-alone online program on weight loss will be mediated by patients' level of engagement, changes in self-efficacy, and changes in diet and physical activity. 3. To explore whether the effectiveness of the combined intervention and the stand-alone weight management program varies by patient characteristics. Hypothesis 3: The interventions will be more effective among patients who are younger, white, and higher socioeconomic status, although the population management strategy may help to reduce these differences.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Focus Groups and Key Informant Interviews: Focus groups will be conducted with 5 to 7 patients at the beginning and end of the study to obtain their feedback about an online program and the population health management support strategy. To be eligible for the focus groups, patients must have a Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) primary care clinician, have a BMI between 27 and 34.9 kg/m2, and have a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or hypertension. Key Informant Interviews will be conducted at the beginning and the end of the study. To be eligible, the key informants must be clinicians at one of the participating BWH primary care practices. There are a total of 165 clinicians in these practices, including staff physicians, residents or fellows, and nurse practitioners or physician assistants. Approximately 7 clinicians at each timepoint will be recruited as key informants and will also be asked to complete electronic surveys during the trial. After adapting the online weight management program and integrating it with the population management support strategy based on our focus groups and key informant interviews, investigators will conduct a three-arm cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of the combined intervention (online weight management program plus population management support) with the stand-alone online weight management program and with usual care. This will be a pragmatic clinical trial conducted in approximately 14 BWH primary care practices. To be eligible for the trial, patients must have an upcoming scheduled visit at a BWH primary care practice, BMI between 27 and 39.9 kg/m2 at enrollment, and a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or hypertension. They also must be between ages 20 and 70 (inclusive) at enrollment, speak English or Spanish, and have access the Internet using a computer, tablet, or smart phone. Finally, patients must be motivated to lose weight. Investigators plan to recruit a total of 840 patients for the study (280 per arm). Patients who enroll in the trial will attend regular primary care visits at their practices and also will complete surveys by e-mail, regular mail, or phone.</detailed_description>
