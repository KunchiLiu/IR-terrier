	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Comparing Anti-Inflammatory Effects Of TXA Versus EACA In Pediatric Congenital Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bleeding under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is one of the most common complications in patients undergoing pediatric cardiac surgery. The inflammatory response produced during and after CPB is a factor that adds significantly to the morbidity after cardiac surgery. A number of factors have been shown to be involved inducing the inflammatory response. These include complement system activation3 and activation of inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1 IL-64, IL-8 and TNF alpha. Tranexamic Acid (TXA) and Epsilon-Aminocaproic Acid (EACA) are lysine analogues frequently used as anti-fibrinolytic agents in patients undergoing CPB. Many authors have highlighted the role of TXA in reducing blood loss and blood transfusion during and after CPB. Role of EACA and aprotinin in decreasing pro-inflammatory response during and after CPB has been well documented in adult literature. Patients undergoing redo sternotomy have higher inflammatory response as compared to patients undergoing first cardiac surgery. It has also been shown that the TXA can reduce the inflammatory response after CPB by acting directly or indirectly on the inflammatory cytokines. There are no studies directly comparing the anti-inflammatory properties of EACA and TXA in the pediatric population undergoing CPB. In our institution, EACA is used as the standard of practice to reduce the blood loss during pediatric cardiac surgeries, but the investigators have now started using TXA more recently. The aim of this study is to compare the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrinolytic properties of these two anti-fibrinolytic agents in pediatric patients undergoing CBP for cardiac surgery. Hypothesis: Tranexamic acid (TXA) has better anti-inflammatory profile as compared to â‚¬-Amino Caproic Acid (EACA) which may help in reducing blood loss, renal injury, hepatic injury and blood transfusion during and after CPB Specific Objectives: During redo sternotomy procedures there is significant anti-inflammatory response which occurs and plays a role in increasing amount chest tube output, blood loss, renal injury, hepatic injury and ultimately patient morbidity and/or mortality. The proposed study will help to know if antifibrinolytic agents are beneficial in reducing the anti-inflammatory response produced and which of the two drugs (EACA or TXA), has a better anti-inflammatory profile when used in a similar setting for patients undergoing pediatric cardiothoracic surgery. Specific Aims: Evaluate whether TXA or EACA can decrease inflammatory response produced during redo sternotomy procedures in pediatric patients and which drug decreases the injury and/or cardiac dysfunction more as reflected by fluid balances, inotropic support, diuretic requirement, length of ventilator support, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay.</detailed_description>
