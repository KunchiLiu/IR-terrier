	<brief_summary>In this prospective nonrandomized study the investigators are going to investigate whether auricular acupuncture with indwelling fixed needles is feasible for treatment of preoperative anxiety. Patients, scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgery, will be asked, if they wish to receive auricular acupuncture (AA) against preoperative anxiety. The patients who will not wish AA, will be asked to take part in questioning (State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI) questionnaire) and will form the control group. The preoperative anxiety using STAI, as well as the duration and quality of sleep on the night before surgery, the incidence of side effects, blood pressure and heart rate will be the outcome measures in this study.</brief_summary>
