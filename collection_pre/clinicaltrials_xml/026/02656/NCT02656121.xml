	<brief_summary>Recently, a special emphasis has recently been directed to the potential role of vitamin D and some regulatory peptides (e.g. adipokines and follistatin) and their associated metabolic roles and genetic factors in the development of PCOS and its related co-morbidities. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of vitamin D supplementation therapy and Metformin therapy on plasma concentrations of adipokines (ghrelin, resistin and adiponectin), follistatin and activins in participants diagnosed with PCOS.</brief_summary>
