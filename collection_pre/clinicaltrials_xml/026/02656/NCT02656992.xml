	<brief_summary>Reduced exercise tolerance is commonly reported in patients with bronchiectasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of high-intensity inspiratory muscle training (High-IMT) and sham High-IMT (control) on exercise capacity, respiratory muscle function (strength and endurance) and health related quality of life in patients with bronchiectasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of High Intensity Inspiratory Muscle Training on Exercise Capacity in Patients With Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis often demonstrates decreased exercise tolerance, marked dyspnea and fatigue. The causes are multifactorial and include altered pulmonary mechanics, inefficient gas exchange, decreased muscle mass, and psychological status, which all lead to a progressive detraining effect. Essentially both the pathology and the functional manifestations of bronchiectasis increase the demand for inspiratory muscle work and that contribute to dyspnea and exercise limitation. In recent studies reduced strength of respiratory muscles are investigated in bronchiectasis and can be contribute the exercise limitation. Additionally IMT has shown to improve respiratory muscle function, exercise tolerance and dyspnea in patients with bronchiectasis. Despite this, the number of studies are inadequate and so the optimal training protocol remains still to be defined. In this study the researchers want to investigate the effects of high-intensity inspiratory muscle training in functional results in patients with bronchiectasis.</detailed_description>
