	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of G-Pen™ Compared to Lilly Glucagon for Hypoglycemia Rescue in Adult Type 1 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a blinded, randomized, Phase 3 comparative efficacy and safety study in adults with type 1 diabetes. Patients will complete screening procedures up to 60 days before randomization to determine eligibility before enrollment to the treatment phase. The procedure for evaluating the efficacy of the G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) consists of inducing hypoglycemia by intravenous administration of regular insulin diluted in normal saline. Each participant will undergo two episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and in random order will receive 1 mg G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) during one episode and 1 mg Lilly Glucagon during the other episode. There will be wash out period of 7-28 days between treatment visits. Blood glucose levels will be monitored post-dosing, with a return of plasma glucose to a concentration &gt; 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes signifying successful hypoglycemia rescue. As a confirmation of efficacy, subjects will complete a questionnaire concerning changes in symptoms of hypoglycemia following treatment with glucagon. Subjects will return for a follow-up safety visit 3-14 days following administration of the final dose of glucagon.</detailed_description>
