	<brief_summary>30 children between 4 and 7 years old with moderate to severe motor impairment, 50% males 50% females will participate in an interventional study in two groups: placebo and experimental group. Placebo group will only receive traditional treatment with physiotherapy and the Experimental or tRNS Group will receive physiotherapy plus tRNS BrainNoninvasive Stimulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>tES With Random Noise Stimulation Applied to Children With Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this Interventional Study with Double Blind Assignment to Placebo and Experimental Group, Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and Neurophysiological are the parameters measured with EEG amplifier before and after 30 sessions. Work hypothesis is that the tRNS Group will present better motor functionality after 30 sessions of 30 minutes of duration of electrical brain stimulation administered during physiotherapy exercises 2 days per week than the Group that only receives treatment with physiotherapy during 30 minutes 2 days per week without tRNS.</detailed_description>
