	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the effect of a suspension containing chlorhexidine and alcohol and another one containing clorhexidine with no alcohol in dynamic of the subgingival biofilm formation versus a Placebo suspension. The initial subgingival biofilm formation will be evaluated by means of Plaque Free Zone (PFZ).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Two Chlorhexidine Solutions to Control the Initial Subgingival Biofilm Formation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blind, cross over, randomized clinical trial. 35 volunteers will stop mechanical supragingival biofilm removal measures for 96h following a complete scaling and polishing of the tooth surfaces. During this period they will be asked to rinse for a minute a Solution containing chlorhexidine and alcohol or a solution with chlorhexidine alcohol-free or placebo. Every 24h the presence of deposits will be registered with special attention to the presence of a plaque free zone between the apical border of the deposits and the gingival margin. Absence of deposits is scored 0, presence of deposits and plaque free zone =1 and presence of deposits and absence of plaque free zone =2 (MALISKA, A. N. et al. Measuring early plaque formation clinically. Oral health preventive dentistry, v. 4, p. 273-278, 2006). The prevalence of scores and the rate of changes from scores 0 and 1 into 2 will be evaluated for significance. Sample size was calculated taking the results from the study o MALISKA, AN (2006) as reference.</detailed_description>
