	<brief_summary>Effective adjuvant treatment can increase cure in patients with high-risk resected melanoma. High dose interferon is a standard of care in the adjuvant setting but is highly toxic and marginally effective. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab is the most active regimen in patients with advanced melanoma so there is clear rationale to test this regimen in the adjuvant setting. Investigators are testing if nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks with 1mg/kg ipilimumab every 6 weeks in the high risk adjuvant setting. The duration of therapy will be six months.</brief_summary>

Completely resected stage III (lymph node positive) or resected stage IV disease. Patients with stage T4BN0 are also eligible. It is required that patients with stage IIIA disease have &gt; 1mm nodal involvement via pathology assessment of the resected node. All patients must be disease free to be eligible.

Therapeutic use of anticoagulants is permissible. Add to concomitant medication log if applicable. Not pregnant and not nursing. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 7 days prior to Day 1 of treatment. Postmenopausal women (surgical menopause or lack of menses &gt;12 months) do not need to have a pregnancy test, please document status. Confirmation of informed consent. Men and women of childbearing potential enrolled in this study must agree to use adequate barrier birth control measures during the course of the study and up to 2 months after. Currently receiving cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy) or investigational anticancer drug Brain metastases, whether resected or not, and any known leptomeningeal disease or known bone metastases. Pregnant or lactating female Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures required in the protocol, to document Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results. Prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast. Documentation required to be sent to BrUOG Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, controlled type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration.
