	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify and provide immediate antiretroviral therapy to a cohort of HIV-infected individuals with "hyperacute" infection (estimated date of HIV infection within the last 30 days). The primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether initiation of dolutegravir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir during hyperacute HIV infection leads to protection of CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue from infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immediate Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy During "Hyperacute" HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although ART decreases HIV-associated mortality, it does not appear to completely restore immune health, for reasons that remain unclear. In addition, while HIV prevention approaches have led to significant successes in decreasing the incidence of new HIV infection over the past few years, the epidemic continues to grow both locally and globally. A synergistic strategy to HIV prevention is to effectively eradicate virus from HIV-infected persons. While complete eradication may not currently be feasible, a "functional cure" in which patients are able to indefinitely maintain undetectable viral loads in the absence of therapy may be an attainable immediate goal. Studying hyperacute HIV-infected individuals will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology of the earliest stages of HIV infection and may help identify the virologic/immunologic predictors of a functional cure.</detailed_description>
