	<brief_summary>The study aims to evaluate use of regorafenib in clinical practice in Hungary. The study should provide information about clinical characteristics of Hungarian regorafenib patients as well as information about safety and efficacy of regorafenib in Hungarian patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. This much needed data is required by the National Health Insurance Fund in order to accept regorafenib into the regular reimbursement system. This study is proposed to be based on patient data from the Hungarian National Health Insurance Fund's Database. Data to be analyzed includes patient demography and baseline tumor characteristics, overall survival, time to treatment failure, duration of treatment, average dose and dose modifications, and adverse events. Further, treatment costs will be estimated.</brief_summary>
