	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Smoking Cessation Mobile Phone Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarching study aim is to recruit and enroll a population of current smokers who are motivated to quit with the assistance of a mobile solution. The core study period will consist of 8 weeks of iPhone program usage. Comprehensive questionnaires will be given to the user during the course of their application usage. Users will receive notifications to link them to these online surveys, which will record their responses in a secure database. Following the 8-week core study, participants may continue usage of the program. During the course of their use of the program, participants will be asked to provide information regarding three general areas on a regular basis as part of their use of the app: smoking status, adherence to self or physician-directed quit plans (including but not limited to medications for smoking cessation and over-the-counter quit aids), and overall user satisfaction. One way that the program assesses these areas involves asking users to answer questions addressing whether or not the user used nicotine in the last 24 hours. At the end of each week, users will also be asked to report their cigarette count for each of the past 7 days, using the standardized reporting technique called the Timeline Followback (TLFB) Method Assessment (Sobell, 1992). At the 16-week mark and at the 24-week mark after enrollment, users will receive a brief questionnaire retrospectively looking at their cigarette usage, adherence to quit aids, and physical symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.</detailed_description>
