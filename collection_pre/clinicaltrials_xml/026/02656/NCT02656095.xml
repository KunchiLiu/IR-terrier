	<brief_summary>This study plans to learn more about measuring Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in humans. LPL is an enzyme in the breakdown of certain types of fats into smaller parts. Lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) is a very rare genetic disorder in which lipoprotein enzyme is no longer functional. This can cause conditions known as high triglycerides in the blood and inflammation of the pancreas. Investigational medications to treat LPLD are currently being developed. In order to see if these medications are effective, it is necessary to be able to accurately measure LPL activity in humans. LPL activity has been successfully measured in animal models after giving heparin. Heparin is a blood thinner which is approved by the FDA. It is originally used to prevent blood clots. This study will administer heparin to healthy adults through intravenous infusion (IV). Blood samples will be collected before and after the infusion to test LDL levels. The purpose of this study is to develop a cheap, more reliable standard for assessment of LPLD in patients</brief_summary>
