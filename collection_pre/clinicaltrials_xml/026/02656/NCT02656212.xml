	<brief_title>Early Phase Pre-Clinical and Initial Clinical Research on Epicatechin (Part 2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, Phase I study that will include (+)-epicatechin dosing over seven days. - Subjects will meet the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for pre-diabetes, including impaired fasting glucose (IFG) [refer to inclusion/exclusion criteria]. - The Project includes: 7 day evaluation of a single daily dose of synthetic (+)-epicatechin in pre-diabetic individuals as compared to placebo. - The Project has 4 outpatient clinic study visits: screening (Visit 1), randomization (Visit 2), end of study drug (Visit 3), follow up end of study (Visit 4). - This Project has 2 telephone visits Primary hypothesis: As these studies are designed to evaluate safety and tolerability, there is no primary hypothesis to test. Primary outcome measures. Vital signs and safety labs: BP, HR, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and liver transaminases These studies will provide initial data about if (+)-epicatechin can influence glycemic control in individuals with prediabetes.</detailed_description>
