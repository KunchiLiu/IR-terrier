	<brief_title>Dietary Lipids, Energy Expenditure and Obesity Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is a complex disease of multifactorial etiology and difficult to control. Among lifestyle changes proposed to the treatment of this disease and comorbidities, there is the modulation of dietary lipid composition. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the modulation of fatty acid (FA) polyunsaturated (PUFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) in energy expenditure (EE), weight loss, body composition, lipid and glycemic profile, free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol, adiponectin, leptin, blood pressure (BP), feeding behavior and expression of PPARα and PPARγ2 genes in adipose tissue (AT) of obese women. It was conducted a parallel, randomized, controlled, single-blind study with dietary intervention (DI) for 60 days, where 32 women with obesity classes I and II were distributed into three groups: G1 = diet rich in n-3 PUFA and n-6 (n = 10); G2 = MUFA-rich diet (n = 11); and G3 = control (n = 11). For G1 and G2 were prescribed normocaloric diets with similar macronutrient composition, varying only the type of lipids offered. In order to achieve the desired intake of unsaturated FA, both groups received individual portions of vegetable oils in the form of sachets, which were consumed for lunch and dinner (G1 = mix of virgin olive oil [VOO] and soybean oil [SO], overall of 35.2g to 52.8g / day; G2 = VOO, overall of 35.2g to 50.6 g / day), besides gelatin capsules (G1 = 2 g of fish oil / day; G2 = 1 capsule of 1g of SO / day). G3 was instructed to keep their eating habits and consuming placebos (1 sachet of 2g of SO and 1 capsule of 1g of SO / day).</detailed_description>
