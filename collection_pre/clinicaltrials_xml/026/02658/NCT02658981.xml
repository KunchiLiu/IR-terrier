	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the safety and best dose of anti-LAG-3 (anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016) or urelumab alone and in combination with nivolumab in treating patients with glioblastoma that has returned (recurrent). Anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016, urelumab, and nivolumab are antibodies (a type of protein) that may stimulate the cells in the immune system to attack tumor cells. It is not yet known whether anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 or urelumab alone or in combination with nivolumab may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-LAG-3 or Urelumab Alone and in Combination With Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine a maximum tolerated dose or maximum administrated dose of anti-lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) antibody (BMS-986016) (anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016) and anti-cluster of differentiation 137 (CD137) antibody (BMS- 663513) (urelumab) given independently and in combination with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody (nivolumab, BMS-936558) safely in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate overall survival. II. To estimate 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. III. To estimate radiographic response (radiographic assessment in neuro-oncology [RANO] and immunotherapy response assessment for neuro-oncology [iRANO]). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of anti-LAG-3 antibody (BMS-986016), anti-CD137 antibody (BMS- 663513), and/or anti-PD-1 antibody (BMS-936558) on biomarkers in peripheral blood, including the T cell compartments, and serum proteins (cytokines and other immune modulators). II. To assess the pharmacodynamic activity in tumor tissue and peripheral blood in treated subjects who undergo optional tumor biopsies. III. To explore potential associations between biomarker measures and anti-tumor activity by analyzing markers of inflammation, immune activation, host tumor growth factors, and tumor-derived proteins in the pre-treatment and on-treatment setting. IV. To further characterize the occupancy and immune cell function at multiple dose levels of anti-LAG-3 antibody (BMS-986016), anti-CD137 antibody (BMS-663513), and/or anti-PD-1 antibody (BMS-936558). OUTLINE: PART A: This is a dose-escalation study of the monotherapy of Anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 and Anti-CD137 (urelumab). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive anti-CD137 (urelumab) IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 15 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PART B: This is the dose-escalation combination therapy portion study of Anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 plus Anti-PD-1(nivolumab) and Anti-CD137 (urelumab) plus Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) IV over 60 minutes and anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 and urelumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60 days, every 2 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter. Patients taken off treatment for other reasons than disease progression are followed up every 2 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
