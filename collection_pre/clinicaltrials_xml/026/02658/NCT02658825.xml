	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of JNJ-63623872 on Cardiac Repolarization Interval in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two-part Phase 1 study consisting of a dose escalation part (Panel 1) and a thorough QT (TQT) part (Panel 2). Panel 1 will be a double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), placebo-controlled dose escalation study in healthy participants to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of JNJ-63623872 after administration of single doses of 2400 milligrams (mg) and 3000 mg under fasted conditions. The final dose to be used in the Panel 2 will be determined based on the results of this dose escalation part. An interim analysis will be conducted on Panel 1 to select the dose for Panel 2. Panel 2 will be a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, 3-period crossover (the same medications provided to all participants but in different sequence), placebo- and positive controlled study to evaluate the effect of JNJ-63623872 on the QT/QTc interval in healthy participants. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
