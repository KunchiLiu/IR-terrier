	<brief_summary>This study protocol will evaluate the efficacy of Bovie Medical's J-Plasma® helium based plasma technology in the reduction of lymphoceles following pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) during robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). The J-Plasma® handpiece will be used during the PLND by dissecting the lymph nodes and sealing the lymphatic channels to prevent lymph leakage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cold Plasma for the Reduction of Lymphoceles Following PLND</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants evaluated and scheduled for a PLND during Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy who have met the study inclusion criteria and who have also given informed consent will be enrolled. Enrolled participants will have their PLND performed using J-Plasma® for dissection and sealing of lymphatic channels. An abdominal-pelvic ultrasound will be completed at a follow-up period ranging from 4-12 weeks post operatively to determine if a lymphocele is present. The occurrence rate of lymphoceles in this trial group will be compared to retrospective data from the principal investigator's practice and other published data to determine if the occurrence rate has been reduced.</detailed_description>
