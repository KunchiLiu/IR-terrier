	<brief_summary>Glaucoma is a very frequent disease in Brittany. In glaucoma the retinal ganglion cells and their axons slowly die with visible changes at the optic nerve head (cupping). Without early diagnosis and effective treatment or with delayed treatment decrease of visual acuity or blindness become. In secondary pseudoexfoliation glaucoma grayish-white deposits of abnormal proteins are found on all surfaces of eye irrigated by the aqueous humor. The deposits of PEX material inside the trabecular meshwork decrease aqueous humour outflow and the intraocular pression raise. The exfoliation material is found on the surface of the lens capsule with frequent developement of nuclear cataract . After cataract surgery the intra ocular pressure (IOP) decrease. Some recent study have found decreasing ocular volume variation associated to IOP fluctuation in night after cataract surgery in normal pressure glaucoma patients. In our study we want see if it's the same thing in pseudoexfoliation glaucoma patients.</brief_summary>
