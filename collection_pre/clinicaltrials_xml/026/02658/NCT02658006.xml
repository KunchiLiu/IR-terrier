	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective observational cohort study is to evaluate multimodal monitoring technologies in the perioperative care of cardiac surgical patients. Right ventricular pressure tracings, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and transthoracic ultrasonography will be studied for their ability to detect and predict complications such as right ventricular failure, renal failure and respiratory failure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study has 4 main objectives: 1. To determine if right ventricular pressure tracings correlate with other indices of right ventricular failure and with positive fluid balance, renal failure and increased length of stay in the intensive care unit. 2. To determine the prevalence of portal vein pulsatility in the perioperative period and its association with right ventricular failure and positive fluid balance. 3. To determine if Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) values correlate with mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and with poorer post-operative prognosis. 4. To determine the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of respiratory complications of cardiac surgery using transthoracic ultrasonography.</detailed_description>
