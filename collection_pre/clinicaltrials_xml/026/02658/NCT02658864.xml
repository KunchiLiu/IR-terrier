	<brief_summary>This study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of oral lafutidine tablets and the effect of food on pharmacokinetics in healthy Chinese subjects. The tolerability and the effect of sex on the pharmacokinetic properties were also evaluated to acquire more pharmacokinetic information.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Properties and Effect of Food on Pharmacokinetic Properties of the Oral Lafutidine Tablets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study of single-dose was randomized, three-period, crossover. And in this study, 12 subjects were randomly assigned to 3 dose groups and received a single dose of 10mg, 20mg and 40mg lafutidine tablets. The washout period was 7 calendar days. In the multiple-dose, 12 subjects took lafutidine tablets of 10 mg twice a day for 6 consecutive days. In the food-effect study, 12 subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups. One group received a single dose of 10mg lafutidine tablets under fasted condition, while the other were in fed condition. The drug administrations were separated by a wash-out period of seven calendar days. In each study group, the male and the female are both in half of the subjects. Using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method to determine the plasma concentration of lafutidine. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the single compartment model.</detailed_description>
