	<brief_title>Prevention of Catheter Associated Lower Urinary Infections Using the Oxys Indwelling Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open randomized controlled trial of 4 weeks duration. The intervention is a novel urinary catheter with an electromagnetic therapy to prevent catheter associated infections. The catheter is used in patients which require longterm urinary catheterization over at least 1 month. The endpoint is bacteriological exam and the laboratory is blinded to the therapy status. Weekly urinary cultures are drawn and a sonication culture of the catheter tip is performed to detect and characterize the biofilm. A colonization rate of &gt;95% is anticipated in the control arm. Therefore a 50% reduction in colonization can be detected with 54 patients, a 90% reduction in colonization can be detected with 20 patients with a power of 0.9.</detailed_description>
