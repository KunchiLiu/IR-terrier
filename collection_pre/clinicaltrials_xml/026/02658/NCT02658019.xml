	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm phase II trial of Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in patients with advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary objective is to assess its therapeutic efficacy in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary endpoint is disease-control rate (DCR) defined as the proportion of patients achieving a best overall response of either a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) (that is maintained for at least 8 weeks). Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and toxicity profile of Pembrolizumab. The investigators will also evaluate the expression levels of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L-1) in tumor tissue, as well as serum titers of hepatitis B or C in patients with hepatitis B or C, respectively, for whom specimens are available.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be an open-label, single-institution, non-randomized, single-arm, Phase II study of pembrolizumab therapy in patients with advanced HCC. Patients will be treated in three-week cycles, with intravenous (IV) administration of pembrolizumab on day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Trial therapy will last until withdrawal of consent, disease progression and/or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. Correlative studies investigating PD-L-1 expression in tumor tissue will be assessed with clinical outcome. Peripheral blood will also be drawn to perform immunologic markers and hepatitis B or C viral titers. This is to determine if viral titers change with treatment. These studies are included for all patients who consent to the correlative studies (See Appendix F). There is an additional consent for the correlative studies. Up to 28 patients will be enrolled at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC). Investigators expect to enroll 10-12 patients per year based on the institution's enrollment capacity. Expected time to complete total accrual is approximately 1.5 years. Expected time to study completion is 3 years from date open to enrollment to allow for survival data. An interim analysis is planned after 14 evaluable patients are assessed for DCR to determine whether to continue with an additional 14 more.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have diagnosis of advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) by one of the following: Histopathology Elevated serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) &gt;400 ng/ml and findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans characteristic of HCC Findings on triple phase MRI or CT scans characteristic of HCC in patients with cirrhosis and tumors at least 1 cm or greater, without a curative treatment option (transplant, resection, or ablation). 2. Measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 (provided in Section 14.0). 3. Radiographic progression on previously treated areas (as defined by RECIST v1.1). 4. Subject refusal for sorafenib treatment or intolerance to sorafenib are also allowed (intolerance is defined as ≥ 28 days of sorafenib (not necessarily consecutive) or ≥grade 3 toxicity due to sorafenib which does not resolve with appropriate supportive care). 5. Patients should have failed at least one prior systemic therapy regimen which could include sorafenib. Patients may have progressed on sorafenib, been intolerant of, or refused sorafenib. Patients who are documented to refuse systemic chemotherapy or sorafenib are also eligible. No limit to prior systemic therapy. Prior locoregional therapy such as surgery, radiofrequency ablation or transarterial chemoembolization are also allowed, provided that progression has been documented after these therapies, and ≥4 weeks have elapsed since the last therapy; (these will not be counted as systemic therapy). 6. ChildPugh Classification with score ≤ 7 points. See Appendix G for criteria. 7. Age ≥ 18 years 8. Estimated life expectancy, in the judgement of the Investigator, of at least ≥ 12 weeks. 9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. See Appendix C. 10. Adequate bone marrow function as defined below: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.2 x 10^9/L, platelets (PLT) ≥ 50 x 10^9/L 11. Adequate liver function as defined below: serum bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl Aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT) ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), Alanine transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 5 x ULN 12. Adequate coagulation as defined by: serum prothrombin time (PT) ≤ 16 seconds 13. Adequate renal function as defined by one of the following: serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR (measured or calculated) Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min for patients with serum creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN. 14. Suitable venous access to allow for all studyrelated blood sampling. 15. Female subject of childbearing potential (CBP) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 3 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. 16. Females of child bearing potential that are sexually active must agree to either practice 2 medically accepted highly effective methods of contraception at the same time or abstain from heterosexual intercourse from the time of signing the informed consent through 120 days after the last dose of study drug. See Appendix H for protocolapproved highly effective methods of contraceptive combinations. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. 17. Negative test for pregnancy is required of females of childbearing potential; A female of child bearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months or 730 days). 18.
