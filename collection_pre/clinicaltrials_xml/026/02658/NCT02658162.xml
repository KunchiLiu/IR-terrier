	<brief_title>A Study on SANGUINATEâ„¢ for the Reduction of Delayed Graft Function in Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty (60) adult subjects who will be recipients of a donation after brain death (DBD) donor kidney and who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 within 48 hours prior to transplant surgery to receive: two infusions of SANGUINATE at a dose of 320 mg/kg or placebo on the day of surgery and approximately 24 hours after surgery. Patients will be hospitalized for up to 5 days and the study duration will be 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Able to understand and provide written informed consent. 2. Male or female subject at least 18 years of age. 3. Dialysisdependent renal failure initiated at least 3 months prior to transplantation. 4. Subject is to be the recipient of a first kidney transplant from a deceased donor (brain death criteria). 5. Is able to receive intravenous infusions of study drug. 6. Anticipated donor organ cold ischemia time &lt; 30 hours. 7. A calculated prediction of DGF risk of least 25%. 8. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 forms of effective birth control regimen (at least onebarrier method) during the initial 30day study period. 9. Male subjects must agree to use condoms or other suitable means of pregnancy prevention. 1. Has received a blood transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC), other than with leukocytepoor blood, within the 90day period prior to screening. 2. Recipient of a live donor kidney or a kidney from a donation after cardiac death (DCD) donor. 3. Recipient of donor kidney preserved with normothermic machine perfusion. 4. Is scheduled to undergo multiorgan transplantation. 5. Has planned transplant of kidney(s) from a donor &lt; 6 years of age. 6. Has planned transplant of kidneys that are implanted en bloc (dual kidney transplant). 7. Has planned transplant of dual kidneys (from the same donor) transplanted not en bloc. 8. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 38 kg/m2 9. Machine perfused preservation donor kidney. 10. Is scheduled for transplantation of a kidney from a donor who is known to have received an investigational therapy (under another Investigational New Drug) for ischemic/reperfusion injury immediately prior to organ recovery. 11. Is scheduled to receive an blood typeincompatible donor kidney. 12. Has undergone desensitization to remove antibodies prior to transplantation. 13. Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg per dL, transaminase more than twice the upper limit of normal or evidence of hepatic insufficiency 14. Has participated in an investigational study within the last 30 days or received an investigational product within 5 halflives of the study drug administration, whichever is longest. Potential subjects participating in a strictly observational study or a study involving approved treatments should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 15. Has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 16. History or presence of active substance abuse (illicit drugs or alcohol) in the previous 6 months, as believed by the Investigator 17. Presence of ECGbased evidence of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, third degree heart block or cardiac arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic instability 18. History or presence of any disease or psychiatric condition that in the Investigator's assessment that would increase the risk to subjects associated with study participation, drug administration or interpretation of results 19. History of biopsyconfirmed malignancy within 5 years of randomization, with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma in situ skin lesions, carcinoma of the cervix in situ, or early detected prostate cancer. 20. Female subject who is pregnant or breast feeding. 21. Has a positive T or Bcell crossmatch by NIH antiglobulin lymphocytotoxicity method, if performed. 22. Has a positive T or Bcell crossmatch AND donor specific antihuman leukocyte antigen (antiHLA) antibody (DSA) detected by flow cytometry/Luminex based antigenspecific antiHLA antibody testing, if performed.</criteria>
