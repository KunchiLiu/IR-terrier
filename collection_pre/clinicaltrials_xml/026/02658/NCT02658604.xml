	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Several examples in the literature describe the types of medication management issues uncovered during the course of home-based medication reviews. For example, the investigators previously reported the outcomes of home medication reviews of 43 homebound community pharmacy patients, finding that 58% of patients were keeping medications in the home that were expired, duplicates of other current medications, or no longer therapeutically appropriate. Many of these issues, due to their nature, could be considered to be "hidden", i.e. issues that are unlikely to be adequately detected or resolved during the course of routine interactions between patients and pharmacists in the community pharmacy setting. Currently, only homebound patients in Ontario are eligible to receive government-funded home medication review services from pharmacists. This limitation in funding eligibility is problematic as it reduces the likelihood that non-homebound patients will receive home medication reviews, even though this population may also benefit from these services. Indeed, evidence in the literature is not limited exclusively to homebound patients, and suggests that non-homebound patients are also at risk from home-centered medication management issues and may also benefit from home medication reviews. PURPOSE: Our study aims to characterize the prevalence and nature of "hidden in the home" medication management issues in non-homebound patients. To our knowledge, this study would be the first of its kind to focus specifically on this patient population and lend direct evidence in support of expanding funding of home medication review services in Ontario to include non-homebound patients. HYPOTHESIS: A subset of ambulatory, non-homebound patients who regularly attend community pharmacies are affected by medication management issues that cannot be adequately identified and resolved during the course of a typical medication review taking place within the pharmacy. These patients would benefit from a full medication review taking place in their own homes, similar to what is presently provided under Ontario's MedsCheck at Home program, for which only homebound patients in Ontario are eligible. RESEARCH QUESTIONS/OBJECTIVES: 1. What is the frequency of, and what type(s) and severity of, drug-related problems are detected during pharmacist visits to patients' homes who would not otherwise qualify for a MedsCheck at Home service? 2. Based on the findings from this study, which criteria would best assist community pharmacists in identifying ambulatory patients who may stand to benefit most from a home-based medication review?</brief_summary>
