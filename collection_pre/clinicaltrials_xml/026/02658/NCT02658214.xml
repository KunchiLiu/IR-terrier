	<brief_title>Durvalumab and Tremelimumab in Combination With First-Line Chemotherapy in Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will screen approximately 100 patients in order to have a total of approximately 80 evaluable patients in 5 cohorts of first-line chemotherapy regimens combined with durvalumab + tremelimumab. This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab in combination with first line chemotherapy regimens in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors: ovarian/peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and gastric/gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥18 years at the time of screening 2. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization 4. Patients with histologically or cytologically documented chemotherapynaive locally advanced unresectable or metastatic ovarian/peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer, SCCHN, TNBC, SCLC, and gastric cancer/GEJ. 4a. SCCHN patients who are candidates for definitive chemoradiation are not eligible to participate. 4b. Gastric/GEJ cancer is defined as HER2 negative adenocarcinoma (not eligible for antiHER2 therapy). 5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 6. At least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline 7. No prior exposure to immunemediated therapy 8. Adequate organ and marrow function 1. Receipt of any investigational anticancer therapy within 28 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study treatment 2. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression unless asymptomatic or treated and stable off steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 1 month prior to study treatment 3. Any unresolved Grade ≥2 toxicity from previous anticancer therapy 4. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders 5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs from study drugs, or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent 6. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥470 ms 20. Active tuberculosis 7. Active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</criteria>
