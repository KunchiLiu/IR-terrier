	<brief_title>The Application of Ticagrelor Combined With Low Molecular Weight Heparin During PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ticagrelor is a new drug compared with clopidogrel. It has a stronger antiplatelet capacity. After PCI，whether using low molecular weight heparin can make patients better prognosis or not, What's more，full amount or half amount low molecular weight heparin?, also investigators want to explore that whether it may lead to more bleeding events.</detailed_description>
