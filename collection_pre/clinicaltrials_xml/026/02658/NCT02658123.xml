	<brief_summary>Preventing complications and readmission after ostomy surgery will decrease the cost of healthcare, improve patient safety, reduce the cost of durable medical equipment required by ostomates, ensure continued specialized care is available, and potentially improve both short and long-term quality of life (QOL) for patients by reducing morbidity and mortality associated with ostomy surgery. The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of patient centered interventions/care pathways and to determine the impact on healthcare utilization, 30-day hospital readmissions, and QOL.</brief_summary>
