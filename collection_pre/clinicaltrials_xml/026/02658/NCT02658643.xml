	<brief_title>Analysis of Biliodigestive Anastomosis Techniques (BDA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study is to determine the benefit-risk ratio (success rate, complication rate, tolerance) for patients with biliodigestive anastomosis by either continuous or interrupted suture. A biliodigestive anastomosis is a surgical connection between the common bile duct (ductus choledochus) and the digestive tract to prevent interference of bile flow. Indications for a biliodigestive anastomosis include total or partial resection of the pancreas and duodenum (PPPD, Whipple procedure) for pancreatic tumors, tumors of the biliary tract or duodenum, and biliary tract reconstructions during liver transplantation or advanced liver resections. Furthermore a biliodigestive anastomosis can be required to manage the injury of the biliary tract and infectious and traumatic structures of the biliary tract. Biliodigestive anastomoses can be performed by continuous or interrupted suture. The aim of this study is to determine the difference between continuous and interrupted suture for biliodigestive anastomoses, as advantages and disadvantages of each technique have not been determined. Only patients receiving their first biliodigestive anastomosis will be included.</detailed_description>
