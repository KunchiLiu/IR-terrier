	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study Investigating Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Ascending Doses of Lu AE04621 in Parkinson Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dosing regimen will be decided at a dosing conference prior to cohort 2-8. Dose levels can be increased, maintained or reduced both between cohorts but also within same cohort. In each cohort 3 patients with Parkinson's Disease will be treated for 3 days, with increasing dose each day. If deemed appropriate the dosing period may be extended to 4 days. In addition, 3 extra cohorts 9 to 11 are additional cohorts that might be used, if necessary to address the study objectives. Up to 33 patients can be enrolled</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient is diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson Disease (consistent with the UK Parkinson`s Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria for the Diagnosis of PD). The patient's Hoehn and Yahr Staging score is ≤ 3 in the "ON" state. The patient experiences motor fluctuations with at least 2.5 hours of "OFF" periods in the awake time and has predictable morning "OFF" episodes, which have been consistent within the past 4 weeks. The patient currently has a good response to LDOPA and has been receiving a stable dose of LDOPA (≥3 doses per day of standard LDOPA or ≥3 doses per day of Carbidopa and LDOPA, ExtendedRelease Capsules) during at least four weeks prior to screening. The patient has cognitive impairment, defined as a Mini Mental State Examination(MMSE) score ≤ 26 at the Screening Visit. The patient has severe disabling dyskinesia The patient takes or has taken disallowed recent or concomitant medication (CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP 3A4 substrate, Dopamine agonists, 5 HT3 antagonists, Antiviral (Amantadine)) Other protocol defined inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
