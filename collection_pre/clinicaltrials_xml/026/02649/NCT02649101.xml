	<brief_title>Thalidomide Plus Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone for Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compares the combination of thalidomide and chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone for the treatment of stage IV breast cancer. Efficacy and safety of the chemotherapy-thalidomide combination will be evaluated. Assessing the isolated effects of thalidomide in a setting where pre and post treatment serum specimens can be obtained will provide essential information about the mechanisms by which vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) inhibition affects tumor growth, and represents an ideal opportunity to evaluate the molecular effects of thalidomide on breast tumor.</detailed_description>
