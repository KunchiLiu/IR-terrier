	<brief_summary>This trial will investigate the combination of two anti-cancer agents to treat patients with relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and ovarian cancers. Oral topotecan has US FDA approval for treating select gynecological cancers and SCLC. LCL161 is an investigational product that has been shown in clinical trials to work together with other anti-cancer agents. In this trial, investigators will determine the optimal dose of LCL161 and topotecan to administer to patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC and ovarian cancers, and examine the safety profile of the drug combination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LCL161 Plus Topotecan for Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer and Select Gynecologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized dose-escalation study of oral LCL161 administered in combination with oral topotecan. Topotecan is US FDA approved for treating metastatic ovarian cancer, stage IV-B cervical cancer, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). LCL161, an investigational product, is an oral small-molecule antagonist of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Preclinical data suggests that IAP antagonists work in synergy with other anti-cancer agents. This study is designed to evaluate the combination of these two agents in patients with SCLC and ovarian cancers where treatment with topotecan would be appropriate. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In the dose-escalation part of the study, patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC and gynecologic malignancies will be eligible for enrollment to determine the optimal dose of the drug combination to be administered. Patients can continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose-expansion part of the study is limited to patients with ovarian cancer and relapsed/refractory SCLC (2 cohorts with 12 patients each) to further assess safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity. Up to 52 patients are planned for enrollment at 3 centers in the U.S.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>KEY POINTS: Dose Escalation Portion: Must have histological diagnosis of relapsed/refractory SCLC or gynecological malignancy for which topotecan would be indicated. Dose Expansion Portion: Must have histological diagnosis of relapsed/refractory SCLC or ovarian cancer for which topotecan would be indicated. Patients with ovarian cancer must have evidence of recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and must have previously received a platinum and taxanebased chemotherapy regimen. Patients with SCLC must have received platinumbased chemotherapy. Measurable or nonmeasurable (but evaluable) disease Adequate organ function Life expectancy â‰¥ 12 weeks. Patients with brain metastases may be enrolled if radiation and/or surgery have been completed and a serial evaluation by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging over 2 months demonstrates stable disease. More than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens given in the metastatic setting. Patients who are currently receiving certain medications that cannot be discontinued prior to starting study drug (including but not limited to: corticosteroids, chronic immunosuppressive treatment, CYP2C8 inhibitors, CYP3A substrates.) Clinically significant heart disease. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for at least 6 months after study treatment.</criteria>
