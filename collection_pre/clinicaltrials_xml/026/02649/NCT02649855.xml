	<brief_summary>Background: Metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the prostate area. It can be controlled by lowering the amount of testosterone in the body. This is called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The vaccine PROSTVAC might help the immune system kill cancer cells. Researchers want to add PROSTVAC and docetaxel chemotherapy to ADT. They think this may work better against prostate cancer than ADT alone. Objective: To test if adding PROSTVAC and docetaxel to ADT works better against prostate cancer than ADT alone. Eligibility: Men ages 18 years and over with metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer Design: Participants will be screened with: Physical exam Medical history Blood tests Possible CT, MRI, or bone scan: Participants lie in a machine. The machine takes pictures of the body. Electrocardiogram: Soft electrodes are stuck to the skin to record heart signals. Participants will have 2 optional tumor biopsies during the study. Participants will join 1 of 2 groups. Both groups will get: ADT Docetaxel by vein Steroids by mouth or vein before each docetaxel infusion PROSTVAC injection Both groups first have ADT. One to 4 months after, they have: Group A: Docetaxel every 3 weeks for 6 cycles PROSTVAC 3 weeks after the last infusion Booster injections 2 weeks later and then every 3 weeks, for 6 boosters total Group B: PROSTVAC Booster 2 weeks later Docetaxel hours later Docetaxel and the booster every 3 weeks for 6 cycles Participants will have a visit 4-5 weeks after the last treatment. They will then have visits every 12 weeks. Participants will be followed for up to 15 years. This includes physical exams every year for 5 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel and PROSTVAC for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - A phase III trial demonstrated that combining docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly improved survival (57.6 vs 44.0 months (HR=0.56, (0.44-0.70), p &lt;0.0001) for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). - PROSTVAC (developed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] and licensed to Bavarian Nordic Immunotherapeutics, Mountain View, CA) is a therapeutic cancer vaccine for prostate cancer. Early studies have demonstrated immunologic efficacy and suggested clinical benefit. A phase III trial has completed accrual. - Preclinical and clinical studies support the potential synergy in the combination of docetaxel and PROSTVAC. The potential to combine docetaxel with vaccine in mCSPC could improve upon the survival advantage that has been previously seen. Objectives: Primary -To determine if PROSTVAC combined with docetaxel is able to induce greater antigen spreading (i.e. a broader immune response) with greater associated response score compared to docetaxel alone after 19 weeks. Key Eligibility Criteria: - Must have castrate sensitive prostate cancer (rising PSA and testosterone over 100) or is within 134 days of starting ADT (Arm A or B) or within 28 days of start ADT (Arm C) - Histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer - Patients must have metastatic disease - Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the ECOG criteria - Patients must have adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function Design - This is a randomized trial of ADT followed by simultaneous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3 weeks x 6 cycles + PROSTVAC q3 weeks x 6 cycles versus ADT followed by sequential docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3 weeks x 6 cycles followed by PROSTVAC q3 weeks x 6 cycles in men with newly diagnosed mCSPC. - Patients who have not started ADT or who have been on ADT for less than 28 days will be assigned to treatment with PROSTVAC for 6 injections followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 q3 weeks x 6 cycles.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer by the Laboratory of Pathology of thE NCI or Pathology Department of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is required prior to entering this study. Patients must have metastatic disease, defined as at least one lesion on bone scan or at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than or equal to 10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. (Patients who have metastatic disease by these criteria prior to ADT, but then have changes after ADT that diminish the size of these lesions or changes on bone scan are still eligible.) Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the ECOG criteria Patients must have adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function with: ANC greater than or equal to 1500/microL, without CSF support Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL AST(SGOT) less than or equal to 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN); Total serum bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), OR in patients with Gilbert s syndrome, a total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0) Serum albumin greater than or equal to 2.8 g/dL Serum phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and potassium greater than or equal to LLN Lipase &lt; 2.0 times the upper limit of normal and no radiologic or clinical evidence of pancreatitis Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional upper limits of normal OR Creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 50 ml/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal by 24 hour urine. Willing to travel to the NIH for followup visits 18 years of age or older. Able to understand and sign informed consent. May have had up to 24 months of ADT (testosterone suppression therapy in the nonmetastatic setting) and are at least 12 months removed from treatment Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception, prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion. Sexually active subjects and their female partners must agree to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must also agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control during the course on the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
