	<brief_summary>RADIANCE-HTN is a randomized, double-blind, sham controlled, 2-cohort study (TRIO and SOLO) designed to demonstrate efficacy and document the safety of the Paradise Renal Denervation System in two distinct populations of hypertensive subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the ReCor Medical Paradise System in Clinical Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with essential hypertension controlled on 1 or 2 antihypertensive medications or uncontrolled on 0-2 antihypertensive medications will be included in the RADIANCE Solo cohort while subjects with treatment resistant hypertension on a minimum of 3 antihypertensive medications will be included in the RADIANCE Trio cohort. Prior to randomization, subjects will be hypertensive in the absence of hypertension medication (SOLO) or despite the presence of a stabilized, single pill, triple, fixed dose antihypertensive medication regimen (TRIO).</detailed_description>
