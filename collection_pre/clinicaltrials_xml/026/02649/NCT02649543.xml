	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to compare infection rates between primary, delayed primary and vacuum assisted closures in contaminated and dirty/infected laparotomy wounds. Social, demographic, surgical, postsurgical and medical variables were registered. A descriptive analysis expressed as total and percentages, medians and interquartile ranges.
