	<brief_summary>Whole body vibration (WBV) can help to improve muscle flexibility by stimulating the neuromuscular functions. But there is a dearth in the literature to prove its effectiveness in improving the flexibility of the upper limb muscles. Therefore the purpose of the study is to determine the effects of vibration on improving upper limb flexibility. This experimental research will be conducted by recruiting participants at the age of 19 to 27 with no histories of injuries on the upper limb. They will be randomly assigned into two groups; experimental (with vibration) and control (no vibration) group. The WBV machine will be used to provide vibration to the upper extremities by placing both palms on the vibration platform. The outcome measure of active chest flexibility and shoulder reach flexibility will be performed pre and post vibration.</brief_summary>
