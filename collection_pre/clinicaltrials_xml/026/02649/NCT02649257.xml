	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to observe the axial IOL rotation after surgery with a capsular tension ring (CTR) and a MC6125 AS IOL. At the end of surgery the orientation of the IOL is documented with a short video clip via the operating microscope unit. Follow-up examinations are performed 1 hour, 1 week and 6 months after surgery. Rotational stability of the IOL is assessed using retroillumination images with a method to avoid bias from cyclorotation or head tilt.</brief_summary>
