	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Resin Sealants: Retrospective Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A population presenting 1st/2nd permanent molars with sealed occlusal surfaces were considered. Dental records were reviewed for: patient's caries risk (High/Low); operator experience (scores 1 to 4, beginners to seniors); number of follow-up visits; isolation procedure; sealant/tooth type; and age at placement. Posteriorly, the patients were called to dental evaluation and the sealed teeth were classified regarding the sealant presence, partial presence or absence, with or without caries, or sealant replacement to a restorative material in Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory, considering the caries presence/absence. Successful outcome was considered in the caries absence.</detailed_description>
