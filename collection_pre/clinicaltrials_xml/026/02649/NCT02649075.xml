	<brief_title>To Evaluate SBI in the Dietary Management of Mild to Moderate Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, pilot study evaluating SBI 10 g BID compared to matching placebo for 12 weeks followed by a 12 week open-label extension SBI 10 g BID (EnteraGam) in the dietary management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease. The effect of SBI will be evaluated on Crohn's disease related symptoms and inflammation symptom control as measured by Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) scores and plasma and stool markers of inflammation. The patient's quality of life will also be assessed as an indicator of disease state.</detailed_description>
