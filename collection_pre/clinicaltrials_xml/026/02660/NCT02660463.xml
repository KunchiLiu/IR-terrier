	<brief_summary>The incidence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) after acute pulmonary embolism ist not clear. It is estimated to be up to 3.8%. Prospective data registration does not exist. Treatment of choice is pulmonary endarterectomy if the thromboembolic lesions are surgically accessible. Otherwise interventional therapy by means of pulmonary balloon-angioplasty (BPA) or medical therapy is indicated. In Germany, the majority of the patients is referred to three CTEPH centers: Kerckhoff Clinic, Saarland University Hospital and Hannover Medical School to evaluate the therapeutic options. Starting in January 2016 all incident patients will be de-identified and included prospectively. Risk factors, outcome and treatment will be documented.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Registry to Evaluate the Effective Incidence of Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension in Germany</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients referred to the participating centers will be diagnosed in a standardized manner to confirm the diagnosis "CTEPH". No additional intervention or blood sampling is necessary. The recommended treatment option is the result of weekly CTEPH conferences. Every patient will be discussed. The registry contains the following data: Center PLZ Sex Age Body Mass Index History of venous thromboembolism (VTE), Date ff 1st VTE Anticoagulation and type of anticoagulation Blood group V/Q scan CT-agiography Pulmonary angiogram World Health Organisation-Functional Class six-minute walk distance Right heart catheter: RAP, PAPs, PAPd, PAPm, PAWP, CO, CI, PVR, SvO2 Treatment: PEA, Ballon Pulmonary Angioplasty (BPA), medically therapy, Vena cava filter CTEPH special risk factors: thrombophilia, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, splenectomy, VA shunt; pacemakers</detailed_description>
