	<brief_summary>This is an prospective open label pilot study conducted over 32 weeks. A total of 25 eligible participants who are infected with HCV and HIV will be recruited from 2 Canadian HIV Trials Network (CTN) sites (Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and McGill University Health Centre) This study is looking into the effectiveness of a combination of Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir Alafenamide Single Tablet Regimen (E/C/F/TAF STR) for HIV treatment and Harvoni for HCV treatment . This study will assess the effect that the study drug has on the metabolism of sugar, the changes in fat in the bloodstream and other metabolic changes. Metabolism is the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat. This study may provide information on the impact of liver fibrosis (scarring of liver tissues) on metabolic changes before, during and after HCV antiviral therapy. Drug-drug interactions (DDI) DDI between E/C/F/TAF and LPV-SOF have been well evaluated and no clinically significant interactions have been identified. A switch to E/C/F/TAF in the context of LPV-SOF HCV antiviral treatment preparation may be particularly beneficial because of its: 1. favorable side effect profile 2. once daily STR formulation 3. known DDI profile with LPV-SOF 4. neutral effect on liver fibrosis 5. improved kidney and bone safety profile with the use of TAF Conduct of this study is justified as it: 1. Assesses a minimal pill count and dosing frequency strategy of co-treatment of HIV and HCV using well tolerated medications with an excellent safety profile and known DDI profile. 2. Provides additional safety data for TAF in the HIV-HCV co-infected population. 3. Quantifies adherence and identifies obstacles to full adherence in this population. There is a paucity of data related to DAA adherence in licensing studies. 4. Provides real-world safety and efficacy data to support the public funding for LPV-SOF DAA therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected populations. 5. Provides preliminary data on the immunologic and metabolic consequences of HCV clearance in HIV-HCV co-infection 6. As a pilot study, the information gathered will inform the feasibility of future clinical trials evaluating novel treatment strategies for HIV-HCV co-infected patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV Drug Switch Followed by HCV Therapy in HIV-HCV Co-Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The availability of interferon (IFN)-free HCV Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) antiviral therapy such as Ledipasvir-Sofosbuvir (LPV-SOF) allows for broad provision of treatment for populations living with HIV-HCV. Co-infected persons frequently have competing co-morbidities and are at risk for progressive liver disease which makes adherence and combined management of HIV and HCV challenging. Simple, safe, well tolerated regimens with few drug-drug interactions could be highly beneficial in ensuring success of HCV therapy in this population. With this is mind, the optimal management of antiretroviral therapy prior to initiating LPV-SOF treatment remains unclear. E/C/F/TAF [elvitegravir-cobicistat-emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumerate (TAF)] will be assessed in this study because it is formulated as a single tablet which facilitates adherence by once daily dosing and reduced pill count. It is established to be affective at achieving and maintaining HIV virologic suppression. The safety profile of this HIV regimen is excellent. The E/C/F/TAF formulation assessed in this study will contain TAF. This formulation has been evaluated in HIV-infected populations and found to be of equivalent HIV antiviral activity and to have improved impact on renal and bone metabolism [ref: David Wohl, Anton Pozniak, Melanie Thompson, Edwin DeJesus, Daniel Podzamczer, Jean-Michel Molina, Gordon Crofoot, Christian Callebaut, Hal Martin, Scott McCallister. Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) in a Single-Tablet Regimen in Initial HIV-1 Therapy. Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. 113LB. February 23-26, 2015, Seattle, Washington.]. There is minimal safety data in HIV-HCV co-infection. Drug-drug interactions (DDI) between HIV antiretrovirals and HCV antivirals remain a key obstacle to the safe and effective delivery. The DDI between E/C/F/TAF and LPV-SOF have been well evaluated and no clinically significant interactions have been identified. A switch to E/C/F/TAF in the context of LPV-SOF HCV antiviral treatment preparation may be particularly beneficial because of its: 1. favorable side effect profile 2. once daily STR formulation 3. known DDI profile with LPV-SOF 4. neutral effect on liver fibrosis 5. improved kidney and bone safety profile with the use of TAF Conduct of this study is justified as it: 1. Assesses a minimal pill count and dosing frequency strategy of co-treatment of HIV and HCV using well tolerated medications with an excellent safety profile and known DDI profile (Complera followed by LPV-SOF). Polypharmacy in the co-infected population remains a significant challenge to therapeutic success. 2. Provides additional safety data for TAF in the HIV-HCV co-infected population. 3. Quantifies adherence and identifies obstacles to full adherence in this population. There is a paucity of data related to DAA adherence in licensing studies. 4. Provides real-world safety and efficacy data to support the public funding for LPV-SOF DAA therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected populations. 5. Provides preliminary data on the immunologic and metabolic consequences of HCV clearance in HIV-HCV co-infection 6. As a pilot study, the information gathered will inform the feasibility of future clinical trials evaluating novel treatment strategies for HIV-HCV co-infected patients.</detailed_description>
