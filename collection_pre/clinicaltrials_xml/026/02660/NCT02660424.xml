Ambulatory with osteoarthritis of the knee with symptoms for at least 6 months and pain on the majority of days for the past 30 days. Symptoms must include knee joint pain. In subjects with bilateral knee osteoarthritis, the more symptomatic knee will be considered the index knee. Radiographic evidence of at least one tibiofemoral osteophyte in the index knee within 12 months before the Day 1 Visit. WOMAC pain subscale score History in the past 10 years of reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis or fibromyalgia.

History of cardiac dysrhythmias requiring antiarrythmia treatment(s). History of abnormal laboratory results ≥2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) indicative of any significant medical disease which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude the subjects participation in the study. A known or clinically suspected infection with human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B or C viruses. Other serious, acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness that in the judgment of the investigator could compromise subject safety, limit the subject's ability to complete the study and/or compromise the objectives of the study.
