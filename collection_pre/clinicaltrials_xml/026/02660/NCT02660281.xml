	<brief_title>URMC Related Haplo-identical Donor BMT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a single-center treatment protocol with four possible preparative regimens, designed to validate the process of related donor haploidentical-SCT at the Wilmot Cancer Institute Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit. Enrolled patients will receive chemotherapy +/- radiation as a pre-transplant conditioning regimen. Patients will then receive haploidentical stem cells, either bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood, followed by GvHD prophylaxis that will include cyclophosphamide. Multiple data points will be collected prior to, during, and following transplantation to ensure safety of the process and to evaluate the stated objectives.</detailed_description>
