	<brief_title>A Qualitative Study to Assess the Content Validity of the Prescription Opioid Misuse and Abuse Questionnaire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested, as part of a post-marketing requirement (PMR) for new drug application (NDA) holders of extended release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids, to conduct a study to develop and validate a measure of the opioid-related adverse events misuse and abuse among patients with chronic pain prescribed long-term opioid therapy. This measure will be used to assess misuse and abuse in PMR Study 2065-1A and PMR Study 2065-4B. Currently, no tool exists to meet this need except for the Self-report Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Prescription (Rx) Opioids questionnaire (SR-MAD) which has undergone several rounds of prior content validation. The SR-MAD has been modified to meet the needs of PMR Studies 2065-1A and 2065-4B, and has been renamed the Prescription Opioid Misuse and Abuse Questionnaire (POMAQ). This study will seek to further develop and validate the POMAQ using the the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry, Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims (FDA 2009) as a reference for conducting qualitative research throughout the process of instrument development to ensure the content validity of a measure and to evaluate the comprehensibility of included questions. This qualitative study to evaluate content validity will be conducted prior to the quantitative study to evaluate construct validity</detailed_description>
