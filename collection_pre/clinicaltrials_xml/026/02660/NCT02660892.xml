	<brief_summary>Threonine is an indispensable amino acid, which is required for human growth and protein synthesis. Deficiency in threonine can affect small intestine growth due to its structural importance in the intestinal protein mucin. While Threonine is found in many foods, deficiency can occur in developing countries where nutrition is primarily plant based, and low in available protein. Ensuring that the dietary intake is sufficient to meet the minimum threshold for growth and development is important for population health. Using a new technique called Indicator Amino Acid Oxidation (IAAO), threonine requirements will be determined in school-aged children (6-10y). The study will help to determine the minimum amount of threonine that is needed to ensure that dietary recommended guidelines are sufficient to meet the needs of this population. Current dietary recommended intake is 19 mg/kg-d in this population, but is based on factorial calculations. Secondary aims will determine the metabolic availability of threonine from food. Protein isolate from food sources (Casein, Soy protein, Pea protein) will be used to provide threonine in place of crystalline amino acids. The IAAO method will be used to determine the amount of oxidation that occurs with known quantities of threonine in food compared to crystalline amino acids, which are regarded as being 100% available. The investigators hypothesize that the threonine requirement in healthy children will be higher than the current dietary recommendation of 19 mg/kg-d. Investigators also hypothesize that Casein will have a higher metabolic availability than either Soy protein isolate, or Pea protein isolate.</brief_summary>
