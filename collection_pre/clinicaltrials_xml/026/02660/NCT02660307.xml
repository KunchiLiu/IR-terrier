Methods: Participants with stress complaints were recruited and randomized into two groups: group 1 (G1) received the intervention while group 2 (G2) did not. Both groups were evaluated before the intervention (time 1 - T1); again after the eight weeks of the program for G1 (time 2 - T2); and then at the end of a second eight-week period during which G2 received the intervention and G1 was simply instructed to maintain the practice they had learned without further instruction (time 3- T3).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Stress Reduction Program for Companies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disorders resulting from chronic stress are some of the main causes of absenteeism and reduced productivity in companies. A number of successful stress management programs are based on the principle of mindfulness and may help individuals to relieve stress symptoms and to improve well-being and pro-social behavior. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a weekly one-hour stress reduction program adapted for companies and if the possible benefits would be sustained 8 weeks after the end of the program. Participants with stress complaints were recruited in two companies and they were randomized into two groups: in the first period of the study, group 1 (G1) N=23 received the intervention while group 2 (G2) N=18 did not. Both groups were evaluated before the intervention (time 1 - T1); again after the eight weeks of the program for G1 (time 2 - T2); and then at the end of a second eight-week period during which G2 received the intervention and G1 was simply instructed to maintain the practice they had learned without further instruction (time 3- T3).</detailed_description>
