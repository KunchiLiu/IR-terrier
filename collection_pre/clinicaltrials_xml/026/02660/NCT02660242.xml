	<brief_title>The Use of Mini-dose Glucagon to Prevent Exercise-induced Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the protocol is to determine if the administration of mini-dose glucagon administered subcutaneously just before exercise produces better glucose stability than no adjustments for moderate intensity exercise in patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). It will also be assessed whether mini-dose glucagon before exercise produces better glucose stability than basal insulin reductions or extra carbohydrate consumption. This is a randomized, 4-way crossover trial. The trial will include 16 participants who complete the study. Each participant will undergo four aerobic exercise sessions (in random order), with different strategies for glucose regulation: - Control Trial: Fasted exercise, no basal insulin reduction - Strategy 1: Fasted exercise, basal insulin reduction only (50% reduction in basal rate at 60 minutes before exercise, for the duration of the exercise) - Strategy 2: Fasted exercise, no basal adjustment + pre-exercise glucose tabs (buccal route-40 grams in total ) - Strategy 3: Fasted exercise, no basal adjustment + pre-exercise mini-dose glucagon (sc) In all 4 sessions, aerobic exercise will be performed in the fasted state (before a standardized meal) for 45 minuets at ~50-55% of the participant's per-determined aerobic capacity. The participant's pump will be blinded during the control trial, strategy 1, and strategy 3 and an injection of saline will be given during the control trial and strategy 1 so that participant is blinded to strategy. The primary outcome for this study will be the glycemic response during exercise and early recovery.</detailed_description>
