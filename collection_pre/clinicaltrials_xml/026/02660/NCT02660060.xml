	<brief_summary>The present study was conducted to find out whether the bioavailability of 0.25 mg pramipexole tablets produced by PT Dexa Medica for PT Ferron Par Pharmaceuticals was equivalent to the reference drug (Sifrol® tablet 0.25 mg, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany for Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Germany).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Two Formulations of Pramipexole Tablets 0.25 mg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, open label, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study under fasting condition. The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast and in the next morning were given orally one tablet of the test drug (Pramipexole 0.25 mg produced by PT Dexa Medica for PT Ferron Par Pharmaceuticals) or one tablet of the reference drug (Sifrol® 0.25 mg, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany for Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Germany). Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), at 20, 40 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours after drug administration. Seven days after the first drug administration (washout period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate drug. The plasma concentrations of pramipexole were determined by validated ultra performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detector (UPLC-MS/MS).</detailed_description>
