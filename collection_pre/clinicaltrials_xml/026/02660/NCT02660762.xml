	<brief_summary>This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of Modified MRCUKALLⅫ/ECOGE2993 Regimen in young adults with newly diagnosed, low-risk, Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified MRCUKALLⅫ/ECOGE2993 Regimen for ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients received a modified BFM regimen which was derived from the MRCUKALLⅫ/ECOGE2993 Regimen.The differences were as follows:(1) cranial prophylactic radiotherapy was omitted (2) Pegaspargase was used instead of L- asparaginase for patient.(3)Two additional Pegaspargase treatments were added into consolidation therapy.</detailed_description>
