	<brief_summary>Current literature report 3 ways to prescribe and control aerobic training. Such models require comparison to determine if they really provide the same impact training in a prescription. The aim of this study is to compare the results of different methods of prescription of aerobic training, ie VO2 workload, heart rate (HR), and load self adjusted by perceived effort (PSE) as well as psychological responses activation, and feel depending on the stimuli offered.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>36 subjects will undergo two sessions. On the first visit, a maximum aerobic exercise test will be carried on treadmill to determine the maximum oxygen intake and maximum heart rate. Second, the subjects are placed (in a blinded fashion) in 3 situations of moderate effort (60 to 65%) for a total of 5 min and 3 min interval between conditions. In situation 1) will be used to speed regarding the particular metabolic demand from the maximum oxygen intake; In the second situation the reserve of heart rate will be used as reference for prescription aiming to achieve 60-65%; On the last visit will be shown to subjects a perceived effort characterized as moderate and asked to adjust their speed according to the application effort. The final will be recorded each time the FC and the speed and perception of effort that the subject was.</detailed_description>
