	<brief_title>Spinal Manipulation and Spinal Mobilization Effects in Participants With and Without Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although evidences suggest a similar effectiveness of spinal manipulation and spinal mobilization, there is no study that compares the neuromechanical effects of these manual therapies in a experimental context and with the standardization of both interventions. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to compare the neuromechanical responses to spinal manipulation (low-amplitude and high-velocity dynamic thrust) and spinal mobilization (repetitions of a low-amplitude and low-velocity nonthrust movement) in participants with and without chronic nonspecific back pain.</detailed_description>
