	<brief_summary>The objective in this case-control intervention study, therefore, was to explore the effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on the GCF levels of chemerin and IL-6 in patients with chronic periodontitis in order to determine the usefulness of chemerin as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of periodontal disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemerin and Interleukin-6 Levels of Gingival Crevicular Fluid in Obese Individuals Following Periodontal Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All individuals underwent a full-mouth periodontal examination, which included probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP). BMI and WHR were used for assessing obesity. In addition, HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose levels were used for elimination of diabetes mellitus. Based on the periodontal and anthropometric measurements, individuals (n=72) were divided into four groups: the periodontal-healthy group (n=18), chronic periodontitis group (n=18), periodontal-healthy with obesity group (n=18) and chronic periodontitis with obesity group (n=18). Periodontitis patients received nonsurgical periodontal therapy. GCF sampling and clinical periodontal parameters were assessed before and 6 weeks after therapy. Chemerin and IL-6 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. 3253 years of age 2. had a minimum of 20 natural teeth, excluding third molars 3) glycosylated hemoglobi levels &lt;6% 4) fasting plasma glucose levels &lt;100 mg/dl. 5) Criteria for the periodontal healthy group were GI = 0, PPD≤ 3 mm, and no signs of attachment and bone loss by clinical and radiographic examination. 6) Criteria for the chronic periodontitis group were clinical signs of inflammation (red color and swelling of the gingival margin), GI ≥ 2, PPD and CAL ≥ 5 mm, and bone loss affecting &gt;30% of the existing teeth on clinical and radiographic examination. 7) Criteria for obese groups were 30≤ BMI &lt;40 kg/m2, and concomitant WHR ≥0.85 for females and WHR ≥0.90 for males. 8) Criteria for normalweight groups were 20≤ BMI &lt;25 kg/m2, and WHR below that determined for obesity. 1. Aggressive periodontitis 2. Periapical pathologies 3. Excessive forces including mechanical forces from orthodontics and occlusion 4. Systemic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus; cancer; human immunodeficiency virus; or disorders that could affect adipokines levels and the periodontal conditions) 5. Chronic highdose steroid therapy, radiation or immunosuppressive therapy 6. Pregnancy, lactation 7. Smoking within the past five years, or allergy or sensitivity to any drug 8. Had no history of periodontal therapy or drug therapy (e.g., antiinflammatories, antibiotics, or any other pharmacological treatment) for at least six months</criteria>
