	<brief_summary>The present retrospective study aims at assessing the clinical effects of a novel implant site development (Extraction site development - XSD) technique after tooth extraction compared with extraction alone in patients requiring dental implant placement following healing of extraction sockets.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D Radiographic Evaluation of a Novel Implant Site Development Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In advanced (Extraction Defect Sounding Class 3-4) alveolar defects, a minimally invasive tunnelised socket preservation technique utilising long term resorbable membranes and connective tissue grafting was used for extraction site development (XSD). The novel technique was evaluated in a retrospective comparative case series study including a total of 54 extraction sites. In the test group, out of 33 single rooted teeth, 29 in the maxilla and 4 in the mandible were removed, extractions sites were treated by the XSD method. Out of 33 teeth, 27 were incisors, 2 canines and 4 premolars. In the control group, out of 21 single rooted teeth, 11 in the maxilla and 10 in the mandible were extracted and left for spontaneous healing. Out of 21 teeth, 13 were incisors, 2 canines and 6 premolars. CBCT scans were taken prior to tooth extraction and 6-9 months later in both groups. Radiographic evaluation was carried out using the I-CAT Vision (Imaging Sciences International, LLC; Hatfield, USA) and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) softwares. Following manual alignment of CBCTs vertical and horizontal linear measurements as well as planimetric measurements of cross-section areas were performed in pre- and postoperative data sets at the extraction sites.</detailed_description>
