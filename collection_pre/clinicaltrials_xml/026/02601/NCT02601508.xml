	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the surgeon's satisfaction with either deep or moderate neuromuscular blockade during laparoscopic gastrectomy surgery and observe the recovery profiles in the recovery room and the ward.The explorative objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profiles of deep and moderate neuromuscular blockades via observation of postoperative complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare of Surgical Condition and Complications With Moderate and Deep NM Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are frequently using during anesthesia to facilitate tracheal intubation and to improve surgical conditions. In an adequately anesthetized and monitored patient, the presence of one or two responses in the train-of-four (TOF) pattern normally indicates sufficient relaxation for most surgical procedures in general practices. It has been called moderate neuromuscular blockade (mNMB) condition. Nowadays, laparoscopic surgeries have expanded impressively into various areas of surgeries, both in scope and volume. If any hypothetical advantages of deep neuromuscular blockade (dNMB) during laparoscopic surgery turned out to be realized in practice with sufficient supporting evidence, it would become an important anesthetic option for better patient outcomes.</detailed_description>
