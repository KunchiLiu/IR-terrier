	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of sapanisertib and to see how well it works compared to pazopanib hydrochloride in treating patients with sarcoma that is too large to be removed (locally advanced) or has spread to other areas of the body (metastatic). Sapanisertib and pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sapanisertib or Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerable dose of sapanisertib (MLN0128 [TAK-228]) within this patient population. (Phase I) II. To determine the differences in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with sarcoma who receive MLN0128 (TAK-228) as compared to pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride). (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate adverse events. (Phase I/II) II. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and duration of response (DOR). (Phase I/II) III. To evaluate time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). (Phase I/II) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate PFS and secondary endpoints within patients crossing over to MLN0128 (TAK-228), upon disease progression during treatment with pazopanib. (Phase II) II. To evaluate the 4 month CBR observed within patients treated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) and grouped by histologically defined cohorts. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study, followed by a randomized phase II study. PHASE I: Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive sapanisertib as in Phase I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing disease progression may crossover to Arm I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have slides available for submission to central pathology review; this review is mandatory prior to registration to confirm eligibility and proper cohort assignment HISTOLOGIC COHORT 1: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (includes: malignant fibrous histiocytoma, myxofibrosarcoma, high grade sarcoma not otherwise specified [NOS]) HISTOLOGIC COHORT 2: Leiomyosarcoma (either uterine or extrauterine) HISTOLOGIC COHORT 3: Other (either malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor or synovial sarcoma); during the phase II portion of the study, enrollment will be limited to maximum of 25 patients in this cohort Note that the phase I is limited to the histologic subtypes listed above; since patients will be enrolling onto dose cohorts during the phase I, they will not enroll onto specific histologic cohorts, although the histologic subtype informed will be collected during patient enrollment Histologic documentation: Eligible patients must have histopathologically confirmed sarcoma of one of the subtypes listed, by central review Locally advanced or metastatic disease; locally advanced disease is defined as disease not amenable to local therapy such as surgery and/or radiation Measurable disease Progression on at least one prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced, unresectable or metastatic disease;
