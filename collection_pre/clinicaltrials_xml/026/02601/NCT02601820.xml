	<brief_summary>The PROP UP research study is funded by The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). PROP UP is a multi-centered prospective observational study that will evaluate all-oral treatment regimens for HCV regarding several patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as HCV-associated symptoms, treatment side effects, medication adherence, out of pocket costs, comorbid conditions, and long-term benefits of cure and harms of treatment to compare PROs of different treatment regimens, treatment durations, and patient subgroups. Participants will be recruited from 9 U.S. liver centers. Approximately 1920 patients with HCV infection who are prescribed a regimen containing Harvoni®, Viekera Pak®, Zepatier®, DAC/SOF or SOF/VEL for chronic HCV will be recruited and approximately 1600 patients who are approved and begin HCV treatment will be enrolled in the longitudinal study. PRO surveys will be evaluated before, during and after HCV treatment. PROP UP is a collaborative effort between behavioral and biomedical researchers, a patient engagement group and a patient advocacy organization.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Newer, more effective all-oral regimens for hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection are available. However the available data from industry-sponsored trials do not provide all the information that patients need, nor do these data represent the broad spectrum of patients treated in real-world practice. Trials also exclude disadvantaged subgroups, focus on short-term efficacy and clinician-rated adverse events, rarely obtain the patient's perspective, and do not investigate longer-term harms of treatment or benefits of viral cure. Given these informational gaps, patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) on treatment harms and benefits that matter most to patients, is needed. PROP UP is funded by The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). PROP UP is a multi-centered prospective observational study that will evaluate 5 newly approved DAA treatment regimens for HCV regarding several patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as HCV-associated symptoms, treatment side effects, medication adherence, out of pocket costs, comorbid conditions, and long-term benefits of cure and harms of treatment to compare PROs of different treatment regimens, treatment durations, and patient subgroups. PROP UP is a collaborative effort between researchers, a patient engagement group, and a patient advocacy organization. Nine U.S. liver centers will collaborate on PROP UP. Approximately 1920 patients with HCV infection who are prescribed a regimen containing Harvoni®, Viekera Pak®, Zepatier®, DAC/SOF or SOF/VEL for chronic HCV will be consented and will complete baseline PRO surveys. Approximately 1600 patients who are approved and begin HCV treatment will be enrolled in the longitudinal study. Participants will complete several PRO surveys at 5 assessment periods during the study: baseline, treatment week 4, end of treatment, 3 months post-treatment, and 12 months post-treatment. PRO survey data will be collected via 3 options: patient home-based computers, tablet, smartphone; phone-administered surveys with a centralized call enter; or at regular clinic visits. Analysis of PROs collected longitudinally before, during and after treatment for HCV will allow the investigators to answer a variety of questions important to patients and clinicians. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate: (a) prevalence of pre-existing baseline symptoms associated with HCV; (b) the development of new onset treatment side effects and exacerbation of pre-existing symptoms during HCV treatment; (c) medication adherence and out of pocket costs associated with treatment; (d) changes in HCV-associated symptoms and functional status in patients who are cured; (e) long-term patient-reported harms associated with treatments and long-term benefits associated with viral cure.</detailed_description>
