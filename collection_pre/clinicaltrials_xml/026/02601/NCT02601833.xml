	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Silver Diamine Fluoride as a Treatment for Caries in Comparison to Traditional Restorative Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the effectiveness of the application of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in comparison to conventional restorative treatments in International Caries Detection and Assessment System criteria (ICDAS) 5 and 6, one and two surface carious lesions in primary molars which will be assessed based on major and minor failure criteria when followed for one year. Additionally, parents'/children's and providers' perceptions will be assessed as well as the cost of both regimens, to include both chair time spent and materials' costs.</detailed_description>
