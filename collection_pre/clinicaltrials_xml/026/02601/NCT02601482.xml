	<brief_summary>A single bout of Interval-Walking (IW) exercise is superior to energy-expenditure and time-duration matched Continuous Walking (CW) exercise upon improving glycemic control. The time spend with high-intensity (fast) walking is considered to be responsible for the improvements seen, whereas the time spend with low-intensity (slow) walking is considered less important. This study will assess if IW with maintained fast walking time duration but reduced total time duration (i.e. reduced slow walking time duration) is equally effective as IW with a normal time duration. Subjects with type 2 diabetes will be included in a crossover, controlled study, where each subject will undergo three trials. Trials will be identical except the following interventions: 1. Sixty minutes of rest (CON) 2. Sixty minutes of classical interval walking (repeated cycles of 3 minutes of fast and 3 minutes of slow walking; IW-60) 3. Fourty-five minutes of time-reduced interval walking (repeated cycles of 3 minutes of fast and 1.5 minutes of slow walking; IW-45). After the interventions subjects will undergo a standardized mixed meal tolerance test with assessment of glycemic control.</brief_summary>
