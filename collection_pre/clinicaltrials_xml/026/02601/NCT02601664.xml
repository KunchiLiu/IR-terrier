	<brief_summary>Design: Single center, single-blind randomized controlled trial of patients with high risk native coronary artery lesions (defined as ≥2 contiguous yellow blocks on the block chemogram) requiring clinically indicated percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients will be randomized to either a combined intervention or conventional PCI. Cardiac biomarker measurements will be performed before PCI and 18-24 hours later. Treatment: Combined intervention consisting of pre-PCI intracoronary vasodilator and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration, use of an EPD if technically feasible, and complete coverage of the lipid core plaque, if technically feasible. Control: Conventional PCI. Duration: 30 days follow-up. The primary trial objective is to compare the incidence and size of periprocedural MI, as assessed by the peak post-PCI troponin distribution in the two study groups. The secondary endpoints are: (1) Reduction in the incidence of &gt;3x and &gt;10x upper limit of normal increase in CK-MB. (2) Reduction in the incidence of slow flow/no-reflow post PCI. (3) Lower incidence of major adverse cardiac events, defined as the composite of death, acute coronary syndrome, or coronary revascularization) during 30-day follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥18 years. 2. Willing and able to provide informed consent and able to comply with study procedures and followup. 3. Undergoing a clinically indicated left heart coronary catheterization 4. Need PCI of a highrisk native coronary artery lesion. Highrisk lesions will be defined as lesions with ≥2 contiguous yellow blocks on block chemogram. 1. Coexisting conditions that limit life expectancy to less than 30days or that could affect the patient's compliance with the protocol. 2. Positive pregnancy test or breastfeeding. 3. High risk for bleeding. 4. Subject is currently, or within the 30 preceding days, participating in a device or pharmaceutical treatment protocol. 5. Clinical presentation with STsegment elevation MI. 6. Persistent (&gt;10 minutes) hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg) 7. Need for revascularization of multiple lesions during the index PCI. 8. Unprotected left main (&gt;50%) or equivalent left main disease.</criteria>
