	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation of NAc/ALIC to Prevent Treatment-Refractory Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessions (persistent thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive ritualistic behaviour). Core symptoms of OCD cause remarkable distress and often perceived as inappropriate. The prevalence of OCD in the general population is estimated between 1% and 3%. It is a psychiatric illness that can lead to chronic functional impairment. Treatment options for OCD include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy. Even when the best treatment options are used, approximately 10% of these patients remain severely affected and are considered therapy-refractory resulting in marked suffering and impairment in self-care, work and social life. More recently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been investigated as a therapy for refractory OCD, and the procedure was granted a limited humanitarian device exemption by the FDA in 2009. For these patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS), a neurosurgical treatment that involves stereotactic implantation of electrodes in specific deep-seated brain regions, has emerged as a new treatment option.</detailed_description>
