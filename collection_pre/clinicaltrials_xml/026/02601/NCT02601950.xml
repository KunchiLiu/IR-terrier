	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, single arm, 2-stage study of tazemetostat 800 mg BID administered orally in continuous 28 day cycles. Screening of subjects to determine eligibility for the study will be performed within 21 days of the first planned dose of tazemetostat. Eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of fivecohorts based on tumor type: - Cohort 1: MRT, RTK, ATRT, or selected tumors with rhabdoid features, including small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type [SCCOHT], also known as malignant rhaboid tumor of the ovary [MRTO] - Cohort 2: Relapsed or refractory synovial sarcoma with SS18-SSX rearrangement - Cohort 3: Other INI1 negative tumors or any solid tumor with an EZH2 gain of function (GOF) mutation, including: epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (EMPNST), extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC), myoepithelial carcinoma, other INI1-negative malignant tumors with Sponsor approval (e.g., dedifferentiated chordoma) any solid tumor with an EZH2 GOF mutation including but not limited to Ewing's sarcoma and melanoma - Cohort 4: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) - Cohort 5: Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) Treatment with tazemetostat will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study. Response assessment will be evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment and then every 8 weeks thereafter while on study.</brief_summary>

Has a malignancy: For which there are no standard therapies available (Cohorts 1, 3, 4 and 5) That is relapsed or refractory after treatment with an approved therapy(ies), defined as metastatic or nonresectable, locally advanced disease that has previously been treated with and progressed following approved therapy(ies) (Cohort 2) That has progressed within 6 months prior to study enrollment (Cohort 5 Expansion ONLY) 5. Has a documented local diagnostic pathology of original biopsy confirmed by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA/College of American Pathologists (CAP) or equivalent laboratory certification 6. For Cohort 1 (rhabdoid tumors only), the following test results must be available by local laboratory: morphology and immunophenotypic panel consistent with rhabdoid tumors, and loss of INI1 or SMARCA4 confirmed by IHC, or molecular confirmation of tumor biallelic INI1 or SMARCA4 loss or mutation when INI1 or SMARCA4 IHC is equivocal or unavailable 7. For Cohort 2 (subjects with relapsed/refractory synovial sarcoma only), the following tests must be available by local laboratory: Morphology consistent with synovial sarcomas, and cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or molecular confirmation (e.g., DNA sequencing) of SS18 rearrangement t(X;18)(p11;q11) 8. For Cohort 3 to 5 (subjects with INI1negative/aberrant tumors or any solid tumor with EZH2 GOF mutation only), the following test results must be available by local laboratory: Morphology and immunophenotypic panel consistent with INI1negative tumors (not applicable for solid tumors with EZH2 GOF mutation), and loss of INI1 confirmed by IHC, or molecular confirmation of tumor biallelic INI1 loss or mutation when INI1 IHC is equivocal or unavailable, or molecular evidence of EZH2 GOF mutation 9. Prior therapy(ies), if applicable, must be completed according to the criteria below: Chemotherapy: cytotoxic (At least 21 days since last dose of chemotherapy prior to first dose of tazemetostat) Chemotherapy: nitrosoureas (At least 6 weeks since last dose of nitrosoureas prior to first dose of tazemetostat) Chemotherapy: noncytotoxic (e.g., small molecule inhibitor) (At least 14 days since last dose of noncytotoxic chemotherapy prior to first dose of tazemetostat) Monoclonal antibody(ies) (At least 3 halflives since the last dose of any monoclonal antibody prior to first dose of tazemetostat) Immunotherapy (e.g. tumor vaccine) (At least 42 days since last dose of immunotherapy agent(s) prior to first dose of tazemetostat) Radiotherapy (RT) (At least 14 days from last local site RT prior to first dose of tazemetostat/At least 21 days from stereostatic radiosurgery prior to first dose of tazemetostat/At least 12 weeks from craniospinal, ≥50% radiation of pelvis, or total body irradiation prior to first dose of tazemetostat) High dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic cell infusion (At least 60 days from last infusion prior to first dose of tazemetostat) Hematopoietic growth factor (At least 14 days from last dose of hematopoietic growth factor prior to first dose of tazemetostat) 10.
