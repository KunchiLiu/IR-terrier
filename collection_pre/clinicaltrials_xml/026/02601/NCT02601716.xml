	<brief_title>PfSPZ Vaccine: Dose Optimization With Heterologous Challenge in Healthy Malaria-Naïve Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted as a collaborative effort between the NMRC, UMB CVD, WRAIR and Sanaria, Inc. The study screening, immunizations and follow-ups for Groups 1 &amp; 2 will take place at the UMB CVD. The study screening, immunizations and follow-ups for Groups 3 &amp; 4 will take place at the NMRC CTC in Bethesda, MD. The controlled human malaria infections (CHMI) will be conducted at WRAIR Entomology, Silver Spring, MD for NMRC subjects, and at UMB CVD for UMB CVD subjects. There will be 4 groups and a total of 84 subjects (60 immunized subjects and 24 infectivity controls). Group 1 (n=15) subjects will receive PfSPZ Vaccine administered by DVI with 4 doses of 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ given every two days, followed by a single, boosting dose of 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ given 16 weeks later for a total PfSPZ dose of 22.5 x 10^5. Group 2 (n=15) subjects will receive PfSPZ Vaccine administered by DVI with 9.0 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose, administered every 8 weeks for a total of 3 doses, with a total PfSPZ dose of 27 x 10^5. Group 3 subjects will receive PfSPZ Vaccine administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI) with 18 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose, administered every 8 weeks for a total of three doses, with a total PfSPZ dose of 54 x 10^5. Group 4 subjects will receive 27 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose, administered once as a priming dose, followed by 9.0 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose, administered every 8 weeks for a total of two doses, with a total PfSPZ dose of 45 x 10^5. Protective efficacy will be assessed by CHMI, conducted by exposure to the bites of five mosquitoes infected with heterologous (7G8) Pf parasites. At NMRC, protective efficacy will be assessed at 24 weeks after the final immunization in Groups 3 and 4. At UMB CVD, protective efficacy will be assessed at both 12 and 24 weeks after the final immunization, in Groups 1 and 2. These subjects may participate in the second CHMI whether or not they were protected in the first CHMI, to serve as controls for the effect of the first CHMI on immunity. Subjects may proceed to CHMI provided they have received at least two of the three immunizations scheduled for Groups 2-4, or at least two of the four priming immunizations as well as the boost scheduled for Group 1. Two subjects in Groups 3 and 4 will be immunized the day before the rest of the subjects in the respective group (referred to as "pilot subjects") for the first immunization. The procedure and sequence of events for immunization of the pilot subjects, and the rest of the subjects in the respective group will be specific to the study site. If there are no safety concerns identified in the pilot subjects that trigger the stopping rules, then the remainder of subjects will be immunized the day after the pilot subjects are immunized. Subjects will be followed for 56 days beyond the 24-week CHMI that takes place 24 weeks after the final immunization (post-immunization week 40).</detailed_description>

Able and willing to provide written (not proxy) informed consent. Physical examination and laboratory results without clinically significant findings and a body mass index (BMI) ≤35 for vaccine groups or BMI ≤40 for control groups. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use effective means of birth control (e.g. oral or implanted contraceptives, IUD, female condom, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap, abstinence, use of a condom by the sexual partner or sterile sexual partner) during the entire study. Women with a history of surgical or chemical sterilization (e.g. tubal ligation, hysterectomy, other) must provide written documentation of infertility from a health care provider. Willing to refrain from blood donation for 3 years following CHMI. Agree not to travel to a malaria endemic region during the entire course of the trial. Any history of malaria infection, or travel to a malaria endemic region within 6 months prior to first immunization. History of longterm residence (&gt;5 years) in area known to have significant transmission of P. falciparum. Body weight equal to, or less than, 110 pounds Has evidence of increased cardiovascular disease risk (defined as &gt; 10%, 5 year risk) as determined by the method of Gaziano [Gaziano, 2008]. Risk factors include sex, age, systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), smoking status, body mass index (BMI, kg/mm2), and reported diabetes status. Positive HIV, HBsAg or HCV serology. Positive sickle cell screening test. An abnormal electrocardiogram, defined as one showing pathologic Q waves and significant STT wave changes; left ventricular hypertrophy; any nonsinus rhythm including isolated premature ventricular contractions, but excluding isolated premature atrial contractions; right or left bundle branch block; or advanced (secondary or tertiary) AV heart block. Current use of systemic immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy. Current significant medical condition (cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, or hematological) or evidence of any other serious underlying medical condition identified by medical history, physical examination, or laboratory examination. History of a splenectomy. History of neurologic disorder (including seizures) or diagnosis of migraine headache. History of psychiatric disorders (such as personality disorders, anxiety disorders, or schizophrenia) or behavioral tendencies (including active alcohol or drug abuse) discovered during the screening process that in the opinion of the investigator would make compliance with the protocol difficult. Plan for surgery between enrollment and CHMI. Females who are pregnant or nursing, females who plan on becoming pregnant or plan to nurse during the study period. Known allergy to any component of the vaccine formulation, history of anaphylactic response to mosquitobites, or any history of anaphylactic reaction, retinal or visual field changes, or known allergy to antimalarials including chloroquine phosphate, atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone®), or artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem®) Receipt of another investigational vaccine or drug within 30 days prior to the first immunization, or plan to participate in another investigational vaccine/drug research during or within 1 month following participation in this study. Participation in any study involving another investigational vaccine or drug within 60 days prior to the screening visit, or plan to participate in another investigational vaccine/drug research during or within 1 month following participation in this study. Personal beliefs that prohibit the receiving of vaccine product containing human serum albumin within the diluent (vaccine recipients only). Use or planned use of any drug with antimalarial activity that would coincide with the periods of immunization or CHMI. Anticipated use of medications known to cause drug reactions with atovaquoneproguanil (Malarone®), or artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem®) such as cimetidine, metoclopramide, antacids, and kaolin. History of any other illness or condition which, in the investigator's judgment, may substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in the protocol or compromise the scientific objectives.</criteria>
