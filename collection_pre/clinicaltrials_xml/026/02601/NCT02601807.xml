	<brief_summary>The ActiPatch is a cutaneous device which is CE marked approved for relief of pain. It is taped over the affected area and stimulation at a high frequency is reported to alleviate pain with no sensation. However there is no class 1 evidence for this on back pain. By randomising patients between application of an active device or a dummy device and assessment of disability and pain scores at two weeks, the efficacy or otherwise can be established. Low back pain is a major health problem and if effective this has major economic implications as the device is cheap and safe.</brief_summary>
