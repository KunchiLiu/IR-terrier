	<brief_summary>The aim is to continue our program on PDE5 inhibition by evaluating effects on insulin resistance, including glucose metabolism and subclinical inflammation, after a 6-week administration of tadalafil in T2D patients. The primary objective is to study the effect of tadalafil compared with placebo on insulin sensitivity during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with one study site. Twenty-five T2D patients will be recruited and randomized to per oral intake of tadalafil 20 mg o.d. for six weeks and after a wash-out period of eight weeks intake of placebo for another six weeks, or vice versa. At the end of each 6 week treatment period a glucose clamp, subcutaneous needle biopsies as well as muscle and subcutaneous microdialysis will be performed. Endothelial function tests and arginin stimulation of insulin secretion tests will be performed after 3 weeks in each treatment arm.</brief_summary>
