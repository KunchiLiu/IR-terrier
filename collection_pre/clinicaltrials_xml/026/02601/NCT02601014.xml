	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and ipilimumab work in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body and express androgen receptor-variant-7 (AR-V7). Tumor cells expressing AR-V7 has been shown to be resistant to hormone therapy and some chemotherapy in patients with prostate cancer. Biomarker-driven therapy, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may work by blocking key biomarkers or proteins that help tumor cells to escape the immune system surveillance and this may help the immune system to kill tumor cells that express AR-V7.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker-Driven Therapy With Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer Expressing AR-V7</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: 1. To evaluate the effect of administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the proportion of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses (&gt; 50% PSA decline) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with detectable AR‐V7 transcript in circulating tumor cells (CTCs). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES; 1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipilimumab + nivolumab in AR‐V7-positive patients. 2. To determine the progression free survival (PFS). 3. To determine the PSA‐PFS. 4. To determine the proportion of "durable" responses. 5. To determine the overall response rate (ORR). 6. To determine the overall survival (OS). 7. To evaluate changes in AR‐V7 detection (or expression levels) before and after treatment with ipilimumab + nivolumab and correlate with PSA responses. 8. To explore potential biomarkers associated with clinical efficacy (ORR, PFS, and OS) of nivolumab and ipilimumab by analyzing absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood as well as programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression in CTCs and/or in tumor biopsies, and immune profiling of sera and tumor tissue. OUTLINE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes every 2 weeks for 36 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days and then every 3 months.</detailed_description>

men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal; menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes; in addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL No evidence (within 5 years) of prior malignancies (except successfully treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) The subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol, and agrees to return to the hospital for follow‐up visits and examination The subject has been fully informed about the study and has signed the informed consent form and, where appropriate, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization for release of personal health information NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately Has received an investigational therapeutic drug within the last 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment, or is scheduled to receive one during the treatment period Has received external radiotherapy within the last 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment Previous therapy with antiandrogens within 4 weeks Patients should be excluded if they have had prior systemic treatment with an anti‐programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1), anti‐PD‐L1, anti‐programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD‐L2), anti‐cytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA‐4) antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T‐cell costimulation or immune checkpoint pathways Symptomatic metastatic disease with signs of rapid progression per investigator's clinical judgment Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments, with the following exceptions: Ongoing treatment with luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or antagonists, denosumab (Prolia) or bisphosphonate (eg, zoledronic acid) is allowed;
