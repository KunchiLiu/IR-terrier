	<brief_summary>Chronic pain in adolescents and young adults (AYA, aged 15-25) is a common problem. Pain that is not treated properly can reduce quality of life. Programs to help AYA learn to live with and manage pain are very important. Our team is developing a smartphone application (app) and website for AYA with chronic pain. The app will help AYA to track pain, sleep, mood, activities, and exercise and help AYA set and achieve goals. The website will give information about pain and how to manage it independently. We will build the program and make sure it is easy to use and understand. We will also test if the program can be put into practice as planned and if AYA using the program feel less pain, have less limitations, and a better quality of life.</brief_summary>
