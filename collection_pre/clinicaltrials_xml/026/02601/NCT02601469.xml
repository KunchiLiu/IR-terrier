	<criteria>1. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of plaque psoriasis, patients 217 years of age with ≥ 10% BSA affected and patients age 18 years of age or older with ≥ 20% BSA affected 2. Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) at baseline for the overall disease severity. 3. Results from a cortisol response test that are considered normal and show no evidence of any abnormal HPA function or adrenal response 1. Patients under 2 years of age. 2. Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of less than 3 (moderate) or greater than 4 (severe) at baseline. 3. Current diagnosis of types of psoriasis other than stable plaque psoriasis (i.e., erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis). 4. Results from a cortisol response test that show evidence of any abnormal HPA function or adrenal response</criteria>
