	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study with a BID oral dose of tazemetostat. Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 14 days of the planned first dose of tazemetostat. A treatment cycle will be 28 days. Response assessment will be evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment and subsequently every 8 weeks while on study. The study has two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. Dose escalation for subjects with the following relapsed/refractory malignancies: - Rhabdoid tumors: - Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) - Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) - Rhabdoid tumor of kidney (RTK) - Selected tumors with rhabdoid features - INI1-negative tumors: - Epithelioid sarcoma - Epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor - Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma - Myoepithelial carcinoma - Renal medullary carcinoma - Other INI1-negative malignant tumors (e.g., dedifferentiated chordoma) (with Sponsor approval) - Synovial Sarcoma with a SS18-SSX rearrangement Dose Expansion at the MTD or the RP2D, for subjects with rhabdoid tumors (MRT/ATRT/RTK/selected tumors with rhabdoid features).</brief_summary>
