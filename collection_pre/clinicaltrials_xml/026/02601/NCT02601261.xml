A recent research shown that the prevalence of antenatal anxiety changes during pregnancy at first trimester is 36.3%; the rate dropped to 32.3% at second trimester but increased again to 35.8% at third trimester (art. 29).According to the World Health Organization, mental health disorders are the leading cause of disease burden in woman from 15 to 44 years (art.6).

	<detailed_description>WHAT CAUSES ANXIETY IN PREGNANT WOMEN Anxiety during pregnancy may expose the woman to a higher risk of a negative outcome in four different fields: 1. Fetal obstetric outcomes; 2. Neonatal outcomes; 3. Child development; 4. Risk to the woman. 1. The anxiety in pregnant woman may expose the fetus to a higher risk of spontaneous early labor, preterm delivery, lower birth weight, fetal distress, fetal growth restriction, risk for spontaneous abortion, risk of pre-eclampsia and for operative/instrumental deliveries. Furthermore could be a major risk for the uterine artery to have high resistance that could reduce blood flow to the fetus. 2. The neonates that had a mother with anxiety issues during pregnancy may have an higher risk of admission to neonatal ICU, have a lower Apgar score and small head circumference, growth retardation, slowed mental development and excessive crying, irritability, hostility and erratic sleep. The mother anxiety could also increase the possibility to have colic in the neonatal age. 3. On the other hand the maternity anxiety could have long-term negative effects on the child development. There are risks of negative effect on maternal-infant bonding, difficult with affect regulations, cognitive delays, behavioral and emotional difficulties, maladaptive and social interactions, cognitive delays, behavioral and emotional difficulties and maladaptive social interactions. Furthermore, the child could develop a major level of fear and anxiety during life, an insecure and disorganized attachment and lower IQ at age 15-15 years. Anxiety of the mothers during pregnancy could cause a non-optimal neuromotorial development of the child, a research demonstrated an association between the anxiety of the mother in late pregnancy and the infant behavior, his emotional problems and his difficult temperament during later infancy. To demonstrated the correlation between anxiety and negative outcomes during childhood a Belgian/Dutch study showed that the 14-15 years old person that had a mother with anxiety disorders reveals a major risk of impulsivity and cognitive disorders. Another study demonstrated the connection between antenatal anxiety and behavioral/emotional problems of a four years old child. Another probable negative outcome of the pregnant anxiety is the asthma during childhood. A study demonstrated that the baby with a anxious mother has an higher risk to the use of antibiotic, to have respiratory and skin illnesses in the first year of the life than the child born from a mother without anxiety disorder. 4. It is very important underline to that anxiety during pregnancy has a negative effect not only on the fetus and child but also on the mother as well. Many researches demonstrated a link between prenatal anxiety and postpartum depression, psychiatric complications, and a higher risk of preeclampsia. In addition, the mother suffering of anxiety requires more examination from an obstetrician and most of all require an elective caesarean section. Other negative outcomes are poor nutrition, impaired self-care of the mother, failure to follow medical and prenatal guidelines, and major exposure to use alcohol, drugs and tobacco. INTERNET INFORMATION In 2004 the 4,5% of the researches of internet were about medical information and, in 2009, the 61% of adult Internet users in the United States searched for health-related information. The Internet allows people to have an immediately health information and also pregnant woman search information about pregnancy and connected problems. For example women affected with nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy search online how this problem could be treated. On the other hand, not all information available on the Internet are regulated, nor are always reliable or current.</detailed_description>
