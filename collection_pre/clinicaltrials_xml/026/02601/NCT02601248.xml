	<brief_title>Study of Theliatinib (HMPL-309) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Theliatinib (HMPL-309) is a new constructive, high effective, high selective, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Theliatinib has demonstrated strong inhibitory effects on multiple tumors with overexpressed EGFR or sensitive EGFR mutations. This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of Theliatinib .</detailed_description>
