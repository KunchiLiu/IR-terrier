	<brief_title>Effect of Maternal Body Mass Index on Labor Progress in Nulliparous Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For nulliparous cases presenting to the labor ward, maternal height &amp; weight will be collected at the time of admission to calculate the BMI (body mass index) &amp; further classified according to WHO (World Health Organization) categories. Putting into consideration the physiological increase in BMI related to pregnancy, the overweight participants whose BMI (25-29.9) will be combined with the normal range BMI (18.5-24.9) category. Labor characteristics of these participants will be then compared with those of the underweight (BMI less than 18.5) &amp; obese (BMI 30 or higher) participants.Females are assigned in one of 3 groups based on their BMI; Underweight group (BMI &lt;18.5kg/m2), Control group whose BMI within normal range (18.5-29.9 kg/m2),&amp; Obese group (BMI more than or equal 30kg/m2). Labor management protocols are fixed. Data on labor progression are collected, including cervical dilatation, cervical effacement, head station &amp; descent. The median duration of labor , estimated by rate of cervical dilatation in cm, will be used as a measurement of labor progression in each group. A cesarean section for abnormal labor pattern will be documented as failure of progress.</detailed_description>
