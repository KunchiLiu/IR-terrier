	<brief_title>Prospective Study of Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis After the Age of 65</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in elderly is increasing because of the increasing life expectancy. RA is associated with a higher prevalence of infections, malignancies, osteoporotic fractures and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of age on prevalence and severity of comorbidities in RA. This study also aims to determine whether age influences disease progression and efficacy and tolerance of treatments. This study will compare two groups of patients : patients older than 65 years old and patients younger than 50 years old, matched for gender and disease duration. The first part of the study will be cross-sectional and will aim to compare characteristics regarding RA manifestations and comorbidities of the two groups at inclusion. Whereas the second part will be prospective to assess the occurrence of comorbidities and the efficacy and safety of treatments in these two groups. Patients will be assessed every year during 5 years in accordance with usual follow-up of the patients. This study could help to better manage elderly RA patients and to modify clinical practice.</detailed_description>
