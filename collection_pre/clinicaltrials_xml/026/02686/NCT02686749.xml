	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-center, randomized, unblinded, clinical trial. The objective is to determine if catheter-based atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is superior to medical treatment in patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) function who have been diagnosed with symptomatic AF within the past 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter Ablation vs. Medical Therapy in Congested Hearts With AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the trial is to compare two different approved treatments for recently diagnosed AF: anti-arrhythmic medications and AF ablation. The study will be conducted to determine if one treatment is more effective than the other for patients with AF and heart failure. About 220 subjects with newly diagnosed AF from hospitals in the United States will take part in this study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either AF catheter ablation or anti-arrhythmic medication for treatment of AF. Both therapies are considered Standard of Care.</detailed_description>
