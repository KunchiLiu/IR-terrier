Had an estimated creatinine (CREA) clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (Creatinine clearance was calculated from the serum CREA value using the Cockroft &amp; Gault formula). Had no history of heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension or other known overt cardiovascular disease. Had no history of 'Aspirin Triad' (chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, severe asthma and intolerance to aspirin or other NSAIDs). Had no marked abnormality of liver tests before entry into the study.
