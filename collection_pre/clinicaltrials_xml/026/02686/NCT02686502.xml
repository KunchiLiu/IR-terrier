	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect and usability of mobile and cloud technology -based intervention on lifestyle modification in 18-40 year obese and overweight subjects. The study has a dose-response design with three randomized subjects groups from Mode 1 to Mode 3 with increasing intensity of intervention (guidance, exercise program, diet, support). The special focus of this study is on motivation and use of music and mobile health devices as motivational tools to support individualized exercise training, healthy diet and overall healthy life style.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity negatively impacts health in many ways. It is associated with metabolic diseases and mood disorders and in women pregnancy outcome as well as the health of the offspring. The modern evolution of societies steers populations towards a profound sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity brings about health benefits, however, the risk reduction for chronic diseases remains significantly greater for fitness than physical activity per se. The recent knowledge suggest Individualized approach rather than general guidelines for exercise in prevention-oriented strategies. In this study we compare three different intensities of lifestyle intervention: 1) general guidelines for healthy exercise and diet, 2) individual program,and 3) highly individual program. Individual programs will be based on pre-examinations including interview and clinical exercise test. Mobile and cloud technologies will be used to collect data and steer the subjects´ lifestyles and daily activities and together with music to motivate them. The duration of the active intervention is 3 months and it will continue on a self-governing basis up to 1 year. The primary outcome is maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), and secondary outcomes are physical activity, cardio-respiratory and cardiovascular parameters, blood volume, total hemoglobin mass, metabolic health along with chronic low-grade inflammation and well-being.</detailed_description>
