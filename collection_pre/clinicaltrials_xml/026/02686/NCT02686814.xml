	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 17mm MDT-2215 aortic valve bioprosthesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PERIGON Japan Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, interventional, non-randomized, multi-center trial, with each site following a common protocol in Japan. A maximum of 20 subjects will be implanted at a maximum of 10 sites in Japan. The trial will include male and female patients of legal age to provide informed consent in Japan, requiring replacement for a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning native or prosthetic aortic valve. Patients will be followed and assessed after implant for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Aortic Valve Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patient has severe aortic stenosis or regurgitation, and there is clinical indication for replacement of their native or prosthetic aortic valve with a bioprosthesis, with or without concomitant procedures, which are limited to any of the following: Left atrial appendage (LAA) ligation Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure Ascending aortic aneurysm or dissection repair not requiring circulatory arrest Resection of a subaortic membrane not requiring myectomy 2. Patient is geographically stable and willing to return to the implanting site for all followup visits 3. Patient is of legal age to provide informed consent 4. Patient has been adequately informed of risks and requirements of the trial and is willing and able to provide informed consent for participation in the clinical trial 5. In the opinion of the investigator, preoperative imaging indicates the patient may be suitable for a 17mm size valve 1. Patient has a preexisting prosthetic valve or annuloplasty device in another position or requires replacement or repair of the mitral, pulmonary or tricuspid valve 2. Patient has had previous implant and then explant of the MDT2215 aortic valve bioprosthesis 3. Patient presents with active endocarditis, active myocarditis or other systemic infection 4. Patient has an anatomical abnormality which would increase surgical risk of morbidity or mortality, including: Ascending aortic aneurysm or dissection repair requiring circulatory arrest Acute type A aortic dissection Ventricular aneurysm Porcelain aorta Hostile mediastinum Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) Documented pulmonary hypertension (systolic &gt;60mmHg) 5. Patient has a noncardiac major or progressive disease, with a life expectancy of less than 2 years. These conditions include, but are not limited to: ChildPugh Class C liver disease Terminal cancer Endstage lung disease 6. Patient has renal failure, defined as dialysis therapy or glomerular filtration rate (GFR)&lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 7. Patient has hyperparathyroidism 8. Patient is participating in another investigational device or drug trial or observational competitive study 9. Patient is pregnant, lactating or planning to become pregnant 10. Patient has a documented history of substance (drug or alcohol) abuse 11. Patient has greater than mild mitral valve regurgitation or greater than mild tricuspid valve regurgitation as assessed by echocardiography 12. Patient has systolic ejection fraction (EF)&lt;20% as assessed by echocardiography 13. Patient has grade IV diastolic dysfunction 14. Patient has documented bleeding diatheses 15. Patient has had an acute preoperative neurological deficit or myocardial infarction and has not returned to baseline or stabilized â‰¥30 days prior to enrollment 16. Patient requires emergency surgery 17. Patient is in NYHA Class I 18. Operative 1.) Prior to attempted implant of MDT2215 valve, it is identified the patient requires a concomitant procedure not allow per the enrollment exclusion criteria 2.) Patient anatomy is not suitable for implant of a size 17mm MDT2215 aortic valve bioprosthesis</criteria>
