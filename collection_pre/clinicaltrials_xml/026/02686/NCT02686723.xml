	<brief_summary>Comparison of two groups of subjets (ACL injury who return to sport) and control group non-injured about clinical and biomechanical data : - clinical test - functional test - motion analysis of 2 sport exercises - tibial translation - isokinetic evaluation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Clinical and Biomechanical Correlation During Return to Sport After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ACL injury in sport practice is frequent and after surgery subjects want to return to sport. Re injury during return to sport is significant and clinical and biomechanical risk factors are described. But no study investigate link between clinical and biomechanical during this risk period. The study will search to highlight correlation between clinical and biomechanical factors. Investigators will realize clinical evaluation (pain, translation) and functional tests (single hop test, triple hop test, 6m time hop test, crossover test). For biomechanical data, investigators will test 2 exercises in motion analyse laboratory (drop vertical jump and cutting task), a translation knee test with GnRB and isokinetic evaluation. Investigators will compared results of injured subjects with a control group non-injured.</detailed_description>
