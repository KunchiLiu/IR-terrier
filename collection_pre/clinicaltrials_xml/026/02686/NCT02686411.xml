	<brief_summary>Objectives: Primary Objective: To determine the change of satisfaction with quality of care after an experience on the Palliative Care Unit (PCU) for both patients and caregivers, as determined by the global rating survey. Secondary Objectives: 1. To determine the change of the quality of care as determined by patients and caregivers utilizing validated assessment tools and global rating survey assessing different aspects of care after PCU. 2. To determine domains of care that are strongly or poorly provided by the PCU, as reported by patient and caregiver opinions on quality of care. 3. To determine which demographic features (i.e. cancer diagnosis; time since diagnosis; reason for transfer to the PCU; gender; caregiver ethnic group; comfort with the idea of transfer to the PCU; Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS), Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and distress thermometer) may correlate with patient and caregiver relative satisfaction with PCU care measured by global survey and with the Family Satisfaction with End-of-Life Care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participant: If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete 1 questionnaire about your overall satisfaction of the care you have received in the hospital, a question about how much distress you have had before your transfer to the PCU, and a question about your level of comfort with being transferred to the PCU. You will be asked to answer these questions based on your experience with the inpatient oncology service. These questionnaires should take about 10 minutes to complete. Your caregiver will also be invited to participate in the study. After you complete the first set of questionnaires, you will complete the same questionnaires about your overall satisfaction of the care you have received in the PCU, a question about how much distress you have had in the past 2 days, and a question about your level of comfort with being transferred to the PCU. You will be asked to answer these questions based on your experience in the PCU. One (1) new questionnaire will ask you to compare the care you received with the palliative care consult service with the care you received in the PCU. These questionnaires should also take about 10 minutes to complete. Information from your medical record (age, gender, educational level, marital status, religion, ethnicity, cancer diagnosis, stage of cancer, time since diagnosis, and the reasons you have been transferred to the PCU) will be collected. Length of Study Your participation on this study will be over after you complete the second set of questionnaires. Caregiver: If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire about your demographic information (such as your age, ethnicity, educational level, marital status, your relationship to the patient, and your religious preference). It should take about 5-10 minutes to complete. You will complete 1 questionnaire about your overall satisfaction of the care your family member or friend has received in the hospital, as well as a question about how much distress you have had before their transfer to the PCU, and a question about the level of comfort you have with your family member/friend being transferred to the PCU. You will be asked to answer these questions based on your experience with the inpatient oncology service. These questionnaires should take about 10 minutes to complete. After you complete the first set of questionnaires, you will complete the same questionnaires about your overall satisfaction of the care your family member or friend received in the PCU, how much distress you have had in the past 2 days, and level of comfort you have with your family member/friend being transferred to the PCU. You will be asked to answer these questions based on your experience in the PCU. One (1) new questionnaire will ask you to compare the care your family member or friend received with the palliative care consult service to the care your family member/friend received in the PCU. These questionnaires should take also about 10 minutes to complete. Length of Study You participation on this study will be over after you complete the second set of questionnaires.</detailed_description>
