	<brief_summary>Infiltration of the greater occipital nerve (GON) with local anaesthetics and corticosteroids is a treatment option for cluster headache. Corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing the pain intensity and frequency in chronic migrtaine. This RCT is set up to assess efficacy and safety of sub-occipital steroid injections with local anesthetic in patients with chronic migraine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infiltration of the greater occipital nerve (GON) with local anaesthetics and corticosteroids is a treatment option for cluster headache. In general, there is a marked paucity of evidence concerning GON blocks in migraine. Corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing the pain intensity and frequency in these patients. This is an RCT to assess efficacy and safety of sub-occipital steroid injections with local anesthetic in patients with chronic migraine.</detailed_description>
