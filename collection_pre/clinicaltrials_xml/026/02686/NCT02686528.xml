	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if hip precautions, which are instructions that limit functional use of a hip replacement after surgery, affect the rate of dislocation in the first six weeks after primary total hip replacement surgery. The impact of hip precautions on a patient's return to activities of daily living and overall patient satisfaction will also be investigated. The overall cost effectiveness of hip precautions will be determined.</brief_summary>
