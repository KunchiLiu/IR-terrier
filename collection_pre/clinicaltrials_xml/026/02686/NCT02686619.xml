	<brief_summary>This multicentre, prospective, randomized, open-label study will compare the safety and efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil with delayed introduction of sirolimus and discontinuation of cyclosporine, with those of mycophenolate mofetil and long term continuation of cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients receiving daclizumab (Zenapax) as induction treatment and followed by 8 month treatment with corticosteroids. The anticipated time on study treatment is 12 months. Participants who will complete the initial 12-month study and who will provide written informed consent will be eligible to participate in a 60-month follow-up phase.</brief_summary>
