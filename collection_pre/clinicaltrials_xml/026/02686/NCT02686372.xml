	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) recurrence rate is high among liver transplant patients, while treatment measures are limited. This study plans to recruit 10 subjects with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) related HCC after liver transplantation. The objective of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of the HBV specific T cell receptor (HBV/TCR) redirected T cell in the target population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TCR-Redirected T Cell Infusions to Prevent Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence Post Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single armed and open labelled trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and HBV infection (HBsAg+) post liver transplantation. For patients who successfully match TCR histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) restriction, escalating doses of HBV/TCR expressing autologous T cells will be infused. Tests will be done to confirmed safety and efficacy during the two-month treatment and observation period and twice each year of a follow up period up to five years.</detailed_description>
