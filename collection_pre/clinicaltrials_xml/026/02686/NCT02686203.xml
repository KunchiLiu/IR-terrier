	<detailed_description>evaluating The Investigational Therapy effects on quality of life, pain and patient's clinical status in adult cancer patients with solid tumors who are no longer candidates for active oncological therapies. Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and receive at least two 20-min treatment sessions, 2 to 12 weeks apart, with the Investigational Therapy on healthy body tissue (i.e. non-tumor region) of back of the hand and/or foot. Number of treatment sessions and treatment frequency will be individualized per patient depending on patient's status as well as per the discretion of the treating therapist, who is specialized and experienced with using the Investigational Therapy. Patients will be assessed for quality of life, pain and patient's clinical status according to acceptable clinical evaluations. If at any time after the start of this study, it will be decided to initiate active oncological treatment, the principal investigator or designee will inform the Sponsor. The Sponsor will decide if the patient will stay or be discontinued from the study.</detailed_description>
