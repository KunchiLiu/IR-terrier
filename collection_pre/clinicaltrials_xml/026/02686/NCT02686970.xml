	<brief_title>Spanish Adaptation and Study of Reliability of the European Quality Questionnaire (EuroQ2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to adapt and validate a Spanish-language version of the European Quality Questionnaire (EuroQ2). Using a forward-backward translation methodology, we will translate the EuroQ2 into Spanish and will evaluate its psychometric characteristics in a clinical sample of 200 family members responsible for making medical decisions for patients who are discharged from the ICU or who died in the ICU. Cronbach's alpha values, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) will be evaluated in order to know the reliability, construct validity, and convergent validity.</detailed_description>
