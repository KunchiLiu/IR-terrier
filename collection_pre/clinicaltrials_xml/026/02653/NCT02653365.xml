	<criteria>Presence of ACPE diagnosed based on SpO2 below 90% with &gt;5 L/ min oxygen via reservoir face mask Acute respiratory distress as evidenced by severe dyspnea Breathing frequency of &gt;30 breaths/min, and use of accessory respiratory muscles or paradoxical abdominal motion in association with tachycardia Cardiac gallops, bilateral rales, and typical findings of congestion on chest radiography, without a history suggesting pulmonary aspiration or evidence of pneumonia. Patients were excluded from the study if they were intubated before ICU admission, or required immediate intubation without prior NIV, or presented a respiratory or cardiac arrest Severe hemodynamic instability (systolic arterial pressure &lt;70 mmHg despite adequate fluid repletion and use of vasoactive agents) or lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias. Patients were also excluded if they were unresponsive, agitated, and unable to cooperate; or if they had any condition that precluded application of a face mask including upper airway obstruction Recent oral or facial trauma or surgery Recent gastric or esophageal surgery Inability to clear respiratory secretions or high risk for aspiration. In addition, patients were excluded if they had a "do not intubate" order or refused research authorization.</criteria>
