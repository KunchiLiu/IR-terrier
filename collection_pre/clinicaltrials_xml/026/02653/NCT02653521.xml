	<detailed_description>The aim of study is to evaluate the benefit of adaptive radiation therapy(ART) for esophageal cancer. 80 patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer will be treated with 3D-CRT(three dimensional conformal radiotherapy, 3D-CRT)/IMRT(intensity modulated radiotherapy, IMRT), dividing to experimental group and control group (40 patients each). All patients are kVCT(kilo-voltage computed tomography, kVCT) scanned weekly(the fifth fraction in a week) and CBCT (cone beam computed tomography, CBCT) scanned per fraction before treatment. Irradiated dose distribution of each patient is calculated using the CBCT images corrected with validated modelling and accumulate the volumetric dose for all PTV(planning target volume,PTV) and OARs(organs at risk, OAR) using deformable registration algorithm. For the experimental group, replan the treatment when the target volume is not covered by the prescribed dose or OARs is overdose beyond the action level to achieve an optimal dose distribution. Conversely, no action is taken in the control group and the original plan will be used for the full treatment course. Dosimetric parameters (such as the ratio of target coverage, the mean dose of OARs, etc) ,treatment toxicities (such as radiation pneumonitis and esophagitis), PFS（Progress Free Survival,PFS）and OS（Overall Survival, OS）of the two groups will be analyzed and compared in the study.</detailed_description>
