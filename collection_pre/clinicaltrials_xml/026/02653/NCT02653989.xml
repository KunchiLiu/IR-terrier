	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MDV9300 in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that have achieved either stable disease or a partial remission following definitive salvage therapy. Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled: a cohort treated with salvage chemotherapy but considered ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), and a cohort of patients who have received ASCT following salvage chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
