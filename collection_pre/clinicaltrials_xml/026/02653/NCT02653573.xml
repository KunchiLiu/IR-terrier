	<brief_title>Young Adult Hypertension Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To address the unmet need for hypertension care in young adults, MyHEART (My Hypertension Education and Reaching Target), a multi-component hypertension intervention was developed. Eligible patients were identified via the healthcare system's electronic health record. Inclusion criteria included: 1. 18-39 years old at the start of the study, 2. previous hypertension ICD-9 coded office visits and 3. uncontrolled hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg) based on the last ambulatory blood pressure reading. Exclusion criteria included a pre-defined list of co-morbidities, in addition to planned or current pregnancy, any health condition that limits physical activity or dietary changes, current participation in another study, and planning to leave the area in the next three months. During the feasibility study, all participants continued to receive usual hypertension care from their primary care provider. The intervention involved health coach calls over a 3-month period using self-management modules. The order of the modules was guided by the participant's choice. All encounters were documented in the electronic health record. Patient acceptability and home blood pressure monitoring survey data was acquired.</detailed_description>
