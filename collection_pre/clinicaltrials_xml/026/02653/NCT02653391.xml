	<criteria>Adults ≥18 years old at the time of Screening Visit Diagnosis of FCED OU based on clinical and ophthalmic test findings Clinical evidence of corneal edema OU diagnosed with FCED, including one or more of the following signs: corneal epithelial microcysts, corneal epithelial bullae, stromal folds, or stromal haze Central corneal thickness of 550 μm to 700 μm (inclusive) in at least one eye diagnosed with FCED, as measured by ultrasonic pachymetry at the time of Screening Visit and Baseline Visit Bestcorrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/25 to 20/320 (inclusive) at the time of Screening Visit and Baseline Visit OU Women of childbearing potential must agree to use birth control as specified in the protocol from the date they sign the informed consent form (ICF) until after the last study Able to give informed consent and willing to comply with all study visits and examinations Corneal findings of any type (including, but not limited to, stromal haze or stromal scarring), in either eye, that, based on investigator's assessment, limit the probability of visual improvement after corneal deturgescence Any ocular pathology requiring treatment with topical ophthalmic drops, with the exception of glaucoma or ocular hypertension Use of topical hypertonic saline drops for 3 days prior to Screening and throughout the duration of the study History of corneal disease (other than FCED) or corneal surgery in either eye Current use or likely need for the use of contact lens at any time during the study History of previous corneal or anterior segment surgery such as LASIK, photorefractive keratectomy, endothelial keratoplasty, penetrating keratoplasty cataract surgery or glaucoma surgery. Any disease or medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent the subject from participating in the study or might confound study results Participation in other investigational drug or device clinical trials within 30 days prior to enrollment, or planning to participate in any other investigational drug or device clinical trials within 30 days of study completion Women who are pregnant or lactating Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
