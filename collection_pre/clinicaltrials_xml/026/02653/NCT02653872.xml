	<brief_title>A Phase I Study to Assess PK of AZD7986 Alone &amp; With Verapamil, Itraconazole or Diltiazem in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open-label, non-randomised, fixed sequence, 3-period study conducted at a single study centre to assess the PK of AZD7986 in healthy subjects when administered alone and in combination with multiple doses of verapamil and itraconazole or diltiazem. An adaptive design with an interim analysis of the PK data from Periods 1 and 2 will be used to determine which of itraconazole or diltiazem will be administered in combination with AZD7986 in Period 3. Treatments to be administered in a fixed order separated by a washout period: period 1 - single AZD7986 (25 mg) on Day 1 (1 hour before food), washout 7 days period 2 - verapamil (240 mg extended release formulation) daily 1 hour before food (Day 1 to 10) and a single dose of AZD7986 (25 mg) 1 hour before food (Day 5), washout period 14 days period 3 - subject to interim pharmacokinetic analysis of AZD7986 alone compared with AZD7986 and verapamil combined, either itraconazole (200 mg, oral solution formulation 10mg/mL) administered twice on Day 1 and daily on days 2 to 11 (1 hour before food) plus AZD7986 (25mg) single dose on Day 6 (1 hour before food); or diltiazem (360 mg, extended release formulation) on Days 1 to 13 (1 hour before food) plus AZD7986 (25 mg) 1 hour before food on Day 8.</detailed_description>

Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the resting electrocardiogram (ECG) and any clinically important abnormalities in the 12 Lead ECG as considered by the investigator that may interfere with the interpretation of ECG interval measured from the onset of the QRS complex (electrical activity or ventricular contraction on the ECG where Q represents the downward deflection, R represents upward deflection and S represents a downward one) to the end of the T wave corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval changes, including abnormal STTwave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular hypertrophy. 8. Prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 450 ms or shortened QTcF &lt; 340 ms or family history of long QT syndrome. 9. PR (PQ) interval shortening &lt; 120 ms (PR &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 120 ms is acceptable if there is no evidence of ventricular preexcitation). 10.
