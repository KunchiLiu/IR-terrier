	<brief_summary>Pulse pressure variation (PPV) is a well-known and widely used dynamic preload indicator based on heart-lung interaction to predict fluid responsiveness. Generally, patients are considered to be fluid-responsive when the PPV value larger than 11-13%. However, several previous researches demonstrated that there is a zone of uncertainty (grey zone) in PPV. To predict fluid-responsiveness accurately in the patients with PPV within grey zone (9-13%), the investigators would evaluate the augmented PPV using augmented ventilation.</brief_summary>
