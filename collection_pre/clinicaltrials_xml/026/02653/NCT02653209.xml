	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to identify subgroups of patients with type 2 diabetes that respond well or poorly to particular drugs based on particular clinical characteristics such as their weight or kidney function, to enable better targeting of treatment for a particular individual. This study will test 2 hypotheses of drug response supported by routine clinical and trial data. 600 patients with type 2 diabetes who have suboptimal glycaemic control on dual oral therapy will be recruited to a randomised double-blind crossover study of a DPP4 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione. Each patient will take each study drug in addition to their existing treatment for four months at a time. At the end of each treatment the patient's glucose control will be measured and information about their experience of the drug will be collected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TriMaster: Study of a DPP4 Inhibitor, SGLT2 Inhibitor and Thiazolidinedione as Third Line Therapy in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a phase 4 randomised double-blind crossover study of a DPP4 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione as third line therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes who have suboptimal glycaemic control on dual therapy with metformin and a sulphonylurea. 600 patients aged 30-80 who have been on stable doses of 2 classes of therapy (not including the trial IMPs or GLP1-agonist) for at least 3 months with HbA1c &gt;58mmol/mol (7.5%) will receive three double-blinded third-line non-injectable therapies. On recruitment into the study participants will have underlying pathophysiology assessed in a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) and samples will be collected for baseline analysis and storage for future biomarker analysis and discovery. Participants will then receive 16 weeks of each over-encapsulated blinded therapy in random order. At the end of each treatment period, fasting blood will be taken to measure glycaemic response (HbA1c), fasting glucose and insulin concentrations trough drug levels and to confirm continued eligibility. Weight, blood pressure and. data about patient experience will also be collected including perceived side effects, preparedness to remain on therapy, psychological health and health related quality of life. At the end of the study, patient treatment preference will be recorded after feeding back to the patient for each of the 3 therapies their HbA1c, weight change, frequency of hypoglycaemias, any patient reported side effects and the patient's verdict on each therapy will be recorded. Each participant will be asked which treatments they would take long term and the reason for their preference.</detailed_description>
