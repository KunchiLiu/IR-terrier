	<brief_summary>This pilot study tests the hypothesis that the medication nitric oxide extract from beetroot juice improves blood flow to the skeletal muscle during exercise. The investigators will use cutting edge technology with contrast enhanced ultrasound to visualize the microvascular blood supply to the forearm. Animal studies have shown reversal of muscle damage with improved delivery of blood to the exercising muscle. This research aims to understand the mechanism of action of this medication in a way it has never been studied before. The results may help benefit individuals with muscular Dystrophy in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Skeletal Muscle Blood Flow in Becker Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subjects are asked to perform a graded hand-grip exercise while blood flow to the skeletal muscle is visualized by contrast enhanced ultrasound. This is done at baseline and after taking the study agent.</detailed_description>
