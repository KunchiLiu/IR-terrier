	<brief_summary>The outcome predictors for cardiac surgery has been popular for many researchers and clinicians. Determining risk factors before surgery reduce morbidity and mortality after surgery. Some routine blood results have been used as predictors for cardiac surgery but none of the researches studied red cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, platelet/lymphocyte ratio and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. This study focused on these parameters and to see whether these parameters can be predictors for cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
