	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators are going to assess the feasibility of this innovate technique of renal sympathetic denervation by translumbar access under ct-guidance. To limit the potential impact on the kidney, the investigators chose a population of chronic renal failure patients on dialysis or renal transplant (with native kidneys still present) and having resistant treatment hypertension despite antihypertensive combination therapy well conducted. The investigators expect to obtain a decrease of the blood pressure at the 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) one month after the sympathetic denervation.</brief_summary>
