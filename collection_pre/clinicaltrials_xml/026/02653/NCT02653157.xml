	<brief_summary>This is a prospective observational study to determine the role of colonization and identify the timing of development of drug resistance in multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) causing infection among critically ill burn patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multidrug Resistant Gram-negative Bacilli Colonization and Infection in Burn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective observational study. Patients will be followed during a single admission for development of colonization or infection with MDR-GNB. Patient clinical characteristics, including infections, surgeries, and antibiotic exposure, will be collected in real-time. Weekly surveillance wound and peri-rectal swabs and, if intubated, biweekly deep endotracheal or tracheostomy aspirates will be collected, de-identified, and stored from all patients and examined for the presence of MDR-GNB. All GNB isolates from blood, urine, respiratory, and wound cultures will be collected, coded, and stored.</detailed_description>
