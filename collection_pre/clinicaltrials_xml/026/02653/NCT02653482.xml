	<brief_title>Dapagliflozin Effect on Symptoms and Biomarkers in Diabetes Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of once-daily dapagliflozin 10 mg on heart failure disease-specific biomarkers (BNP and NTproBNP), symptoms, health status, and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure with reduced systolic function.</detailed_description>
