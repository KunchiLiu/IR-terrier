	<brief_summary>This is an open-label comparative study in three parallel groups. It is expected that 90 patients and/or healthy volunteers will participate in this biomedical research. Distribution in groups - 30 patients with type 2 diabetes and an indication for treatment with a GLP1 analogue (group 1) - 30 patients with type 2 diabetes (control diabetic subjects) not treated with Incretins (group 2) - 30 healthy subjects (non-diabetics) (group 3) This study will investigate modifications in eating behaviour induced by Liraglutide in patients who start treatment with Victoza® and certain aspects, such as liking (hedonic characteristic of a food), wanting (desire to eat a given food) and salivation in response to the presentation of a food by taking measurements at D0 (before initiation of the treatment with Liraglutide in the group concerned) then at 15 days (except for the controls), 3 months and 9 months (only for controls).</brief_summary>
