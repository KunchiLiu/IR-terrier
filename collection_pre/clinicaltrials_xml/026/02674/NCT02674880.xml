	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to test the effect of HMW-HA on NIV effectiveness in patients admitted to a sub-intensive care unit for respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of COPD. The design is a parallel-arm, single-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. Eighty patients, aged eighteen years or older, admitted for respiratory failure primarily due to COPD exacerbation and requiring non-invasive ventilation will be enrolled and randomized to the study treatment (active or placebo). All patients will be treated with NIV delivered using a Hamilton C1 ventilator and medical therapy according to current guidelines (inhaled long-acting b2 agonists, inhaled long-acting anticholinergic, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics). Patients randomized to the active intervention group will also receive HMW-HA (YabroÂ® - 5 ml of saline containing 0.3% hyaluronic acid sodium salt) via nebulizer b.i.d., while patients randomized in the control group will receive a matching placebo. Patients will be treated until weaning or until NIV failure, defined as oro-tracheal intubation or death.</detailed_description>
