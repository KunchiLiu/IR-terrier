	<brief_title>Maximum Oxygen Uptake in ACL-injured Professional Soccer Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is considered a major injury and may affect the career of professional soccer players. Surgical ACL reconstruction is often required to treat the resulting knee instability. Although ACL reconstruction is considered a successful procedure in restoring knee stability, literature shows that only 55% of the participants return to competitive sports participation after surgery. Soccer players need technical, tactical and physical skills to succeed, such as good knee function and aerobic capacity. Our purpose is to evaluate maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) in ACL-injured professional soccer players and after a six-month period of post-operative rehabilitation, compared to a control group of healthy professional soccer players.</detailed_description>
