	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the utility of buspirone in patients who have a diagnosis of functional dysphagia. All participants will be randomized to receive either a placebo pill or buspirone. Subsequently, we will evaluate whether their swallowing is improved. Participants who were randomized to receive placebo will then receive buspirone and those who were receiving buspirone will receive placebo. We will again evaluate whether their swallowing improved.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Buspirone for Functional Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Buspirone helps to modulate molecules which can affect the activity of the muscles in the esophagus. Studies in the past have shown that in healthy people, buspirone can improve the vigor with which the esophagus squeezes to propel food into the stomach. In patients with functional dysphagia, the esophagus muscles may be weak (as defined by manometry). Our two phase study will evaluate both symptoms of difficulty swallowing and the vigor with which the esophagus propels a bolus in patients after they 1) receive placebo pills and 2) receive buspirone pills. We hypothesize that the placebo pills will not affect the vigor of the muscles or the symptoms of difficulty swallowing, but that buspirone will improve both outcomes.</detailed_description>
