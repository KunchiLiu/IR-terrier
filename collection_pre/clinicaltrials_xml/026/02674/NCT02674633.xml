	<detailed_description>The study will be a randomized, parallel group, controlled trial of two videogame-like (iPad-based) digital therapies. The study will consist of 3 primary phases: Screening, Washout/Baseline, and Treatment. During the Screening Phase (Day -28 to Day -7), participants will undergo screening to evaluate eligibility for the study. Screening may take place up to 28 days before the Baseline Visit (Day 0). For those children currently on medication for ADHD the Washout period will begin 7 days prior to Baseline where treatment will be discontinued. On Day 0, the Baseline visit will occur wherein additional eligibility criteria will be established. The Treatment Phase (Day 1 to Day 27) will involve using the digital therapy at home for each participant followed by an In-Clinic assessment on Day 28 to assess key outcomes. Compliance with treatment/use requirements will be monitored remotely during this phase.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed ADHD diagnosis, any presentation, at Screening based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental HealthFifth Edition criteria and established via the MINIInternational Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents administered by a trained clinician Screening/Baseline score on the clinicianrated ADHDRSIV score &gt;= 28 Screening/Baseline score on the TOVA 8 API &lt;= 1.8 Not undergoing pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate or amphetaminebased products at time of Screening; or, if undergoing pharmacological treatment, must be willing and appropriate (i.e. not optimally treated in the investigator's judgment) to wash out of current regimen Ability to follow written and verbal instructions (English), as assessed by the PI Estimated Intelligence Quotient score &gt;= 80 as assessed by the Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBITII) Ability to comply with all the testing and requirements. Current, controlled (requiring a restricted medication) or uncontrolled, comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, based on MINIKID and subsequent clinical interviewing, with significant symptoms including but not limited to posttraumatic stress disorder, psychosis, bipolar illness, pervasive developmental disorder, severe obsessive compulsive disorder, severe depressive or severe anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, or other symptomatic manifestations that in the opinion of the Investigator that may confound study data/assessments. Participants with clinical history of learning disorders will be allowed to participate, provided the disorder does not impact their ability to participate in the trial based on PI judgment Participants who are currently treated with a nonstimulant medication for ADHD (i.e., atomoxetine, clonidine clonidine, guanfacine) Initiation within the last 4 weeks of behavioral therapy. Participants who have been in behavior therapy consistently for more than 4 weeks may participate provided their routine is unchanged during the course of the study. Participants planning on changing or initiating behavior therapy during the course of the study will be excluded Participant is currently considered a suicide risk in the opinion of the Investigator, has previously made a suicide attempt, or has a prior history of, or is currently demonstrating active suicidal ideation or selfinjurious behavior as measured by Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale at screening Motor condition (e.g., physical deformity of the hands/arms; prostheses) that prevents game playing as reported by the parent or observed by the investigator Recent history (within the past 6 months) of suspected substance abuse or dependence History of seizures (exclusive of febrile seizures), or significant motor or vocal tics, including but not limited to Tourette's Disorder Has participated in a clinical trial within 90 days prior to screening Diagnosis of or parentreported color blindness (Confirmed inclinic via ICBT) Uncorrected visual acuity (Confirmed inclinic via ability of subject to play the intervention) Regular use of psychoactive drugs (other than stimulant) that in the opinion of the Investigator may confound study data/assessments Any other medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator may confound study data/assessments Has a sibling also enrolled/currently participating in the same study Has previously participated in a study of Akili's EVO videogamelike digital therapy</criteria>
