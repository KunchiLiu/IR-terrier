	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to use Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring on participants undergoing shoulder surgery in the beach chair position to determine cerebral desaturation events and to further determine cognitive changes pre and post surgery using the Mini Mental State Exam.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of Cognitive Outcomes After Anesthesia on Patients in the Beach Chair Position</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective, randomized, controlled study, investigators used a standardized anesthesia protocol to maintain the MAP during surgeries done in the BCP. Investigators hypothesized that, if the MAP was maintained, NIRS monitoring would not change intra-operative anesthesia management and would not affect the post-operative cognitive outcomes of participants undergoing surgery in the beach chair position. Investigators secondarily wanted to document the actual incidence of cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) recorded by NIRS occurring in participants placed in the BCP if the MAP was strictly maintained.</detailed_description>
