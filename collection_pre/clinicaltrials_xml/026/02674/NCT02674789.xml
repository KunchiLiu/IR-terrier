	<brief_title>Ionized Magnesium in Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnesium is an essential micronutrient for health and exercise performance. Deficiencies are common, especially in case of insufficient diets. Athletes are a population at risk of magnesium deficiency, as they can have strong nutritional (dis)believes and increased losses through sweat. That is why monitoring magnesium status in athletes is very important. Ionized magnesium is the active form of total magnesium, this value might be even more important than total magnesium. However, whether ionized magnesium is influenced by day variation is not clear yet. In addition: one bout of exercise can change magnesium status and probably ionized magnesium status. For people active in sports it is important to be aware of this variation in magnesium status, to prevent the diagnosis of false inadequate magnesium status. Therefore it is the aim of this proposal to determine whether ionized magnesium varies within one day and whether it changes after an acute bout of exercise. Objective: The main objective is to investigate whether ionized magnesium concentration varies during one day, and whether it is changed after one bout of exercise Study design: This will be a cross-over design. With screening and preliminary tests before the exercise test day and the non-exercise test day. The order in which exercise day and non-exercise day will be done, will be randomly divided between the participants. Intervention: A rest day and an exercise day At exercise day: an exercise test of 90 min at 70% of VO2max. Blood samples are taken at set time points during rest day and exercise day</detailed_description>
