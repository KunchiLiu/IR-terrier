	<brief_summary>This study investigates if live feedback during home-based exercises will improve the ability to perform the exercises with the prescribed time under tension (TUT) per repetition compared with no feedback among adolescents with patellofemoral pain. The hypothesis is that adolescents who receive live feedback from BandCizer™ will have a mean TUT that is significantly closer to the prescribed TUT compared to the group not receiving feedback during the course of the intervention.</brief_summary>
