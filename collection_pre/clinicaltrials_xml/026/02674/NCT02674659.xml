	<brief_summary>This research will add resistance training to patients who undergo cardiac rehabilitation program after coronary bypass surgery, comparing the level of PCSK9 level on that group to another group who receives conventional rehabilitation program (only aerobic exercise)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Resistance Training on Proprotein Subtilisin Convertase Kexin 9 Level After Coronary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PCSK9 level will be measured before and after cardiac rehabilitation program (around 2-4 weeks), and will be compared between two groups. ELISA method will be used to measure plasma PCSK9 level. Resistance training will be given by professional trainer in gymnasium of National Cardiac Center Harapan Kita, following rules from American College of Sports Medicine guideline regarding to exercise after cardiac event.</detailed_description>
