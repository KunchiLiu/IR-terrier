	<brief_title>A Mass Balance Study With a Microtracer Dose of 14C-esketamine in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, open-label (identity of study drug will be known to participant and study staff), single-dose, parallel-group study. The study consist of Screening Phase (Days -21 to -2), Open-label treatment Phase (Day -1 up to Day 8) and End of Study (9 to 13 days after last study assessment). The total duration of study from the Screening Phase through Follow-up, is 37-41 days. Participants will be assigned to 1 of the two groups (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) during the treatment phase. The participants will be primarily evaluated to determine the metabolic disposition of radiolabeled esketamine administered by the oral and intravenous routes. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

Note: Average from 3 supine measurements will be used at screening visit A 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with normal cardiac conduction and function, including: Sinus rhythm; Heart rate between 45 and 90 beats per minute (bpm); QTc interval less than or equal to (&lt;=)450 milliseconds (ms); QRS interval of &lt;110 ms; PR interval &lt;200 ms; Morphology consistent with healthy cardiac conduction and function Participants diagnosed with a current or previous psychiatric or bipolar disorder, as assessed by the investigator, will not be permitted to participate in the study Current suicidal or homicidal ideation/intent/behavior as assessed by Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) at screening Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis at screening or at admission to the study center on Day 1 as deemed appropriate by the investigator Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs or 12lead ECG at screening or Day 1, and as deemed appropriate by the investigator Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication (including vitamins and herbal supplements) within 14 days before study drug administration is scheduled, except for acetaminophen</criteria>
