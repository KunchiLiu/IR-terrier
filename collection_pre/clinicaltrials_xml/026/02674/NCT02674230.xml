	<brief_summary>This study aims to study the relationships between obesity, circadian rhythm, and aging. The investigators set up a prospective cohort registry for morbid obesity, obesity, and normal subjects with annual follow-up. The cohort aims to investigate the pathophysiological, molecular, genetic, and cellular aspects of the relationships between obesity, circadian deregulation, and impacts on aging. Clinical data, questionnaires, biological material, and molecular signatures will be collected and investigated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this observational study is the follow-up of 2000 adult obesity (BMI ≥ 35 and 24-35 kg/m2) and non-obese subjects with annual follow-up for 10 years. Clinical data, biochemistry, and biological samples (serum, DNA, RNA, white blood cells) will be collected and stored. Adipose tissues will be collected if participants received liposuction, plastic surgery, bariatric surgery, dermatological procedure, intra-abdominal operation, and cardiovascular surgery. Questionnaires will be obtained with special nurse including sleep quality, chronotypes, and circadian activities. During follow up period, major adverse cardiovascular events will be monitored. The investigators anticipate that the results generated from the study will provide valuable data to a better understanding of the relationships between obesity, circadian rhythm, and aging.</detailed_description>
