	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to determine differences in outcomes in patients who receive regional anesthesia (a fascia iliaca block) versus placebo prior to undergoing hip arthroscopy with labral repair and/or debridement and osteoplasty for hip impingement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Anesthesia in Hip Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: After informed consent is obtained at a routine/pre-surgical clinic visit, all patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo randomization into one of two groups. These groups are 1) to receive regional anesthesia (a single shot fascia iliaca block using bupivacaine) prior to hip arthroscopy, or 2) undergo a subcutaneous injection procedure using a normal saline placebo (0.9% sodium chloride in water) instead of bupivacaine. Intra-operatively, both groups will receive general anesthesia and local anesthesia (lidocaine and bupivacaine in the peripheral compartment).</detailed_description>
