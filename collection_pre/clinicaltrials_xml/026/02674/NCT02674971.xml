	<brief_summary>For weight loss to occur, energy intake needs to be reduced to incur an energy deficit. One dietary strategy that may facilitate reducing energy intake and enhancing weight loss is consuming a diet low in dietary energy density (ED). The ED of a given food, defined as the ratio of energy of the food to the weight of the food (kcal/g), is largely determined by water content, but is also affected by fat and fiber. Although the 2010 Dietary Guidelines encourage an eating pattern low in energy density (ED) to manage weight, it is currently not known what the best strategy is for reducing ED in the diet. Eating a greater number of foods low in ED or reducing the number of foods high in ED may reduce overall dietary ED. As ED is believed to reduce intake by allowing a greater weight of food relative to total energy consumed assisting with enhancing feelings of fullness, it is anticipated that either increasing consumption of low-ED foods in the diet alone or combining an increase in consumption of low-ED foods with a decrease in consumption of high-ED foods may be the best strategies for reducing overall dietary ED for weight loss.</brief_summary>
