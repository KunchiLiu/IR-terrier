	<brief_title>GAS-Hem Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive, congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficient or defective coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). The absence of FVIII leads to 'spontaneous' bleeding episodes (occurring primarily in joints, muscles and, less commonly, in soft tissues) and to excessive bleeding following trauma or injury. With proper treatment (FVIII) and self-care, most hemophilia patients can maintain an active, productive lifestyle. With a growing appreciation that a low bleed rate sometimes is only achieved, in part, by patients limiting their activities, there has been growing interest in understanding how hemophilia may still limit life despite absence of major bleeds. The current study will introduce and test a standardized method for individualized outcome measurement based on Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), a method that allows participants to set goals to address challenges that are meaningful to them and monitor attainment in those areas over time. The Standardized Goal Attainment Scaling menu for Hemophilia (GAS-Hem) is an online instrument for setting and tracking personalized goals related to hemophilia. The goal menu captures common challenges faced by people with hemophilia, accompanied by an inventory of descriptors that can be personalized. The tool can be used to track the health of individuals across a wide spectrum of ages, life experiences and health states. This is a 12-week, multicenter, prospective, observational, feasibility study of up to 60 people (aged 5 and 65) with moderate to severe hemophilia A to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of GAS-Hem as a patient reported outcome (PRO) measure to monitor clinical progress in participant-identified goal areas. Outcomes, including GAS-Hem (primary), health-related quality of life, bleeding episodes (location, cause, time) and treatment (time, dose and reason for infusion) will be assessed at screen/baseline, with follow-up at 6 and 12 weeks. Endpoints of interest include participant GAS-Hem outcomes at 6 and 12 weeks, participant quality of life (QoL) outcomes at 6 and 12 weeks, as well as participant and clinician perception of the GAS-Hem as a useful means of identifying and monitoring progress in relevant goal areas.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Participant has a documented diagnosis of hemophilia A 2. Participant has documented clotting factor levels of 5% or less 3. Participant is on a prescribed regimen of continuous prophylaxis. Continuous prophylaxis is defined by the World Federation of Hemophilia as "… the intent of treating for 52 weeks a year and receiving a minimum of an a priori defined frequency of infusions for at least 45 weeks (85%) of the year under consideration" 4. Participant is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol 5. Participant is proficient in the English language to allow for use of the Standardized Goal Attainment Scaling menu for Hemophilia (GASHem) tool. 1. Participants with an active Factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitory antibody (≥ 0.4 Bethesda units (BU) using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay or ≥ 0.6 BU using the Bethesda assay) at any time prior to screening 2. Participant has been diagnosed with an inherited or acquired hemostatic defect other than hemophilia A (eg, qualitative platelet defect or von Willebrand's disease) 3. Participant has participated in a clinical study involving a medicinal product or device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is scheduled to participate in a clinical study involving a medical product or device during the course of this study 4. Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator</criteria>
