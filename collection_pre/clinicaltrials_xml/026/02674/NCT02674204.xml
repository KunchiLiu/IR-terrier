	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to to examine the effects of atorvastatin, a type of statin, on changes to the heart among women undergoing breast cancer treatment. Atorvastatin may reduce or eliminate the harmful effects of chemotherapy treatment to the heart tissue of breast cancer patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a placebo-controlled study. It will compare the effects of atorvastatin against the effects of a placebo (an inactive substance, such as, a sugar pill) on changes to the heart before and during breast cancer treatment. Participants will be in the study for approximately a year and a half, and the study will enroll up to 90 patients. During that time, there will be three study visits in addition to any standard of care visits. Participants will also receive telephone calls from study staff during the study intervention and a follow-up phase to check-in with them. Analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis on all patients who complete the third study visit's Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</detailed_description>
