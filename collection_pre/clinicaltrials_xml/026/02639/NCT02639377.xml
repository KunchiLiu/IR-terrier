	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to analyze the efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate as a chemical adjuvant for the treatment of peri-implant mucositis in single implants compared with homologous teeth with gingivitis, in a non-surgical treatment protocol with a six-month follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of 0.12% Chlorhexidine Gluconate for Peri-implant Mucositis and Gingivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following clinical parameters were evaluated in both test and control groups; visible plaque index (VPI) and gingival bleeding index (GBI) were obtained for full mouth (IPV and ISG) and for each implant and teeth (VPI implant; VPI teeth; GBI implant; GBI teeth). For statistical purposes, percentages of faces with biofilm and marginal bleeding at teeth and implants were calculated. These parameters were evaluated at baseline and at one, three and six months post-therapy. Probing depth (PD implant; PD teeth) and bleeding on probing (BOP implant; BOP teeth) were collected for all implants and teeth with a North Carolina periodontal probe at six sites. After data collection, an arithmetic averages of the sites with bleeding on probing and probing depths were calculated at baseline, three and six months. The peri-implant and periodontal biotype for each implant and teeth was rated as thin or thick, according to probe transparency during probing depth.</detailed_description>
