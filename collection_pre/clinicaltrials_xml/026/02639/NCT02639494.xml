	<brief_summary>An evaluation of the feasibility of using the Self-Centering Guide Catheter to deliver a guide wire across a stenotic native aortic valve into the left ventricle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Centering Guide Catheter Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, open-label, single-arm feasibility study evaluating the Self-Centering Guide Catheter. All subjects who are candidates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) of a native valve with a transcatheter aortic valve that is introduced percutaneously via the femoral artery using conventional catheterization techniques will be evaluated for enrollment in this study. The Self-Centering Guide Catheter is intended to facilitate delivery of a guidewire across a stenotic native aortic valve and into the left ventricle.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must be at least 18 years of age. Subject (or legal guardian) understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides written informed consent before any studyspecific tests or procedures are performed. Subject is eligible for and is an acceptable candidate for transcatheter aortic valve replacement of a stenotic (aortic valve area ≤1 cm2, aortic jet velocity ≥4.0 m/s, or mean gradient ≥40 mmHg) native valve with a transcatheter aortic valve that is introduced percutaneously via the femoral artery using conventional catheterization techniques. Subject has known hypersensitivity to the components of the device (e.g., polyether block amide, fluoropolymers, nickel, platinum, tantalum, titanium). Subject has a preexisting prosthetic aortic valve.</criteria>
