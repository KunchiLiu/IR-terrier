	<detailed_description>Measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is simple, inexpensive, safe and accurate method in determining the presence of intra-abdominal hypertension. This measurement can guide patient management. Monitoring intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal per-fusion pressure. for signs of abdominal compartment syndrome has become an inexpensive and useful diagnostics tool for identifying complications. An integrated approach to screening and monitoring for intra-abdominal hypertension may improve patient outcomes and decrease hospital costs. Due to the high incidence of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, it is essential for critical care nurses to regularly monitor intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal per-fusion pressure. Critical care nurses have the ability to identify intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, implement and evaluate management interventions. Nursing practice should be centered on evidence based practice guidelines . Nurses should provide a standard of care in managing patients who are at risk of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome from pre hospital, emergency, operating room and intensive care areas</detailed_description>
