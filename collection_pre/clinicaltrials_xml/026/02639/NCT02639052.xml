	<brief_title>Itch Relieving Effect of Botox: a Study in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have shown that botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) has an antipruritic effect due to the inhibition of acetylcholine and other pruritic factors, such as substance P and glutamate. For instance, subcutaneous BoNT/A improves itch accompanied to hand eczema, dermatitis, lichen simplex, and rhinitis. Furthermore, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed that BoNT/A reduced histamine itch intensity in healthy men. Since acetylcholine has been shown to mediate itch in atopic dermatitis, this study aims to test the itch relieving effect of BoNT/A on a non-histaminergic model for chronic itch. This non-histaminergic model using the plant cowhage induces itch by activating protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) receptors, which play a role in the itch of atopic dermatitis, also making this model better suited to test the efficacy of BoNT/A to relive chronic itch.</detailed_description>

Must abstain from the use of moisturizers on the arm. 1. Individuals under 18 or over 50 years of age. 2. Inability to complete the required measures. 3. The presence of an itchy skin disease. 4. Diagnosis of diseased that would affect itch or pain perception (e.g. neuropathies). 5. Currently enrolled in any investigational study in which the subject is receiving any type of drug, biological, or nondrug therapy. 6. Use of oral, topical analgesics, or other medications known to interfere with itch or pain perception in the week prior to the study and throughout the study (e.g. antihistamines, anesthetics, opioids, neuroleptics, etc.). 7. Use of emollients on the arms a week prior to the study and throughout the study. 8. Use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and illicit drugs. 9.
