	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibition in diabetics affects hemodynamic parameters and sympathetic activation in the setting of increasing concentrations of neuropeptide Y, an endogenous peptide. The central hypothesis is that DPP4 inhibition decreases degradation of neuropeptide Y, resulting in increased vasoconstriction and sympathetic activation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of DPP4 Inhibition on Vasoconstriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors are routinely used for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since the prevalence of hypertension is 1.5-3 times greater in diabetics compared to sex-aged matched controls, the use of antihypertensives such as ACE inhibitors is also common in diabetics. DPP4 is involved in the degradation of multiple vasoactive peptides, one of which is neuropeptide Y. This peptide is thought to play a role in blood pressure regulation and sympathetic nervous system activation. The aim of this study is to investigate how DPP4 inhibition affects vasoconstriction in response to increasing neuropeptide Y concentrations. Additionally, the investigators want to understand how the combination of DPP4 inhibition and ACE inhibition affects vasoconstriction and sympathetic activation. Understanding the hemodynamic and neurohumoral changes associated with DPP4 and ACE inhibitors has important implications for the millions of patients with T2DM who take these drugs concurrently.</detailed_description>
