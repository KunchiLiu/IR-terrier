	<brief_summary>Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could have several anatomical causes of obstruction. A sleep endoscopy study is a technique to help determine the anatomical cause of OSA. This study will be using standard of care practice and infuse dexmedetomidine (DEX) to induce sleep. The goals of the study are to (1) confirm airway obstruction with endoscopic view and correlate that with Acoustic Respiratory Rate (RRa) signal at the moment of airway obstruction, and (2) characterize the EEG signals when subjects are under DEX sedation alone.</brief_summary>
