	<brief_summary>This open-label, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of cobimetinib in pediatric and young adult participants with solid tumors with known or potential kinase pathway activation for which standard therapy has proven to be ineffective or intolerable and for which no curative standard-of-care treatment options exist. The study will be conducted in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage at the recommended dose.</brief_summary>
