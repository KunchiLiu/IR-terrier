	<criteria>Subjects may be male or female, and must be aged =/&gt;18 years on the date of signing the informed consent form. Subjects must have histologically confirmed, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pleural or peritoneal predominantly (&gt;50% of tumor component) epithelial mesothelioma or nonsquamous nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both chemotherapynaive and previously treated subjects will be eligible; however, newly diagnosed NSCLC subjects eligible for FDAapproved therapies should have received the same before enrollment (e.g. subjects with epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]mutated and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]translocated NSCLC should have received FDAapproved targeted therapies). Subjects must have at least 1 measurable or evaluable tumor lesion according to RECIST 1.1 (for nonsquamous NSCLC) or mRECIST (for epithelial pleural mesothelioma). Subjects with resected primary tumors who have documented metastases are eligible. Subjects must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Subjects must have ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance Status of 0 or 1 Subjects must have adequate bone marrow, liver, kidney, and coagulation functions. Subjects who have a previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from the cancer being evaluated in this study, or any previous cancer curatively treated &lt;3 years before the start of study Treatment. Subjects who have a history or current evidence of bleeding disorder, i.e. any hemorrhage / bleeding event of CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade ≥2 within 4 weeks before the start of study Treatment. Subjects who have new or progressive brain or meningeal or spinal metastases. Subjects who have a history or current evidence of uncontrolled cardiovascular disease i.e. NYHA (New York Heart Association) Class III or IV. Subjects who have a history or current evidence of uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;95 mmHg at screening despite optimal medical management. Subjects who have a history or current evidence of malignant biliary obstruction requiring biliary stent. Subjects who have had solid organ or bone marrow Transplantation. Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or their excipients, or a history of severe hypersensitivity to any other Antigen. Subjects who have a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or subjects who have an active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection requiring treatment. Subjects who have an active clinically serious infection of CTCAE Grade ≥2 or nonhealing wound unrelated to the primary Tumor. Subjects who have received systemic cancer therapy, radiotherapy, granulocyte colonystimulating factors, (GCSF) or granulocyte macrophagestimulating factors (GMCSF), erythropoietinstimulating agents, investigational drug treatment outside of this study within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment, drugs with known renal toxicity and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers. Subjects who have started oral or parenteral anticoagulation therapy within 2 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine until end of treatment visit.</criteria>
