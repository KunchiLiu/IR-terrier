	<brief_summary>The number of patients 60 and older with breast cancer is increasing as our population ages. Despite the fact that the majority of breast cancers occur in patients 60 and over, these patients are consistently under-represented in clinical trials. Because patients 60 and older are an under-studied group, investigators do not have detailed information on the side effects and experiences for these patients receiving chemotherapy. Understanding the side effects patients receiving chemotherapy experience is an important part of this study. In addition, past research has shown that having poor social support can affect quality of life, mood, and outcomes for people with cancer. However, few studies in the past have focused on improving the quality of life and support systems that patients have while they receive treatment. This research study is evaluating how engaging in an online support community may improve the experience of older patients receiving chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This clinical trial will evaluate how an on-line health information sharing community of patients called PatientsLikeMe, www.patientslikeme.com, [or "PLM"] may help patients feel better supported during treatment. This study will also evaluate how much PLM can help collect information on side effects from chemotherapy treatments.</detailed_description>
