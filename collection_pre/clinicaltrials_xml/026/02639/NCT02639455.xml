	<brief_summary>Poor oral health can greatly impact quality of life and can also impact overall health. For instance, research suggests that poor oral health may be associated with systemic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the causes of poor oral health. The idea that athletes may have a propensity for dental caries has been gaining traction. There have been recent reports of high levels of dental caries, dental erosion and periodontal diseases among elite soccer players compared to the general public and in athletes from a wide range of sports. However, to date, no studies have investigated the oral microbiome of athletes. Many factors affect the development of dental caries, including host factors, diet, and the microorganisms present in the oral cavity. More than 700 types of bacterial species have been detected in the oral cavity, and some have been identified to play a significant role in the development of oral disease. Streptococcus mutans is the main species involved in dental decay with various lactobacilli also involved in the disease process. Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas ginigivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are the main species involved in periodontal disease. It is not currently known if changes in the collective oral microbiome foster or impede the development of these pathogens. Complex microbe-host interactions occur to allow for the progression of oral disease, with host nutrition and hygiene playing a significant role. Endurance athletes widely consume a variety of sport drinks, gels, and energy bars for supplementation of electrolytes and carbohydrates. The consumption of these foods leads to pH drops in the oral cavity and may contribute to tooth erosion and demineralization. Oral disease may also be exacerbated by the fluid and electrolyte deficit that impedes saliva flow during exercise. However, several studies have failed to demonstrate a clear link between sports drinks and an increased risk of dental caries among athletes. Dental caries are caused by microorganisms in the oral cavity. These microbes may be affected by host factors or nutrition in the progression of oral disease. Due to the documented prevalence of dental caries in athletes and the lack of clear connection between sports drinks and dental caries, the investigators propose to investigate any correlation that may exist between exercise and the oral microbiome.</brief_summary>
