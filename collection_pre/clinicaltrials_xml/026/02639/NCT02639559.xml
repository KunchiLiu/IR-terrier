	<brief_summary>Current protocols use G-CSF to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from matched sibling and volunteer unrelated donors. Unfortunately, this process requires four to six days of G-CSF injection and can be associated with side effects, most notably bone pain and rarely splenic rupture. BL-8040 is given as a single SC injection, and collection of cells occurs on the same day as BL-8040 administration. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of this novel agent for hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization and allogeneic transplantation based on the following hypotheses: - Healthy HLA-matched donors receiving one injection of BL-8040 will mobilize sufficient CD34+ cells (at least 2.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight) following no more than two leukapheresis collections to support a hematopoietic cell transplant. - The hematopoietic cells mobilized by SC BL-8040 will be functional and will result in prompt and durable hematopoietic engraftment following transplantation into HLA-identical siblings with advanced hematological malignancies using various non-myeloablative and myeloablative conditioning regimens and regimens for routine GVHD prophylaxis. - If these hypotheses 1 and 2 are confirmed after an interim safety analysis of the data, then the study will continue and include recruitment of haploidentical donors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (DONOR): Age 18 to 70 years of age. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. PART 1: Donor must be a 5/6 or 6/6 HLAmatched sibling willing to donate PBSC for transplant. PART 2: Donor must be a 5/6 or 6/6 HLAmatched sibling or 3/6 or 4/6 HLA haploidentical donor willing to donate PBSC for transplant. Haploidentical donors will be allowed to participate upon investigator decision and based on the data reached from 5/6 or 6/6 HLA matched transplant done during Part 1 of the study. Adequate organ function defined by: serum creatinine within normal limits or a minimum creatinine clearance (CrCl) value of ≥ 60 ml/min calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation AST, ALT and total bilirubin ≤ 2x institutional upper limit of normal. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception with two different forms, including one barrier method, during participation in the study and for 2 weeks following dosing with BL8040. Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the subject. Female subjects must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 10 days prior to taking study medication if of childbearing potential or must be of nonchildbearing potential. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the subject to be eligible. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as: ≥ 45 years of age and has not had menses for &gt; 2 years Amenorrheic for &gt; 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a FSH value in the postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation Posthysterectomy, oophorectomy, or tubal ligation. Able and willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol. Able to understand and willing to sign an IRBapproved written informed consent document. Inclusion Criteria (RECIPIENT): Age 18 to 75 years ECOG performance status of 02 (inclusive) One of the following diagnoses: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in 1st or subsequent remission Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 1st or subsequent remission Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic or accelerated phase NonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's disease (HD) in 2nd or greater complete remission, partial remission Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Multiple myeloma (MM) Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) excluding primary or secondary myelofibrosis Adequate organ function defined by: a creatinine clearance (CrCl) value of ≥ 60 ml/min by MDRD study equation AST, ALT and a total bilirubin ≤ 2x institutional upper limit of normal. Adequate cardiac function with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%. Adequate pulmonary function defined as NO severe or symptomatic restrictive or obstructive lung disease, and formal pulmonary function testing showing an FEV1 ≥50% of predicted and a DLCO ≥ 40% of predicted, corrected for hemoglobin. Female subjects must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test if of childbearing potential or be of nonchildbearing potential. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the subject to be eligible. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as: *≥ 45 years of age and has not had menses for &gt; 2 years Amenorrheic for &gt; 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a FSH value in the postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation Posthysterectomy, oophorectomy, or tubal ligation. Able to understand and willing to sign an IRBapproved written informed consent document. Exclusion Criteria (DONOR): Received any investigational agent within 30 days and/or 5 halflives (of the other investigational agent), whichever is longer, of receiving BL8040. Active HIV or hepatitis B or C infection Pregnant or breastfeeding. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the test compounds, materials, or contraindication to test products. Any malignancies in the 2 years prior to baseline, excluding: basal cell carcinoma, in situ malignancy, lowrisk prostate cancer, cervix cancer after curative therapy. A comorbid condition which, in the view of the investigators, renders the subject at high risk from treatment complications. Exclusion Criteria (RECIPIENT): Recipient must not have received any investigational drug within 30 days of starting conditioning treatment. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Active HIV or hepatitis B or C infection. Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the clinical investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of the patient. Subjects with a clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition or any other condition that cannot be wellcontrolled by the allowed medications permitted in the study protocol that would preclude safe and complete study participation, as determined by medical history, physical examinations, ECG, laboratory tests, or chestXray and according to the investigator's judgment.</criteria>
