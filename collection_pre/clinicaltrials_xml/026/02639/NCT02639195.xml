	<brief_summary>This study has two segments the first is a chart and outcome assessment of patients treated at Clear Passage (CP) with a history of small bowel obstruction (SBO). These patients have completed multiple questionnaires as a standard of care for outcome monitoring in the clinic setting, no new data will be collected. The second segment is a prospective observational, online questionnaire based study of subjects with a history of SBO not treated at CP. Data on the impact of quality of life (QOL) over time of subjects not treated at CP will be assessed using the same questionnaire used as standard of care in the clinic twice, 90 days apart. This will be accomplished using the NIH Assessment Center, with subjects able to complete the questionnaires with ease via the internet. As this segment is observational, there is minimal risk to these subjects. The data obtained from the untreated subjects will allow for reporting of overall impact on QOL in this population, data that is not available, as well as provide a control group for assessment of improvement for interventions for SBO.</brief_summary>
