	<brief_summary>Young men who have sex with men (MSM) in low- and middle-income countries often do not seek out HIV testing, are unaware of their HIV-positive status, and do not receive early medical care, compromising their health and contributing to downstream disease incidence. This situation is of great concern in post-socialist countries of Eastern Europe, where stigma about HIV/AIDS and same-sex behavior are great, HIV epidemics are still increasing, and the health needs of young MSM are rarely acknowledged or addressed. The planned research will be conducted in Sofia, Bulgaria, where MSM account for nearly half of HIV infections. The study will be conducted in two phases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community Intervention for HIV Testing &amp; Care Linkage Among Young MSM in Bulgaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In an initial qualitative phase, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with MSM ages 16 to 20 and other key informants to gain an understanding of factors related to HIV testing. The project's second phase is a trial of a network intervention to increase regular HIV testing and care linkage among young MSM. The investigators' prior studies in Bulgaria have shown that young MSM are clustered with other young MSM in social networks. The intervention trial will recruit 54 small social networks of MSM, each consisting of a young MSM "seed" between age 16 and 20 and also all close MSM friends surrounding the seed. All participants will complete baseline measures assessing recent HIV testing practices and testing history; attitudes, intentions, perceived norms, barriers, and understanding about HIV testing and medical care; sexual risk practices; and substance use. All participants will receive HIV risk reduction counseling. Networks will then be randomized to comparison and intervention conditions. Influence leaders of each experimental condition network will be identified, and network leaders will together attend a 5-session intervention, which will train, guide, and engage leaders to deliver theory-based, personally-tailored advice and counseling to their network members to correct misconceptions about HIV testing and care; strengthen friends' norms, attitudes, intentions, and perceived benefits of regular testing; and address barriers to testing. All members of intervention and comparison condition networks will be re-assessed at 6- and 12-month followup to determine the intervention's effects on HIV testing, regular testing, and testing- and care-related scale measures. Participants diagnosed with HIV infection at any point will be linked to medical care.</detailed_description>
