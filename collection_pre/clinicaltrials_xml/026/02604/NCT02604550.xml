	<brief_title>Anterior Cruciate Ligament Pain Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is a prospective, randomized, surgeon-blinded, two-armed trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of femoral nerve blocks versus adductor canal blocks for participants undergoing outpatient anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. The objective of this study is to compare the pain control benefit of two different types of nerve blocks. Ropivacaine, which is FDA-approved for use in both femoral nerve blocks as well as adductor canal blocks, will be utilized. The study will be comparing the efficacy between FDA approved treatments.</detailed_description>
