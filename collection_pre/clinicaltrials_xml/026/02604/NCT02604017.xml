	<criteria>1. Male or female, at least 18 years of age at time of screening. 2. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV GT1 infection. 3. Chronic HCV infection. 4. Subject must be HCV treatmentnaïve (i.e., patient has never received a single dose of any approved or investigational regimen) or treatmentexperienced (has failed prior IFN or pegIFN with or without RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN therapy). 5. Subjects must be noncirrhotic. Additional Inclusion Criteria for GT1 HCV/HIV1 coinfected patients: 6. HIV1 ART naïve with CD4 ≥ 500 cells/mm3 (or CD4+ % ≥ 29%) at Screening and plasma HIV1 RNA &lt;1,000 copies/mL at Screening and at least once during the 12 months prior to Screening. Or On a stable, qualifying HIV1 ART regimen for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, with CD4 ≥ 200 cells/mm3 (or CD4+ % ≥14%) at Screening and plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; LLOQ at Screening and at least once during the 12 months prior to Screening. 1. History of severe, lifethreatening or other significant sensitivity to any excipients of the study drugs. 2. Female who is pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study or breastfeeding; or male whose partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study. 3. Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the investigator. 4. Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). 5. HCV genotype performed during screening indicating coinfection with more than one HCV genotype. 6. Chronic human immunodeficiency virus, type 2 (HIV2) infection.</criteria>
