	<brief_summary>Objective of the study is to determine the influence of dietary supplementation with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on skin conditions. 33 healthy female subjects will be randomly assigned to a placebo group, a low-dose (LD) group receiving 50 mg CoQ10/day and a high-dose group (HD) receiving 150 mg CoQ10/day (11 subjects per group). A water-soluble form of CoQ10 with improved bioavailability (Quvital syrup with Q10vital®, Valens Int. d.o.o., Slovenia) will be used. Various skin parameters will be evaluated before the supplementation (the baseline), after 6 and after 12 weeks of supplementation. To evaluate the photoprotective potential of CoQ10 the minimal erythema dose (MED) will be determined before (the baseline) and after 12 weeks of the supplementation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective of the study is to determine the influence of dietary supplementation of CoQ10 in form of water-soluble Q10vital® on skin conditions. 33 healthy female subjects will be randomly assigned to a placebo group, a low-dose (LD) group receiving 50 mg CoQ10/day and a high-dose group (HD) receiving 150 mg CoQ10/day (11 subjects per group). A water-soluble form of CoQ10 with improved bioavailability (Quvital syrup with Q10vital®, Valens Int. d.o.o., Slovenia) will be used. The placebo or CoQ10 will be administered in the form of a syrup; all subjects will consume 5 mL of syrup daily for 12 weeks. The photoprotective potential of CoQ10 will be evaluated with a determination of the minimal erythema dose (MED) before (the baseline) and after 12 weeks of the supplementation. Other skin parameters will be evaluated before supplementation (the baseline), after 6 and after 12 weeks of supplementation. Comparison will be done as the mean of the individual ratios. The differences between the before-after condition will be analyzed with the statistical test of analysis of variance. In case of failure to find homogeneity in the variances the nonparametric ANOVA, the Willcoxon test, will be used. The results will be expressed as mean ± standard error for each group with a significance level of 0.05 for all the statistical tests.</detailed_description>
