	<brief_summary>This randomized active-controlled multicenter Phase III open-label study will evaluate and compare between treatment groups the efficacy of alectinib versus chemotherapy in participants with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC who were previously treated with chemotherapy and crizotinib, as measured by investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and to evaluate and compare between treatment groups the central nervous system (CNS) objective response rate (C-ORR) in participants with measurable CNS metastases at baseline, as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or recurrent (Stage IIIB not amenable for multimodality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC that is ALKpositive. ALK positivity must have been determined by a validated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test (recommended probe, Vysis ALK BreakApart Probe) or a validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) test (recommended antibody, clone D5F3) Participant had received two prior systemic lines of therapy, which must have included one line of platinumbased chemotherapy and one line of crizotinib Prior CNS or leptomeningeal metastases allowed if asymptomatic Participants with symptomatic CNS metastases for whom radiotherapy is not an option will be allowed to participate in this study Measurable disease by RECIST Version 1.1 prior to the administration of study treatment Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 For all females of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be obtained within 3 days before starting study treatment Participants with a previous malignancy within the past 3 years are excluded (other than curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin, early gastrointestinal [GI] cancer by endoscopic resection or in situ carcinoma of the cervix) Participants who have received any previous ALK inhibitor other than crizotinib Any GI disorder that may affect absorption of oral medications</criteria>
