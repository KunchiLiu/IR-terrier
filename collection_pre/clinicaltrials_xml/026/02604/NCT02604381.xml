Subject using other therapies for OA, such as exercise, heat/cold therapy, joint protection and physiotherapy/occupational therapy agrees to continue these therapies as normal avoiding changes in frequency or intensity and to record therapies in the study diary Subject agrees not to start any new therapies for OA during the course of the study Agrees to maintain current exercise and dietary habits for the duration of the study Has given voluntary, written, informed consent to participate in the study Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the trial Physical examination findings show severe articular inflammation Subject has a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, spinal disorders or other musculoskeletal disease Subject has been recommended for knee surgery WOMAC Pain Scale Score &lt;4 for total pain (average of question #1 to question #5) at screening and baseline Subject has kidney or liver disease, blood disorders, active cancer and/or HIV infection Subjects with significant medical history or current metabolic disorders, thyroid disease, immune disorders and/or cardiovascular disease will be reviewed by the Qualified Investigator (QI). Subjects deemed by the QI to be at possible risk will not be permitted in this study. Subjects with a Type I or II diabetes Subjects with a history of seizures who are currently on medication to control seizures Subjects with hypertension will be reviewed by the Qualified Investigator (QI).
