	<brief_summary>Randomized clinical trial, conducted in the Intensive Care Unit of the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre from october 2011 until november 2015 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Three Technical Airway Clearance in Mechanical Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To compare the effectiveness of techniques: vibrocompression (G1), hyperinflation with mechanical ventilation (G2) vibrocompression + hyperinflation with mechanical ventilation (G3) in the amount of aspirated secretions, mechanical ventilator time, incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia , reintubation tracheal and mortality in mechanical ventilator. Primary outcome: weight in grams of the aspirated secretions. Secondary outcome: hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters: heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral arterial oxygen saturation; peak inspiratory pressure, tidal volume; dynamic compliance ; mechanical ventilator time; reintubation tracheal; Incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and mortality in mechanical ventilator.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>In mechanical ventilation for a period of 2472 h Endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) lower 10 cm of water. Lower noradrenaline doses of 0.5mg / kg / minute for an average greater than or equal blood outstrips 60 mmHg. Pneumothorax and hemothorax undrained Subcutaneous emphysema Osteoporosis Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Fractures of ribs Obese ( BMI greater than 35) Mechanical ventilator with higher peak pressures 40 cm of water.</criteria>
