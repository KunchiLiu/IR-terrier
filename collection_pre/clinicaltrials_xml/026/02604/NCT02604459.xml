	<brief_summary>Postoperative delirium occurs in up to 65% of elders undergoing surgery for repair of a hip fracture and this complication is independently associated with increased morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and placement in long-term care institutions. To date, the only intervention shown to be effective at minimizing postoperative delirium is a proactive geriatric consultation. This prospective randomized clinical trial will randomize 160 adults, aged 65 years or older, to either optimized general anesthesia or usual general anesthesia care for hip fracture surgery to determine if the optimized anesthesia management reduces the severity of postoperative delirium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Optimized General Anesthesia Care Reduce Postoperative Delirium?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized to one of two intraoperative anesthesia treatment groups: 1.) Usual care - the anesthetic management will be at the discretion of the anesthesia provider; or 1.) Optimal care - the intraoperative depth of anesthesia will be directed using a BIS monitor, blood pressure will be maintained within 20% of preoperative levels, and cerebral oxygenation will be maintained &gt; 60% during anesthesia. Subjects will be evaluated using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) for the first 5 postoperative days to determine if they experience postoperative delirium.</detailed_description>
