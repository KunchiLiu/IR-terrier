	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disease that affects millions of people worldwide and about 100,000 Americans. Sickle cell disease is a group of blood disorders that affect hemoglobin (Hb), the molecule that delivers oxygen throughout the body via red blood cells. The abnormal sickle cell Hb polymerizes under low oxygen tension and causes RBCs to become distorted into a rigid sickle, or crescent shape. Sickle cells have a shorter lifespan than normal RBCs. As a result, patients with SCD frequently develop anemia, leading to fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, and coldness in the hands and feet. In children with SCD, anemia can also cause delayed growth and development. Sickle red blood cells are also prone to adhesive interactions with each other, white blood cells, platelets, and blood vessel walls. These adhesive interactions lead to occlusion of the small blood vessels, blocking the flow of blood, and cause inflammation and multiple organ damage. Acute blockage of the blood vessels results in episodic events that are known as sickle cell crises, and they are accompanied by 3 serious symptoms: pain, organ damage and inflammation. Pharmacotherapy of SCD is limited to hydroxyurea, the only FDA approved drug for the treatment of sickle cell disease. However, considerable percentage of patients with sickle disease are not responsive or showing varying degree of response to hydroxyurea treatment. For a very long time, the investigators understanding of the underlining pathological processes which lead to the occlusion of the blood vessel was dominated by the simplistic mechanical approach. However, the emerging evidence indicates that primary events in vaso-occlusion are triggered by polymerization-independent events, with sickling occurring as secondary incident. The current consensus is that, the primary events crucial to vaso-occlusion are due to inflammation and increased adhesion of RBC, platelet and leukocyte to blood vessels lining tissue (endothelium). This new paradigm of pathophysiology of the disease has shifted the management strategies from prevention of Hb polymerization to amelioration of the inflammation and reduction of blood cell adhesion. In order to elucidate the changes behind the increased propensity of blood cells to adhere to each other and the endothelium extensive studies were conducted on red blood cell membrane. The major membrane abnormalities observed in red blood cell of SCD patients compromise membrane transport defects, dysfunctional lipid bilayer and perturbation of fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids. The abnormality is characterized by high omega-6, low omega-3 and an imbalance between the two fatty acid families. The fatty acid imbalance in SCD is known contributory factor in enhanced blood cell adhesion, aggregation, blood coagulation and inflammation (Daak et al 2013; Daak et al 2015). SC411 is a drug based on omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) that may help prevent sickle cell crises, decrease inflammation and continuous breakdown of red blood cells. The active ingredient DHA, is formulated using advanced Lipid Technologies™ (ALT™), and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule. In this study investigator will compare the rate of sickle cell crises between individuals with sickle cell anemia disease receiving SC411 capsules vs. placebo capsules. The results of this research will provide the evidence about the potential therapeutic effect of SC411 in SCD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who meet all of the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the study: 1. Aged ≥ 5 years and ≤17 years at screening; 2. Has been diagnosed with SCD (that includes the genotypes HbSS, HbSC, and HbS/beta thalassemia documented by hemoglobin HPLC or electrophoresis); 3. Has had between ≥ 2 to ≤ 10 episodes of clinical sickle cell crises within 12 months of the Screening Visit. 4. Is either not on hydroxyurea at the Screening Visit and does not plan on receiving it during the course of the study or has received hydroxyurea for a minimum of 12 months and is dose stabilized for at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit with the intent to continue for the duration of the study; 5. Parent or guardian is able to give written informed consent, and the potential pediatric patient is able to provide assent in a manner approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and comply with the requirements of the study; and 6. If sexually active, agrees to use a reliable method of birth control (eg, barrier, birth control pills, abstinence) during the study and for 1 month following the last dose of study drug. Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the study: 1. Has a significant medical condition that required hospitalization (other than sickle cell crisis) within 2 months of the Screening Visit; 2. Has chronic daily use of opioid analgesia for any reason; 3. Has a diagnosis of chronic pain or chronic pain syndrome (eg, chronic pain from the repeated vasoocclusive events, chronic pain from avascular necrosis); 4. Has a history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infection; 5. Has a history of documented episode(s) of priapism within 12 months of the Screening Visit; 6. Has international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;2.0 or is on regular anticoagulation; 7. Has thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 80,000) or is on chronic ASA therapy; 8. Has increased risk of stroke: documented abnormal or "high conditional" transcranial Doppler (TCD) mean velocity (TCD V) by STOP criteria (Adams, 1998) within the preceding year or has a history of moyamoya syndrome: 1. "High conditional" = TCD V ≥ 185199 cm/sec, or TCDi V ≥170184 cm/sec, or TCD maximum V ≥250 cm/sec; 2. Abnormal = TCD V≥ 200 cm/sec, or abnormal high TCDi V≥ 185 cm/sec, or TCD maximum V≥ 250 cm/sec; 9. Has received a blood transfusion in the 2 months prior to the Screening Visit or 3 months prior to randomization or has hemoglobin A (HbA) levels &gt;15% at the Screening Visit; 10. Has received any blood products in the 2 months prior to the Screening Visit or 3 months prior to randomization; 11. Has renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN, or requiring peritoneal or hemodialysis); 12. Has liver dysfunction (ALT &gt;2.0 x ULN); 13. Has other concomitant chronic medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would compromise participation in the study or confound the evaluation of the study outcome; 14. Is pregnant or lactating or has the intention of becoming pregnant during the study (if a female of childbearing potential or partner of a patient participating in the study); 15. Is currently taking or has been treated with any form of omega3 fatty acid or fish oil supplement within 30 days of the Screening Visit or during the course of the study; 16. Has been treated with an experimental antisickling medication/treatment within 30 days of the Screening Visit or during the course of the study; 17. Is currently taking or has been treated with any investigational drug for any disease within 30 days of the Screening Visit or during the course of the study; 18. Is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study and/or has participated in such a study within 30 days of the Screening Visit or during the course of the study; or 19. There are factors that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, make it difficult for the patient to comply with the requirements of the study (eg, inability to swallow capsules due to past history of stroke).</criteria>
