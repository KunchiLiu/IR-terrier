	<brief_summary>Sympathetic activity could be increased during robot-assisted laparoscopic gastrectomy, which is performed in a head up position under CO2 pneumoperitoneum. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system prolongs the QT interval and can increases the susceptibility to life threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Thus the investigators decided to evaluate the heart-rate corrected QT interval (QTc interval) during robotic-assisted laparoscopic gastrectomy.</brief_summary>
