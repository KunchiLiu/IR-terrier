	<brief_summary>While the process of fibrosis is essential for normal wound healing, an excessive and uncontrolled 'fibrotic' response can result in impaired tissue structure and function. In other words, affected 'fibrotic' tissues are unable to heal back to normal and therefore don't work as effectively as they normally would. In the case of the lung, fibrosis can occur across large parts of the lung such as in conditions like Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis or it can occur in much smaller patches such as around the borders of some lung tumours. At the moment the investigators don't fully understand the mechanisms of fibrosis and so therefore cannot monitor or treat these conditions as effectively as the investigators could. Despite the significant global financial burden of these diseases, treatment options are very limited and monitoring of disease progression remains a real challenge. In an effort to address this problem, the research team have designed and synthesised an imaging agent (FIB ONE) that can detect fibrosis in the lung. FIB ONE will be used at very low concentrations in patients with a lung condition characterised by excessive activity of the fibroproliferative pathway either scheduled for a routine bronchoscopy or elective surgery. FIB ONE will be administered directly into the lungs during a bronchoscopy procedure and images of the lungs will be analysed. As part of this study, the research team's novel endomicroscopy detection system will be compared to equipment that is routinely used in the NHS when imaging the FIB ONE probe.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging FIB ONE in the Human Lung Using Endomicroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to deliver a FIB ONE microdose to 18 patients with a lung condition characterised by excessive activity of the fibroproliferative pathway (e.g. conditions such as IPF, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, suspected or confirmed lung cancer) to assess whether the imaging agent can detect fibrotic (matrix metalloproteinases) activity in the lung. The primary endpoint is to visualise the delivery of a microdose of FIB ONE and assess imaging parameters in patients with lung conditions using two microendoscopy systems. Cohort 1 will consist of 12 patients scheduled for routine elective diagnostic or surveillance bronchoscopy with a fibroproliferative lung condition and Cohort 2 will consist of 6 patients undergoing planned cardiothoracic surgery for biopsy/resection of lung conditions characterised by excessive activity of the fibroproliferative pathway. For both cohorts, eligibility will be verified by a clinical trial physician after written informed consent has been obtained. For cohort 1, a bronchoscopy with lavage will be performed to harvest broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). For cohort 2, a sample of resected lung tissue will be analysed. Fibre-based endomicroscopy (FE) will be performed and up to 70μg (± 40%) in total of FIB ONE will be instilled. CT identified regions of architecturally normal lung in all participants will act as internal controls and will be used to compare the FIB ONE signal in normal and diseased lung tissue. Participants will be asked to provide routine blood samples before and after FIB ONE administration. A cardiorespiratory exam and routine observations will be performed 4-6 hours following the administration of FIB ONE and all participants will be assessed for discharge. All participants will either be contacted by a member of the research team via telephone or ward visit 24 hours (± 4 hours) after FIB ONE dosing to ensure no AEs/SAEs were experienced. The participant's involvement in the study is concluded when the 24 hour assessment has been successfully completed and all AEs/SAEs have been resolved.</detailed_description>
