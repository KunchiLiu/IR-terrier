	<brief_summary>To investigate whether the additional induction chemotherapy (IC) to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was able to improve overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and to clarify if stage-specified chemoradiotherapy regimens benefit the most for locoregionally advanced NPC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Investigation of the Impacts of Prognosis for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data of patients firstly diagnosed NPC from Jan 1st, 1998 to Jun 1st, 2013 were downloaded from Department of Medical Information, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center. Patients were excluded if they had stage I or II disease, no complete medical records, received treatment previously, or without concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Follow-up data is updated on October 1st, 2015.The propensity score-matching (PSM) method was adopted to balance observed covariates between both groups. Propensity scores reflect the conditional probability that is intended to be uniform between patients received CCRT and IC+CCRT based on their baseline characteristics. Matching was performed based on nearest-neighbor matching, and comparing between CCRT and IC+CCRT patients were matched within their respective risk groups.</detailed_description>
