	<brief_summary>An Open-Label Study in Healthy Male and Female Subjects to Identify the Concentration that Provides Optimal Bioavailability of Levodopa Infused Subcutaneously via a Pump System; and to Compare the Bioavailability of Levodopa/Carbidopa Solution to that of Levodopa/Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG), Infused via a Naso-Jejunal Tube</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Sequential Two-Part, Open-Label Study in Healthy Male and Female Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1: This is a single centre, open-label design with 2 study arms (ND0612H and ND0612L), in 24 subjects that will receive the ND0612L or ND0612H regimens. Part of the subjects will also participate in Part 2 of the study. Within each study arm, subjects will receive 3 doses of the investigational LD/CD solution for subcutaneous (SC) infusion. Study drug will be administered for 24 -30 hours as a subcutaneous (SC) infusion to the lower abdomen. Then subjects will be readmitted for Part 2. Part 2: This is a single centre, open-label design with 3 treatment arms to which 15 subjects who completed the ND0612H arm of Part 1 ND0612-005a will be allocated in a randomised manner. Within each treatment arm subjects will receive 2 out of 3 doses of LCIG infused for 16 hours directly to the jejunum. Subjects will be discharged from the clinic 24 hours after the end of the last infusion</detailed_description>
