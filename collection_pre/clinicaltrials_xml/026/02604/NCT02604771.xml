	<brief_summary>This study is an epidemiological non-interventional trial that aims to evaluate standard daily practice in managing patients with arterial hypertension. The trial only records real-life clinical practice with no additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures. The study is purposed to collect the following Egypt-specific epidemiology data on hypertension: demographic data, patients' characteristics, and patients' management/treatment in order to reach its rationale.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Egypt Hypertension Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is aimed to evaluate response rate of the antihypertensive treatment with Thiazide Diuretics, calcium antagonist, Angiotensin Converting enzyme Inhibitor, Angiotensin II receptor blocker, and Beta Blocker in real life practice, and to collect the following Egypt-specific epidemiology data on hypertensive patients: demographic data, patents characteristics, and patients' management/treatment. Approximately 300 sites will be participating (1 investigator per site; 300 investigators). Patients that are to be enrolled will either be newly diagnosed with hypertension, or on current antihypertensive treatment, compiling a total of 3000 patients (21 years, or older). The study will be conducted in two sequential phases; the first phase will include 150 sites from Cairo, Giza and Alexandria aiming to reach 1500 patients followed by a second phase which will include 150 sites from Delta and Upper Egypt aiming to reach 1500 patients. Epidemiological data collection will take place at a single visit and Laboratory Investigations will be requested in the first visit. Patients will be followed for 3 visits with the investigator. The investigator will complete a Patient Record Form (PRF) with the patient's data: demographics, history, current antihypertensive drug treatment/treatment changes, results of physical examination, blood pressure (SBP/DBP), heart rate.</detailed_description>
