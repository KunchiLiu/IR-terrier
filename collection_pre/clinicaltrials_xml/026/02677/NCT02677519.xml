	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (Aptensio XR速) in children aged 4-5 years who have been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by assessing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) blood pressure, pulse, height, weight, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term (12-month) safety and tolerability of Aptensio XR速 in children aged 4 to less than 6 years who have been diagnosed with ADHD. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by assessing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) blood pressure, pulse, height, weight, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory values and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Disturbances in sleep (quantity and quality) patterns will also be assessed using the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). Secondary objectives include assessment of long-term efficacy of Aptensio XR速. Secondary measures include: - Investigator administered Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale Preschool Version (ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version) - Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale (CGI-S ) - Connors Early Childhood Behavior-Parent Short form [Conners EC BEH-P(S)]</brief_summary>
