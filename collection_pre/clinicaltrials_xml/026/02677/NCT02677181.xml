	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of ATG for Prophylaxis of aGVHD in Matched Sibling Donor PBSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transplantation with G-CSF （Granulocyte colony stimulating factor ）mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSCT) has been a stable transplant setting with matched sibling donor transplantation. Unmanipulated haploidentical donor PBSCT (haplo-PBSCT) has been applied in patients with hematologic malignancies. In our previous cohort study, haplo-PBSCT was associated with lower incidence of severe acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD compared with matched sibling donor PBSCT (MSD-PBSCT). Haplo-PBSCT has the same GVHD prophylaxis regimen with MSD-PBSCT, except ATG. It suggested the potential advantage of ATG in prophylaxis of GVHD and improvement of long-term quality of life of the transplant recipients, which motivate us to observe the efficacy of combined ATG regimen for GVHD prophylaxis in MSD-PBSCT.</detailed_description>
