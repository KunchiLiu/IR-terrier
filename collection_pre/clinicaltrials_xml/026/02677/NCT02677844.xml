	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to determine: - The effect of single increasing doses of the study drug, abemaciclib, on healthy participants. - The relationship between the amount of abemaciclib and the electrical tracing of the heart rhythm when abemaciclib is given. - How much abemaciclib is found in the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. Information about any side effects that occur will be collected. The study will enroll two groups (cohorts) of participants. Each group will complete 4 study periods. This study is expected to last about 3 months. Screening may occur up to 28 days prior to enrollment. All participants will undergo a follow-up assessment approximately 21 days after administration of their final dose of study drug.</brief_summary>
