	<brief_summary>During reconstructive surgery that involves autologous fat grafting (AFG -- transplanting fatty tissue from one part of your body to another), fat tissue is removed from one part of the body (usually the abdomen or legs) and inserted into another part of the body. This fat must be cleaned and filtered (processed) before being inserted back into the body. The goal of this clinical research study is to compare 3 techniques for processing fatty tissue that is collected during reconstructive surgery. Researchers want to compare the amount of fat processed and the length of time needed to complete AFG technique and surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of the dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You have an equal chance of being assigned to each group. - If you are in Group 1, the tissue will be processed by REVOLVE™. In this method, the tissue is washed with a medical solution and spun at low speed to clean the fatty tissue and separate the fat tissue from other substances before it is transplanted. - If you are in Group 2, the tissue will be processed by PureGraft™. This process uses system of filters to wash fatty tissue with a medical solution and separate out unwanted substances before it is transplanted. - If you are in Group 3, the tissue will be processed by the Coleman technique. In this process, the fatty tissue is placed in a centrifuge, a machine that spins the tissue at high speed in order to separate the different substances in the tissue. Once the spinning is done, the fat cells can be collected. Surgery: After you have been assigned to a study group, you will be scheduled for reconstructive surgery. During your surgery, the study staff will watch the surgeon and the nurses as they perform the surgery. The observer will record how long the surgical team takes to complete each key step during the surgery. In addition, study staff will count the number of items (such as syringes and tubes) that were used and thrown away during the surgery and record the amount of usable tissue that is produced. After the fatty tissue is removed, it will be processed according to the group you have been assigned. It will then be placed back into your body during reconstructive surgery. If the surgeon decides during surgery to use a different AFG technique than the one that was assigned to your surgery, you will still continue to be part of the study. Even if this change takes place, each AFG process and reconstructive surgery will be performed in the standard way. Length of Participation: Your participation on this study will be over after your reconstructive surgery. There are no follow-up tests or visits. This is an investigational study. The REVOLVE™, PureGraftTM, and Coleman techniques are all FDA approved and commercially available. Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
