	<brief_summary>Objectives In this study the investigators examined the changes in common femoral vein (CFV) and great saphenous vein (GSV) calibre during thermo neutral water immersion (TNI), cold water immersion (CWI) and contrast water therapy (CWT). Design Ten professional handball players visited the laboratory on three occasions. At each visit, participants completed a 20-minutes procedure in an upright position: 4-minutes in air (baseline) and then 16-minutes lower limbs TNI (~35째C), CWI (~12째C) or CWT (2:2minutes (~12째C to ~35째C) ratio), selected randomly. Methods CFV and GVS calibres were evaluated by echo Doppler measures at baseline and at the end of 16 min immersion.</brief_summary>
