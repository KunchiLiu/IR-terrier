	<brief_summary>This study is a double blind treatment trial that will test if sulforaphane improves core symptoms in autism. The investigators expect to see clinical improvement in some of these areas. Sulforaphanes come from eating certain vegetables such as broccoli. The investigators will be using a preparation that gives specific and reproducible amounts. The investigators will also test specific chemicals and genes needed for sulforaphane usage to try to understand differences in response.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a double blind randomized treatment trial that will test if sulforaphane improves core symptoms in autism. It is designed to try to replicate a previous trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01474993) which reported that the isothiocyanate, sulforaphane treatment led to improvement by multiple metrics. Significant improvement was seen in behavior as measured by the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC) and by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). In addition a significantly greater number of participants receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication as per the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). In addition The investigators will attempt to account for some variability in response to sulforaphane treatment by testing alleles of genes that are relevant in sulforaphane metabolism. The investigators will also measure glutathione levels, which are also important in sulforaphane metabolism and are in part regulated by sulforaphane.. Sulforaphane is the most potent naturally occurring inducer of mammalian cytoprotective enzymes known. Therapeutic potential is based at least in part on their ability to up-regulate genes responsible for alleviation of oxidative stress and to regulate both the immune system and the inflammatory response 40 Males with autistic disorder will be randomly selected to receive either sulforaphane or placebo. Seven visits are required by the subjects including enrollment ,screening, baseline, weeks 4, 10 and 18 and a follow up visit at seek 22.</detailed_description>
