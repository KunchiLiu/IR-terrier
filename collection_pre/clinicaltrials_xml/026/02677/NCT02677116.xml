	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of different doses of olaratumab and to determine which dose should be used for future pediatric studies. The present study is open to children with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to another part of the body. The study has two parts. In each part, a specific dose of olaratumab will be given for 21 days, followed by one of three standard chemotherapy regimens. Participants will only enroll in one part.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The participant must have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of solid tumor, excluding lymphomas and melanoma, but including central nervous system (CNS) tumors, that is relapsed or refractory, not be amenable to curative treatment. The participant has the presence of measurable and/or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1). Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) Criteria or Macdonald Criteria should be used for CNS tumors. The participant has a Lansky (&lt;16 years of age) or Karnofsky (≥16 years of age) performance score of at least 50. The participant has adequate hematologic, organ, and coagulation function ≤2 weeks (14 days) prior to first dose of study drug: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥750 cubic millimeters (mm³) Platelets ≥75,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥8 grams per deciliter (g/dL) Total bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3.0 x ULN Serum creatinine is based on age/gender Adequate coagulation function as defined by International Normalized Ratio ≤1.5 or prothrombin time ≤1.5 x ULN, and partial thromboplastin time ≤1.5 x ULN Both female and male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraceptive precautions during the trial and up to 3 months following the last dose of study drug, as appropriate. Participants must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anticancer therapies or must adhere to posttreatment conditions as follows: Myelosuppressive chemotherapy Hematopoietic growth factors Biologic (antineoplastic agent) Antibody therapy Radiation Stem cell infusion without traumatic brain injury Corticosteroids Have received treatment within 21 days of the initial dose of study drug with an investigational product or nonapproved use of a drug or device or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. Participants that have had bone marrow or solid organ transplant are excluded. The participant has an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known severe viral infection including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not required). Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded. If the participant is to be enrolled in the doxorubicin combination arm, a left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF &lt; 50%) or shortening fraction of &lt;27% by echocardiogram (either multigated acquisition [MUGA] or echocardiogram [ECHO] are required, not both). Participants that have received prior anthracycline therapy if the participant is to be enrolled in the doxorubicin combination arm.</criteria>
