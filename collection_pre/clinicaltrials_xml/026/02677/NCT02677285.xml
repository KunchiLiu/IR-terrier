	<brief_summary>This study consists of two clinical series. With the first series investigators monitor the healing of skin grafts with bioimpedance measurements. The bioimpedance measurement is done with a purpose built patch that has electrodes in contact with the wound and reference electrodes. In the second series the investigators monitor closed operational wounds (breast reconstruction surgery patients) with bioimpedance measurements. This series is also conducted with bioimpedance measurements but the wounds are operational wounds. Both groups will have 20 patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioimpedance Based Monitoring of Operation Wound and Skin Graft Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives of the study: 1. The investigators will study how bioimpedance measurement results correlate with conventional wound healing monitoring. 2. The investigators will seek the best methods for handling, interpreting and presenting bioimpedance measurement results. 3. The investigators will find out if impedance measurement is applicable to clinical use.</detailed_description>
