	<brief_summary>This study combines two drugs in the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Investigators are proposing combining ibrutinib, an orally-administered, small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (FDA approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL), with pacritinib, a novel JAK2-FLT3 inhibitor that has shown activity in relapsed lymphoma, including CLL/SLL. Investigators will first demonstrate the safety and tolerability of Pacritinib when combined with Ibrutinib in a phase I study, which will help establish the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose)of Pacritinib when combined with Ibrutinib. Once the optimal dose of Pacritinib is established in the phase I setting, a phase II evaluation will seek to establish the efficacy of the combination of Pacritinib with Ibrutinib. Patients will receive continuous treatment until progressive disease and will be followed while on study treatment for a total of 2 years.</brief_summary>
