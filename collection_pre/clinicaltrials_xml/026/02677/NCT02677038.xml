	<brief_title>Olaparib for BRCAness Phenotype in Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take olaparib by mouth 2 times each day (2 tablets in the morning and 2 tablets in the evening, about 12 hours apart). You should take the tablets at around the same time each day with 8 ounces (1 cup) of water. You should not chew, crush, dissolve, or divide the tablets. You may take the tablets with a light meal or snack. If you vomit shortly after the olaparib tablets are swallowed, the dose should only be replaced if all of the intact tablets can be seen and counted. If you miss a scheduled dose by less than 2 hours, you should take the missed dose. If you miss a study drug dose by more than 2 hours, do not take the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose as scheduled. Study Visits: Each study cycle is 28 days. On Day 1 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and biomarker testing. - If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. On Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Every 8 weeks for up to 40 weeks and then every 12 weeks after that (Weeks 52, 64, 76, and so on), you will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease. At any time during the study, you may have some of the above tests repeated if the doctor thinks they are needed for your safety. The study doctor will tell you if you need to have any of these tests repeated. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your active participation in this study will be over after the follow-up visit. End-of-Treatment Visit: As soon as possible after your last dose of study drug: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have a core needle biopsy for biomarker testing. - If the disease appears to have gotten worse, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. If you stop study treatment and the disease has not gotten worse, you will continue to have a CT scan or MRI every 8 weeks for up to 40 weeks and then every 12 weeks after that, until the disease appears to get worse. Follow-Up Visit: About 30 days after the end-of-treatment visit: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Long-Term Follow-Up: About 2 months after your end-of-treatment visit and then every 2 months until the study is over, you will be called by the study staff and asked how you are doing and if you have taken any other anticancer treatments. Each call should last about 10-15 minutes. This is an investigational study. Olaparib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Its use in this study is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 24 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 2. Family history: one or more close blood relative with ovarian carcinoma at any age or breast cancer age 50 or younger or two relatives with breast, pancreatic or prostate cancer (Gleason 7 or higher) at any age, or patients with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. However, patients with previously identified genetic aberrations that are associated with HRD will be eligible even in the absence of family history [e.g. somatic BRCA mutation, Fanconi Anemia gene, ATM or RAD51 mutations]. 3. Patients must be germline BRCA 1 or 2 negative. (Note: If BRCA status was previously determined, that result is acceptable but documentation of status must be available; subjects with unknown status will be referred to genetic counselling for BRCA testing as per standard of care.) and/or patients with previously identified genetic aberrations that are associated with HRD will be eligible even in the absence of family history [e.g. somatic BRCA mutation, Fanconi Anemia gene, ATM or RAD51 mutations]. 4. Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for metastatic disease to be eligible. 5. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;/= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;/= 10 mm with spiral CT scan. 6. Patients must agree to have a study biopsy from metastatic site (liver, omentum, lung or lymph node) to be eligible. 7. Patients with prior malignancy and treated with no evidence of active disease, and more than 2 years from initial diagnosis are eligible. 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 01 (Karnofsky &gt;70). 9. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes &gt;/= 3,000 cells/mm^3; absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,500 cells/mm^3; platelets &gt;/= 75,000 cells/mm^3; hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dl (no blood transfusions within 4 weeks prior to enrollment); total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (IULN); AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;/= 2.5 X IULN without liver metastasis; &lt;/= 5 X IULN for patients with liver metastasis; creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;/= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. 10. International Normalized Ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5. 11. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years of age. 12. Women of childbearing potential (defined as not postmenopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical sterilization) and fertile men must agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception while they are receiving study treatment and for 30 days after last dose of study drug. Male subjects must agree to refrain from sperm donation during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drugs. 13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Signed informed consent form must be obtained prior to initiation of study evaluations and/or activities. 1. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months of initiation of therapy. 2. Patients whose tumors are deemed to be platinumrefractory will be excluded from the trial. 3. Pregnancy or lactation. 4. Patient has active and uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring systemic therapy. 5. Patient has undergone major surgical resection within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. 6. Patient received radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or an investigational therapy within 2 weeks prior to study entry. 7. Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems such that the investigator considers it unsafe for the patient to receive an experimental research drug. 8. Serious psychiatric or medical conditions that could interfere with treatment. 9. Major bleeding in the last 4 weeks prior to study entry. 10. Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors. 11. Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) with corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470msec. (Fredericia's scale).</criteria>
