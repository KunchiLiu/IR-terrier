	<brief_summary>The test group consisted of eighteen subjects with hyposalivation used probiotic tablets (≥ 4/day) and gel (once a week) (streptococci, bicarbonate and carbamide) for 3 months and 9 used placebo tablets and gel. The salivary secretion rates were measured and microbial samples collected and analysed using cultivation technique twice both at baseline and at the 3-month follow up (1-2 weeks between the appointments).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Probiotic Streptococci and pH-rising Components on the Oral Microbial Flora</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim was to analyse the effect of daily intake of probiotic alpha-haemolytic facultative anaerobic streptococci (Streptococcus oralis), pH-rising components and Stevia on the oral microflora in hyposalivated subjects. Material and methods: Subjects with hyposalivation (unstimulated secretion rate of &lt; 0.1 ml/min and/or a stimulated secretion rate &lt; 0.7 ml/min) and ≥ 10 000 cfu/ml of mutans streptococci and/or lactobacilli on the tongue or in the supragingival plaque were included. Eighteen subjects used probiotic tablets (≥ 4/day) and gel (once a week) for 3 months and 9 used placebo tablets and gel. The salivary secretion rates were measured and microbial samples collected and analysed using cultivation technique twice both at baseline and at the 3-month follow up (1-2 weeks between the appointments).</detailed_description>
