	<brief_summary>EBV has been implicated in pathogeny of SLE with increase in EBV sero-prevalence, defective control in EBV infection and altered both B and T immune responses to this virus The main objective of this pilot proof-of-concept (POC) study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of autologous EBV specific CTL adoptive transfer in adult patients with serologically active SLE</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous EBV-specific Cytotoxic T Cells for the Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic lupus is a disabling disease of the young woman, whose treatment is based on the long-term corticosteroid, anti-malarials and immunosuppressants synthesis. This support is not without potential side effects. EBV is a herpes causes infectious mononucleosis virus, usually encounter in childhood or adolescence, and that our natural immunity cell (CD8 T cells) controls all our lives, not eliminate. Increasingly scientific studies show that there are patients with systemic lupus (and multiple sclerosis), a failure of self-control of the EBV virus, by T lymphocytes (CD8). This uncontrolled virus then stimulate the B lymphocytes, which produce antibodies, toxic in lupus. The laboratory isolate T cells specific for EBV (EBV-CTL) of a patient, and stimulate in culture to strengthen them. They can be then re-injected by a single intravenous infusion (autotransfusion), and were used to control the virus in certain diseases where EBV has a demonstrated role post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome EBV-induced. Our therapeutic approach is completely innovative, as based on the principle of cell therapy, thus not using new drugs, and based on the restoration of the patient's immune system, specific EBV.</detailed_description>
