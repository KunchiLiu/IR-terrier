	<brief_summary>This Phase 1b/2 study is an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral AG-120 + Subcutaneous (SC) azacitidine and oral AG-221 + SC azacitidine in subjects with newly diagnosed AML with an IDH1 or an IDH2 mutation, respectively. The study population consists of subjects who are not candidates to receive intensive Inductive chemotherapy (IC). The study comprises a Phase 1b dose-finding and AG-120 expansion stage and a Phase 2 randomized stage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of Oral AG-120 Plus Subcutaneous Azacitidine and Oral AG-221 Plus Subcutaneous Azacitidine in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was redesigned to expand the number of patients analyzed during the Phase 1b stage of the study to determine a safe and effective dose of AG-120 administered with azacitidine for future studies. The Phase 1b (AG-120 expansion) stage will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of oral AG-120 when administered with Subcutaneous azacitidine. The Phase 2 stage of the study will no longer include AG-120 administered with azacitidine (IDH1 subjects) and IDH1 patients will not longer be included in the azacitidine alone arm.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: 1. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF). 2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any studyrelated assessments/procedures being conducted. 3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 4. Subject has newly diagnosed, primary (ie, de novo) or secondary (progression of MDS or myeloproliferative neoplasms [MPN], or therapyrelated) AML according to the WHO classification with ≥ 20% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow: Have an Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) gene mutation (R132, R140, or R172) IDH mutational status will be assessed locally; for sites without local testing capabilities, a referral lab will be identified. By the investigator's assessment who are not candidates to receive intensive Inductive chemotherapy (IC). 5. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2. 6. Subject has adequate organ function defined as: Serum aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN, unless considered due to leukemic organ involvement. Serum total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN. Higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed to ineffective erythropoiesis, 3 times the upper limit of normal for Gilbert's syndrome (eg, a gene mutation in UGT1A1), or leukemic organ involvement. Serum creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) glomerular filtration rate (GFR): GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 × (Scr)1.154 × (Age)0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if African American) 7. Agree to serial bone marrow aspirate/biopsies. 8. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)* may participate, providing they meet the following conditions: Agree to practice true abstinence ** from sexual intercourse or to use highly effective contraceptive methods (eg, combined [containing estrogen and progestogen] or progestogen only associated with inhibition of ovulation, oral, injectable, intravaginal, patch, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; bilateral tubal occlusion; intrauterine device; intrauterine hormonereleasing system; or male partner sterilization [note that a vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the FCBP trial participant and that a vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success]) at screening and throughout the study, and for at least 4 months following the last study treatment; and Have a negative serum βsubunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) at screening; and Have a negative serum or urine (investigator's discretion under local regulations) βhCG pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 72 hours prior to the start of study treatment in the Treatment Period (note that the screening serum pregnancy test can be used as the test prior to the start of study treatment in the Treatment Period if it is performed within the 72hour timeframe). 9. Male subjects must agree to practice true abstinence from sexual intercourse or agree to the use of highly effective contraceptive methods (as described above) with nonpregnant female partners of child bearing potential at screening and throughout the course of the study and should avoid conception with their partners during the course of the study and for at least 4 months following the last study treatment (6 months following last dose of azacitidine in Canada). Furthermore, the male subject must agree to use a condom while treated with azacitidine and for at least 4 months following the last azacitidine dose. The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment: 1. Subject is suspected or proven to have acute promyelocytic leukemia based on morphology, immunophenotype, molecular assay, or karyotype. 2. Subject has AML secondary to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). 3. Subject has received a targeted agent against an Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. 4. Subject has received prior systemic anticancer therapy, HSCT, or radiotherapy for AML. Note: Hydroxyurea is allowed prior to enrollment for the control of peripheral leukemic blasts in subjects with leukocytosis. (however, hydroxyurea should not be given within 72 hours prior to and after administration of azacitidine). For subjects with secondary AML (eg, MDS or MPN) treatment for prior cancer is not exclusionary; full treatment information will be collected within the CRF. The use of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for suspected APL is not exclusionary provided it is discontinued prior to initiation of treatment in the protocol. 5. Subject has received more than 1 cycle of prior treatment with azacitidine, or subject has received any prior treatment with decitabine for Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Clarification: Subjects with newly diagnosed Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are currently receiving their 1st cycle of azacitidine (7 days) can be screened for the study. On study, Cycle 1 must be started at 28 days (+/ 3 days) after initiation of the prestudy azacitidine. 6. Subject has or is suspected of having central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.

Subject is taking the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transportersensitive substrate rosuvastatin; subject should be excluded from the study unless he/she can be transferred to other medications at least 5 halflives prior to the start of study treatment. 15.

Female subject who is pregnant or lactating. 20.
