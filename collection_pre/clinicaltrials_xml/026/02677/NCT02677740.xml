	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to increase our understanding of how two different protocols of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), inhibitory (1 Hz) and excitatory (5 Hz), applied over the primary motor cortex of the presumed dominant hemisphere, affect functional connectivity and neurochemistry in the brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms of Non-Invasive Neuromodulation Interventions: Influence on Human Neurochemistry and Functional Connectivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method which is effective for treating both psychiatric and non‐psychiatric disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, pain syndromes and for improving motor function in neurodegenerative diseases or following stroke. rTMS uses series of brief pulses of magnetic field applied to the surface of the head for a period of time (e.g. 20 minutes). The effects of rTMS are transient, and critically dependent upon the location, frequency and intensity of stimulation. Several studies have provided evidence that rTMS can influence the excitability and function of neurons (neuromodulation) for up to one hour, both near to, and distant from, the site of stimulation. However it is still unclear how these transient local and distant changes in function induced by specific rTMS protocols are mediated. In this project we will combine expertise in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and rTMS neuromodulation to develop and test protocols for examining the changes produced by non-invasive brain stimulation on healthy subjects. rTMS will be applied outside the scanner using standard TMS coils and MRI/S at 7 Tesla will be acquired before and immediately after rTMS. Our aim is to increase the understanding of how the two different rTMS protocols, inhibitory (1 Hz) and excitatory (5 Hz), applied over the primary motor cortex of the presumed dominant hemisphere, affect functional connectivity and neurochemistry in the brain.</detailed_description>
