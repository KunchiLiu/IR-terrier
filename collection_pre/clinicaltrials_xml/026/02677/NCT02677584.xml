	<brief_summary>Investigators hypothesized that the timing of caffeine administration in either prophylaxis or treatment of apnea of prematurity will affect the apnea response to caffeine</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Versus Therapeutic Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It will be a randomized control trial, patients will be randomly assigned to receive caffeine in a loading dose of 20 mg/kg (equivalent for 10 mg/kg caffeine base) and a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg/day (equivalent for 5 mg/kg caffeine base) either as a prophylaxis group (1) or therapeutic group (2) . Prophylactic caffeine (group 1) will be defined as caffeine prescribed for preterm infant within the first 72 hours of life prior to manifest apnea , therapeutic caffeine ( group 2 ) will be defined as caffeine prescribed for manifest apnea within or after the first 72 hours of life . Preparation and administration of caffeine will be performed by a Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurse. Statistical Evaluation: Statistical analyses will be performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences-SPSS version 16 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). For categorical variables, the X2 test will be used. For group comparisons, the Student T test will be used in normal distribution and the Mann-Whitney U test will be used in case of abnormal distribution. For repeating measurements, variance analyses and Friedman variance analyses will be used. For descriptive statistics, percent, minimum-maximum-median, mean, and standard deviation will be used in accordance with the type and distribution of the variable. A P value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. Informed consent will be obtained from parents, and the study will be approved by the local ethical committee.</detailed_description>
