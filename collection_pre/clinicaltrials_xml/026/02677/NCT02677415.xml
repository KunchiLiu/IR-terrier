	<brief_summary>Recent observational studies have found an association between general anaesthesia and increased post-operative mortality in acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing endovascular treatment. It is unknown whether there is a causal relationship in this observation. The investigators are performing a large randomised trial of general versus local anaesthesia to definitively answer the question of whether anaesthetic type alters perioperative outcome.</brief_summary>
