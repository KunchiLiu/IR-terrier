	<detailed_description>This study is prospective observational single blinded study. A participant is visit in the ER who patient with epistaxis. Investigators will enroll 50 patients with epistaxis.

After proper management of epistaxis, investigators get blood sampling of the participant and, the participant has a reservation to "opd of cardiovascular division of Internal Medicine" (CV opd) in the hospital. When the participant visit CV opd, the participant undergo 24-hours-BP-monitoring and Pulse wave velocity (PWV). After that, the participant will be follow-up for 3 months. Investigators collect 50 data from 50 participants as a registry and analyze the data.</detailed_description>
