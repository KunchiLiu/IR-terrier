	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment (such as memory problems) due to cancer and its treatment can interfere with quality of life and can linger long after treatment has ended, yet research examining cognitive rehabilitation approaches has produced limited clinical benefit. The proposed study will provide information about systematic light exposure for the treatment of cognitive impairment in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors and will investigate how it works. This study would facilitate the development of this potential treatment, giving health care providers and cancer survivors a much-needed tool to help with cancer-related cognitive impairment.</brief_summary>
