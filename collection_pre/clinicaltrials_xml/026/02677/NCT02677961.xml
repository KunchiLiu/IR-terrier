	<brief_summary>Translational studies in cancer research can be impeded by the lack of high-quality clinical data that can be correlated with research questions. This is particularly true in the case of rare diseases, such as bone and soft tissue tumors. It is therefore the purpose of this study to create a prospective EHR-based clinical registry for individuals with bone and soft-tissue tumors.</brief_summary>
