	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effects of the nicotinic allosteric modulator JNJ-39393406 on psychometric performance and residual depressive symptoms in patients who have been diagnosed with unipolar and bipolar depression but currently DO NOT meet criteria for an episode of Major Depression or Manic Episode. Hypothesis: Allosteric modulation of the a7nAChR with JNJ-39393406 improves psychometric performance and residual depressive symptoms in patients with unipolar major depression disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression (BPD). Outcome measurements: - BACS - MADRS - BNSS - CGI-S- BP, - Questionnaire on smoking urges (QSU) and time to the first cigarette after waking up in the morning, - Readiness for discharge scale.</detailed_description>

All participant patients must have signed an informed consent document indicating they understand the purpose of the study and the procedures required for the study and are willing to participate by complying with the study procedures and restrictions. 4.

In the opinion of the investigator the patient can be safely treated with no more than 2 psychotropic medications as background therapy (SOS for agitation and sleeping medication are allowed in addition to the 2 psychotropics). 7. The background psychotropic(s) that will be continued throughout the 2 week trial must have been started at least 2 weeks prior to the baseline day at doses allowed by the local regulations and no changes in dose have been made during this prebaseline 2 week period. 8. Inpatients or outpatients at the discretion of the investigator (If outpatients the Readiness for Discharge Scale has to be administered at baseline and at each visit.) 1. Women of child bearing potential who do not practice contraception. 2. Psychosis, florid manic or major depressive episode during the 4 weeks preceding baseline day or current psychosis. 3. Patients on more than 2 psychotropic (hypnotics for sleep and occasional SOS for agitation do not count). 4. Smokes more than 40 cigarettes per day. 5.
