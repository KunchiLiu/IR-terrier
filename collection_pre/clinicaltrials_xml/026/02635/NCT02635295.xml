	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is: 1. to evaluate the effectiveness of the nursing student - nurse teacher mobile cooperation (MC) during the clinical practicum, 2. to measure the usability of the mobile application. The detailed research questions and hypothesis of this study are as follows: 1. What is the impact of MC on the nurse competence level of nursing students evaluated by work role, teaching-coaching and therapeutic interventions? H1: Nursing students' using MC will have a stronger change in the self-assessed level of nurse competence than those using standard cooperation (SC). H2: Nursing students' using MC will have higher level of nurse competence assessed by mentors after clinical practicum than those using SC. 2. What is the impact of MC on the clinical self-efficacy level of nursing students? H3: Nursing students' using mobile cooperation will have a stronger change in the self-assessed level of self-efficacy in clinical performance than those using standard cooperation. 3. What is the impact of mobile cooperation on the satisfaction level of nursing students evaluated by supervisory relationship, pedagogical atmosphere on the ward and the role of nurse teacher? H4: Nursing students' using mobile cooperation will have higher level of satisfaction with the supervisory relationship, pedagogical atmosphere on the ward and the role of nurse teacher after clinical practicum than those using standard cooperation. 4. What is the perceived usability of the mobile application by the intervention group? The ultimate goal is to establish a modern, innovative solution for the nursing student - nurse teacher cooperation to support and facilitate the clinical learning of nursing students during the clinical practicum.</brief_summary>
