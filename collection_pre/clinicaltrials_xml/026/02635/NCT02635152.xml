	<brief_title>Interpretation Bias Modification for Body Dysmorphic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study aims to examine the feasibility of a remote treatment for body dysmorphic disorder delivered via the Internet. To evaluate the efficacy of the IBM protocol we have developed in reducing negative appearance and evaluative related interpretations, we will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial over the internet. Individuals with a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder (N = 40) will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) IBM or 2) progressive muscle relaxation. Each condition will consist of eight 10-25 minute treatment sessions. Participants will complete two sessions per week for four weeks and will be administered assessments at pre-treatment, one week post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. We hypothesize that: 1) IBM will lead to greater reductions in BDD symptoms than the PMR condition; 2) IBM will lead to greater reductions in depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation than the PMR condition; 3) IBM will lead to greater reductions in threat interpretations and greater increases in benign interpretations than the PMR condition; 4) The effects of condition on BDD symptoms will be mediated by changes in BDD-related interpretation bias; and 5) The effects of training in the IBM condition will be maintained at the 3-month follow-up assessments.</detailed_description>
