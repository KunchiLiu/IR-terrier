	<brief_summary>Hypofractionated radiosurgery has been investigated in a few trials and appears to be safe and feasible. Investigators initiated this multicenter phase II prospective trial to analyse feasibility (toxicity) of hypofractionated radiosurgery with 5 fractions in patients with localised prostate cancer, who are ineligible for the "PREFERE trial" under the hypothesis that the ratio of patients with late toxicity ≥ grade 2 after 1 year amounts 2,8% and is significant lower than 17.5%.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental radiosurgery of prostate with 5 fractions each with 7,00 Gy (total application rate of 35,00 Gy). Planned visits are: Baseline, visits at every radiation day and four follow ups (4-6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and one year after last day of radiation).</detailed_description>
