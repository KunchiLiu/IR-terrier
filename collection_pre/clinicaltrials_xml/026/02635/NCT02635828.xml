	<brief_summary>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a displeasing experience that distresses surgical patients during the first 24 hours after a surgical procedure. The incidence of postoperative nausea occurs in about 50%, the incidence of postoperative vomiting is about 30%, and in high-risk patients, the PONV rate could be as high as 80%. Therefore, the study design of this single arm, non-randomized, pilot study assessed the efficacy and safety profile of a triple therapy combination with palonosetron, dexamethasone and promethazine to prevent PONV in patients undergoing craniotomies under general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Triple Therapy With Palonosetron for PON Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At induction of anesthesia, a triple therapy of palonosetron 0.075 mg IV, dexamethasone 10 mg IV and promethazine 25 mg IV was given as PONV prophylaxis. After surgery, subjects were transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) or post anesthesia care unit as clinically indicated. Ondansetron 4 mg IV was administered as primary rescue medication to subjects with PONV symptoms. PONV was assessed and collected every 24 hours for 5 days via direct interview and/or medical charts review.</detailed_description>
