	<brief_title>Phase III Trial of Topical Formulation of Sirolimus to Skin Lesions in Patients With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease that causes benign tumors on the almost whole body (including skin, brain, kidney, lung and heart), behavior disorder as autism, mental retardation and neurologic symptom as epilepsy. Angiofibroma is TSC-specific facial skin lesions, and hamartoma caused by increase of the component of skin connective tissues and blood vessels. Other skin lesions due to TSC are white macule(hypomelanotic macule), plaque, shagreen patch and ungual fibromas. Current therapeutic methods for angiofibroma are laser or surgical treatments, but there are problems as many relapses, deficiency of evidence, change of pigment, scar and risk of infection. This will be a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group trial. The trial has three phases; the screening phase, double-blinded treatment phase, and post-treatment phase. The screening phase comprises a screening visit where subject's initial eligibility will be evaluated. During double-blinded treatment phase, patients who meet all entry criteria for the trial will be randomized into two groups, and they will apply 0.2% NPC-12G gel or placebo gel topically twice a day for 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
