	<brief_summary>Some studies have shown that antiplatelets agents could reduce organ dysfunction in septic shock in mice and human models. Platelets are actors in immunity and their activation can be complicated by tissue damage with vascular occlusions which can lead to organ dysfunction. Investigators can hypothesize an increase in platelet activation and in leukocyte-platelet aggregates in septic shock.</brief_summary>
