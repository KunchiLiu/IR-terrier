	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorders characterized by intermittent obstructions of the upper airway during sleep. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has been shown to be the most efficacious treatment for OSA. It consists of a small device that provides positive airway pressure delivered by a mask attached to the patients nose/mouth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multinight CPAP for Sleep Apnea Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the multinight (MNT) algorithm on patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) over 45 nights while using a CPAP machine at home. The researchers are evaluating the performance of the existing algorithm as well as capturing the data to make enhancements. Two main stages of this algorithm will be assessed: i. Fast Track (FT) stage. In the FT stage the aim is to assess if the algorithm reliably and timely reaches approximate therapeutic pressure levels. ii. Slow Titration (ST). In the Slow Titration stage the aim is to assess if data samples have been appropriately collected in a pressure range so that the therapeutic pressure can be inferred according to the algorithm proposed.</detailed_description>
