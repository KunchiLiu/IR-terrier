	<brief_summary>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by recurrent obsessions and/or compulsions, is a disabling psychiatric condition affecting approximately 2-3% of the population. Whereas several first-line treatments have been established (e.g., pharmacological and psychological), a substantial proportion of patients (40-60%) fail to experience symptom remission, underscoring the need for research in this area. One approach to increasing treatment efficacy is to target underlying risk factors or dysfunctions that may in turn improve outcomes. One such risk factor is anxiety sensitivity (AS) cognitive concerns. AS cognitive concerns reflects fears of mental incapacitation (e.g., "It scares me when I am unable to keep my mind on a task"). There is recent evidence that AS cognitive concerns is uniquely associated with various obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom domains. However, questions remain as to whether reductions in AS cognitive concerns will lead to subsequent reductions in OC symptoms. The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the efficacy of a brief AS cognitive concerns intervention on reductions in OC symptoms.</brief_summary>
