	<brief_summary>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) has been considered as the first-line choice for the management of &gt;20mm kidney stones. The traditional nephrostomy tract of PNL was dilated to 24-30F, which is referred to as "Standard-PCNL". Standard PNL has an ideal stones free rate (SFR), however, at the cost of severe morbidity. To decrease the disadvantages related to standard PNL, "mini-perc" or "mini-PCNL", 20F or less, was first introduced to pediatric procedure in 1997, and subsequently implemented in adults with the expectation of similar SFR and low morbidity in the past twenty years. Although abundant efforts have been done, whether mini-perc outweigh standard-PNL for the treatment of &gt;20mm calculis in terms of efficiency and safety remains controversial. To solve this problem, we performed this multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mini-PCNL versus standard-PCNL for the management of 20-40 mm size kidney stones.Investigators plan to do a multi-center international randomized controlled trial(RCT). There are 44 hospitals included in this study, including The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Shenzhen People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, The first people's Hospital of Kashi, The First People's Hospital of Yulin, The Central Hospital of Shaoyang, Jiangmen Central Hospital, People's Hospital of Nanhai District, Foshan, The second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanhua University,Luoding People's Hospital, Qingyuan People's Hospital, The second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Chongqing Daping Hospital, Zhuzhou Central Hospital, HuiZhou Municipal Central Hospital, Jining NO.1 People's Hospital, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, The General Hospital of Shenyang Military, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, ShengJing Hospital Of China Medical University, Yichang Yiling Hospital, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Beijing Chuiyangliu Hospital, Renji Hospital Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuling Center Hospital of Chongqing City, Baoshan No.2 People's Hospital, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Shanghai General Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, 181st hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Danyang People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province, The fifth hospital of People's Liberation Army, Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, The 159th Central Hospital of People's Liberation Army, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, Venus International Hospital, Lions Kidney Hospital, Global Rainbow Healthcare and Istituto Clinico Humanitas. This study will be started at December,2015 and ended at November,2017.At least 1950 patients with 20-40mm renal calculi will be enrolled.By simple random sampling technique, patients will be assigned to two 975-patient groups (mini-PCNL group and standard-PCNL group). All the patients will be diagnosed definitely before operations with non-contrast CT, along with plain radiography (kidney ureter bladder, KUB), IVP and Ultrasound. Patients with positive preoperative urine culture should be treated with suitable antibiotics based on the culture sensitivity result for at least 72 h before standard PNL/mini-perc. Patients who have negative urine culture should receive a single dose of broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis just prior to the procedure. Surgical technique Under general or epidural anaesthesia, each patient is initially placed in the lithotomy position, and a 5 Fr or 6Fr ureteral catheter is inserted to the kidney and fixed with a 16 Fr Foley catheter. Then the patient is turned to the prone position. The choice of using C-arm fluoroscopic or ultrasonography guidance or a combination fashion for the percutaneous access was made at the discretion of the treating urologist. The length of the needle from skin to the collecting system is measured to ensure that the length of dilator is appropriate. No patient underwent bilateral simultaneous PCNL and patients with bilateral stones underwent surgery 4 weeks apart Mini-PCNL group: The access tract is dilated with a fascial dilator from 8F up to 18F. We defined access to the collecting system as gaining entry to the targeted urinary system and desired calix. For some complex cases, when indicated requiring multiple tracts, additional tracts were created in the same session. The stone was fragmented by pneumatic lithotripsy or Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy through 8/9.8F semirigid ureteroscope (Richard Wolf, Germany). The large fragments were extracted with a forcept, and small fragments were flushed out with an endoscopic pulsed perfusion pump. A silastic nephrostomy tube was placed at the end of procedure and a 4-6Fr double pigtail ureteral stent was left for 2 weeks after operation. X-ray check for residual stone fragments is also performed at the end of the procedure. Standard-PCNL group: The access tract is dilated from 8F to a maximum 24 F using fascial dilator. Rigid nephroscope were used. Stones were fragmented by pneumatic lithotripsy, Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy or EMS. The rest of the procedure is the same as described for patients in mini-perc group. Patients were candidates for the tubeless procedure only when the following strict conditions were met: single percutaneous tract, absence of major perforation of collecting system and bleeding, complete stone clearance assessed by intraoperative nephroscopy and fluoroscopy at the end of the procedure. For a tubeless procedure, the flank was compressed for 5 min. Patient was monitored for postoperative complications. Data collection Data for the 2 groups -demographic characteristics, site of target calix, site of access, S.T.O.N.E score, hemoglobin drop, postoperative pain, duration of procedure, hospital stay, cases of tubeless, complications (modified Clavien system), stone clearance (SFR of postoperative day 1 and 1 month follow-up), serum levels of markers of the systemic response to surgery-induced tissue trauma (CRP) and the need for auxiliary treatment (for example, re-miniperc, RIRS and ESWL) - are compared. Main study endpoints: The endpoint is SFR of postoperative day 1 and 1 month follow-up. The other endpoints include complications, cases of tubeless and hospital stays. Initial SFR is assessed by KUB at day 1 after operation. Non-contrast CT is obtained for all patients at 1 month after the operation to evaluate the final SFR, allowing time for the spontaneous passage of stone fragments. Any information concerning needs for auxiliary treatment (for example, re-miniperc, RIRS and ESWL) will be recorded. Stone-free status are defined as either the absence of any residual stone fragments or the presence of clinically insignificant residual stone fragments in the kidney which were defined as ≦ 4mm, asymptomatic, non-obstructive and non-infectious stone particles. The stone size was defined as the largest diameter of single stone on plain abdominal radiograph of the kidneys ureters and bladder (KUB) and/or non-contrast CT. In the case of multiple stones, the summation of the largest diameters of the stones was used. Demographic characteristics include age, sex, BMI, stone size and location, etc. Operation time is defined as the time from puncture to the placement of the nephrostomy tube. Hospital stay was defined as days between the surgery date and discharge date. Postoperative pain (visual analogue scale [VAS], use of analgesics) will be recorded. The rate of hemoglobin drop is assessed by comparing the preoperative Hb level with 24-hour postoperative Hb level. If the procedure is considered as successful, the pigtail stent is removed as outpatient after 2weeks. Follow-up including non-contrast CT will be generally scheduled in 1 month. Bleeding severity is judged by the treating surgeon, and transfusions are administered according to local practice guideline. Complications of all patients are recorded according to modified Clavien classification system.</detailed_description>
