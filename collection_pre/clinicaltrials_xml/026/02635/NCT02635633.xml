	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate a novel stimulation protocol of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of unifocal neocortical epilepsy, namely continuous thetaburst stimulation (cTBS). As this is a pilot study, the primary endpoint is on safety and tolerability of the treatment. However, information on clinical efficacy and mechanism of action will also be collected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Thetaburst Stimulation for the Treatment of Refractory Epilepsy - Safety, Feasibility and Proof-of-concept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Study design: This is an open label prospective pilot trial of continuous thetaburst stimulation (cTBS) in patients with unifocal neocortical epilepsy. The study comprises a 13-week period, consisting of 4 weeks baseline seizure frequency assessment, a one-week treatment period with baseline assessments on Monday (T0) and stimulation sessions from Tuesday to Friday (T1-T4), and an 8-week follow-up period with short-term assessments immediately after the final stimulation session on Friday afternoon (T4) and long-term assessments after 2 weeks (FU2) and 8 weeks (FU8). 2. Objectives: The primary objective is to assess the feasibility, safety and tolerability of cTBS in refractory epilepsy patients. The secondary objectives are to assess the clinical efficacy and associated mechanism of action of cTBS in unifocal neocortical epilepsy. 3. Rationale: An open label prospective design allows to make a first estimate on the safety, feasibility and tolerability of cTBS in refractory epilepsy patients. There are currently no reports available of cTBS performed in epilepsy patients. The ultimate aim is to assess clinical efficacy of cTBS with regard to seizure frequency, but a feasibility and safety study is a prerequisite in order to achieve this goal.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Refractory unifocal neocortical epilepsy with a welldefined ictal onset zone based on a standardized presurgical evaluation â‰¥ 4 seizures/month, for at least six months On a stable drug regimen for at least 2 months IQ &gt;70 Reliable completion of a seizure diary by patient or caretakers Therapeutic compliance in the past Informed consent signed Pregnancy, shortterm birth wish or childbearing age without adequate birth control History of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures Intracranial metal hardware (excluding dental filling): surgical clips, shrapnell, electrodes under the stimulation area Presence of pacemaker, implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD), permanent medication pumps, cochlear implants or deep brain stimulation (DBS) Patients with a vagus nerve stimulator are not excluded, provided that adequate distance between the coil and the implanted material can be maintained. As the short duration of the study will not interfere with an ongoing presurgical evaluation and/or its eventual conclusion, the patients in the course of the evaluation or awaiting surgery are also eligible for inclusion.</criteria>
