	<brief_summary>The optimal antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥1 with concomitant acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or revascularisation by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting, is still unknown. For these patients current North American and European guidelines recommend a triple therapy strategy, including vitamin K antagonists (VKA), aspirin and clopidogrel. A major drawback of this triple therapy strategy is a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding. Furthermore, the ommitance of aspirin and the introduction of more potent P2Y12 inhibitors as well as the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC), created numerous new antithrombotic treatment strategies for these patients with overlapping conditions. To date, evidence on the risks and benefits of these new antithrombotic treatment strategies is lacking. The WOEST 2 Registry aims to improve medical care for patients with AF and/or a heart valve prosthesis ánd undergoing coronary revascularisation through a better understanding of their demographics, antithrombotic management and related in-hospital and long-term outcomes. The WOEST 2 Registry will provide data to support benchmarking of antithrombotic treatment patterns and patient outcomes. Objective: To assess the different management patterns and related in-hospital and long-term safety and efficacy outcomes of combined use of chronic oral anticoagulation and a P2Y12 inhibitor in patients with atrial fibrillation and/or a heart valve prosthesis undergoing coronary revascularisation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>In order to be eligible to be included in this registry, a subject must meet ALL of the following criteria: 1. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; 2. Patients with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (prior to hospitalisation ór during hospitalisation within 72h after coronary revascularisation) and/or with a heart valve prosthesis (aortic/mitral); 3. Chronic treatment with OAC or NOAC therapy at inclusion or the intention to start chronic treatment with OAC or NOAC within 72h after coronary revascularisation AND with intended duration of treatment for at least one year after inclusion in the registry; 4. Indication for coronary revascularisation by CABG or PCI (with deployment of at least 1 coronary stent); 5. Prescription of a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) because of CABG following acute coronary syndrome* and /or because of PCI (with deployment of at least 1 coronary stent). 6. Patient has provided written informed consent. A potential subject who meets ANY of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: 1. Patients unable to sign informed consent (including mental disabled patients); 2. Patients with life expectancy &lt; 1 year; 3. Allergy or intolerance to P2Y12 inhibitors.</criteria>
