	<brief_title>The Relation Between Serum Ascorbic Acid Concentration and Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The micronutrient vitamin C is an effective water soluble antioxidant that scavenges several reactive oxygen species, thus reducing oxidative stress, It also acts as an enzymatic cofactor to the enzymes lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl hydroxylase, which is required for synthesis of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, Collagen requires hydroxyproline bridges across the triple helix to provide stability to it, Ascorbic acid also causes down regulation of the metalloproteinase-2 and biosynthesis of collagen where it is required for the formation of triple helical structure of collagen. Thus, ascorbic acid participates in the equilibrium between synthesis and degradation of collagen and this may be critical in reducing the occurrence of preterm PROM.</detailed_description>
