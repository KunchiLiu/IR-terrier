	<brief_summary>The present study is based on hypotheses that some as yet unknown genetic factors may result in recurrent miscarriage (RM). Consequently, the main aim of this study was to gain new information about the underlying genetic causes of RM in the Egyptian population and to investigate the expression of ERK and p-ERK protein in human placenta and their corresponding tissue, to assess the significance of MAPK signal pathway in progression of recurrent miscarriage and PI3K-Akt Pathway.</brief_summary>
