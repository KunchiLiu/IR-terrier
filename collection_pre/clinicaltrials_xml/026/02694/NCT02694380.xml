	<brief_title>Measuring the Effect of Radiation Therapy on Patient Activity Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the University of Pittsburgh (UPMC) St. Margaret and UPMC Shadyside, in the department of radiation oncology, breast, prostate, head and neck, and lung cancer patients will receive the standard treatment for their cancer and in no way will this study interfere with this treatment. Prior to initiation of radiation, consenting patients will be given Misfit activity tracking devices (accelerometers) to be worn on their wrist to track their activity levels throughout the course radiation therapy. Bracelets will be given to patients by the PI or co-investigators (MDs involved in patient's care) at date of consent and returned at completion of the study. The bracelets will track daily steps taken, calories burned, miles walked, and restful and restless sleep. Again, the purpose of the study is merely to measure the affect radiation therapy has on activity levels of patients.</detailed_description>
