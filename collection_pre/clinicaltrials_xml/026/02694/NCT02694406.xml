	<brief_summary>As ovarian cancer is characterized by an anarchic neovascularization resulting in a wide number of immature microvessels. These vessels are characterized by a lack of coverage by pericytes and the higher expression of one of the receptors of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor on both endothelial and epithelial cells of ovarian cystadenocarcinomas. These physio pathogenic characteristics have been demonstrated to be in line with variations of MR perfusion parameters. Unlike many lesions that occur in other parts of the body, biopsy should not be performed in adnexal masses that demonstrate no evidence of peritoneal disease because it may cause spillage of cystic contents, potentially leading to iatrogenic up-staging of what may have been a malignant tumor that was limited.</brief_summary>
