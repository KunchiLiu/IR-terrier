	<brief_title>The Advantages and Disadvantages Between Uncut Roux-en-Y Reconstruction and Billroth II Reconstruction After Laparoscopy-assisted Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To search which is the better reconstructions by comparing and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages between Uncut Roux-en-Y and Billroth II reconstructions after laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Method: It's a prospective study including all patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) in the First Hospital of Jilin University, from February 2016 to February 2017. All surgical procedures will be performed by the single surgery team, which is leaded by professor Wang Quan. The reconstruction method will be selected randomly from Uncut Roux-en-Y and Billroth II anastomosis by drawing lots preoperatively without distinct indications. Clinical data, operation data and perioperative complications and related physiological indexes of differences.</detailed_description>
