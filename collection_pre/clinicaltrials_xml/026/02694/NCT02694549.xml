	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Age ≥18 years Patients eligible for a nonemergent diagnostic or interventional catheterization via a femoral sheath of less or equal 6Fr In the investigator's opinion, the patient is suitable for the CaveoVasc® System , conventional hemostasis techniques and participation in an investigational trial. Understand and sign the study specific written informed consent form. Patients with significant anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10g/DL, Hct&lt;30). Patients with a baseline INR &gt; 1.5 Active bleeding or high bleeding risk (severe liver failure, active peptic ulcer, creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min, platelets count &lt; 100,000 mm3), patients with chronic use of vitamin K antagonists, direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa antagonists Severe concomitant disease with life expectancy below 12 months Uncontrolled systemic hypertension Patients who are immunocompromised. Patients who need a puncture needle longer than 8 cm due to morbidity obesity Active systemic or cutaneous infection or inflammation Prior arterial surgery in abdomen and/or lower extremities Cardiogenic shock Patients who are known to be pregnant or lactating. Patients having a complication(s) at the femoral artery access site presheath removal including hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula. Prior femoral vascular surgery or vascular graft in region of access site. Documented chronic peripheral arterial insufficiency preventing the use of the femoral technique Patients who are currently participating in another clinical trial of an investigational drug or device that has not concluded the followup period. Patients with known allergy to components of the device. Patients who cannot adhere to or complete the investigational protocol for any reason</criteria>
