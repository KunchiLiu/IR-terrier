	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer, through the recognition and removal of pre-cancerous lesions, which in most cases evolve with a sequence that goes through formation of high-grade dysplasia (HGD). The probability of HGD increases with the increase of the lesion of the polyp itself. Lesions&gt; 2 cm are present in 1% of colonoscopy screening. The resection of these lesions presents a greater technical difficulty and consequently a decrease in the efficiency. The rate of incomplete resection reported in the literature reaches 10% while that of recurrence / residual adenoma 16.4 / 31.7%. The aim of the study SCALP is to evaluate the incidence of complications, efficacy and cost of endoscopic resection of colic lesions&gt; 2cm in a setting of clinical practice in an unselected population</brief_summary>
