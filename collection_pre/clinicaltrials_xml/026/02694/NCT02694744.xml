	<brief_title>Patiromer With or Without Food for the Treatment of Hyperkalemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 110 eligible participants with hyperkalemia will be randomly assigned to receive a patiromer starting dose of 8.4 g/day, either with or without food. All participants will undergo a screening period (1 day) to determine eligibility for study entry. Eligible participants will be treated for 4 weeks and followed for 2 weeks after completing the patiromer treatment. There are six planned clinic visits during the Treatment Period and two planned visits after the last dose of patiromer during the Follow-up Period. The dose of patiromer may be increased or decreased (titrated) based on participants' individual potassium response.</detailed_description>
