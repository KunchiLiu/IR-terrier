	<brief_summary>Even with optimal anti-malaria therapy and supportive care, severe and cerebral malaria are associated with a 10-30% mortality rate and neurocognitive deficits in up to 33% of survivors. Adjunctive therapies that modify host immune-pathological processes may further improve outcome over that possible with anti-malarials alone. Investigators aim to evaluate a PPARγ agonist ( "rosiglitazone") as adjunctive therapy for severe malaria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone Adjunctive Therapy for Severe Malaria in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the use of artemisinin-based therapy has improved outcomes in severe malaria, the mortality rates remain high. Adjunctive therapies that target the underlying immunopathology may further reduce morbidity and mortality in severe and cerebral malaria beyond that possible with anti-malarials alone. Pre-clinical data have established a beneficial role for PPARγ agonists in experimental cerebral malaria. A proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial of uncomplicated malaria in Thailand has extended these findings to an informative patient population, showing that adjunctive treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone improves parasite clearance, and reduces biomarkers of inflammation (IL-6 and MCP-1) and endothelial activation (Ang-2 to Ang-1 ratio), and increases neuro-protective pathways (BDNF). The previous clinical trial also established the safety and tolerability of short course rosiglitazone in adults with malaria infection. Importantly, rosiglitazone does not induce insulin release or hypoglycemia in malaria-infected patients. Based on these data, and on studies demonstrating neuro-protective effects on PPARγ agonists in CNS disease and injury, the investigators believe that PPARγ agonists are promising candidates for adjunctive therapy for severe and cerebral malaria. In this study the efficacy of rosiglitazone vs. placebo control as adjunct to standard of care anti-malarial therapy in children with severe (including cerebral) malaria will be tested. The underlying hypothesis is that the addition of rosiglitazone to standard antimalarial therapy in severe P. falciparum infection is safe and will result in improved clinical outcomes and lower rates of long-term neurocognitive impairment.</detailed_description>
