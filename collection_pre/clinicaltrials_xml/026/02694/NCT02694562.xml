	<brief_title>Microparticle Enhanced Cytotoxic Transarterial Embolization Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colon or rectal carcinoma that has spread to the liver is considered to be metastatic and is a Stage IV cancer. If the metastasized tumor is unresectable, the only current treatment is chemotherapy. Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is considered as a palliative treatment in advanced metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC), with the potential of local tumor control. TACE has evolved in the past 8 years to include drug-delivery devices that can target and deliver drugs from small microparticles (DEB-TACE). Superselective DEB-TACE has the potential to penetrate deeper into the tumor's vasculature to reach peripheral growing points. Loading these microparticles with a cytotoxic drug may improve the level of local tumor control. The MIRACLE III study is a controlled, pilot, single center (Italy) study on 18 subjects with pretreated non-resectable mCRC.</detailed_description>
