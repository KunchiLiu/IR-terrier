	<brief_summary>The goal is to investigate the efficacy, safety and possible neuro- and cardioprotective effects of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in adult cardiac patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement surgery with a biological prosthesis. Neuropsychological evaluation preoperatively and at 30d after surgery will establish if there are any differences in neuropsychological performance between groups. A large array of biochemical markers will be analyzed from plasma samples taken at different time points. Additionally skin biopsies from the lower limb will be taken before and after performing RIPC on said limb. During the venous cannulation phase a atrial biopsy will be taken. The biochemical markers from plasma and tissue samples will be used to asses brain tissue damage, inflammation and cardiac tissue damage between groups. This will be a single center prospective randomized study with two groups. A intervention group (RIPC) and a control group. Study size is: 40 patients in total, 20 patients per group.</brief_summary>
