This study investigates the effect of Combined Decongestive Therapy and pneumatic compression pump on body image in patients with lymphedema secondary to breast cancer treatment.42 women with breast cancer related lymphedema participated. All patients completed the body image and relationships scale. Researchers divided the participants randomly into an intervention (n=21) or control group (n=21). In the first phase, CDT was accompanied by use of a compression pump for four weeks, three days per week. In the second phase, Combined DecongestiveTherapy was performed daily without compression pump for four weeks by patients at home. At the end of each phase, both groups completed the questionaire.
