	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography-based Positioning for Macular Hole Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy of macular hole (MH) surgery with the halting of prone positioning by monitoring the MH closure in the swept source optical coherence tomographic (SS-OCT) images was compared with the surgery by the surgeon's decision. All eyes were treated by pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling, and gas tamponade. MH closure was defined as a connection of the edges of the sensory retina in the SS-OCT images.The macular hole closure and visual outcome were compared.</detailed_description>
