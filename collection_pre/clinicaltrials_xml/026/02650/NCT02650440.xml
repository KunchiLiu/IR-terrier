	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the effects of novel versus conventional locomotor training using a robotic gait orthosis (LT-RGO) after stroke. The novel LT-RGO protocol imposes progressive decrease of speed and guidance force as compared with the conventional protocol which is the progressive increase of LT-RGO speed with progressive decrease of guidance force. The hypothesis is that the novel LT-RGO protocol, by establishing a progressive decrease in gait velocity and guidance force, may facilitate greater motor recovery compared to the use of a conventional protocol.</brief_summary>
