	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study. The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and feasible to give the participant cyclophosphamide (a type of chemotherapy), natural killer (NK) cells, and an antibody called Hu3F8 as a treatment for neuroblastoma. NK cells are a type of white blood cell. Funding Source- FDA OOPD</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of NB as defined by international criteria,.e., histopathology (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) or bone marrow metastases plus high urine catecholamine levels. Highrisk NB as defined by riskrelated treatment guidelines1 and the International NB Staging System, i.e., stage 4 with (any age) or without (&gt;365 days of age) MYCN amplification, MYCNamplified stage 3 (unresectable; any age), or MYCNamplified stage 4S. Patients must have a history of tumor progression or persistent disease or failure to achieve complete response following standard therapy. Patients must have evaluable (microscopic marrow metastasis, elevated tumor markers, positive MIBG or PET scans) or measurable (CT, MRI) disease documented after completion of prior systemic therapy. Disease staging approximately within one month of treatment Prior treatment with murine and hu3F8 is allowed. Patients with prior m3F8, hu3F8, ch14.18 or hu14.18 treatment must have HAHA antibody titer â‰¤1300 Elisa units/ml. Human antimouse antibody positivity is allowed. Eligible NK donor Children and adults are eligible Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this program. Donor Inclusion Criteria Donor is bloodrelated and HLAhaploidentical to the recipient. Donor has undergone serologic testing for transmissible diseases as per blood banking guidelines for organ and tissue donors. Tests include but are not limited to: Hepatitis B Surface Antigen, Hepatitis B Surface Antibody, Hepatitis B Core Antibody, Hepatitis C antibody, EpsteinBarr Virus Antibody, HIV, HTLV I and II, Varicella Zoster (Herpes Zoster), Herpes Simplex Antibody, Cytomegalovirus Antibodies, Syphilis (RPR profile) for adolescents and adults, measles for pediatric patients, West Nile Virus, Chagas screen, and Toxoplasma antibodies. Donor must be able to undergo leukopheresis for total volume of 1015 liters. There is no age restriction for the donor. Patients with CR/VGPR disease Existing severe major organ dysfunction, i.e., renal, cardiac, hepatic, neurologic, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal toxicity &gt; grade 3 except for hearing loss, alopecia, anorexia, nausea, hyperbilirubinemia and hypomagnesemia from TPN, which may be grade 3 ANC should be &gt;500/uL Platelet count &gt;75K/uL. History of allergy to mouse proteins Active lifethreatening infection Inability to comply with protocol requirements Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Donor Cardiac risk factors precluding ability to undergo leukopheresis Concurrent malignancy or autoimmune disease Donor is pregnant</criteria>
