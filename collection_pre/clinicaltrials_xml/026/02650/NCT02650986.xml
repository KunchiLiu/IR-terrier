	<brief_summary>This phase I/IIa trial studies the side effects and best dose of a gene-modified T cells and to see how effective it is in treating patients with solid tumors expressing cancer-testis antigens 1 (NY-ESO-1) gene that have spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or have spread to other places in the body (metastatic). A T cell is a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill abnormal cells of the body. Placing a modified gene for NY-ESO-1 into the patients' T cells in the laboratory and then given them back to the patient may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading, and it may also allow genetically modified T cells to grow.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of adoptive transfer of autologous NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor (TCR) (NY-ESO-1 reactive TCR retroviral vector transduced autologous PBL)/dominant-negative transforming growth factor-beta receptor II (dnTGFbetaRII) (TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes [TILs]) transgenic T cells. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. NY-ESO-1 TCR/ dnTGFÎ²RII transgenic T cell persistence by analyzing serial peripheral blood samples for the presence of T cells with the NY-ESO-1 TCR by tetramer analysis. II. To study T cell differentiation that correlates with higher anti-tumor responses. III. To test the hypothesis that NY-ESO-1 TCR/dnTGFbetaRII will constitute in cells more efficient in inducing tumor regression. IV. Determine objective tumor responses by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of NY-ESO-1 TCR/TGFbDNRII-transduced TILs followed by a phase II study. Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -5 and -4. Patients then receive NY-ESO-1 reactive TCR retroviral vector transduced autologous PBL with TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous TILs infusion on day 0. After completion of study treatment, patients are follow up at weeks 1-4, 8 and 12, at 6 and 9 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and yearly for 9 years.</detailed_description>
