	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the effect of antiviral therapy with entecavir and lamivudine for hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma after radical hepatectomy. Included patients will randomly divide into two groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Entecavir for Postoperative HBV-HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a poor prognosis, and its incidence has increased dramatically in many countries. Hepatectomy is a radical therapy for early-stage HCC. However, even after radical resection, the prognosis for HCC patients remains discouraging because of the high recurrence rate and frequent incidence of intrahepatic metastasis. Therefore, preventing HCC recurrence is very important. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major risk factor for HCC development in China. Some retrospective studies have shown that lamivudine or entecavir treatment for HBV-related HCC patients can effectively reduce the HCC recurrence rate and increase the survival rate after hepatectomy. However, which drug has more efficacy has not been addressed.</detailed_description>
