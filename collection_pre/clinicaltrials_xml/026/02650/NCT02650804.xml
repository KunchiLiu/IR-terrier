	<brief_title>BPM31510 Administered Intravenously With or Without Gemcitabine in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study to examine the safety and effectiveness of BPM31510 administered as a 144-hour continuous intravenous (IV) infusion as a monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer patients as 2nd / 3rd line therapy. This study will occur in two parts. Part 1 of the study will enroll ten (10) patients in the BPM31510 (monotherapy arm) and enroll ten (10) patients in the BPM31510 plus gemcitabine (combination therapy arm). If at least one of ten patients treated (in either arm) experiences a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, after 2 cycles of treatment, then Part 2 of the study will enroll an additional 15 patients for a total of 25 patients in the arms(s) showing response. In the absence of at least one CR or PR, if at least 3 patients experience stable disease in either or both of the treatment arms the Sponsor can choose to enroll the additional 15 patients into the applicable treatment arm(s) into the expansion stage. BPM31510 Nanosuspension Injection (40 mg/mL) will be administered IV over 144 hours. Each patient will receive 2 consecutive 72-hour infusions per week (Tuesday-Friday and Friday-Monday). Patients enrolled in the monotherapy arm will receive a BPM31510 dose of 171 mg/Kg. The dose for BPM31510 in the combination arm is 110 mg/Kg. Patients enrolled in the combination therapy arm will also be treated with gemcitabine IV once weekly (starting at week 3) at a starting dose of 1000 mg/m2. Cycle 1 of therapy is either 6 weeks in duration for patients with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 6 weeks (monotherapy) or 6 weeks in duration for patients with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 6 weeks plus gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 21, 28 and 35 (combination therapy). Cycles 2-12 are 4 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 4 weeks (monotherapy) or 4 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 4 weeks plus gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 7, 14 and 21 (combination therapy). Response will be assessed after Cycle 2 (10 weeks) and patients who continue onto Cycles 2-12 will be assessed every 2 cycles (8 weeks). Toxicity will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.02). Assessments of the antitumor activity of the combination will be performed at the end of Cycle 2 and every 2 cycles thereafter using standard techniques such as computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with measurable disease. Response will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Patients who experience no unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, may receive additional 28-day cycles for up to 1 year. Patients will continue BPM31510 alone, or in combination with gemcitabine, for a maximum of 12 cycles in the absence of intolerable toxicity and progression. If gemcitabine in the combination therapy arm is discontinued due to chemotherapy-related toxicity, patients may continue to receive BPM31510 as monotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient has a histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The patient has undergone; at least one prior, but no more than 2 prior standard, nongemcitabine, therapies for pancreatic cancer (for enrollment into the combination therapy arm); or, at least one prior, but no more than 2 prior standard, gemcitabine, therapies as monotherapy or as part of combination chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer (for enrollment into the monotherapy arm). The patient is at least 18 years old. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status Measurable tumor lesions according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (Section 10.2). In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient has a life expectancy of &gt; 3 months. Sexually active patients and their partners agree to use an accepted method of contraception during the course of the study (Appendix C:Guidelines Regarding Women of Childbearing Potential). Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week prior to beginning study treatment. The patient has adequate organ and marrow function as follows: absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1500 mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, serum creatinine &lt; upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X (ULN) ; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) if no liver involvement or ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal with liver involvement. The patient has serum electrolytes (including calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, sodium and potassium) within normal limits (supplementation to maintain normal electrolytes is allowed). The patient has adequate coagulation: prothrombin time (PT) and an International Normalized Ratio (INR), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the informed consent document. The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA class III and IV), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. The patient has active heart disease including myocardial infarction within previous 3 months, symptomatic coronary artery disease, arrhythmias not controlled by medication, unstable angina pectoris, or uncontrolled congestive heart failure (NYHA class III and IV). The patient has received chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks or has received nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. The patient has received radiation to ≥ 25% of his or her bone marrow within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.

Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (negative imaging study, if clinically indicated, within 4 weeks of Screening Visit). History of other malignancies (except adequately treated Stage 1 cancer, cured basal cell carcinoma, superficial bladder cancer, Breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) unless documented free of cancer for ≥5 years.
