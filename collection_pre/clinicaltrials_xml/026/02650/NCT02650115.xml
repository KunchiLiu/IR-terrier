	<brief_summary>Chronic liver diseases are common and the two main causes in France are NAFLD (No Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic) and ALD (alcoholic liver disease). Because of the importance of the current global obesity, NAFLD has become very common and it is estimated that its prevalence in the general population reaches 20-30%. NAFLD (No Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic) and ALD (alcoholic liver disease) includes a broad spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis isolated (infiltration of fat in the liver), in hepatic inflammation, fibrosis (abnormally high accumulation of extracellular components in the functional liver tissue) and finally cirrhosis and its complications. Choline deficiency (essential nutrient generally classified as Class B vitamins) has been associated with liver damage each characterizing NAFLD and ALD. The amount of choline in the body depends in particular on food intake and degradation of choline by the intestinal microbiota. NAFLD and ALD are complex pathologies resulting from the interaction of environmental / nutritional factors and a genetic background. It therefore appears now necessary to study the influence of the relationship between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and gut microbiota metabolism of choline on the severity of liver injury observed in NAFLD and ALD. If the interaction of these three elements (the host genetics - environmental factors - and intestinal microbiota metabolic choline) has an influence on the severity of the lesions of NAFLD and ALD direct application may be of bring a food supplement choline in patients at risk (mutation of the PEMT gene (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase), postmenopausal women, microbiota profile for increased degradation of dietary choline) to restore the amount of choline in the body and thus to avoid a worsening of the ALD or NAFLD and progression to cirrhosis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>NAFLD (No alcoholic liver disease) and / or ALD (alcoholic liver disease) Liver biopsy scheduled NAFLD is defined by the presence of hepatic steatosis (ultrasound or retrospectively confirmed histologically) without concomitant treatment responsible for steatosis (corticosteroids, amiodarone, methotrexate, tamoxifen) without risk drinking of alcoholic beverages (&gt; 210 g / week in men or&gt; 140 g / week in women), and no other cause of chronic liver disease. ALD will be defined by the presence of chronic liver disease in a patient with a risk of alcohol consumption (&gt; 210 g / week in men or&gt; 140 g / week in women).
