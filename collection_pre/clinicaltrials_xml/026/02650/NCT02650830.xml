	<brief_summary>"The goal of this work is to critically test the hypothesis that there exists a different profile of bile acids (BAs) in patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with normal controls. Through confirmation of different profile of BAs in T2DM, investigator will suggest modulation of specific bile acids as a new possible treatment target in patients with T2DM. Investigator also expect the specific BAs signature will be used to screen T2DM before hyperglycemia. In addition, investigator will evaluate the association between each BA species and serum total glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) concentrations to determine if the specific BAs profile is related with total GLP-1 or FGF-19 concentration in serum. Investigatr also evaluates the correlation between each BA species and metabolic profiles and oxidative stress marker to find possible roles of each BA component in glucose metabolism.</brief_summary>
