	<brief_title>Mitochondrial Respiratory Function in Mammalian Skeletal Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20 men and women, 30-60 years, equally divided between patients diagnosed with advanced (stages III or IV), persistent (recurrence within 6 months) or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (n=10) and healthy age matched control subjects (n=10) will be studied. Muscle biopsies will be collected from cancer patients before and after a 4 week standard of care (SOC) treatment. Muscle biopsies from healthy control subjects will be collected at baseline only. Lean body mass and fat mass will be determined by a DEXA scan before and after 4 week SOC treatment (cancer patients) to document any change in body composition (cachexia), and at baseline only in the age-matched healthy controls. Blood will be collected from both cancer patients and healthy subjects to examine hormone levels at the time of biopsy.</detailed_description>
