	<brief_summary>Anesthesia-induced atelectasis persist in the postoperative period but are not usually diagnosed because imaging techniques are required. The aim of the study is to determine whether the value of SpO2â‰¤96 while breathing room air (0.21 FiO2) for 5 min, maneuver that we defined as the Air Test, was able to diagnose atelectasis in the postoperative period after a general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
