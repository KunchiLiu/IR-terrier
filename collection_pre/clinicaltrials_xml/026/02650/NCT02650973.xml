	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, single-blind, 3-period crossover study in healthy subjects to assess PK, PD, and safety (including immunogenicity) of a single 6mg subcutaneous injection of CHS-1701 or 6mg SC dose of Neulasta given during each period. The screening period may occur up to 28 days prior to the confinement period. After screening, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three possible treatment sequences. Treatments will be spaced by not less than 28 days.</detailed_description>
