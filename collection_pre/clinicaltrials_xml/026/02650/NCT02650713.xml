	<criteria>Confirmed locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumor in participants who have progressed on a standard therapy, are intolerant to standard therapy, and/or are nonamenable to standard therapy Life expectancy (in the opinion of the investigator) of &gt;= 12 weeks Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 01 All acute toxic effects of any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgical procedure must have resolved to Grade &lt;= 1 or returned to baseline, except alopecia (any grade) and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy Adequate hematological, liver, and renal functions Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study treatment in premenopausal women and women &lt;= 2 years after start of menopause For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drugs Locally confirmed CEA expression in tumor tissue Active or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases as determined by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation during screening and prior radiographic assessments Spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation or previously diagnosed and treated spinal cord compression without evidence that disease has been clinically stable for &gt;= 2 weeks prior to enrollment Leptomeningeal disease Malignancies other than nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) within 5 years prior to enrollment, with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and treated with expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent) Significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases which could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including diabetes mellitus, pulmonary disorders, and known autoimmune diseases Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (CHF) of any New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification (Class II or greater), serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment (exceptions: atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia), history of myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days before Day 1 or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study Known HIV Active Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) infection (required at screening) Severe infections within 28 days prior to Day 1, including, but not limited to hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia or active tuberculosis Received oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 14 days prior to Day 1 (Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., for prevention of a urinary tract infection) are eligible) Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that would contraindicate the use of an investigational drug</criteria>
