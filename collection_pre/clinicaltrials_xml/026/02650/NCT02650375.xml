	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Metatinib Tromethamine tablet in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer,or con squamous NSCLC. Patients receive Metatinib orally 200mg once daily (QD) or 100mg twice daily (BID) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The study will determine whether MET gene mutation, amplification, as well as MET protein overexpression in tumor tissue correlate with treatment efficacy and clinical outcome. The potential PD biomarker for Metatinib will also be explored.</brief_summary>
