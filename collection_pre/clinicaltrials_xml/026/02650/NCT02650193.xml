	<brief_summary>This is a study of how one or more injections of HSP-130 under the skin effect the white blood cell counts and drug levels in women with breast cancer that has not spread to distant sites in the body (non-metastatic). This will be studied in women before breast surgery or while receiving chemotherapy. Safety will also be studied. Additionally, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and safety of single and multiple doses of HSP-130 in subjects with non-metastatic breast cancer. This study will determine the dose to move forward for future clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Of The Safety And Effects Of One Or More Doses Of HSP-130 Injected Under The Skin In Women With Breast Cancer That Has Not Spread To Distant Sites In The Body.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, sequential enrollment study characterizing the pharmacodynamic (PD), pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety of HSP-130 in subjects with non-metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received chemotherapy at any point prior to enrollment in this study (ZIN-130-1504). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and safety of single and multiple doses of HSP-130 in subjects with non-metastatic breast cancer. This study will determine the dose to move forward for future clinical trials. There are two aspects of the study. In the initial part of the study, 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled to receive HSP-130 treatment (3 mg , or 6 mg by subcutaneous injection) during the period between biopsy and definitive surgery. This will determine whether 3 mg and 6 mg have similar or different effects on the PD variables (absolute neutrophil counts and CD34+ cell counts). This part of the study is referred to as Cycle 0 since study subjects will receive no chemotherapy while receiving HSP-130 until the effect of HSP-130 on the PD variables is known. A total of 12 subjects may be enrolled in Cycle 0. The objective of Cycle 1-4 is to determine the dose to be taken forward to Phase 3 clinical trials. Cycles 1-4 subjects will receive HSP-130 after their definitive breast surgery at the time they receive TAC chemotherapy (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Subjects will receive up to 4 cycles of every 3 week TAC chemotherapy with HSP-130 given on Day 2 of the chemotherapy regimen. - If the 3 mg dose is found to be inferior (potentially subtherapeutic) to the 6 mg dose in Cycle 0, only the 6 mg dose will be studied in Cycles 1-4 (n=12), when subjects receive concomitant chemotherapy. - If the 3 mg dose is found to be comparable to the PD results obtained in Cycle 0 with 6 mg, the 3 mg dose (n=12) will also be studied in women receiving TAC chemotherapy. Data from the HSP-130 6 mg regimen (plus 3 mg, as appropriate) will be analysed, discussed with the FDA and determination if a dose greater than 6 mg is appropriate to study (e.g., 12 mg). If all three doses are studied, a total enrollment of up to 36 subjects is projected for Cycles 1-4.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A subject will be eligible for study participation if all of the following criteria are met at Screening: 1.

Females ≥ 18 years 3. Histologically confirmed and documented invasive breast cancer 4. Breast cancer without evidence of distant metastases (Stage 4) based on staging workup 5. Chemotherapy naive, who have not received chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting and who are candidates for chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting of taxane/cyclophosphamidebased regimen, e.g., TAC, as background chemotherapy 6. Zubrod/WHO/ECOG performance status ≤ 2 7. Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function reserve as evidenced by: 1. Hemoglobin ≥ 10 mg/dl 2. ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L 3. Platelet count of ≥ 100 x 10^9/L 4. Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dl 5. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) of the reference lab 6. Serum creatinine of ≤ 1.5 x ULN for reference lab or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 60 mg/min 8. Body mass index (BMI) of 19 to 40 kg/m^2 , inclusive 9. Subjects of childbearing potential, and their partners, agree to pregnancy prevention throughout the duration of the study (through the Followup Visit). Specific type of pregnancy prevention should be discussed with, and acceptable to, the treating oncologist in the context of the tumoral hormone receptor status. Subjects and their partners must agree to use of an effective method of contraception, to avoid impregnation of females throughout the course of the study Medically acceptable forms of birth control can include, with approval of the treating physician: 1. Barrier methods (condom or diaphragm with spermicide) 2. Intrauterine device (IUD) 3. Hormone contraceptives (such as oral [pill], injection, skin patch, implant, cervical ring) 4. Subjects using oral contraceptives must be on a stable regimen for at least 3 months prior to Screening. Sexually active subjects must use contraception while on HSP130 from admission to the final Followup Visit 10. Able to understand verbal or written instructions and comply with all study requirements, to communicate effectively with study personnel and is available for the planned duration of the study A subject will NOT be eligible for study participation if any of the following criteria are met at Screening: 1.

Prior autologous stem cell harvest of any type 3. Drug sensitivity, allergic reaction, or known hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to E. coli derived proteins, filgrastim, other GCSFs, or pegylated agents 4. Known hypersensitivity to docetaxel, polysorbate 80, or doxorubicin 5.
