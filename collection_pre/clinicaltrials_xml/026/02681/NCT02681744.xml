	<detailed_description>To examine the effects of resistance training on sarcopenic obesity in older women, a representative sample of older women from Bras√≠lia, Brazil (n&gt;244 subjects), will be recruited and invited to undergo body composition measurement using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Moreover, the Sarcopenic Obesity index and isokinetic strength evaluations will be performed. It will be a single-blind randomized, controlled 24-week clinical trial, in which experimental group will receive a progressive resistance training program, meanwhile control group will receive instructions to maintain their lifestyle habits. Randomization will be conducted by computer-generated list in blocks of 10. Additionally, body composition, strength assessment, and sarcopenic index will collected and compared after the intervention period.</detailed_description>
