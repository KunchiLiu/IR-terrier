	<brief_summary>This is a pilot, non-randomized, single institution, observational study investigating the effect of dramatic weight loss secondary to bariatric surgery on biomarkers of breast cancer in tissue and blood as well as on imaging in women at elevated risk for breast cancer. Twelve months after bariatric surgery, 50% of excess weight is generally expected. Eligible women at elevated risk for breast cancer who are already planning to undergo bariatric surgery will be consented to undergo imaging (MRI and mammogram), breast tissue biopsy, and fasting blood draw prior to bariatric surgery, approximately 14 days after bariatric surgery, and approximately 1 year after bariatric surgery. In parallel we will also be assessing 40 normal breast tissue specimens as well as blood samples from the Komen Tissue Bank (elevated risk but normal BMI) to establish a normal BMI, elevated risk control group for our study. The KTB samples will be matched for general risk of breast cancer (&gt;20%), age, race and menopausal status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Weight Loss on Breast Tissue and Blood Biomarkers in Women at Increased Risk for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1. The effect of bariatric surgery on Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE) in breast MRI through comparative analysis of images of women pre- and 1 year post-bariatric surgery. 2. The effect of bariatric surgery on breast density as seen on standard four view mammograms and processed with a commercial volumetric breast density measurement software (volpara®density™) through comparative analysis of images of women pre- and 1 year post-bariatric surgery. Secondary Objectives 3. The impact of bariatric surgery on obesity associated immune markers in breast tissue by: - Comparing the cellular immune components in normal breast tissue lobules by looking at immune infiltrates [B cells (CD20), cytotoxic T cells (CD8), helper T cells (CD4), dendritic cells (CD11c), leukocytes (CD45), and monocytes/macrophages (CD68)] in normal breast of lean women and obese women pre- and 14 day and 1 year post-bariatric surgery. - Assessing the presence of crown like structures (CLS) in normal breast of lean women and obese women pre- and 14 day and 1 year post-bariatric surgery. 4. The effect of bariatric surgery on aromatase expression in breast tissue of women pre- and 14 day and 1 year post-bariatric surgery as compared to levels in breast tissue of lean women from Komen Tissue Bank (KTB). 5. The effects of bariatric surgery on other blood correlatives pre- and 14 day and 1 year post-bariatric surgery including: 1) PGE2, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, IL-8 and IL-10 in the inflammatory pathway; 2) adiponectin, leptin, insulin, IGF1, and IGFBP3 in the insulin pathway; and 3) estradiol, SHBG, E2, T and DHEAS in the hormonal pathway.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Patient must be at elevated risk for breast cancer, with more than 20% lifetime risk calculated by any one of the known risk models (Gail, Claus, TyrerCusick or Hughes models) or based on a personal history of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical hyperplasia. 2. Patients must have a BMI ≥ 30 as calculated by the formula: Weight in pounds / height squared x 703 = BMI A BMI of: 1. 18.524.9 is considered normal; 2. 25.029.9 is considered overweight; 3. 30.0+ is regarded as obese. 3. Patients must be willing to provide a core tissue biopsy at baseline and with repeat tissue collection after 2 weeks and 12 months postbariatric surgery. 4. ECOG Performance Status of 0 1 within 28 days of registration. (Appendix I) 5. Aged 1875 years 6. Subjects must be accessible for treatment, adverse event tracking and followup as determined by the treating physician. 7. Subject consent and authorization for the release of health information must be obtained according to local institutional guidelines. 8. Patients must be planning to undergo primary bariatric surgery (no revisions). Exclusion Criteria 1. No history of any malignancy except: adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years. 2. No concurrent or planned participation in randomized trials of weight loss or exercise interventions or trials targeting insulin, IGF1 or their receptors. These interventions would interfere with the endpoints. 3. Weight cannot exceed 500 lbs at the time of imaging. 4. Known allergy to gadolinium which is used for MRI contrast.</criteria>
