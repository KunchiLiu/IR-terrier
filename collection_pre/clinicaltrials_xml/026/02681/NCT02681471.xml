	<detailed_description>Background and Purpose: Aim of this prospective clinical study was to compare two different surgical techniques and used solutions on serum electrolytes, bleeding and Transurethral Resection of Prostate (TURP) syndrome undergoing TURP. Methods: Fifty-three patients scheduled for elective TURP were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. Patients were divided into two groups. Patients in Group M (Monopolar) (n=25) were used monopolar resectoscope (Karl Storz, Tottling, Germany) and 5% mannitol as irrigating solution. Patients in Group B (Bipolar) (n=25) were used bipolar resectoscope TURis (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan) and isotonic saline as irrigating solution. Patients who received spinal anaesthesia were given 2.5-3 ml 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacain intrathecally and others were given general anaesthesia. Patients demographics, prostate volumes, hemodynamic parameters, volumes of irrigation and IV solutions were recorded. Blood samples were collected preoperatively (control), 45 minutes after the induction (2nd Measurement) and 1 hour after the end of the operation for analyzing serum electrolytes, osmolarity, hemoglobin values.</detailed_description>
