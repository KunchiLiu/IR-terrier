	<brief_summary>This study evaluates two different methods of controlling intraocular pressure in nonvalved aqueous tube shunts immediately after implantation; needle fenestrations or a suture wick.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Efficacy of Fenestrations in Tube Shunt Implants During the Early Postoperative Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized control study of glaucomatous eye undergoing tube shunt implantation using a nonvalved implant for poorly controlled glaucoma of any type. Eyes scheduled to receive a nonvalved tube shunt implant will be randomized to receive either needle fenestration(s) or a suture wick using a single 10-0 vicryl anterior to the ligature. The operative quadrant will be imaged using anterior-segment optical coherence tomography at pre- and post-operative visits.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>18 years of age or older Eyes that have poorly controlled glaucoma requiring a tube shunt implantation Willingness to participate in the study and sign informed consent Concurrent surgery except phaco/intraocular lens Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry Eyes with exposure limitation (tight lids, deep orbits) that would make performing the anterior segment optical coherence tomography difficult</criteria>
