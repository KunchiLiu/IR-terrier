	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, chest clinical study with a single study site. Forty subjects will receive fractionated CO2 laser resurfacing of the chest. . Immediately following the procedure (Day 0), postoperative gel randomized to the chest (TR-987 or placebo), will be applied with a thickness of 1-2 mm by a non-blinded coordinator, along with a split-chest Silon TSR bandage. Subjects will return for follow up on Day 1, with the gel and split chest Silon TSR© bandages applied by non-blinded coordinator during visit, with further follow-up on Days 6, 8, 10, 13 and 28. Both subjects and evaluating investigator will be blinded to randomization schedule (performed by an unblinded coordinator). Subject will apply gels and split chest Silon TSR© bandages at home on Days 2, 3 and 4 when not visiting clinic.</detailed_description>
