	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy and Combination Chemotherapy for Medulloblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: Adjuvant induction chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 28 days after prior resection, patients undergo radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis 5 days a week for 4 weeks and then conformal radiotherapy to the tumor bed 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Beginning 1 week after the initiation of radiotherapy, Temozolomide is applied to these patients as a chemotherapy drug with a dosage of 75mg/m2, daily. The chemotherapy and radiation are combined as temozolomide is taken 1 hour prior to every fraction of radiotherapy. Maintenance chemotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction chemoradiotherapy, patients receive eight 4-week cycles of temozolomide (dosage: the 1st cycle, 150mg/m2, daily × 5 days, 4 weeks a cycle; the 2-8th cycle, 200mg/m2, daily × 5 days, 4 weeks a cycle and repeated again). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
