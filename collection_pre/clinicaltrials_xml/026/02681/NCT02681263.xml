	<brief_summary>The present study aims at demonstrating the efficacy of temocillin in the treatment of UTI requiring parenteral therapy due to a confirmed ESBL producing or AmpC hyperproducing Enterobacteriaceae, resistant to quinolones and Bactrim® in France. In addition, this study will describe and support the use of high dose (6g/day) of temocillin which could be of interest for the treatment urinary tract infection due to multi-resistant bacteria having high MIC (up to 32 mg/L). The investigators will also evaluate the tolerance of the drug by monitoring the adverse event and the incidence of eventual Clostridium difficile associated infection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age of at least 18 year old Patient benefits from social security Signed informed consent A urinary tract infection due to a confirmed ESBL producing strain (detected by the use of a rapid diagnostic test applied on the urine) requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy Hospitalized patient For women able to procreate: Use of an acceptable method of birth control throughout the study. Acceptable methods of birth control are: oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm with spermicide and condom. (All forms of hormonal contraception are acceptable Patient infected with a bacteria which is not an ESBLproducing or AmpC hyperproducing Enterobacteriaceae Patients infected with a strain sensible to both fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Patients infected with a strain resistant to temocillin Hospitalacquired urinary tract infection (defined as a urinary infection that occurred at least 48h post admission in the hospital) Patients has received any dose of active antimicrobial therapy (an antibiotic to which the infecting bacterium is susceptible) in the last 48h (prior to enrolment) except ≤ 2 dose of gentamicin. Patients presenting another site of infection than urinary (except onset of bacteraemia from urinary tract origin) due to Gram negative bacteria. Patients needing concomitant antimicrobial therapy. Septic shock Children (up to 18 years old) Women who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive at any time during the study (pregnancy test will be conducted for woman without menopause) Patients with any kind of urinary/bladder catheter (JJ ureteral probe, …) Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to penicillins or to any other type of betalactam agent Chronically dialyzed patients Patients having a creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min Complete obstruction of the urinary tract Perinephretic or intrarenal abscesses Tutorship or curatorship patient Patient unable to give his consent</criteria>
