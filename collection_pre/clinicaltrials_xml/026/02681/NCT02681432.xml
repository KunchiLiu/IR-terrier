	<detailed_description>Randomized clinical trial performed in woman with epithelial primary ovarian cancer (stage FIGO II, III and IV) or tumor recurrence. A cytoreductive surgery will be perform in all of the patients include in the trial, and it will be assign at randomization: - HIPEC-arm: cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with paclitaxel (175 mg / m2) for 60 minutes at a temperature of 42-43º degrees; followed by postoperative systemic IV chemotherapy with carboplatin (AUC=6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles. - No HIPEC-arm: Cytoreductive surgery followed by postoperative systemic IV chemotherapy with carboplatin (AUC=6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women with histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer (stage II / III / IV disease of FIGO) or tumor recurrences (the women of childbearing age need to have a negative pregnancy test) Complete cytoreduction: Index CC0/CC1 cytoreduction (residual tumor size after surgery, no visible (CC0) or less than 0.25 cm (CC1)) No extraabdominal tumor disease Absence of heart failure. Adequate renal and hepatic functions Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 02 or Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70% Patients with unresectable tumor or incomplete cytoreduction. Contraindications for treatment with paclitaxel: patients with severe hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or any of the excipients,pregnancy or lactation and patients with baseline neutrophil count &lt;1.500/mm3 (&lt;1.000/mm3 for patients with Kaposi sarcoma). Paclitaxel is also contraindicated in patients who have concurrent and severe infections. Extraabdominal metastases or unresectable liver metastases Presence of other malignant tumor disease. Multisegmental complete bowel obstruction.
