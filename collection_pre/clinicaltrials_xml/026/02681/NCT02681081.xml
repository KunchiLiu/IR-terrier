	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to identify non-invasive strategies that will optimize the neurobiological environment and improve learning and memory in the treatment of chronic pain. The overall aims of the current proposal are to determine if food restriction and/or glucose administration in conjunction with a relaxation/guided imagery exercise will result in neurophysiological changes and functional improvements compared to the relaxation/guided imagery exercise alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up to sixty adults with chronic knee osteoarthritis pain will be randomized to one of three groups: food restriction (20 participants), glucose administration (20 participants), or control (20 participants). Participants will attend four sessions over a two to three week period.</detailed_description>
