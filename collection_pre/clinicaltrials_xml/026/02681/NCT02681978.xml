	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of ivabradine on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) after complete revascularization with percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI). At least 30 days after PCI, patients will be randomized to receive ivabradine 5 mg twice daily or to continue with standard medical therapy.</brief_summary>
