	<brief_summary>The presence of Pigment Epithelial Detachments (PEDs) in neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (nAMD), Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) and idiopathic Poplypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (iPCV) can present a diagnostic challenge in the elderly population; despite detailed diagnostic testing to differentiate these three conditions, misdiagnosis and mistreatment still occurs. One potential way of differentiating these three conditions might be to compare cytokine profiles in nAMD versus CSR versus iPCV. This information may be useful in creating a diagnostic aqueous cytokine and hormone profile to differentiate between nAMD, CSR and iPCV. The primary goal of this study is to compare baseline aqueous cytokine and cortisol levels between nAMD, CSR, and iPCV patients and age-matched cataract controls. The secondary objective is to assess intra-group changes in visual and anatomical outcomes in nAMD, CSR and iPCV patients with PED treated with aflibercept and correlate these changes to baseline cytokines. We will not be comparing visual and anatomical changes between groups after treatment in this study.</brief_summary>
