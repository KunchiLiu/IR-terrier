	<brief_summary>Anthroposophic speech therapy (ATS) has been shown to positively influence heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate - respiration coordination in healthy volunteers. This study was performed to learn more about such improvements and possible alteration in baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in hypertensive patients, which characteristically differ in those regulatory parameters from normotensive patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Speech-therapy in Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective, primarily pre-post study, patients received three ATS treatments in alternation with three control sessions (casual talking with the therapist). In order to perform HRV-analysis and BRS determination blood pressure and ECG were continuously recorded during the sessions. Changes in subjective well-being and perceived health were assessed by questionnaire before and after the various sessions (mood questionaire). Thirty-one patients participated in this study, the majority diagnosed with arterial hypertension (22 out of 31).</detailed_description>
