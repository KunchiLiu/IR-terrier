	<brief_summary>The rationale for this study is to investigate the benefits of epidural analgesia in pancreatic resections in a prospective, single blind, randomized control trial. This study will evaluate both short and long-term outcomes related to epidural analgesia, providing a longitudinal and comprehensive perspective to the advantages and disadvantages of this technique. The investigators hypothesize that the use of epidural analgesia reduces a patient's consumption of morphine or morphine-equivalent in the post-operative period following pancreatic resections.</brief_summary>
