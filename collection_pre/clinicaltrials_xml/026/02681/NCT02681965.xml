	<brief_summary>Proposed is a 6-month randomized controlled trial, in 200 overweight or obese Stage I-IIIC breast cancer survivors examining 6-month changes in: 1) body weight, 2) diet, 3) physical activity, and 4)quality of life in women randomized to receive the modified LEAN intervention compared to women randomized to wait-list control (i.e., the wait-list control will receive the modified LEAN intervention after completing the 6-month study).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Mail and Video-based Weight Loss Trial in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of modifying the LEAN intervention (NCT02110641) to make it more cost effective by reducing or eliminating the counseling sessions. To guide the modification of the intervention one or more focus group sessions with former LEAN participants will be conducted. The purpose of these meetings will be to gain input on enhancing the LEAN book. The LEAN book will be central to the modified intervention, but the LEAN book will be modified based on feedback from the focus group(s) and experience gained from the LEAN study. The reading level of the LEAN book will also be assessed to ensure acceptability to those with a low literacy level. Once these changes have been finalized, the efficacy of the modified program will be tested using the methods described in the Brief Summary.</detailed_description>
