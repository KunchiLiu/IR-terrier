	<brief_title>Early Vision Screening in High-risk Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-term, low-birth-weight, and development delay are well-known risk factors related to higher incidence of high refractive error and strabismus, which can potentially lead to amblyopia and is regarded as amblyopia risk factors. This project is a cross-sectional controlled study. Our study includes high-risk group and normal group. High-risk group includes children with birth history of pre-term, low-birth-weight and the diagnosis of development delay in FEMH. Normal group enrolled age-matched children without those risk factors. Vision screening by FDA-approved photorefraction device as well as comprehensive ophthalmic exams for definite diagnosis will be performed on the high-risk group and the normal group.</detailed_description>
