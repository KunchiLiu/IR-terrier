	<brief_title>Planning Treatment for Oesophago-gastric Cancer: a Maintenance Therapy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open label, multicentre, randomised phase II clinical trial. An adaptive trial design is proposed to allow ineffective treatments to be discontinued early, and to potentially add novel treatment arms as the trial progresses. Patients will initially receive standard chemotherapy for their locally advanced or metastatic oesophago-gastric adenocarcinoma, according to local practice based upon their HER-2 status (tested locally). In order to be eligible for trial entry, HER-2 negative patients should have received a platinum-fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy doublet or triplet (Arm A), whilst HER-2 positive patients (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and FISH positive) should have received cisplatin in combination with either capecitabine or 5-FU (CX or CF) plus trastuzumab chemotherapy (Arm B). Potentially eligible patients will be registered with the trials office whilst undergoing first line chemotherapy. Patients will then become eligible for trial recruitment and randomization following completion of at least 6 cycles of standard chemotherapy with ≥SD (stable disease) on the end-of-treatment CT scan. Eligible patients will then be randomised according to HER-2 status as follows: - HER-2 positive patients (~20%) will be currently not be randomised and will be assigned maintenance single-agent trastuzumab (current UK standard), a comparator arm is in development. - HER-2 negative patients (~80%) will be randomised in a 1:1:1 fashion between surveillance only (current UK standard), maintenance capecitabine, or maintenance immuno-modulatory therapy (anti-PD-L1 antibody) Patients will be stratified according to: locally advanced disease versus metastatic disease, and performance status (0 versus 1 versus 2). Review of patients will occur every 4 weeks in the observation only arm. In maintenance therapy arms, patients will be reviewed every 3 or every 4 weeks depending upon the treatment strategy. CT assessments of response will occur every 12 weeks (3 months) in all arms of the trial. Treatment will be continued indefinitely until the occurrence of either disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal for another reason. The trial is being run from the RMH GI clinical trials unit with Professor David Cunningham as the over-arching CI. Effective arms in the phase II portion of the trial may be taken forward into a phase III maintenance trial powered for overall survival. It is also hoped that, as more robust data becomes available for other biomarker-selected populations (e.g. MET-positive, FGFR-amplified), it may be possible to amend the overall trial design to incorporate these biomarker-targeted maintenance therapies in the HER-2 negative population.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria All Patients Histologically verified inoperable locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction, or stomach. Completion of at least 6 cycles of firstline chemotherapy for locally advanced / metastatic disease (this must have included a platinum and fluoropyrimidine in all cases; HER2 positive patients must have received trastuzumab alongside chemotherapy) with &gt; stable disease on the end of treatment CT scan. Disease which, following firstline chemotherapy, remains inoperable and unsuitable for definitive chemoradiotherapy. Able to proceed with maintenance treatment within 28 days of the last day of the last cycle of chemotherapy. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks of diagnostic tissue available for biomarker analysis. Unidimensionally measurable disease (CT or MRI as per RECIST). Any prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting must have been completed at least 6 months prior to the first occurrence of metastatic disease. No prior radiotherapy in the advanced disease setting. Patients receiving palliative radiotherapy to sites of disease that are not measurable may be eligible and should be discussed with the Chief Investigator. Male/female patients aged ≥18 years. WHO Performance status 0, 1 or 2. Patients should have a projected life expectancy of at least 3 months. Adequate bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5x109/l; white blood cell count ≥ 3x109/l; platelets ≥ 100x109/l; haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9g/dl (can be posttransfusion). Adequate renal function: calculated creatinine clearance ≥50ml/minute. Adequate liver function: serum bilirubin ≤1.5x ULN; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN (5 × ULN is acceptable for ALT, AST and ALP if liver metastases are present). Women of childbearing potential as well as fertile men and their partners must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse or to use an effective form of contraception during the study and for 7 months following the last dose of assigned study drug(s). Written informed consent must be obtained from the patient before any studyspecific procedures are performed. Exclusion Criteria All Patients Concurrent enrolment in another clinical trial unless it is an observational (noninterventional) clinical study. Tumours of squamous histology. Documented brain metastases, central nervous system metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Patients who have not recovered from clinically significant effects of any prior surgery, radiotherapy or any other antineoplastic therapies. All toxicities must have resolved to grade 1 or less, with the exception of peripheral neuropathy which must be &lt; grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. Any major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg). Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiac disease e.g. symptomatic coronary artery disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmia, or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months. Patients with any prior history of clinically significant cardiac failure are excluded from study entry.
