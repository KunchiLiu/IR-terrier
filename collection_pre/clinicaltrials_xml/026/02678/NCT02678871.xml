	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common comorbidity of patients candidates to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The management of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) for the prevention of ischemic stroke is very challenging in this population of complex and frail subjects. Since the percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure with the WATCHAMN device proved promising safety and efficacy results in randomized comparisons with OAC (current standard of care), the aim of the current study is to assess the feasibility and the early safety of performing TAVI with the Lotus System and percutaneous LAA closure with the WATCHMAN device at the same session.</brief_summary>
