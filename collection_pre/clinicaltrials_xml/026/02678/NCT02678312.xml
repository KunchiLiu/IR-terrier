	<brief_summary>This study consist of two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). The purpose of Part 1 is to evaluate the way the body absorbs, distributes and removes the drug LCZ696. This will help determine the proper dose of LCZ696 for Part 2 of the study. The purpose for Part 2 is to compare the effectiveness and safety of LCZ696 with enalapril in pediatric heart failure patients over 52 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Chronic heart failure resulting from left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and receiving chronic HF therapy (if not newly diagnosed) NYHA classification IIIV (older children: 6 to &lt;18 years old) or Ross CHF classification IIIV (younger children: &lt; 6 years old) Systemic left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% or fractional shortening ≤20% For Part 1 study: Patients must be treated with an ACEI or ARB prior to screening. Patients in Group 1 and 2 must be currently treated with the dose equivalent of at least enalapril 0.2 mg/kg prior to the LCZ696 3.1 mg/kg administration. Group 3 patients will participate in LCZ696 0.8 mg/kg and not LCZ696 3.1 mg/kg. Biventricular physiology with systemic left ventricle Key Patient with single ventricle or systemic right ventricle Patients listed for heart transplantation (as United Network for Organ Sharing status 1A) or hospitalized waiting for transplant (while on inotropes or with ventricular assist device) Sustained or symptomatic dysrhythmias uncontrolled with drug or device therapy Patients that have had cardiovascular surgery or percutaneous intervention to palliate or correct congenital cardiovascular malformations within 3 months of the screening visit. Patients anticipated to undergo corrective heart surgery during the 12 months after entry into Part 2 Patients with unoperated obstructive or severe regurgitant valvular (aortic, pulmonary, or tricuspid) disease, or significant systemic ventricular outflow obstruction or aortic arch obstruction Patients with restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Active myocarditis Renal vascular hypertension (including renal artery stenosis) Moderateto severe obstructive pulmonary disease Serum potassium &gt; 5.3 mmol/L History of angioedema Allergy or hypersensitivity to ACEI / ARB</criteria>
