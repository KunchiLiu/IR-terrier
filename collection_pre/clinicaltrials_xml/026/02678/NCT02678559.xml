	<brief_summary>The principal aim is to assess impact of alveolar recruitment manoeuvres (ARM) on stroke volume variation, evaluated by trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE). These variations will be measured on preload dependency or preload independency status. The principal purpose is to determine if variations of stroke volume during standardized ARM can predict the preload dependency status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preload Dependency Evaluation With Stroke Volume Variation During Alveolar Recruitment Manoeuvres</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Population studied: anesthetized patients for cardiac surgery of coronary bypass. Secondary endpoints : - comparison between TEE and mini-invasive monitoring systems in accuracy of measurement of stroke volume variation during ARM. These mini-invasive systems are : Clearsight system (Edwards Lifescience) and Flotrac system (Edwards Lifescience) - Difference between pre and post-cardiopulmonary bypass status on principal purpose evaluation</detailed_description>
