	<brief_summary>This phase II/III trial studies gallium 68 Ga (68Ga)-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in finding tumors in patients with prostate cancer undergoing surgery that tend to spread quickly (intermediate-risk) or is likely to come back or spread (high-risk). Diagnostic procedures, such as PET/MRI, may help find and diagnose prostate cancer and find out how far the disease has spread. Radioactive drugs, such as gallium Ga 68-PSMA, binds to tumor cells that have specific receptors, and may allow doctors to see smaller tumors than the standard of care contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or MRI scan.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI for detection of regional nodal and distant metastases in patients with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy with lymph node dissection. OUTLINE: Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA intravenously (IV). Patients then undergo PET/MRI after 45 minutes of administration of radiopharmaceutical injection. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24-48 hours.</detailed_description>
