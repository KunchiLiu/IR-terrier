	<brief_summary>Anal fistula is a very common disease with a high impact on life quality. The only commonly accepted treatment option is surgery. A wide range of operations and techniques have been developed all suffering from a relatively high recurrence rate. The investigators propose the combination of the mucosal advancement flap with application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the fistulectomy site. This study aims to test the hypothesis that by applying PRP the healing rate of complicated anal fistulas can be improved in comparison to a control group where the operation is performed without addition of PRP.</brief_summary>
