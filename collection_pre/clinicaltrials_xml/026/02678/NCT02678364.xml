	<brief_summary>While there have been a considerable number of studies on the impact of additional vitamin D in the diets of hens on the resulting egg vitamin D content, the effect of consumption of such vitamin D-enhanced eggs on vitamin D status of healthy human subjects has not been tested in a RCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Vitamin D-biofortified Eggs on Wintertime Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of consumption of vitamin D3 versus 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 biofortified eggs on winter serum 25(OH)D in adults using a 8-wk randomized controlled trial. This research will provide new data on the potential of vitamin D enriched eggs as a food-based strategy for prevention of vitamin D deficiency.</detailed_description>
