	<brief_summary>This double-blind randomized controlled trial seeks to find a better treatment for women with mixed urinary incontinence (both stress and urgency incontinence). The primary aim is to determine whether midurethral sling surgery combined with injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®) into the detrusor muscle of the bladder improves symptoms of mixed urinary incontinence better than sling surgery alone.</brief_summary>
