	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 open-label study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BMN 190 intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at 300mg every other week (qow) for a period of 96 weeks, in patients with CLN2. The study is designed to assess disease progression in siblings of children enrolled in the 190-201 study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Study of Intracerebroventricular BMN 190 in Patients With CLN2 Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BMN 190 is a recombinant form of human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), the enzyme deficient in patients with CLN2 diseases (also known as classical late-infantile CLN2, cLINCL, or Jansky-Bielschowsky disease), a form of Batten Disease. As an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), BMN 190 is designed to restore TPP1 enzyme activity. BMN 190 is designed to reduce the progressive, pathologic accumulation of lysosomal storage material, and improve the symptoms of disease. 190-203 is a Phase 2 open-label study that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BMN 190 in patients with siblings enrolled in the 190-201 study. Study drug administration consists of 300mg dosing administered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion every other week (qow), for a duration of 96 weeks.</detailed_description>
