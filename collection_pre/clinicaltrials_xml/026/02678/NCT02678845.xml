	<brief_title>Project Collabri for Treatment of Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Depression is a common disease mostly treated in general practice. Diagnose and evidence based treatment in general practice today is not optimal (e.g. lack of continuity in disease management and lack of treatment opportunities). International studies show effect of collaborative care on depression, but is not directly applicable into a Danish context. A Danish model for collaborative care treatment of people with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia and panic disorder (the Collabri Model) is developed. The Collabri model consists of a multi-professional approach to treatment, scheduled monitoring and review, enhanced inter-professional communication and a structured treatment plan. Objectives: to investigate the effect of the Collabri model for depression and further investigate two methods for detection of depression; standard detection and case finding. Methods: Two researcher-blinded cluster-randomized controlled studies with an intervention group (treatment according to the Collabri model) and a control group (TAU). Participants are 480 patients with depression consulting their general practitioner. Results: Primary outcome for the collaborative care study on depression is depression symptoms, measured with BDI at 6 months. Discussion: The results will contribute new knowledge on collaborative care for depression and anxiety in Danish conditions.</detailed_description>
