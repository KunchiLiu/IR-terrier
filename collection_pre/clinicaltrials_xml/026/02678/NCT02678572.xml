	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate two groups of patients who have melanoma that has spread from the eye to the liver: one group (50%) will get high-dose chemotherapy delivered specifically to the liver, while the other group (50%) will get one of 4 standard best alternative care treatments. Patients in each group will get repeating cycles of treatment until the cancer in the liver advances and will be followed until death. This study will evaluate the effect of the treatments on how long patients live and how long it takes for the cancer to advance or respond to the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion vs Best Alternative Care in Patients With Hepatic-dominant Ocular Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. Screening Phase: Screening assessments will be conducted within 28 days prior to randomization to determine each patient's overall eligibility. These assessments will include medical history, physical examination, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), vital signs, full hematology and biochemistry, radiologic assessments of disease status, and an evaluation of the vasculature compatibility for Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion (PHP). Treatment Phase: Eligible patients will be randomized to treatment with Melphalan/HDS 3.0 mg/kg Ideal Body Weight (IBW) or Best Alternative Care (BAC) and must begin treatment within 14 days following randomization. BAC treatment will be: dacarbazine (DTIC); transarterial chemoembolization (TACE); ipilimumab; or pembrolizumab, based on each institution's rank order of their BAC treatments based on their standard of care (SOC). For Melphalan/HDS treatment, patients will receive up to 6 treatments. Each treatment cycle consists of 6 weeks with an acceptable delay for another 2 weeks before the next planned treatment to allow for recovery of melphalan-related toxicity, if needed. Tumor response will be assessed in both cohorts every 12 weeks (+ 2 weeks) until hepatic disease progression. If the patient receives only 1 treatment, the disease assessment scans will be conducted 12 weeks after the date of the first treatment. The assessment scans will be reviewed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), also referred to as Independent Central Review. At any time when hepatic progressive disease (PD) is observed, the patient will be removed from further study treatment. Melphalan/HDS treatment will also be discontinued in the event that recovery from treatment related toxicity requires more than 8 weeks from last treatment. An end-of-treatment visit will be conducted approximately 6 to 8 weeks following the final dose of study treatment. Ongoing adverse events (AEs) at the end-of-treatment visit will be followed until the severity returns to baseline of CTCAE Grade &lt; 1. The maximum possible duration of the study treatment for any patient will be 12 months. Follow-up Phase: In the event that disease has not progressed at the end-of-treatment visit, disease assessment scans will continue every 12 weeks (+ 2 weeks) until disease progression is documented. Patients will be contacted by phone every 6 months for survival status for the first two years following the completion of study treatment, then yearly thereafter, until death, withdrawal of informed consent or they become lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first. Patients will be monitored for two years, following the completion of study treatment, for the development of myelodysplasia and secondary leukemia.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age. 2. Patients must weigh ≥ 35 kg (due to possible size limitations with respect to percutaneous catheterization of the femoral artery and vein using the Delcath Hepatic Delivery System). 3. 50% or less histologically or cytologicallyproven ocular melanoma metastases in the parenchyma of the liver. 4. Disease in the liver must be measurable by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 5. Evidence of limited extrahepatic disease on preoperative radiological studies is acceptable if the life threatening component of PD is in the liver. Limited extrahepatic disease is defined in this protocol as follows: metastasis in up to one other organ (bone, subcutaneous, or pulmonary), limited to up to 2 nodules and amenable to resection or radiation. The extrahepatic lesions should be no larger than 2 cm in diameter each. The rationale for permitting this limited extrahepatic disease is that these types of lesions are amenable to surgical resection or radiation. 6. Scans used to determine eligibility (CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and MRI of the liver) must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization. An MRI of the liver is required at screening to validate that CT accurately reflects the extent of disease in the liver. 7. Patients must not have chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoembolization, radioembolization, or immunoembolization for their malignancy in the month prior to treatment and must have recovered from all side effects of therapeutic and diagnostic interventions except those listed in Appendix B of the study protocol. Patients receiving anti programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) immunotherapy such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab, or human cytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 blocking antibody such as ipilimumab should wait 8 weeks before Melphalan/HDS treatment. 8. Patients must have an ECOG PS of 01 at screening and on the day prior to treatment. 9. Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and a prothrombin time (PT) within 2 seconds of the upper normal limit. Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) must be ≤ 2.5 x ULN. 10. Patients must have a platelet count &gt; 100,000/µL, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 gm/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) &gt; 2,000/uL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, and a serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL unless the measured creatinine clearance is &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m2. 11. Provided signed informed consent. 1. Patients with ChildPugh Class B or C cirrhosis or with evidence of portal hypertension by history, endoscopy, or radiologic studies. 2. Those with New York Heart Association functional classification II, III or IV active cardiac conditions, including unstable coronary syndromes (unstable or severe angina, recent myocardial infarction), worsening or newonset congestive heart failure, significant arrhythmias and severe valvular disease must be evaluated for risks of undergoing general anesthesia. 3. History or evidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease that precludes the use of general anesthesia. 4. For female patients of childbearing potential (i.e., have had a menstrual period within the past 12 months): unwilling or unable to undergo hormonal suppression to avoid menstruation during treatment. 5. For female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. have had a menstrual period within the past 12 months): a positive serum pregnancy test (βhuman chorionic gonadotropin) within 7 days prior to enrollment. 6. Sexually active females of childbearing potential and sexually active males with partners of reproductive potential: unwilling or unable to use appropriate contraception from screening until at least 6 months after last administration of study treatment. 7. Lactating women are excluded from study participation. 8. Patients taking immunosuppressive drugs or who are unable to be temporarily removed from chronic anticoagulation therapy. 9. Patients with active bacterial infections with systemic manifestations (malaise, fever, leucocytosis) are not eligible until completion of appropriate therapy. 10. Patients with severe allergic reaction to iodine contrast, which cannot be controlled by premedication with antihistamines and steroids (because a hepatic angiogram is needed for the Delcath system procedure). 11. Patients with a history of or known hypersensitivity to melphalan or the components of the Melphalan/HDS system. 12. Patients with latex allergy. 13. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to heparin or the presence of heparininduced thrombocytopenia. 14. Patients with a history of bleeding disorders or evidence of intracranial abnormalities which would put them at risk for bleeding with anticoagulation (e.g., strokes, active metastases). 15. Patients with a history of gastrinoma, hepatic vasculature incompatible with perfusion, hepatofugal flow in the portal vein or known unresolved venous shunting. 16. Known varices at risk of bleeding, including medium or large esophageal or gastric varices, or active peptic ulcer. 17. Patients with prior Whipple's procedure. 18. Patients with brain metastases or presence of other intracranial lesions at risk for bleeding by history or baseline radiologic imaging. Active infection, including Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C infection. Patients with antihepatitis B core antibody (HBc) positive, or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) but DNA negative are exception(s). 19. Uncontrolled endocrine disorders including diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism. 20. Received any investigational agent for any indication within 30 days prior to first treatment. 21. Not recovered from side effects of prior therapy to ≤ Grade 1 (according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 4.03). Certain side effects that are unlikely to develop into serious or lifethreatening events (e.g. alopecia) are allowed at &gt; Grade 1.</criteria>
