	<brief_summary>Orbital masses develop at the expense of the orbital structures lacrimal glands, oculomotor muscles, optic nerve, meningeal spaces, peripheral nerves, bone wall, orbital fat, lymphoid structures or vascular structures. These masses can be tumors, benign or malignant, or pseudotumor, mainly represented by specific or non-specific orbital inflammation. Pathology is of considerable importance for the diagnosis and the treatment of those masses. However, biopsy or surgical resection of the orbital masses is sometimes difficult and dangerous outside expert centers. The identification of a non-invasive technique for distinguishing tumors from pseudotumors, thus avoid in some cases a biopsy, would be a major contribution for the patients. Quantitative analysis of the ultrasound exam with doppler of those masses could identify diagnostic criteria, especially for the lacrimal gland, easily explorable.</brief_summary>
