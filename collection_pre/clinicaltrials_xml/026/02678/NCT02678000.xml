	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (all Parts): Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Male and female patients, age 40 to 85 years of age (inclusive) on a stable (at least 1 month) dose of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and stable moderately impaired renal function, defined here as an eGFR 3059 mL/min/1.73m^2 (inclusive) using the 4 variable MDRD Study equation for at least 3 months. At screening, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will be assessed in the sitting position after the patient has rested for at least five minutes, and again after three minutes in the standing position. Sitting vital signs should be within the following ranges: oral body temperature between 35.037.5 °C systolic blood pressure, 100170 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure, 50100 mm Hg pulse rate, 50 95 bpm Patients should be excluded if their standing vital signs (relative to sitting) show findings which, in the opinion of the Investigator, are associated with clinical manifestation of postural hypotension (i.e. absence of any other cause). The Investigator should carefully consider enrolling patients with either a &gt; 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic or a &gt;10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure, accompanied by a &gt; 20 bpm increase in heartrate (comparing standing to sitting results). Patients must weigh at least 50 kg to participate in the study, and must have a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 38 kg/m^2. BMI = Body weight (kg) / [Height (m)]^2. Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study. Exclusion criteria: History of angioedema, drugrelated or otherwise, as reported by the patient. Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g. spironolactone or eplerenone), aliskiren, vasopressin receptor antagonists (e.g. tolvaptan), or oral alkalinizing agents (e.g. sodium and potassium citrate or Shohl's solution). Note: Patients who discontinue their ACEinhibitor and substitute with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may be eligible to be rescreened provided their medication regimen has been stable for at least 1 month and their renal function has been stable for at least 3 months. Any substitutions or changes to a patient's medication regimen must be done under the guidance of the patient's treating physician. History of a renal transplant. Known current significant left ventricular outflow obstruction, such as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or significant severe valvular disease on prior or current echocardiogram. A serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/l or ≥ 5.2 mmol/l at screening. A previous history or previously diagnosed renal cystic disease such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (history of an incidental asymptomatic acquired renal cyst(s) is excepted); obstructive uropathy; renal stone(s) in the past 2 years; chronic interstitial nephropathy; drug induced nephropathy; residual renal insufficiency following an episode of acute kidney injury or acute tubular necrosis related to renal atheroembolic disease, septic shock or ischemic nephropathy; renal tubular acidosis requiring treatment; nephrotic syndrome or nephrotic range proteinuria; or renal artery stenosis.</criteria>
