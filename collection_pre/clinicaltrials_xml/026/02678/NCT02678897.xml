	<brief_summary>The study is two-parted. First part's aim is to map need of pain medication among patients undergoing medical abortion in early pregnancy (under 9 pregnancy weeks). In second part investigators compare different administration routes of opiates in patients in medical abortion with pregnancy weeks 12-20. In both parts plan is to compare teenaged to adult women and in addition to try to map predicting factors of severe pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain and Medical Abortion Among Teenaged Women Compared to Adult Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adequate pain control is crucial in medical abortion. Experience of painful and traumatic abortion can affect patients future plans for pregnancy and childbirth. Study's purpose is to investigate only pain experience and management. Otherwise the treatment of abortion is according to present national guideline of Finland. Study's goal is to map predicting factors of severe pain and to evaluate the adequacy of our future pain medication. Investigators assume that while using more effective pain management via PCA pain sensation can be lowered. Assumably above all teen-aged patients benefit more than their adult controls from pain management via PCA. Study is done in cooperation with Helsinki university and Helsinki university central hospital and is accomplished in Womens hospital and Kätilöopisto hospital in which care of abortions is centralized in HUS area. This study is two-part. The need and sufficiency of pain medication and pain experience is compared among teen-aged and adult women undergoing medical abortion in early pregnancy. Still present pain management and pain management via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is compared in prospective randomized clinical trial when the length of pregnancy is more than 9 weeks. In both parts of the study are requested patients who choose medical abortion, are first time pregnant and aged between 15 and 19 years or 25 and 35 years. Patients volunteer in the study. First part is prospective study in which pain experience and sufficiency on pain medication is compared in three different age groups among women undergoing medical abortion in early pregnancy (under 9 weeks of pregnancy). Second part is intervention study. In controlled randomized study the analgesia via PCA is compared to pain management via oral or intramuscular administration of opiates in patients in medical termination of pregnancy with gestational age over 9 weeks. Patients are divided on two groups according to gestational age and we compare teen-aged and adult women together in both groups. Patient recruitment for the study is expected to start in the beginning of the year 2016 and lasts for 1,5-2 years time. With the help of our trial investigators hope to recognize those patients who benefit from more intense pain management and to create guideline on pain management so that all patients receive adequate analgesics in future.</detailed_description>
