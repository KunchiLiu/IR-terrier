	<brief_summary>One of the most powerful predictors of stroke is hypertension, with estimates of approximately 33% of adults in the United States experiencing this condition. Hypertension is significantly more prevalent in African Americans compared to European Americans. Importantly, hypertension is a modifiable stroke risk factor. This proposal will use a community-based participatory research approach to perform a randomized trial of a mobile phone text-messaging intervention to reduce high blood pressure in an urban African American community in Flint, Michigan.</brief_summary>
