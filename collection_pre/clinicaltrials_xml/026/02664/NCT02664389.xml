	<brief_summary>Despite relevant clinical and/or familial presentations suggesting a hereditary predisposition (early-onset, multiple primary tumors, familial aggregation), targeted genomic analysis based on the phenotype are often non contributive. As somatic cancer genes are limited, the hypothesis is that the targeted next-generation sequencing of 200 genes, selected for their implications in cancers may contribute to the understanding of many selected patients' presentation by the identification of germline deleterious mutations, and may identified phenotype overlapping and/or mosaicisms. The focus will be put on early-onset breast, ovarian, colorectal cancer or pediatric cancers and multiple primary tumors.</brief_summary>
