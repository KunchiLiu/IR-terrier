	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare 28 day mortality rates between septic shock patients with acute renal insufficiency treated via L-Carnitine (as an adjunct therapy) versus a similar group of patients not receiving L-Carnitine adjunct therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: A. To compare study arms in terms of patient safety. B. To compare study arms in terms of further clinical outcomes, with special emphasis on nephrological outcomes. C. To study (and compare between arms) the kinetic curves of free and total serum carnitine. Renal replacement therapy rapidly depletes the body's carnitine levels. Tracking adequate carnitine levels is therefore important for the interpretation of study results. D. To constitute a bio-bank in association with the study for future ancillary studies (e.g. kidney injury marker studies, carnitine-responders versus non-responders, and other exploratory studies.</detailed_description>
