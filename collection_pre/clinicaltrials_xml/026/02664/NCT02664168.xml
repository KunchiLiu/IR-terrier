	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the prevention of incision healing complications in patients undergoing revision TKA and THA treated with either Single-Use NPWT (PICO) compared to standard of care dressings (AQUACEL Ag Surgical Dressing). All patients undergoing a revision TKA and THA who consent to taking part in the study, and meet the eligibility criteria will be included onto the study. Patients will be followed up for a period of up to 3 months to determine if there are any latent incision healing complications</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient ≥18 years old 2. Male or nonpregnant, nonlactating, postmenopausal or surgically sterilized females 3. Subjects undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty or revision total hip arthroplasty 4. Subjects provide informed consent, which will consist of reading, signing, and dating the informed consent document after the Investigator, subInvestigator or other designated study staff member has explained the study procedures, risks, and contact information 5. Subjects deemed able to understand and comply with study visit schedule and procedures 1. Wounds that require daily inspection 2. Active bleeding within the surgical site 3. Pregnant, lactating females, or females of childbearing potential not willing to practice an effective method of contraception 4. Subjects on warfarin therapy.
