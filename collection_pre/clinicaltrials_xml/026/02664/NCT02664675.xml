	<brief_summary>Recent data found that peri-implantitis may differ from periodontitis at the histological level in terms of extent and composition of the cellular components. From human biopsies, it has been shown a deeper apical extension of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and a larger proportion of granulocytes and macrophages in peri-implantitis lesions compared to periodontitis lesions. Following experimental peri-implantitis, it has been observed a continuing bone loss around dental implants after ligature removal; whereas, such a progression was not observed around teeth after cessation of the experimental periodontitis. The factors influencing the recruitment and the activation of osteoclasts in both diseases have not been compared yet. Hypothesis : The more rapid and more severe alveolar bone destruction occurring in peri-implantitis compared to periodontitis is due at least in part to differences in the inflammatory process in these diseases. Aim: to study the cytokine profile produced by gingival explants from periodontitis or peri-implantitis sites and to test the consequences on alteration of bone remodelling activity using in vitro approach. Materials and methods The investigators will establish a collection of human gingival samples from patients undergoing surgical treatment of periodontitis or peri-implantitis. The investigators will test pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines release and consequences on osteoclast differentiation and activity.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Beneficiary by national health insurance Age: over 18 yearold Non smoking Good health For the periimplantitis group: patients formerly treated with a non surgical procedure without antibiotics with at least one functional dental implant with at least on pocket deeper than 5 mm with bleeding on probing and radiographical alveolar bone loss. For the periodontitis group: patients formerly treated with a non surgical procedure without antibiotics for a generalized severe chronic periodontitis (in accord to Armitage 2009) and needing a resective surgical procedure (periodontal pockets deeper than 5 mm with bleeding on probing) For the healthy group: patients with good health without periodontal or peri implant disease needing gingivectomy (crown lengthening, esthetic surgery) Smokers Patients treated with antibiotics or NSAID during the last 3 months Patients suffering from a chronic infectious, inflammatory or autoimmune disease (non equilibrated diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthrosis, GougerotSj√∂gren, Crohn, Behcet, Horton, obesity, chronic end renal disease, cardiopathies....) Pregnant women For the healthy group : bleeding on probing on the site.</criteria>
