	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, double-blind, post-chemotherapy, adjuvant phase III clinical trial. The primary aim of this study is to determine the value of regorafenib in improving disease-free survival (DFS). Patients with Stage III (IIIB or IIIC) colon cancer as defined by the 7th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual are randomized 1:1 to placebo or the experimental agent regorafenib following completion of at least four months of standard adjuvant therapy (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) , capecitabine, oxaliplatin (CapeOx), and other).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Regorafenib Following Completion of Standard Chemotherapy for Patients With Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to determine the value of regorafenib in improving DFS. The secondary aims are to evaluate the dose tolerance and long term toxicity of two years of regorafenib following standard adjuvant therapy, and to evaluate the effect of the use of regorafenib in overall survival (OS). Eligible patients in this double-blind study will be randomized to take either regorafenib 120 mg or placebo orally, once daily for 21 consecutive days of a 28 day cycle for 26 cycles (2 years). Accrual for this study will be approximately 1118 randomized patients. These 1118 patients will provide approximately 313 DFS events at the time of primary analysis. An initial futility analysis will be performed when 312 patients have been on study at least 3 months. The decision to continue the trial will be determined by success of both early stopping endpoints defined as follows: - The toxicity profile of regorafenib compared to placebo is acceptable. - The regorafenib regimen is tolerable for prolonged administration. An estimated compliance rate of 60% at 6 months for regorafenib will be required for continuation of the study. If toxicity is acceptable and compliance with regorafenib is at least 60% nominally, then accrual will continue. The second futility analysis will be conducted when approximately 67 DFS events are observed. Trial conduct and accrual will continue unless the primary endpoint (DFS) trends too far in the opposite direction (hazard ratio greater than or equal to 1.1). Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. NSABP C-13 will include a Behavioral and Health Outcomes correlative science component. A C-13 Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire will be administered at baseline (after consent and prior to randomization) and at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 30 months. Submission of blood samples for C-13 correlative science studies will be a study requirement for all patients. Submissions will also include archived primary tumor tissue from the resected colon primary. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) will be collected on Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 2, with additional blood samples for biomarkers collected at various time points for future analysis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 01 There must be histologic confirmation of high risk, adenocarcinoma of the colon defined as AJCC 7th Edition Stage IIIB or IIIC. The patient must have had an en bloc complete gross resection of tumor (curative resection) by open laparotomy or laparoscopicallyassisted colectomy. The distal extent of the tumor must have been greater than or equal to 12 cm from the anal verge. (Patients who have had a twostage surgical procedure to first provide a decompression colostomy and then in a later procedure to have a surgical resection are eligible.) Imaging (positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) of chest, abdomen, and pelvis must be performed within 90 days prior to randomization and must demonstrate no evidence of metastatic disease. If findings noted in imaging study reports are equivocal, the determination of whether or not the findings represent metastatic disease will be at the investigator's discretion. The patient must be able to swallow oral medication. The patient must have completed at least 4 months of adjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., FOLFOX, CapeOx, or other, such as 5fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FLOX), 5fluorouracil/leucovorin (5FU/LV), capecitabine). The interval between completion of standard adjuvant chemotherapy and randomization must be less than or equal to 60 days. Blood counts performed within 28 days prior to randomization must meet the following criteria: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1500/mm3; platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3; and hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 9 g/dL. The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization must be met: total bilirubin must be less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); and alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2 x ULN; and Asparate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) must be less than or equal to 2 x ULN for the lab. (Note: If AST and/or ALT greater than ULN, serologic testing for Hepatitis B and C must be performed and results must be negative.) Lipase performed within 28 days of randomization must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. Serum creatinine performed within 28 days of randomization must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.

If urine dipstick result is greater than or equal to 2+ protein, a 24hour urine protein must be less than 1.0 g/24 hours. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) must be greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 according to the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated formula. International normalized ratio of prothrombin time must be less than or equal to 1.5 times the ULN. Patients who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or heparin will be allowed to participate if no underlying abnormality in coagulation parameters exists per medical history.
