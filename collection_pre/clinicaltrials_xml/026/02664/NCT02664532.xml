	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective open labeled randomized study was to compare the "laryngoscopic glottis view" as well as "ease of intubation" between the two blades in routine intubations in non-difficult airways.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Miller Straight Blade vs Macintosh Blade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred and fifty patients with predicted non difficult airway were randomly assigned into two groups. After induction of anaesthesia laryngoscopy was performed with respective blades and trachea intubated. Parameters monitored were: glottis view obtained during laryngoscopy (Cormack Lehane grade), ease of intubation, intubation attempts, total duration of laryngoscopy in seconds and encountered complications.</detailed_description>
