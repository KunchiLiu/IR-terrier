	<detailed_description>This is a randomized prospective comparative clinical study will be conducted in Ain Shams University, Maternity Hospital.

All included women will be subjected to the following: 1. History Full history taking, (personal, present, past and obstetrics history). 2. Clinical examination including: General examination: 1. Assessment of vital data 2. Assessment of general condition. 3. Cardiac and chest examination, to exclude any contraindication for anesthesia. Abdominal examination: Assessment of fundal level for fetal dating, fetal lie and fetal heart sound. 3. Investigations: Laboratory Complete blood picture.- Random blood sugar. Ultrasonography: Fetal biometry for fetal dating and fetal viability. 4. All participants operated under general or spinal anesthesia. Prophylactic antibiotic is given according to the approved protocol of Ain Shams Maternity Hospital (as two intravenous doses of broad spectrum penicillin (after clamping of the umbilical cord and 12 hours postoperatively. Oral antibiotic of the same group was then started for 3-5 days. 5.In group A (closure group)the subcutaneous fat will be closed with three to five interrupted sutures. The sutures were tied until the tissue was adequately re-approximated, but not as hard as possible to avoid necrosis. In group B (non closure group) the subcutaneous fat will not sutured. 6.In all participants Skin to be closed by subcuticular stitches using absorbable polyglactin 910 suture 7. Dressing is removed after 48hours postoperatively, to be disinfected with alcohol 70% antiseptic solution daily in both groups. 8.
