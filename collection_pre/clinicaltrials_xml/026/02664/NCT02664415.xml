	<brief_title>Safety and Therapeutic Efficacy of the VRC01 Antibody in Patients Who Initiated Antiretroviral Therapy During Early Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may have the potential to treat HIV infection by preventing the spread of the virus. This study will evaluate an experimental mAb known as VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of VRC01, when administered during analytic treatment interruption (ATI), in adults who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) during early acute HIV infection. The study will enroll participants from the RV 254 study who were diagnosed during early acute HIV infection and who have been on ART. At study entry, participants will stop taking their antiretroviral (ARV) medications. They will be randomly assigned to receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of VRC01 or placebo at Weeks 0 (study entry), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24. For 7 days following each infusion, participants will be asked to record and report any symptoms to study researchers. In addition to the infusion visits, participants will attend follow-up visits for 48 weeks. Study visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, and urine collection. Neurocognitive testing will take place at select study visits. Some participants may take part in optional study procedures including mucosal secretion collection, MRI brain scan, colon biopsy, lymph node biopsy, leukapheresis, and lumbar puncture. Study staff will monitor participants' HIV throughout the study, and participants will end their participation in the study and restart their ARV medications, if needed.</detailed_description>

Receipt of licensed vaccine or other investigational study agent within 28 days prior to enrollment or past participation in an investigational HIV vaccine study with receipt of active product. Current or planned participation in another interventional clinical trial during the study period. Chronic or recurrent use of medications that modify host immune response, e.g., oral or parenteral steroids, cancer chemotherapy. Any other chronic or clinically significant medical condition that in the opinion of investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of the volunteer.
