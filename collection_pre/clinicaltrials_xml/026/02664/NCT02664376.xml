	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia in a geriatric hospital ward. Sarcopenia is defined by a loss of muscle mass, loss of muscle strength and loss of muscle quality. It is a geriatric syndrome that, to this date, is not systematically tracked in clinical practice. In order to detect sarcopenia, the investigators will use the operational definition proposed by the European Working Group (EWGSOP) involving the measure of three parameters, namely the speed of walking, the muscle strength and the measurement of the muscular mass.</brief_summary>
