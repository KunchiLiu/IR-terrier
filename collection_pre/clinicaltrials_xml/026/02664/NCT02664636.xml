	<brief_summary>The main objective is to develop models for the cortical reorganization of motor areas and inter-hemispheric equilibrium in the early phase of post stroke recovery evaluated by the fNIRS technique from day 0 to day 60 (day 0 being the day of inclusion in the study) and to correlate the latter with the early phases of motor recovery over the same period, as measured by the test Fugl-Meyer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: A. To evaluate changes in functional outcomes (Box and Blocks Test and NineHolePeg Test from Day 0 to Day 60. B- To evaluate changes in autonomy (Barthel Index) from Day 0 to Day 60.</detailed_description>
