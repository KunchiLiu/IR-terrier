	<brief_summary>Older patients account for around 10% of the population, of which 57% have a long-term illness, and 33% were admitted in the past year. Geriatric assessment (GA) is a multidimensional assessment of general health status that can help identifying deficiencies and followed by a personalized care plan. Assessment and management of elderly patients is a daily concern for the general practitioner (GP) but conflicting results have been reported so far relating to the clinical impact of GA when applied in the primary care setting. This study protocol aims to assess the effect on morbi-mortality of a complex intervention in patients aged ≥70 years with chronic conditions in primary care. It aims to demonstrate that a GA adapted to primary care, followed by a personalized care plan and combined with successful interprofessional collaboration can improve clinically relevant outcomes in elderly patients with chronic conditions such as one-year overall mortality, unplanned hospital admission, emergency visits, or institutionalization. The CEPIA study will also help addressing the issue of whether an improved benefit could be achieved from a systematic nurse-led or a case-by-case GP-led GA.</brief_summary>
