	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the overall response rate of single agent TRC105 and the combination of TRC105 and bevacizumab in patients with refractory GTN (including choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT)). Up to 30 patients will be treated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of TRC105 and Bevacizumab in Patients With Refractory Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to endoglin, an angiogenic target highly expressed on the tumor vessels and tumor cells in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor types. TRC105 has been well tolerated as a single agent and when combined with bevacizumab. These antibodies may be efficacious in refractory GTN, a tumor type that is highly vascular and has been shown to densely express endoglin.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Willingness and ability to consent for self to participate in study 2. Willingness and ability to comply with study procedures 3. Elevated serum hCG (in cases of choriocarcinoma); elevated hCG or measurable disease (in cases of PSTT or ETT) 4. Histologically proven trophoblastic neoplasia, or clinically demonstrated trophoblastic neoplasia that has progressed following treatment with at least one chemotherapy regimen that included 2 or more chemotherapy agents. 5. Age of 16 years or older 6. ECOG performance status ≤ 1 7. Resolution of all acute adverse events resulting from prior cancer therapies to NCI CTCAE grade ≤ 1 or baseline 8. Adequate organ function 1. Prior treatment with TRC105 2. Current treatment on another therapeutic clinical trial 3. Uncontrolled chronic hypertension defined as systolic &gt; 150 or diastolic &gt; 90 despite optimal therapy 4. Significant pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, or ascites 5. Active bleeding or pathologic condition that carries a high risk of bleeding 6. Tumors located in the central chest or other location where bleeding is associated with high morbidity 7. Thrombolytic use (except to maintain i.v. catheters) within 10 days prior to first day of study therapy 8. Angina, MI, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within the past 6 months. Deep venous thrombosis within 6 months, unless the patient is therapeutically anticoagulated for at least 2 weeks. In this situation, low molecular weight heparin is preferred 9. Known active viral or nonviral hepatitis 10. Pregnant or actively breastfeeding without intention to discontinue prior to initiation of study 11. Open wounds or unhealed fractures within 28 days of starting study treatment 12. History of peptic ulcer disease or erosive gastritis within the past 6 months, unless treated for the condition and complete resolution has been documented by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) within 28 days of starting study treatment 13. History of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula in the past 6 months, or while previously on antiangiogenic therapy, unless underlying risk has been resolved 14. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related illness 15. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for this study 16. History of brain involvement with cancer, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with radiated or resected lesions are permitted, provided the lesions are fully treated and inactive, patients are asymptomatic, and no steroids have been administered for brain edema for at least 28 days 17. Receipt of systemic anticancer therapy, including investigational agents, within 28 days of starting study treatment. If anticancer therapy was given within 28 days of starting study treatment, patients may be included if 5 times the elimination halflife of the drug has passed 18. Patients who have received wide field radiotherapy ≤ 28 days (defined as &gt; 50% of volume of pelvic bones or equivalent) or limited field radiation for palliation &lt; 14 days prior to starting study treatment or those patients who have not recovered adequately from side effects of such therapy 19. Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 6 weeks prior to study registration or not fully recovered from any such procedure</criteria>
