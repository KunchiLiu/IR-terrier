	<brief_summary>Carbetocin is an oxytocin agonist used for prevention of postpartum bleeding after cesarean delivery. First studies revealed in 2012 an analgesic effect of carbetocin, compared to its parent substance oxytocin. This study will enroll 78 women undergoing cesarean delivery. In a double-blind, prospective design patients will be either attributed to the oxytocin or the carbetocin study arm. The primary endpoint will be the area of hyperalgesia around the cesarean delivery scar. This will be performed with a von Frey hair, resulting in a unpleasant feeling in the area of hyperalgesia.</brief_summary>
