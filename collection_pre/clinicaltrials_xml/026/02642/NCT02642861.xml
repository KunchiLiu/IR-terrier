	<brief_summary>Although a number of mechanisms for cramps in liver disease have been postulated and have been targeted by medical therapies, a clear picture of the causal events has not emerged. Several agents as vitamin E, human albumin, zinc, taurine, eperisone hydrochloride and branched-chain amino acids have shown some benefit in small uncontrolled studies, although large randomized controlled trials are lacking. - Cyclobenzaprine, is a muscle relaxer medication used to relieve skeletal muscle spasms. It is one of the best-studied drug for this application.</brief_summary>
