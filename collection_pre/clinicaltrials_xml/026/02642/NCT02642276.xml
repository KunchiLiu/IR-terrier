	<brief_title>Exercise Training in Individuals With Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise training (walking) is a recommended therapeutic intervention for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Studies have shown that exercise training improves walking distance, pain-free walking distance, endothelial function and quality of life in these patients. However, to date the most effective exercise training option in terms of improvement of cardiovascular parameters has not been clearly identified. In this controlled trial, patients with PAD will be randomized to either maximal walking group, submaximal walking group, or usual care. The aim of the study is to compare the effect of maximal vs. submaximal walking training programmes on i) walking ability, ii) vascular function, iii) arrhythmogenic potential, iv) parameters of inflammation, hemostasis and heart failure severity, v) health-related quality of life in individuals with PAD.</detailed_description>
