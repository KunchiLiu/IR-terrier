	<brief_summary>The diagnostic value of sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage cervical cancer has been well studied. However, there were no randomized controlled study on comparing the long-term outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy and conventional procedure. The investigators perform a phase III, randomized controlled trial to determine whether pelvic lymphadenectomy could be replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy in surgical treatment for patients with early-stage cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Versus Systematic Pelvic Lymphadenectomy in Early-stage Cervival Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study comprises two parts: Part I: To compare the outcomes of managements with and without pelvic lymphadenectomy for patients with negative sentinel lymph node; Part II: To compare the outcomes of managements with and without pelvic lymphadenectomy for patients with positive sentinel lymph node. Patients with newly diagnosed International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA2, IB1 and IIA1 cervical cancer are eligible for our study. The tumor diameter should be less than 3cm. Sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed at the beginning of operations. After pathological examination of frozen section, patients will be assigned to Part I or Part II study according to their status of sentinel nodes. In both parts of this trail, patients have equal chance to be randomly assigned to experimental arms (undergo radical hysterectomy plus systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy) and controlled arms (undergo radical hysterectomy only). Postoperative pelvic radiotherapy will be started within 6 weeks after surgery if the patients have pelvic lymph node metastasis, parametrial involvement, deep stromal invasion or positive margin. Extended-field external beam therapy, delivering a dose of 4500cGy by a four-field technique, will be administered to patients with positive para-aortic nodes. High-dose rate brachytherapy will be delivered to the vaginal stump if patients have positive surgical margins. The primary end point is 2-years progression-free survival. The secondary end points are overall survival, long-term outcome of sentinel lymph node biopsy and the quality of life.</detailed_description>
