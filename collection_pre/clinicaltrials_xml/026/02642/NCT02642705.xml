	<brief_summary>The present study aims at evaluating the effect of two innovative treatment strategies in obese patients: high intensity interval training and hypoxic conditioning. Obese patients will be randomized in groups performing high intensity interval training, constant load training, hypoxic conditioning or placebo normoxic conditioning for 8 weeks. The effects of the interventions will be measured regarding exercise tolerance, blood pressure, body composition, metabolic status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Intensity Interval Training and Hypoxic Conditioning in Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>120 obese patients will be randomized to 6 intervention groups. Each group will follow an 8-week intervention (3 session per week) with either high intensity interval training in normoxia or hypoxia, constant load exercise training in normoxia or hypoxia, hypoxic or normoxic (placebo) conditioning at rest. Exercise capacity, metabolic status, blood pressure, vascular function and physical activity will be assessed before and after the intervention.</detailed_description>
