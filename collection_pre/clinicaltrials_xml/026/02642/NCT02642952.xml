	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate by non-invasive methods the change in central hemodynamics and arterial stiffness produced by grafts and endografts after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Our main goal is to measure the changes in: Augmentation index, central blood pressure, pulse wave analysis, pulse wave velocity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The measures will be done before the procedure and after them. We will use the device called: SphygmocoR (Atcor Medical, Sydney, Australia).</detailed_description>
