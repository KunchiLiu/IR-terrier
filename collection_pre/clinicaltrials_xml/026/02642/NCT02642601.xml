	<brief_title>Role of Indomethacin in Difficult Embryo Transfer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a prospective randomized study in which 200 women undergoing ICSI( intracytoplasmic sperm injection) and fulfilling the inclusion criteria(Difficult mock embryo transfer on day of ovum pick up ,Women's age 20-38 yaears,Early follicular FSH ≤10 IU/l ,Tubal, male infertility, unexplained factors of infertility.) will be recruited. All patients will received long stimulation protocol ;down regulation will be achieved by administration of triptorelin0.1 mg(decapeptyl 0.1 mg, Ferring, Malmo, sweden) S.C daily from day 21 of the cycle preceding the stimulation cycle till the day of hCG administration.,down regulation will be checked day 2 of stimulation cycle by checking serum E2˂50 pg/ml, endometrial thickness ˂ 5mm and quiescent both ovaries. When down regulation is achieved stimulation is commenced using hmG(Menogon, ferring pharmaceuticals, Germany) 225 IU daily intramuscular injection, Serial trans-vaginal ultrasound to assess follicular growth and serum E2 are done starting on day 6 of the cycle and onward, with adjustments of gonadotropin dose and monitoring frequency based on patient response. Once 3 or more leading follicles reached≥18mm hCG 10000 IU (Pregnyl; NV Organon) will be administrated IM. Ovum pick up will be done 34-36 hours following hCG administration with ultrasound guidance under general anesthesia.after that mock embryo transfer will be done using labotec embryo transfer catheter and women in which any degree of difficulty according to Tomas et al. 2002 criteria will be recruited in the study and divided randomly into two groups according to computer generated random cards ;group A (n=100): will receive indomethacin 100 mg rectal supp(KAHIRA PHARMA&amp;CHEM,IND,CO.CAIRO-EGYPT) 1-2 hours before embryo transfer, group B (n=100) will not receive any medications before embryo transfer. Embryo transfer of 2 embryos will be done by the same technique in lithotomy position with full bladder under ultrasound guidance 2-3 days after ovum pick up depending on the number and quality of available embryos using labotec catheter (Labotec, Gottingen Germanny). Luteal phase will be achieved Using progesterone vaginal pessaries (Cyclogest, Alpharma, UK) 400 mg twice daily from the day of egg collection till the day of the pregnancy test and continued till 12 week gestation if pregnancy is documented.</detailed_description>
