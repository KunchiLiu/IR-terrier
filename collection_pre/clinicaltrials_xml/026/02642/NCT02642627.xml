Negative response to the Bellafill Skin Test. Presence of ≥4 distensible atrophic acne scars (treatment scars) in in the facial area. Subject desires correction of his/her atrophic acne scarring. All Fitzpatrick skin types are eligible. Willing to withhold additional aesthetic therapies to the proposed treatment area (e.g., other soft tissue fillers such as hyaluronic acid, and/or any resurfacing procedures (as described in Protocol Section 5.4) for the duration of the study. Able to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits, as assessed by the Investigator. Sign an IRBapproved Informed Consent Form, Photographic Release Form, and the Authorization for Use and release of Health and Research Study Information (HIPAA) Form prior to any studyrelated procedures being performed. Female subjects that are pregnant (positive urine pregnancy test), breastfeeding, or who are of childbearing potential and not practicing a reliable method of birth control. Undergone facial treatments with any prohibited treatment/procedures and/or use of any other prohibited treatment/procedure within certain time periods as listed in Protocol Section 5.4. Excisional facial surgery (such as Blepharoplasty, Face Lift, Rhinoplasty) of the face less than 6 months prior to study enrollment or plans for facial surgery during the study. History of bleeding disorders. Presence of any skin pathology or condition that could interfere with the evaluation of the treatment areas, worsen due to the proposed treatment or require interfering topical, systemic or surgical therapy. Recent or current history of inflammatory skin disease, infection, cancerous/precancerous lesion, unhealed wound or clinically significant acne in the proposed treatment areas. Clinically significant acne is defined as a patient whom has ≥3 active inflammatory acne lesions in the treatment areas. History of systemic granulomatous diseases active or inactive (e.g., Sarcoid, Wegeners, TB) or connective tissue diseases (e.g., lupus, dermatomyositis). Hypertrophic acne scars, any evidence of keloid scarring in the treatment area. Known hypersensitivity or previous allergic reaction to any of the components of the study device (including lidocaine or any amidebased anesthetic), or has a history of allergies to any bovine collagen products, including but not limited to injectable collagen, collagen implants, hemostatic sponges, and collagenbased sutures.
