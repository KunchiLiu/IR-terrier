	<brief_summary>Traditionally, strength training and power is the main objective of providing only muscle conditioning, without possible gains on the VO2Max, however, not for aerobic performance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Intensity Interval Training With Strength/Power Exercises on VO2Max</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 10 visits will be performed. The subjects will be divided into two exercise groups: 1) control group (CG) who performed only aerobic activity of running or walking at moderate intensity (65% VO2max); and 2) strength and power exercise group (GFP), which held the protocol circuit. On the first visit the subjects answer an initial questionnaire of risk stratification for coronary artery disease, and performed a maximal aerobic exercise test. The subjects performed the interval protocol with strength and power exercises at high intensity in circuit. 20 seconds stimuli will be provided with 10 seconds passive recovery, totaling 4 minutes. In the last session the subjects will be performed the same initial procedures adopted in the first visit to determine the values of VO2max after training. The control group will be performed just one training session total run time conducted in eight sessions by GFP group (approx. 30 min).</detailed_description>
