	<brief_title>Dental Support and the Second Stage of Labor Among Multiparous Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have demonstrated that a dental support device (DSD) may increase the isometric strength of different muscle groups (1-7). A preliminary pilot study of 32 women in 2009 showed that DSD may shorten the second stage of labor among nulliparous women (8) by increasing the expulsive efforts of the parturient. The study hypothesis was that DSD may decrease the length of the second stage of labor and decrease the need for obstetrical interventions such as cesarean delivery or operative vaginal delivery. The Laboraide™ is a DSD developed specifically for use during labor. It is an inert device located between the jaws and does not interfere with speaking, breathing or any other oral activity during labor. It is a single use device, and is not transferred between women. The investigators hypothesize that using this device can shorten the second stage of labor and decrease obstetrical intervention rate. The researchers will also investigate it's efficiency in pain management.</detailed_description>
