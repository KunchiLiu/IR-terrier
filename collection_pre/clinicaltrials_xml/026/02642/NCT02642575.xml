	<brief_title>Automated Folliculometry Using Five-Dimensional Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Prospective pilot study that will be performed at the Fetal Care Unit at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital. 72 women will be recruited from the the Fetal Care Unit who will fulfill the inclusion criteria. They will be counseled to be included into the study. All cases will be subjected to: full history taking including patient's age, parity,last menstrual period , past history of medical disorders, clinical examinations (General and abdominal). Two-Dimensional Ultrasound and Five-Dimensional Ultrasound will be done for all cases for assessment of ovarian follicles after controlled ovarian stimulation by clomid 50 mg5×2×1 The automated software allows for automated three-dimensional follicular measurement.The software then analyzes the volume and automatically identifies all of the follicles in the ovary. The software also automatically generates several volumetric parameters of each and every identified follicle.</detailed_description>
