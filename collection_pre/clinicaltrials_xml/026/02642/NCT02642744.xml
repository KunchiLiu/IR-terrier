	<brief_summary>This study will examine if the attending nurse model will enhance critical patient-centered elements of care that will in turn improve patient education and shared decision-making, medication adherence, stroke-related health literacy, and reduce early readmissions to ultimately yield improved patient quality of life. Our primary objective is to determine whether the attending nurse model of care improves stroke patients' health at 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days after hospital discharge as assessed through questionnaires.</brief_summary>
