	<brief_title>Interaction of Melatonin and MTNR1B Genotype on Glucose Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators' recent GWAS discovery of MTNR1B as a novel type 2 diabetes gene has sparked great interest into the role of melatonin in glycemic control, for which the mechanism is largely unknown. This research will determine the effect of melatonin and MTNR1B on glycemic control under highly-controlled, in-laboratory protocols while manipulating circulating melatonin concentrations (both up and down) and assessing glycemic control by frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests, as well as in ex vivo human pancreatic islets. This research will provide mechanistic insights into the metabolic effects of melatonin and the MTNR1B risk variant and may help in evidence-based approaches and personalized recommendations to improve glycemic control in night shift workers and late-night eaters.</detailed_description>
