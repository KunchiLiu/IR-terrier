	<brief_title>Prebiotics in Patients With Non-alcoholic Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will include 60 patients with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which will randomize to two groups, receiving either ITF (Inulin/oligofructose-OFS 75/25) or maltodextrin (placebo). The trial will last for 20 weeks: Stage 1-Run-in period: Subjects will be followed to ascertain weight maintenance. Stage 2- Randomized intervention period: Subjects will be assigned to receive 16 gram/day of ITF or maltodextrin. Both ITF and placebo will be provided in identical opaque packages and both subjects and researchers will be blinded to the content. Stage 3- Extension period: All patients will receive 16 gram/day of ITF for 8 weeks. After signing informed consent, the following data will be collected: demographics, lifestyle habits including dietary questionnaires, and medical history. At the end of week 2, week 12 and week 20 all the following tests will be performed: Vital Signs: blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, body composition determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Biochemical blood tests: liver function tests fasting glucose insulin &amp; lipid profile, 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), CRP (an inflammation marker), SCFA, BCAA, and LBP and FGF 19. Fecal samples: fecal samples will be used for microbiota composition analysis, and BA analysis. Assessment of liver status At week 2, 12, and 20 by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), SteatoTest and NashTest (FibroMax™) and by liver enzymes for evaluating steohepatitis.</detailed_description>
