	<brief_title>Intravenous Iron Treatment in Patients With Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency: IRONMAN</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a very common medical problem. Despite improvements in treatment, many patients suffer limiting symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue. Hospitalisation for CHF is common and life expectancy reduced. Many patients with CHF have a deficiency of iron (low iron levels or cannot use iron properly), and this is associated with poorer outcomes. Some small research studies have suggested that giving patients intravenous iron improves symptoms in the short term. It is unknown, however, whether correcting iron deficiency is beneficial to patients with CHF in the long term and whether it improves life expectancy and keeps them out of hospital. This study will help us answer these key questions. This study will address whether the additional use of Intravenous (IV) iron on top of standard care will improve the outlook for patients with heart failure and iron deficiency. One group of participants will receive treatment with iron injections and the other group will not receive any iron injections. The study will take place in about 50 secondary care sites (hospitals) across the UK. Participants will be recruited over a period of two years and will be followed up for a minimum of two and a half years (average duration of three years per participant). After the initial visits, participants will be seen every four months.</detailed_description>

Iron deficient defined as TSAT &lt;20% and/or ferritin &lt;100 ug/L 5. Evidence of being in a higher risk HF group: Current (with intention to discharge in next 48 hours) or recent (within 6 months) hospitalisation for HF, or Outpatients with NTproBNP &gt;250 ng/L in sinus rhythm or &gt;1,000 ng/L in atrial fibrillation (or BNP of &gt; 75 pg/mL or 300 pg/mL, respectively) 6. Able and willing to provide informed consent 1. Haematological criteria: ferritin &gt;400ug/L; haemoglobin &lt;9.0, or &gt;13 g/dL in women or &gt;14g/dL in men; (B12 or folate deficiency should be corrected but do not exclude the patient) 2.

Planned cardiac surgery or revascularisation or cardiac device implantation; within 3 months of a primary diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction (excluding small troponin elevations in the context of heart failure admissions), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), major CV surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), cardiac device implantation or blood transfusion; on active cardiac transplant list; left ventricular assist device implanted 6. Any of the following comorbidities: active infection (if the patient is suffering from a significant ongoing infection as judged by the investigator recruitment should be postponed until the infection has passed or is controlled by antibiotics), other disease with life expectancy of &lt;2 years, active clinically relevant bleeding in the investigators opinion, known or suspected gastrointestinal malignancy 7. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential (i.e. continuing menstrual cycle) not using effective contraception see Appendix 3. 8. Contraindication to IV iron in the investigator's opinion according to current approved Summary of Product Characteristics: hypersensitivity to the active substance, to Monofer® or any of its excipients (water for injections, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment)); known serious hypersensitivity to other parenteral iron products; noniron deficiency anaemia (e.g. haemolytic anaemia); iron overload or disturbances in utilisation of iron (e.g. haemochromatosis, haemosiderosis); decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatitis 9. Participation in another intervention study involving a drug or device within the past 90 days (coenrolment in observational studies is permitted)</criteria>
