	<brief_summary>Muscle cramps markedly affect the quality of life in cirrhotic patients with no highly effective drug. Methocarbamol is a central muscle relaxant used to treat skeletal muscle spasms. The mechanism of action of methocarbamol is currently unknown, but may involve the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Methocarbamol has a high therapeutic index, i.e. a wide range of safe and effective dosages.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Muscle cramps markedly affect the quality of life in cirrhotic patients with no highly effective drug. Abrams et al compared patients with cirrhosis with those with congestive heart failure and found a significantly higher prevalence of weekly or daily cramps with cirrhosis (22%) vs patients with congestive heart failure (5%). Interestingly, there was no difference in diuretic use or dosing between the 2 groups, supporting that factors other than diuretic-mediated effects explained the differences. Methocarbamol is a central muscle relaxant used to treat skeletal muscle spasms. The mechanism of action of methocarbamol is currently unknown, but may involve the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Methocarbamol has a high therapeutic index, i.e. a wide range of safe and effective dosages.</detailed_description>
