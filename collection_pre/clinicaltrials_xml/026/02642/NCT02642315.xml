	<brief_summary>Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder. Augmentation is the main complication during long-term DA treatment of RLS. This study aims to examine effect of Horizant (Gabapentin Enacarbil) on Augmentation in RLS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Horizant (Gabapentin Enacarbil) on Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an Open label single arm study. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Horizant in patients with RLS who exhibit augmentation while on Dopaminergic therapy. Adult patients (age 18-85 years) with diagnosis of primary RLS (diagnosed by study investigators) with augmentation on dopaminergic therapy will be screened for participation in the study. RLS diagnosis will be made by the study investigators using International RLS study group criteria. Patients with augmentation on dopaminergic therapy as defined by NIH 2007 with ASRS of 5 to 15 will be offered to participate in the study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. The study will be performed after approval of the Institutional Review Board of the University of Missouri. A total of 20 subjects will be entered into the study over a period of 1 year. Written consent will be obtained from all patients. After pre-participation evaluation for eligibility, subjects will be selected and enrolled in the study and followed for a total of 6 follow up visits (Days 0, 30, 90, 120, 180, 360). Subjects Enrollment period will last up to 12 months. The total duration of study will be 24 months.</detailed_description>
