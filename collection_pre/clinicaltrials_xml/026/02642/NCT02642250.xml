	<brief_summary>Revival of significance and the emergent market of herbal medicinal products necessitate strong commitment by the stakeholders to safeguard the end users. The variability in the concentrations of constituents of plant material, coupled with the variety of extraction techniques and processing steps used by different manufacturers, results in distinct inconsistency in the quality of herbal products. The present study will be directed to a polyherbal formulation Entoban which integrates an outstanding blend of herbs that have been used for decades to eradicate microorganisms and worms from gastrointestinal tract. It is the combination of Holarrhena antidysenterica, Berberis aristata, Symplocos racemosa, Querecus infectoria and Helicteres isora. The current study would target the chemical assessment, pharmacological and comparative clinical evaluation of Entoban to assure its safety and efficacy.</brief_summary>
