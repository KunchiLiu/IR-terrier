	<brief_title>Hamstrings X Patellar Tendon for ACL Reconstruction in Soccer Players - RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number of techniques for ACL reconstruction have been proposed and tested, and most surgeons now prefer autografts with the patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon. The functional outcome after ACL reconstruction with the patellar or semitendinosus tendon has been a recent area of interest. Soccer is the most popular sport worldwide with more than 260 million active players, and it is hard to say if patellar tendon or semitendinosus grafts have different outcomes. The purpose of this study was to specifically evaluate outcomes of bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft versus hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction in soccer players. The hypothesis of this study was that hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction would provide no statistically significant differences in patient-reported outcome scores, postoperative level of sports function, and harvest-site morbidity when compared with patellar tendon autograft .The Cincinnati Knee Rating System (CKRS) was chosen as the primary outcome. As secondary outcome, reruptures. Between march 2016 and march 2017, 60 soccer players will be operated. The investigators consider as soccer players those who play more than 4 times a week. Once included in the study, they will be randomized in two groups: "hamstring group" and "patellar tendon group". The final clinical evaluation with two years. For both groups, the technique is the same, the fixation of the grafts with metal interference screws. Femoral tunnel will be drilled with outside-in technique. The tibial tunnel with conventional 55 degrees guide. Both groups of patients will receive the same physical therapy protocol. Data will be evaluated with the SPSS software for Windows (version 13.0).</detailed_description>
