	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, double masked, parallel assignment clincal trial. Five hundred eyes of 500 participants between 40 - 70 years with normal IOP, gonioscopically open angles and age related cataract. Eyes underwent phacoemulsification or MSICS following a 1:1 randomization and allocation code. Best corrected vision (BCVA), IOP, comprehensive slit lamp evaluation and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) were performed at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months follow up.</detailed_description>
