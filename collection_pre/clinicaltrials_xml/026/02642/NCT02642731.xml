	<brief_summary>Sensitive renal markers have been studied abundantly in connection with open heart, liver and transplantation surgery; however in major orthopaedic surgery their use is anecdotal. The aim of the present study is to evaluate use of sensitive renal markers, NGAL (Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin ), KIM-1 (Kidney injury molecule- 1), LFABP (liver-type fatty acid-binding protein), and IL-18 (interleukin -18), in patients without kidney deterioration undergoing TKA (total knee arthroplasty) as a pilot study before large study concerning acute kidney injury in orthopaedic surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute renal deterioration is a serious adverse event in elective surgery. Serum creatinine based diagnostics of acute kidney injury may delay diagnosis and produce false negative results since serum creatinine is affected by diet, muscle mass, used hydration therapy. In recent times new markers have been developed and tested in order to find sensitive, fast and reliable marker of renal deterioration.</detailed_description>
