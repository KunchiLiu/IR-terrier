	<brief_title>Trauma Services Intervention to Prevent Violence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allegheny County, PA continues to suffer between 100-120 homicides each year, with perhaps 2-3 times as many gunshot injuries that require hospitalization. Firearm homicides overwhelmingly affect African American men aged 15-35. Building on prior efforts in violence prevention, the investigators propose to launch a hospital trauma service intervention that will take advantage of a "teachable moment" in the emergency room. All four hospitals providing Level I Trauma services in Allegheny County have agreed to host the program, an evidence-based effort developed by the National Network of Hospital Violence Intervention (NNHVI). Adaptation of the NNHVI model will focus on the social networks of gunshot victims as well as the victims themselves. Intervention efforts will range from job training and mentoring to relocation to different communities. The investigators will offer the opportunity to participate in the research and receive the intervention to all gunshot victims identified in county Level I trauma services. Participants in the research protocol will be asked to recruit their high-risk social network members for the intervention.</detailed_description>
