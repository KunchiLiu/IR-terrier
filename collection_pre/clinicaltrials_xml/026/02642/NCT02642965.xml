	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 (CPX-351) when given with fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim and to see how well they work in treating younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back after treatment (relapsed) or is not responding to treatment (is refractory). Liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 is made up of two chemotherapy drugs, cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride, and works to stop cancer cell growth by blocking the cells from dividing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Filgrastim may increase the production of blood cells and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Giving liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 followed by fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim may be a better treatment for patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and may cause fewer side effects to the heart, a common effect of other chemotherapy treatments for acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Cytarabine-Daunorubicin CPX-351, Fludarabine Phosphate, Cytarabine, and Filgrastim in Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the toxicities associated with CPX-351 in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). II. To estimate the response rate (complete remission [CR] plus complete remission with partial platelet recovery [CRp]) after CPX-351 (cycle 1) followed by fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLAG) (cycle 2) in children with AML in first relapse. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the response rate (CR + CRp + complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]) after one cycle of CPX-351. II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of plasma cytarabine and daunorubicin after CPX-351 administration to pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the response in biomarkers of cardiac injury to a single cycle of CPX-351. II. To explore the effect of CPX-351 on novel biochemical and imaging markers of cardiotoxicity, including plasma micro ribonucleic acid (RNAs) (miRNA) and myocardial deformation. III. To explore the role of rare coding variants as risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. OUTLINE: COURSE 1: Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 0 and at day 28-30 or up to 1 week prior to day 1 of course 2, and liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients without evidence of central nervous system (CNS) disease (CNS1) receive no further CNS-directed therapy in course 1. Patients with &lt; 5 white blood cells per microliter of blood with blast cells (CNS2) disease may receive an additional dose of cytarabine IT on day 7 at the discretion of the investigator. Patients meeting criteria for CR, CRp, and CRi may proceed to course 2. COURSE 2: Beginning 28 days later, patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and then on day 15 until blood count recovery, and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes and high-dose cytarabine IV over 1-3 hours on days 1-5. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months, and then yearly for 5 years.</detailed_description>
