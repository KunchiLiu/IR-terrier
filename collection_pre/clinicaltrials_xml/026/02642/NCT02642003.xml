	<brief_summary>Background and Aims: Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment modality for decompensated cirrhosis and is limited by donor organ availability and financial resources; thus many patients die while awaiting liver transplant. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) therapy can mobilize bone marrow stem cells for tissue regeneration, and has been shown to benefit patients with liver disease. The investigators evaluated the efficacy of GCSF therapy in decompensated cirrhosis in an open labelled randomized control trial. Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis of mixed etiologies were randomized to receive either a 5-day course of GCSF (5 μg/kg/d) plus standard medical therapy for 6 months (Group-A); or standard medical therapy alone for 6 months (Group-B). At the end of 6 months their survival were compared.</brief_summary>
