	<brief_summary>The investigators are examining: 1. the relationships of insulin levels and natriuretic peptide hormone levels, and 2. the effects of administering an infusion of natriuretic peptide hormone on the breakdown of fat in healthy lean and otherwise healthy obese individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natriuretic Peptides and Metabolic Risk in Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cardiac natriuretic peptide hormonal system may protect against the development of cardiometabolic risk. Epidemiologic studies have shown that in relatively healthy individuals without heart failure, low natriuretic peptide levels are associated with unfavorable cardiometabolic phenotypes, including higher blood pressure, obesity, higher insulin levels, and diabetes mellitus. Understanding the mechanisms behind the "natriuretic peptide deficiency" of obesity would illuminate an important way in which obesity interacts with the cardiovascular system. The investigators propose a prospective cross-over design in 40 healthy lean and otherwise healthy obese individuals. The investigators propose the following specific aims and hypotheses: Aim 1: To study the effect of hyperinsulinemia on the response of the natriuretic peptide system to salt loading. Hypothesis 1: Hyperinsulinemia will suppress natriuretic peptide levels in both obese and lean individuals. Aim 2: To examine the effect of an intravenous infusion of natriuretic peptide on acute markers of lipolysis. Hypothesis 2: An intravenous infusion of natriuretic peptide will raise acute markers of lipolysis in both obese and lean individuals.</detailed_description>
