	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab in comparison with usual care in the reduction of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia at high cardiovascular risk with non-HDL-C not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated statin therapy. Secondary Objectives: - To demonstrate whether alirocumab is superior in comparison with usual care in its effects on other lipid parameters (ie, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), total cholesterol (Total -C), lipoprotein a (Lp[a]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TGRLs), apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1), apolipoprotein C-III (Apo C-III), lipid subfractions by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (ie, LDL-C particle size and LDL, very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], HDL, and intermediate-density lipoprotein [IDL] particle number). - To assess changes in diabetes parameters with alirocumab vs. usual care treatment. - To demonstrate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab. - To evaluate treatment acceptance of alirocumab. - To evaluate PCSK9 concentrations and antibody development. - To demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab vs. fenofibrate on non-HDL-C and other lipid parameters (subgroup analysis).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab Versus Usual Care on Top of Maximally Tolerated Statin Therapy in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Mixed Dyslipidemia (ODYSSEY DM-Dyslipidemia)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The maximum study duration will be approximately 9 months per patient, including a 6 month treatment period, a screening period of up to 3 weeks, and an 8 week safety observation period. If needed for the purpose of scientific communication, a first-step analysis (both efficacy and safety) will be performed at the Week 24 cut-off date. A second-step analysis will be performed once all patients have completed the study and will include a final update of the safety analysis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia whose nonhighdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (nonHDLC) is not adequately controlled with a stable, maximum dose/regimen of statin that is tolerated by the patient. 18 years of age or more. Documented history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. NonHDLC of 100 mg/dL or greater. Triglycerides greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL and less than 500 mg/dL. Stable antihyperglycemic agents for at least 3 months. No change in weight of more than 5 kg within the prior 3 months. On stable dose of medications that are known to influence weight and/or lipids within the last 3 months. Exclusion criteria: Use of any lipid modifying therapies other than statins within the last 4 weeks (eg, ezetimibe, fenofibrate, nicotinic acid, omega3 fatty acids, etc.) or use of over the counter products/nutraceuticals known to impact lipids (eg, red yeast rice) within the last 4 weeks. Currently drinking more than 2 standard alcoholic drinks per day. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;45 kg/mÂ² or currently enrolled in a weight loss program and still in active phase of weight loss. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 9% or greater. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
