	<brief_summary>Renal sympathetic denervation from the intima of renal arteries has become an important method for the treatment of resistant hypertension, but renal sympathetic nerve are mainly located in the adventitia, and there is no report about renal sympathetic denervation from the renal adventitia. Primary aldosteronism is an important factor of secondary hypertension, tumor aldosterone in unilateral adrenal can increase the concentration of plasma aldosterone, in some patients blood pressure control is still not desirable after resection of tumor aldosterone. This study intends to conduct renal sympathetic denervation ablation from the adventitia to observe its efficacy and safety on blood pressure of patients with primary aldosterone.</brief_summary>
