	<brief_title>Breastfeeding Improvement Following Tongue-tie and Lip-tie Release</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breastfeeding rates in the United States initiate at around 80%, but many mothers are unable to effectively breastfeeding because of problems with latch and suction generation. Previous studies have demonstrated how nipple pain is directly linked to ankyloglossia, but most of these studies are done with poor methodology. Clinically, tongue-tie and lip-tie have correlate with numerous other symptoms besides nipple pain. These babies tend to be inefficient nursers, which can affect weight gain. Abnormal intake of air because of the poor latch/seal can lead to reflux symptoms. Finally, there is a significant psychological toll on mothers who want to breastfeed but cannot do so. This study aims to prospectively analyze these outcomes by using validated tools.</detailed_description>
