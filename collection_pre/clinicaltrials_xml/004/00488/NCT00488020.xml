	<detailed_description>About 500cc of blood are collected from the iliac bone marrow under epidural anesthesia.In the cell therapy lab this blood is harvested and mononuclear cells are separated.This procedure takes roughly 4 hours.After dilution in albumin (40cc)the mononuclear cells are injected into the calf muscles through 40 shots.This procedure is indicated for patients with lower limb ischemia on whom all the others known therapies have failed</detailed_description>
