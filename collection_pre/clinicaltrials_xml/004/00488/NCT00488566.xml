	<brief_summary>This is a First Time in Human Study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and resting motor threshold (rMT) of single doses of GSK drug in healthy volunteers.This will be a 2 part and 2 centre study.Part 1 will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single oral dose, dose-rising, cross-over study in healthy male and female (of non-child bearing potential) volunteers.Subjects will be randomized into cohorts of 10 subjects and cohorts will be recruited until the pre-defined safety or PK stopping limits are reached.Each subject will receive placebo and no more than 4 ascending doses of GSK drug in a randomized sequence on 5 separate study occasions.Each dosing session will take place over 2 days and there will be at least one subject on placebo on each day. There will be only one subject on any new active dose during the first day.Part 2 will be a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to investigate the effect of single doses of GSK drug and lamotrigine on resting motor threshold in healthy male subjects. Subjects will attend the unit a maximum of 4 separate occasions.During each session subjects will receive up to 4 TMS measurements and single doses of either GSK drug, lamotrigine or placebo, in a randomised manner.Up to two doses of GSK drug will be investigated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part 1 Healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 65 yrs and female (of nonchild bearing potential) subjects aged between 18 and 50 years. Part 2 righthanded healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 65 years. Parts 1 &amp; 2 body weight &gt;50 kg and Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range 19 29.9 kg/m2 inclusive. No abnormality on relevant clinical examination. No abnormality on relevant clinical chemistry or haematology examination at the prestudy medical examination. A 12lead ECG at the prestudy medical examination which is normal. Nonsmokers. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to any study procedures being done. The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions. Parts 1&amp;2 exceeding weekly recommended alcohol intake. An unwillingness of a male subject to use a condom/ spermicide in addition to having their female partner use another form of contraception. A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody result at screening. A positive urine drug test at screening or prior to each treatment period. History of alcohol/drug abuse or dependence within 12 months of the study. Urine cotinine levels indicative of smoking. History or regular use of tobacco or nicotine containing products within 6 months prior to screening. QTc interval &gt; 450 ms. Current or past history of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Sitting systolic blood pressure &gt;139 or &lt;90 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 or &lt;50 mmHg. Standing heart rate &lt;45 bpm. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new chemical entity within 30 days or 5 halflives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dose of current study medication. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Consumption of moderate/high tyramine containing food or drinks from 1 week prior to the first dose and until discharge, following the last dose. History of hypersensitivity to lamotrigine. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof.Or a history of drug, cosmetic or other allergy that, in the opinion of the physician, might interfere with the conduct of the study. History of known or suspected seizures, including infantile febrile, unexplained significant and recent loss of consciousness or history of significant head trauma with loss of consciousness or a family history (first degree relative) of epilepsy or seizures (fits). Where participation in study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Part 2 History of clinically relevant skin rashes and allergies. Poorlycontrolled migraine headaches. Implanted metal devices including pacemakers. Previous brain neurosurgery. History of neurological disorders and stroke.</criteria>
