	<brief_title>A Trial in Healthy Volunteers, to Evaluate the Tolerability and Cardiac Safety of Prucalopride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 32 healthy volunteers with two sessions (I and II). Each session consists of a run-in day for baseline assessments, 13 treatment days and 5 additional days for assessments. Subjects will be randomized to start with either the prucalopride or placebo session. Between the 2 sessions, there will be a washout period of 14 to 21 days, to avoid any carry-over effect.</detailed_description>
