	<brief_summary>The study is designed with drugs used frequently in the treatment of AML, but with a new combination less toxic,and effective in AML multidrug resistant. Justification: - The AML patients with primary resistance or relapsed in the first 12 months after CR, have second line chemotherapy low response rate . - These patients with AML with primary resistance or relapse, that reach remission after a rescue treatment, have an interval free survival and a global survival very short - Probably the resistance to the treatments is in relation to different forms expression of the MDR. - Complete remission is considered valid evaluation, because every patient who should obtain a CR can be considered to be eligible for a possible curative treatment: Ara-C administration to high doses or the TPH treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It is a protocol opened, multicentric, led to end to increase a) the rate of complete responses, b) the duration of the response, c) the free survival of disease and d) the global survival. The included subjects will be patients with primary or secondary AML that they have not achieved the CR after the standard treatment with an anthracycline or derivative associated with Ara-C or have relapsed in the first 12 months after having achieved the RC. Also patients with AML that, for any reason, they could not receive the standard treatment with anthracycline and Ara-C, will be included Cycle of induction. The patients will be treated by FLAT according to the following scheme: - FLUDARABINE, 30 mg/m2 i.v. (In 1 hour) on the 1st to 4. - CITARABINE, 2 g/m2 i.v. (In 4 hours), four hours after finishing the fludarabine, on the 1st to 4. - TOPOTECAN, 1,5 mg/m2 i.v. (In 4 hours), four hours after finishing the cytarabine, on the 1st to 4. When the patient starts recovering the hematological counts, and providing that has not blasts in the peripheral blood (SP), he will become a medullar revision (MO): - If MO presents severe hypocellularity without blasts,no therapeutic measurement will take and there will repeat revisions weekly and MDR's study up to the CR or the blasts appearance. - If in MO persist blasts (&gt;5 %) but have diminished less than 50 % of the initial number, the induction will be continued by the FLAT's second shift. - If in MO persists more than 50 % of blasts of the initial number, the patient goes out of the protocol and it will be treated as an agreement by the criterion of the center. The patients who have managed to enter CR will receive a cycle of consolidation as soon as possible and always within 2 months from the day in which they received first FLAT's dose. The cycle of consolidation consists of another FLAT's scheme to the same doses.</detailed_description>

Subjects of 18 years of age or major, with diagnosis of primary or secondary AML, confirmed cytologically, that fulfill one of the following conditions: Do not reach a CR after the conventional treatment. Relapse in the first 12 months after a CR. During remission, patients can have be treated by a transplant. The relapse is defined as the presence of blasts in peripheric blood or the presence of &gt;5 % of blasts in MO. Not participation in a clinical trial. 2. ECOG &lt; o = 2 3. Considered suitable patients for an intensive chemotherapy 4. Informed consent 1. Pelvic or spinal radiotherapy in 4 weeks before the incorporation in the protocol. 2.

Precedents of intervention of major surgery in 2 weeks before the incorporation in the protocol. 9. Patients with disease serious or not controlled (for example not controlled diabetes, infection, hypertension, etc.). 10. Patients who have received other cytotoxic drugs (except hydroxyurea to reduce the leucocytosis) as treatment of the current relapse or of the resistance, in 4 weeks before the protocol. 11. Patients with hypersensitivity known to someone of the drugs of the protocol. 12. Patients treated previously with growth factors with purposes of sensibilization. 13.
