	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Tigecycline in Hospitalized Patients With cIAI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tigecycline to treat complicated intra-abdominal infections in hospitalized patients. Both the clinical response profile and the microbiological response profile will be assessed. The primary endpoint will be clinical response within the microbiological evaluable population at the test-of-cure assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hospitalized male or female patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Patients must be a candidate for or have had a laparotomy, or laparoscopy of an intraabdominal abscess. Patients with a complicated intraabdominal infection such as: an intraabdominal abscess; an intraabdominal abscess (including liver and spleen) that develops in a postoperative patient after receiving &gt; 48 hours and less than or equal to 5 days of a nonstudy antibiotic. An intraabdominal culture must be obtained from the infected site. appendicitis complicated by perforation (grossly visible) and abscess and/or periappendiceal abscess; perforated diverticulitis complicated by abscess formation or fecal contamination; complicated cholecystitis with evidence of perforation or empyema; perforation of the large or small intestine with abscess, or fecal contamination; purulent peritonitis or peritonitis associated with fecal contamination; gastric or duodenal ulcer perforation with symptoms lasting at least 24 hours prior to operation; traumatic bowel perforation with symptoms lasting at least 12 hours prior to operation. Patients with any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude an evaluation of a response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy or followup visits could be completed. Active or treated leukemia or systemic malignancy that required treatment with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy or antineoplastic therapy within the past 3 months, or any metastatic malignancy to the abdomen with life expectancy less than 6 months. Anticipated length of antibiotic therapy less than 5 days.</criteria>
