	<brief_summary>It has been found that many breast cancers are hormone dependent and that hormonal therapy by estrogen suppression such as ovarian ablation, tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor has proven beneficial in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Zoladex, a kind of luitinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue, can offer efficient estrogen suppression as well. It can induce reversible amenorrhea and the clinical effect is similar to ovarian ablation. Some studies have demonstrated the efficacy of zoladex in treating pre and perimenopausal hormone dependent breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. Few data is available on Zoladex in neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer In our departments, neoadjuvant CEF regimen is of general practice, and a preliminary study is designed to investigate whether adding Zoladex into neoadjuvant CEF could further improve results in hormone responsive breast cancer.</brief_summary>
