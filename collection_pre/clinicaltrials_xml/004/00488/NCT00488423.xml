	<brief_summary>MIDAS involves an assessment of glucose levels obtained before and after bariatric surgery. There are two different procedural tests involved; an oral glucose tolerance test (mixed meal) and a hyperglycemic clamp test. Two tests are performed preoperatively and five more are performed postoperatively for a one year period. The associated labwork drawn with the mixed meal and clamp tests are demonstrating changes in glucose, insulin and gut hormone levels.</brief_summary>
