	<brief_summary>The diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) continue to undergo rapid change. Randomized controlled trials such as the TEMPO study have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the combination of etanercept and methotrexate. Importantly, the TEMPO study showed that patients treated with etanercept and methotrexate could reach the newer therapeutic goals of low disease activity and remission, and that the physicians, patients, and payers are no longer prepared to accept the goal of "Reduction of symptoms". RCT are important and powerful tools in assessing efficacy and safety but have their limitations in terms of generalisability. In order to assess health economics, clinical effectiveness and safety of etanercept, they need to be measured by performing observational studies of unselected patients. This study aims to provide a holistic assessment of patients receiving etanercept in a real world setting. This will include centers that would not normally take part in RCT. The study will assess treatment with etanercept with descriptive statistics of the following parameters: Health economic, Safety, Effectiveness. In addition, there was a previous study of similar design, but of only 3 months duration (101354), which will allow comparison with historical data. Since previous study, there have been a number of significant changes: Introduction of a new formulation for etanercept (Enbrel® 50mg · once weekly), Definition of early RA has been modified to short disease duration (from 3 months to 1 year).</brief_summary>
