	<brief_title>Follow-up After Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to analyze the data collected for clinical purposes in 453 patients who already underwent endovascular AAA repair at UCSF and SFVA, and others who will undergo this operation in the future. Most of these patients have now passed the 2-year follow-up required by the original protocol, all continue to be followed for clinical purposes, using the same studies, the same data forms and the same schedule as before, because studies of various devices of this type have shown that the potential for late problems requires continuing scrutiny of stent-graft structure and function, as a basis for timely re-intervention.</detailed_description>
