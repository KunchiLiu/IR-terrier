	<brief_summary>This 2-arm study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Fuzeon with an integrase inhibitor in an expanded access program plus an optimized background antiviral regimen (AVR) in HIV-1 infected patients naive to Fuzeon and an integrase inhibitor. In the first cohort phase of the study (Phase I), eligible patients received Fuzeon 90 mg subcutaneously (SC) twice daily until confirmation of response (min/max = 8/16 weeks). In Phase II, the randomised comparator phase of the study, responders were randomized to receive Fuzeon either 90 mg SC twice a day or 180 mg SC once a day for a further 16 weeks. Non-responders and virological failures were terminated from the study. The anticipated time on study treatment was 3-9 months, and the target sample size was 210 individuals.</brief_summary>
