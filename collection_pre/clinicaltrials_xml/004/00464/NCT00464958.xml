	<brief_summary>Open label, one year extension study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 12 mg sublingual tizanidine administered once nightly in MS patients who successfully completed Phase I/II protocol C2/5/TZ:MS-05 at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Department of Neurology, Dr. Arnon Karni, PI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>One Year Extension Study To Protocol C2/5/TZ:MS-05</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The previous study, Protocol C2/5/TZ-MS-05, using 12 mg sublingual tizanidine, confirmed that administration of once nightly sublingual tizanidine before sleep results in a statistically and clinically significant reduction in next-day spasticity, as compared to placebo. The clinical effect following 12 mg sublingual tizanidine was larger (4-5 units on the Ashworth scale) and more sustained (up to 18-20 hours post-dose) than was seen for 8 mg tizanidine (earlier study, Protocol C2/5/TZ:MS-03z). This study also reconfirmed that the increased improvement in next-day reduction of spasticity following overnight sublingual tizanidine dosing is not accompanied by a concomitant increase in next-day somnolence. This study, a 12 month open label extension, will allow those patients who successfully completed Protocol C2/5/TZ-MS-05 and who found tizanidine to be beneficial, to continue treatment under close medical supervision. The study will provide long-term (12 months) clinical efficacy and safety data re: the use of once daily sublingual tizanidine, administered at night, just before bedtime.</detailed_description>
