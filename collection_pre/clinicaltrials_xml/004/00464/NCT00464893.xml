	<brief_title>Phase II Study With Catumaxomab in Patients With Gastric Cancer After Neoadjuvant CTx and Curative Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label, multi-center phase II study in surgically resectable patients after neoadjuvant ECX-chemotherapy, with confirmed diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma and with a high risk of disseminated tumor cells due to serosal infiltration or positive lymph nodes after curative gastrectomy. Treatment with catumaxomab will consist of an initial dose of 10 µg given intraoperatively as an intraperitoneal bolus and of four postoperative ascending doses (10-20-50-150 µg)which will be administered as an i.p.-infusion using an installed abdominal i.p.-port on the postoperative days 7, 10, 13 and 16. Catumaxomab is a trifunctional antibody targeting EpCAM on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells. Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells [DCs] and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to preclinical data, trifunctional antibodies activate these different immune effector cells, which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response.</detailed_description>
