Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within one month of the dose of vaccine. Previous vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine of serogroup A, C, W135 and/or Y within the last five years. Previous vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine of serogroup A, C, W135 and/or Y. Previous vaccination with tetanus toxoid within the last month. History of meningococcal disease. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition (congenital or secondary), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, until the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.
