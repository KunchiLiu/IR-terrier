	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin Type A for the Treatment of Male Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of the male CP/CPPS is often as unsuccessful as frustrating for patients and doctors. Because of that patients change their general practitioners or urologists quite regularly. One of the major problems is the unknown pathomechanism of the disease. Most patients are suffering from irritative voiding symptoms and a dysfunction of the pelvic floor. By looking at the various (non-) conservative therapeutical strategies it becomes quite clear that there is no unique and convincing therapeutical strategy. At present Botulinum-Toxin Type A (BTX A) is widely used in the urological field especially for para-/tetraplegics patients having trouble with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. It has been reported in case series (doses: 200U and 30U) that BTX A injected into the external urethral sphincter is able to reduce the symptoms without provoking incontinence. This is implied with the hypothesis that obstructive voiding symptoms because of a CP/CPPS are associated with an incomplete relaxation of the bladder neck and the external urethral sphincter. After having given their informed consent, patients undergo a screening visit and baseline evaluation including patients history, clinical examination, NIH-CPSI and IPSS-questionnaires, micturition diary, sonography, 4-glass test and urodynamics. Patients fulfilling the study eligibility criteria are randomized to receive intrasphincteric injection of either BTX A or placebo. There will be 5 follow-up visits including a post-treatment follow-up after 1 year.</detailed_description>
