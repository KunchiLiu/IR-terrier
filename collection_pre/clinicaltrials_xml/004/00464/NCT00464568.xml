	<brief_summary>This current study is planned as a dedicated pharmacodynamic (effect of drug on the body) study to investigate the dose response in rhinitic subjects at doses where GSK256066 has been proven to work (200mcg) or expected to (50mcg) work. This study also aims to investigate the lower end of the predicted therapeutic range.</brief_summary>
