	<brief_summary>This study will investigate whether GC1008, an antibody which neutralizes TGF-beta, is safe in treating patients with the disease called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The highest dose without excessive side effects will be investigated. Tests will determine how long GC1008 is in the body and how it is excreted.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of GC1008 in Patients With Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) of Single Doses of GC1008 in Patients With Treatment Resistant Idiopathic FSGS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients in each cohort will receive a single dose of GC1008 infusion at 1, 2, 4 or 0.3 mg/kg body weight. The higher dose cohort will not start until the first 28 days safety data for the lower dose cohort have been reviewed by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Cohort C and D will run concurrently with patients randomised to receive either a 4 or 0.3 mg/kg body weight dose, respectively. After receiving the infusion of GC1008 on Day 0, patients will be monitored for the 24 hours following the infusion. Patients will return periodically over the following 112 days for safety evaluations and clinical outcome assessments. Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single dose administration of GC1008 as well as for evaluation of markers of clinical efficacy</detailed_description>
