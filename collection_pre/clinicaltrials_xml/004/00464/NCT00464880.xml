Patients on ongoing hypertensive therapy must have a blood pressure ≥ 135/85 mmHg but lower than 170/105 mmHg at Visit 2 (Day 1) AND patients must be on stable antihypertensive medications for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 2 (runin period). 2. Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients must have a blood pressure ≥ 135/85 mmHg but lower than 170/105 mmHg at Visit 2 (Day 1). Patients must be on stable hypoglycemic medications for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 2 (Day 1). Patients must be willing and medically able to discontinue all angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), aldosterone receptor antagonist and potassium sparing diuretic medications for the duration of the study.

Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to dosing. Significant illness within the two weeks prior to dosing. Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drugs including, but not limited to, any of the following: History of major gastrointestinal tract surgery such as gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, or bowel resection Currently active or previously active inflammatory bowel disease during the 12 months prior to Visit 1 Currently active gastritis, duodenal or gastric ulcers, or gastrointestinal/rectal bleeding during the 3 months prior to Visit 1.

Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or the Novartis medical monitor, would jeopardize the evaluation of efficacy or safety History of noncompliance to medical regimens or unwillingness to comply with the study protocol Known or suspected contraindications to the study medications, including history of allergy to ACE inhibitors and/or to thiazide diuretics or other sulfonamide derived drug Any surgical or medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may place the patient at higher risk from his/her participation in the study, or is likely to prevent the patient from complying with the requirements of the study or completing the study Use of any prescription drug or overthecounter (OTC) medication which is prohibited by the protocol. Patients who previously participated in any aliskiren study. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
