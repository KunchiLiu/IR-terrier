	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring (POC) in the ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe burns and traumatic injury can be associated with protracted illness and prolonged ICU course. The beneficial effects of strict serum glucose control in critically ill surgical patients have been demonstrated. Continuous glucose monitors may improve glucose control by providing close to real-time glucose measurements, giving the critical care team the ability to react to trends before hypo- or hyperglycemia is reached. These improvements may decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with severe thermal injury, thereby minimizing hospital stay and recovery. Burned and injured soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines may return to duty in a more expeditious fashion, or at minimum, enjoy a better quality of life after discharge from the intensive care unit.</detailed_description>
