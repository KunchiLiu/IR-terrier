Group B practices (n=41) received the same as Group A and were offered weekly conference calls providing advice and support. Group C practices (n=41) received the same as Group B and were offered in-office visit providing hands-on advice and support. Outcome measures were computed from reimbursement claims submitted to NC Division of Medical Assistance. Primary outcome measure: rate of preventive dental services provision per 100 well-child visits.
