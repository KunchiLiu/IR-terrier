	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate safety of switching from fondaparinux to either unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin for patients experiencing acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary angioplasty.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Switching From Fondaparinux to Bivalirudin or Unfractionated Heparin in ACS Patients Undergoing PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective open label, randomized, multi-center registry. One hundred patients who received fondaparinux within the 24 hours prior to presentation to the coronary catheterization lab and who are suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention. The patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin during the angioplasty. All patients will be followed throughout the duration of the hospital stay.</detailed_description>
