	<brief_summary>Patients with coronary artery disease are characterized by an increased cardiovascular risk and they often have low blood high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels or HDL-cholesterol with modified vasculoprotective properties. The purpose of the present study is to characterize the quality of HDL-cholesterol in patients with coronary artery disease and normal blood HDL-cholesterol levels and to examine the effect of exercise training on the vasculoprotective effects of HDL-cholesterol in these patients. Additionally, the researchers aim to investigate the endothelial function, oxidative stress and the regenerative capacity of the endothelial progenitor cells in patients with coronary artery disease and the changes dependent on physical activity of patients.</brief_summary>
