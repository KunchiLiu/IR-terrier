	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn if apixaban can prevent blood clots in the leg (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) and lung (pulmonary embolism [PE]) that sometimes occur within patients hospitalized for acute medical illness, and to learn how apixaban compares to enoxaparin (Lovenox®) for preventing these clots. The safety of apixaban will also be studied.</brief_summary>
