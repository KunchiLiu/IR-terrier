	<brief_title>A Study Designed to Evaluate ODSH in Subjects With Exacerbations of COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management of acute exacerbations of COPD today is qualitatively the same as it was 40 years ago: bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Because of the prominent pathophysiological role of neutrophils in exacerbations of COPD, neutrophils and their toxic oxidants and proteases represent therapeutic targets which are currently unchallenged in the treatment of this aspect of the disease. Ideally, to disrupt neutrophilic airway inflammation, one would both block neutrophilic influx from the vascular space into the airway, as well as neutralize or inactivate prominent neutrophilic toxins such as the proteases HLE and cathepsin G. Heparin is a sulfated mucopolysaccharide that slows blood clot formation by inhibiting the reactions that lead to formation of fibrin clots. Physicians use heparin to prevent blood clot formation during open-heart surgery, bypass surgery and dialysis. Heparin also prevents previously formed clots from becoming larger and causing more serious problems. Heparin has other biological properties, most notably anti-inflammatory activity. At doses required to be therapeutically beneficial as an anti-inflammatory, heparin can cause severe, potentially life-threatening hemorrhage. ParinGenix has chemically modified heparin to retain the anti-inflammatory activity while reducing anti-coagulant properties. Heparin has long been known to be a potent inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo, of the cationic neutrophil proteases HLE and cathepsin G. However, heparin also has numerous other important anti-inflammatory effects. P-selectin is the primary endothelial attachment molecule mediating neutrophil rolling along the vessel wall. At concentrations close to those achieved in plasma near the high range of therapeutic anticoagulation, heparin inhibits P-selectin and P-selectin mediated interaction of leukocytes with endothelium. Heparin also blocks the leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and Mac-1-dependent leukocyte adherence to endothelial ICAM. These combined effects on rolling, integrin-dependent attachment and perhaps other aspects of cellular passage through the basement membrane prevent neutrophil accumulation in areas of inflammation. As an example, when given in much higher concentrations than those appropriate for therapeutic anticoagulation, heparin efficiently blocks neutrophilic influx into ischemic reperfused myocardium and brain reducing the size of both myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Thus, heparin and heparin analogues may have the potential to also reduce inflammatory influx of neutrophils into the airway during exacerbations of COPD. All subjects will receive standard of care treatment, including corticosteroids, beta-2 agonists, and antibiotics as well as ODSH or placebo.</detailed_description>
