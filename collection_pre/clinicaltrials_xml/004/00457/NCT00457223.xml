	<brief_title>To Compare Fibrin Glue and Suture in Primary Pterygium Excision With Amniotic Membrane Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are few studies about use of fibrin glue in pterygium surgery with conjunctival auto-graft with promising outcome. Less recurrent rate, less discomfort and halve surgical time were reported. Up to our knowledge,there is no report of fibrin glue in pterygium excision with amniotic membrane transplantation(AMT). There is conventional technique to use AMT in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital because some benefits over conjunctival auto-graft e.g. - Preserve healthy superior conjunctiva for future glaucoma filtering surgery - Can use in big or 2-headed pterygium - Not contract as conjunctival graft esp. in case of fibrin glue - Potential easier to use with fibrin glue - Available from Thai Red Cross Eye Bank Comparison(s): amniotic membrane transplantation using fibrin glue compare to suture after pterygium excision.</detailed_description>
