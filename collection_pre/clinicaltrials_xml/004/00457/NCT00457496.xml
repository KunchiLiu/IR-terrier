	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Cognitive and Physical Intervention to Reduce Head and Muscle Pain in Working Communities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many studies have been performed to assess the efficacy of non invasive physical interventions in the treatment of different types of headache and cervical pain. However the evidence on their effectiveness is still limited and the results of recent studies are conflicting. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a workplace cognitive and physical programme (Intervention) in reducing the frequency of pain involving the head and neck area. The Intervention consists of brief shoulder and neck exercises to be performed several times a day, a relaxation exercise and instructions of how to reduce parafunction and hyperfunction of the craniofacial and cervical muscles during the day. Comparison(s): Group of employees that will receive a cognitive/physical programme (Intervention), compared to a similar group of employees that will not receive the Intervention (Controls); (frequency of headache and neck and shoulder pain).</detailed_description>
