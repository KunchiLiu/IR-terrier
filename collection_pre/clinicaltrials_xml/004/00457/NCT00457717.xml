	<brief_title>Myopia Control by Combining Auricular Acupoint and Atropine Eyedrops</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 64 school-aged children with myopia, fulfilling eligibility criteria, were recruited. They were randomly assigned to three arms: 1. 21 treated with the 0.25 % atropine each night (0.25A). 2. 20 treated with the 0.5 % atropine each night (0.5A). 3. 23 treated with 0.25 % atropine each night together with stimulation of auricular acupoints(0.25A+E). This protocol was proceeded for at least 6 months.The differences in post-treatment effects of these three groups were statistically accessed.</detailed_description>
