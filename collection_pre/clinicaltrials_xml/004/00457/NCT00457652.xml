	<brief_title>Does Caffeine Reduce Rosuvastatin-Induced Protection Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rosuvastatin is a proven cholesterol lowering medicine, which hereby is assumed to achieve a reduction in cardiovascular events. Apart from it's cholesterol lowering action, rosuvastatin may also increase tolerance against ischemia-reperfusion injury. In dogs rosuvastatin increases the endogenous concentration of adenosine, by enhancing the activity of the enzyme ecto-5'-nucleotidase, which converts adenosine monophosphate into adenosine. We hypothesize that rosuvastatin increases tolerance against ischemia-reperfusion injury by induction of ecto-5'-nucleotidase and thereby increasing adenosine activity. This protective effect of rosuvastatin can be abrogated by using the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine.</detailed_description>
