	<brief_summary>This aim of this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining a single course of Yttrium 90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan, a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody ( Zevalin ), with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed, refractory, or transformed Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combining Zevalin With High-Dose Chemotherapy Prior to Autologous StemCell Transplant in Patients With Relapsed, Refractory, or Transformed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relapse rates after chemotherapy for relapsed, refractory or transformed Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)remain very high. NHL is a radiosensitive tumor. We hypothesize that targeted radioimmunotherapy combined with high-dose chemotherapy may increase response and survival rates in a safe and reliable manner.</detailed_description>
