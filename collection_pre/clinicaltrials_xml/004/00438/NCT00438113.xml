	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a very common arrhythmia causing many symptoms resulting in numerous hospitalizations. Catheter ablation is a technique that has evolved significantly to improve symptomatic recurrences, but does not offer a 100% cure rate. We hypothesize that the use of aggressive BP lowering will reduce the rate of recurrent AF after catheter ablation for AF. We plan a randomized clinical trial of aggressive BP lowering versus standard BP control to investigate this.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrial Substrate Modification With Aggressive Blood Pressure Lowering to Prevent AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity, necessitating treatment. Radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation/flutter has evolved significantly and is the closest we have come to a 'cure' for these dysrhythmias. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation in those who have undergone radiofrequency ablation as treatment AF is up to 40% at one year and higher in those with persistent AF. Hypertension is a potent risk factor for AF, but recent studies have demonstrated that even modest increases in BP may lead to a higher incidence of AF. There is no clinical trial evidence to date that has investigated aggressive BP control in patients post radiofrequency ablation for AF to prevent recurrent AF. Objective: We propose to determine if aggressive BP control reduces recurrent AF post ablation. Hypothesis: Aggressive BP lowering will reduce the incidence of recurrent AF post ablation. Research Plan: Study Design. This will be a randomized open label trial in patients who are post catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Randomization to either aggressive BP lowering or standard BP control will occur three to six months prior to the procedure. Study Population. Patients will be included if they have persistent or high burden paroxysmal (refractory to class 1 or 3 antiarrhythmic medication) and intend to have a catheter ablation procedure for AF. Followup. Patients will be followed at 3 month intervals for the first year, then every 6 months to a maximum of 30 months or the common study end date has been reached (1 year post randomization for the last patient enrolled). Statistical Analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the primary outcome will be performed. A Cox proportional hazards model will be constructed to assess the effect of variables chosen a priori on the primary outcome.</detailed_description>
