	<brief_title>Comparison of Early and Late Therapy for Adults With Operatively Treated Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the last three decades, operative treatment of distal radius fractures has become increasingly common compared to non-operative treatment. Over the last 15 years there has been a trend towards more invasive, internal plate fixation of fractures of the distal radius. One argument in favor of internal fixation for these fractures is that, similar to other periarticular fractures, it would be beneficial to allow early movement of the wrist articulation. There is not, however, any data to support this statement. In fact, data regarding external fixation that either immobilizes the wrist or allows wrist motion suggest that early wrist mobilization is not as important as the overall alignment of the bone in terms of final wrist motion. This question is important in patient care and in decision-making regarding these fractures. Additionally, many companies use this claim as a marketing point in spite of the lack of evidence. We consider that good quality data is needed to determine the answer to this issue and to help to resolve the related problems described above.</detailed_description>
