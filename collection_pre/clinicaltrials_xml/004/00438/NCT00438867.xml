	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a one-time intracoronary infusion of Ad5FGF-4 is effective in reducing the time to onset myocardial ischemia as measured by exercise treadmill testing and improving myocardial blood flow as measured by SPECT imaging. Exercise capacity, angina functional class, patient symptoms and quality of life will also be evaluated to characterize the efficacy of Ad5FGF-4. Short-term and long-term safety of Ad5FGF-4 will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Angina Pectoris</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Female patients 1875 years of age inclusive Stable angina classified as CCS III or IV Receiving treatment with at least two classes of chronic antianginal medication, of which two are at the maximally tolerated dose Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥30% Not a candidate for, or unlikely to benefit from standard revascularization procedures as verified by an independent cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon (not a study investigator) at each center Can undergo ETT using the modified Bruce protocol and; 1. ECG changes diagnostic of myocardial ischemia occur during the first 10 minutes of exercise 2. Variability of the time to onset of ECG changes diagnostic of myocardial ischemia is ≤25% or within 60 seconds if the time to onset of myocardial ischemia occurs within the first 4 minutes of exercise as determined by two consecutive screening treadmill tests Evidence of stress induced myocardial ischemia by adenosine SPECT, defined as a reversible perfusion defect size of ≥9% Willing and able to comply with the study requirements including longterm followup Provided written informed consent Patients of childbearing potential (must be surgically sterile or postmenopausal) Patients for whom an immediate revascularization procedure is indicated (CABG surgery or PCI) Myocardial infarction within the past 3 months Unstable angina or hospitalization requiring intravenous antianginal therapy within the 14 days prior to the start of screening evaluations Congestive heart failure NYHA Class IV Electrocardiogram that precludes accurate assessment of exercise induced myocardial ischemia (e.g., left bundle branch block, WolfParkinsonWhite syndrome, atrial fibrillation) Myocarditis or restrictive pericarditis Left main coronary stenosis ≥70% (unless the patient has a patent graft or collateral vessels supplying the left coronary circulation) or proximal stenoses ≥70% in all major coronary conduit vessels (coronary arteries and bypass grafts) Clinically significant aortic or mitral valvular heart disease Coronary ostial stenosis that precludes adequate catheter engagement in any target vessel Coronary artery to venous communications, which bypass the coronary capillary bed Untreated lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias CABG surgery within the past 6 months, unless those grafts are now occluded. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) within the past 3 months, unless the dilated vessel(s) are now occluded Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) within 3 months prior to the start of screening evaluations Transmyocardial or percutaneous myocardial laser revascularization within the previous year Prior treatment with any cardiovascular gene or stem cell therapy. Any intercurrent illness that may interfere with their ability to perform a maximal ETT Any major organ disease that substantially impairs life expectancy. History of cancer, other than basal cell carcinoma, or patients with any laboratory or physical exam or diagnostic procedure finding suggestive of current malignancy Moderate to severe nonproliferative or proliferative retinopathy from any cause (ETDRS score &gt;35), clinically significant macular edema, or previous panretinal photocoagulation therapy Heparin induced thrombocytopenia or history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or other medical condition causing thrombocytopenia SGPT level greater than 2.0 times the upper limit of the laboratory normal range Bilirubin level ≥2.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL Platelet count &lt;100,000/μL White blood cell count &lt;3,000/μL Positive test for hepatitis B or C Positive test for HIV History of colon cancer in a first degree relative (i.e., parent, sibling or offspring) unless the patient has undergone a colonoscopy in the past 36 months with negative findings History of breast cancer in a first degree relative Patient in a family with any documented hereditary cancer syndrome Prior anaphylaxis reaction to iodinated contrast agents Patients who are known to be immunosuppressed or are receiving chronic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs Received an investigational drug or biologic within 30 days of screening or are currently participating in an investigational drug, biologic or device trial</criteria>
