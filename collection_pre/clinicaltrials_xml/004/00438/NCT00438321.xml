	<brief_title>Effect of Increasing Testosterone on Insulin Sensitivity in Men With the Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome is a medical condition defined by high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, increased abdominal obesity (gain in fat around the region of the stomach), and insulin resistance. Insulin is the hormone that your body produces to decrease the levels of sugar in your blood. A person that is insulin resistant needs more insulin to decrease blood sugar levels than a normal person does. Insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes, which is one of the most common illnesses in the United States. There is evidence pointing to a relationship between insulin and testosterone in men (testosterone is the male sex hormone that is produced in the testes). As men get older their testosterone levels decrease while their weight and insulin resistance tends to increase. The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the details of the relationship between insulin and testosterone. A clearer understanding of this relationship can have an important impact on public health due to the high rate of health problems associated with diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. We are looking for men between the ages of 50-75 with the metabolic syndrome to participate in this research study. Participation in this study involves taking medication and/or placebo (a placebo looks exactly like the study medication but contains no active drug), blood tests, muscle biopsies, and imaging scans. This study involves outpatient visits. Subjects are paid up to $500 for completing the study.</detailed_description>
