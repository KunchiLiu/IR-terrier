	<brief_title>Comparison of Early and Late Therapy for Adults With Non-Operatively Treated Proximal Humerus Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proximal humerus fractures with limited displacement and fractures that occur in older, less active or infirm patients are treated non-operatively. There is a general impression, supported by some data, that better function is obtained with immediate initiation of shoulder exercises. However, there is some concern that this may contribute to nonunion of the fracture and may be unnecessary. Some researchers have demonstrated better outcomes with immediate rehabilitation with pendulum movements. Others have shown similar functional outcomes when rehabilitation begins approximately a month after injury, or when radiographs show signs of bone healing, and this delay is associated with lower rates of non-union and malunion occurrence.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and Female patients. Any race Older than 18y Diagnosed with proximal humeral fracture clinically and confirmed by imaging studies: X rays and/or CT Scans. Any type of proximal humeral fracture according to the Neer or AO classification system. Patient should have received nonoperative treatment. Patients younger than 18 y. Patients with multiple other fractures. Patients that have received surgical treatment including closed reduction and percutaneous fixation, open reduction and internal fixation (plates, screws, pins, tension wire bands, cerclage wiring and/or intramedullary nailing) and/or articular shoulder prosthesis.</criteria>
