	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Combinations of biological substances in alefacept may be able to carry cancer-killing substances directly to cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alefacept in treating patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alefacept in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma or Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose or the optimal immunologic dose of alefacept in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Secondary - Determine if antitumor activity of this drug exists in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. - Induction therapy: Patients receive alefacept IV over 2-5 minutes once weekly for up to 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or complete or partial response after induction therapy proceed to maintenance therapy. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of alefacept until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The optimal immunologic dose is defined as the dose that does not exceed the MTD, has the highest alefacept level, and achieves saturation of CD2 receptors. - Maintenance therapy: Patients receive alefacept IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 10-12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who experience disease progression during maintenance therapy may receive reinduction therapy* comprising 4 weekly doses of alefacept. The patient then proceeds to a second maintenance phase in the absence of disease progression. NOTE: *Only 1 reinduction allowed. Patients undergo blood and tissue collection periodically for pharmacological studies. Blood serum is analyzed for alefacept concentration, cytokine concentration, CD16 polymorphisms, and CD2 saturation via flow cytometry. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 3 years and then periodically thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
