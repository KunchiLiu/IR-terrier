	<brief_summary>Abdominal obesity is strongly associated with dyslipidemia, which may account for the associated increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary disease. Weight reduction is suggested to be a preferred and effective first-line strategy to correct lipid abnormalities, particularly in overweight/obese subjects. This improvement may be related to the effect of reduction in abdominal fat mass on apoB and apoA-I metabolism, but this remains to be fully demonstrated. Hypothesis: Reduction in abdominal fat mass by weight loss decreases apoB concentration and raises HDL-cholesterol chiefly by increasing LDL-apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR), as well as decreasing HDL apoA-I, respectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Abdominal Obesity on Lipoprotein Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We examined the mechanism of the effect of weight loss through dieting on LDL and HDL metabolism in abdominally obese men. LDL apoB-100 and HDL apoA-I kinetics were studied using a primed-constant infusion of 1-[13C]-leucine in a controlled, dietary intervention trial of 16 weeks duration in middle-aged, obese men with the metabolic syndrome. Isotopic enrichment in apoB and apoA-I was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and fractional turnover rates estimated using multi-compartmental modelling.</detailed_description>
