	<brief_summary>This multicenter, prospective, observational registry will evaluate the safety and performance of the CYPHER SELECT™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent, and of all future generation of commercially approved Cordis Sirolimus-eluting Stents (SES), in routine clinical practice. Its objective is to measure the incidence and identify the predictors of acute, sub-acute and late stent thrombosis and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE). Additional analyses will be performed in patient sub-populations, such as diabetes, in-stent restenosis (ISR), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and multivessel coronary disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-center Post-Market Surveillance Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The data will be collected in consecutive subjects treated with commercially available product and following standard clinical practice. This registry will be limited to subjects who have received only the CYPHER SELECT™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent during the index procedure. While no inclusion or exclusion criteria have been specified, uniform, complete and accurate data will be collected peri-procedurally, during the index hospitalization, and during follow-up. All subjects should be treated according to the Instruction For Use (IFU) including conduct of the stenting procedure, application of antiplatelet medication and any other medical therapy should be provided according to local usual practice. Data collection (Electronic Data Capture), data management, statistical analyses, monitoring and core laboratory evaluations will be assigned to independent organizations.</detailed_description>
