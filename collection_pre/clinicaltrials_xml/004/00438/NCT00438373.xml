	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if there is an association between the serum LH receptor expression on the day of hCG or the day of oocyte retrieval and the retrieval rates at oocyte pick up. For this purpose, m-RNA copy numbers will be assessed in the blood serum of patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF on different days. Furthermore, detailed ultrasound scans will be perfomed, as well as assesment of hormonal levels during ovarian stimulation.</detailed_description>
