	<brief_summary>The purposes are 1. to measure the effect of dialysis with glucose in dialysis water on blood pressure, pulse rate, plasma concentration of glucose, plasma concentrations og insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, renin, angiotensin II, endothelin and body temperature, and 2. to analyse the relationship between the changes in blood pressure and changes in vasoactive hormones</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The relationship between blood pressure during dialysis treatment and vasoactive hormones are studied. This includes measurements of plasma concentration of glucose, plasma concentrations og insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, renin, angiotensin II, endothelin</detailed_description>
