	<brief_summary>The present clinical trial is a dose comparison of a multi-component active immunotherapy designed to stimulate an immune reaction to specific tumor associated antigens which are highly expressed on a large number of solid cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immune Response to a Multi-component Immune Based Therapy (MKC1106-PP) for Patients With Advanced Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of tumors are ignored by the immune system and it was thought for a long time that tumor antigens did not exist. However, recently a number of tumor antigens have been described. These antigens reside on cancer cells and can be recognized by specific T-cells which can ultimately attack and destroy the tumor.</detailed_description>
