	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 6R-BH4 on vascular function in patients with coronary artery disease. We hypothesize that 6R-BH4 will improve vascular function in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of 6R-BH4 Treatment in Coronary Artery Disease (OXBIO Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decreased production of nitric oxide (NO) from the endothelium (the layer of cells that forms the lining of all blood vessels) has been shown to contribute to atherosclerosis. NO has multiple beneficial effects on vascular function. Endothelial function can be measured in humans via a number of methods, and endothelial dysfunction has been shown to be a strong adverse predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is essential for the production of NO in endothelial cells. 6R-BH4 is a synthetic version of naturally occurring BH4. We aim to investigate the effects of oral 6R-BH4 supplementation on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
