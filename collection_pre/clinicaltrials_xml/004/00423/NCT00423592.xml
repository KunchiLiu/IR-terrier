	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 study was to determine the incidence of increased serum aminotransferase concentrations (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), as well as the overall safety and tolerability of ambrisentan, in participants with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), idiopathic PAH (IPAH), or familial PAH (FPAH) who had previously discontinued ERA therapy (bosentan or sitaxsentan) due to increased serum ALT or AST concentrations.</brief_summary>
