	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess, after 6 weeks of dosing, whether co-administration of ezetimibe 10 mg with simvastatin 20 mg will be more effective than treatment with doubling the dose of simvastatin to 40 mg alone in reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations and in achieving the National Cholesterol Expert Panel (NCEP) III LDL-C target goal of &lt;2.6 mmol/L (&lt;100 mg/dL) for subjects with diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must have diabetes mellitus type 2 (fasting plasma glucose &gt;7 mmol/L [126 mg/dL]) of at least 12 months duration at Visit 3 and must be adequately controlled (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] &lt;=9.0%). Subjects must not have had a change in antidiabetic pharmacotherapy [i.e. changes in dosage (with the exception of +/ 10 units of insulin) or addition of new medication] or experience recent history of repeated hypoglycemia or unstable glycemic control within 3 months of Visit (Baseline Visit). Subjects must have documented coronary heart disease (CHD). For the purposes of this study, CHD will include one or more of the following features: documented stable angina with evidence of ischemia on exercise testing); history of myocardial infarction; history of percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCTI) with or without stent placement); symptomatic peripheral vascular disease (claudication); documented history of atherothrombotic cerebrovascular disease; and/or documented history of unstable angina or nonQ wave myocardial infarction. Subjects must have a lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) concentration &gt;=2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) to &lt;=4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) using the Friedewald calculation available at the time of randomization Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Subjects must have triglyceride concentrations of &lt;3.99 mmol/L (350 mg/dL) at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Subject must be currently taking simvastatin 20 mg daily and by history has taken 80% of daily evening doses for the 6 weeks prior to Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Subject must be &gt;=18 years and &lt;=75 years of age. Subjects must have maintained a cholesterol lowering diet and exercise program for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 2) and be willing to continue the same diet and exercise program during the study. Subjects must have liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) &lt;50% above the upper limit of normal, with no active liver disease, and creatinine kinase (CK)&lt;50% above the upper limit of normal at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Clinical laboratory tests (complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistries, urinalysis) must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Subjects must report a stable weight history for at least 4 weeks prior to entry into study at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Women receiving hormonal therapy, including hormone replacement, any estrogen antagonist/agonist, or oral contraceptives, must have been maintained on a stable dose and regimen for at least 8 weeks and be willing to continue the same regimen for the duration of the study. Women of childbearing potential (includes women who are less than 1 year postmenopausal and women who become sexually active) must be using an acceptable method of birth control (e.g., hormonal contraceptive, medicallyprescribed intrauterine device (IUD), condom in combination with spermicide) or be surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation). Subjects must be free of any clinically significant diseases other than diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would interfere with study evaluations. Subjects must understand and be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and must agree to remain on their cholesterollowering diet and their exercise regimen for the duration of the study Subjects must demonstrate their willingness to participate in the study and comply with its procedures by signing a written informed consent. Subjects whose body mass index (BMI = weight[kg]/height[m]**2) is &gt;=35 kg/m**2 at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Subjects who consume &gt;14 alcoholic drinks per week. (A drink is: a can of beer, glass of wine, or single measure of spirits). Any condition or situation which, in the opinion of the investigator, might pose a risk to the subject or interfere with participation in the study. Women who are pregnant or nursing. Congestive heart failure defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) as Class III or IV. Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia. Myocardial infarction, acute coronary insufficiency, coronary artery bypass surgery, or angioplasty within 3 months of Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Unstable or severe peripheral artery disease within 3 months of Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Newly diagnosed or currently unstable angina pectoris. Uncontrolled hypertension (treated or untreated) with systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic &gt;100 mmHg at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Uncontrolled endocrine or metabolic disease known to influence serum lipids or lipoproteins, i.e., secondary causes of hyperlipidemia, such as secondary hypercholesterolemia due to hypothyroidism (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] above upper limit of normal) at Visit 3. Subjects with a history of hypothyroidism who are on a stable therapy of thyroid hormone replacement for at least 6 weeks are eligible for enrollment if TSH levels are within normal limits at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Impaired renal function (creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL) or nephrotic syndrome at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Disorders of the hematologic, digestive, or central nervous systems including cerebrovascular disease and degenerative disease that would limit study evaluation or participation. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Cancer within the past 5 years (except for successfully treated basal and squamous cell carcinomas). History of mental instability, drug/alcohol abuse within the past 5 years, or major psychiatric illness not adequately controlled and stable on pharmacotherapy. Subjects who have not observed the designated washout period for any of the prohibited medications. Subjects currently consuming large amounts of grapefruit juice (&gt;1 liter/day). Oral corticosteroids, unless used as replacement therapy for pituitary/adrenal disease and the subject is on a stable regimen for at lest 6 weeks prior to Visit 3 (Baseline Visit). Subjects who are currently using cardiovascular medication (e.g., antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic) and have not been on a stable regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to Visit 3 (Baseline Visit) and it is expected to change during the study. Subjects who are currently using psyllium, other fiberbased laxatives, and/or any other overthecounter (OTC) therapy known to affect serum lipid levels (phytosterol margarine), and have not been on a stable regimen for at least 5 weeks prior to study entry Visit 3 (Baseline Visit) and who do not agree to remain on this regimen throughout the study.</criteria>
