	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn whether apixaban can prevent the blood clots in the leg (deep vein thrombosis) and lung (pulmonary embolism) that sometimes occur after hip replacement surgery and to learn how apixaban compares with enoxaparin in preventing these clots. The safety of apixaban will also be studied</brief_summary>
