	<detailed_description>The PDT/Lucentis trial will be a Phase IV comparative trial comparing the use of combination therapy with ITV ranibizumab and verteporfin PDT to ITV ranibizumab alone in patients with exudative AMD. Patients will be randomized to one of three groups. All patients will receive three consecutive monthly treatments with ITV ranibizumab. Patients randomized to group I will receive only ITV ranibizumab. Patients randomized to group II will also receive one treatment with reduced fluence (20% fluence) verteporfin PDT at day 0. Patients randomized to group III will also receive one treatment with reduced fluence (40% fluence) vPDT. All patients will also be evaluated for possible retreatment with ranibizumab according to established criteria. Thirty patients (ten per group) will be recruited from one U.S. sites in a 6-month period. Randomization will occur at the time of entry into the study. Follow-up will continue until month 12 (from day 0) in all subjects.</detailed_description>

Concurrent disease in the study eye that could compromise visual acuity or require medical or surgical intervention during the study period Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule in the study eye Previous violation of the posterior capsule is also excluded unless it occurred as a result of YAG laser posterior capsulotomy in association with prior, posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation History of idiopathic or autoimmune uveitis in either eye Significant structural damage to the center of the macula in the study eye likely to preclude improvement in visual acuity following the resolution of macular edema, including atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, subretinal fibrosis, laser scar(s) Vitreomacular traction or epiretinal membrane in the study eye evident biomicroscopically or by OCT Ocular inflammation (including trace or above) in the study eye Uncontrolled glaucoma (defined as intraocular pressure ≥30 mm Hg despite treatment with anti medications) or previous filtration surgery in the study eye Infectious blepharitis, keratitis, scleritis, or conjunctivitis (in either eye) or current treatment for serious systemic infection Spherical equivalent of the refractive error in the study eye of more than 8 diopters myopia (For patients who have had refractive or cataract surgery in the study eye, preoperative spherical equivalent refractive error of more than 8 diopters myopia is not allowed) Systemic Conditions Uncontrolled Blood pressure exceeding diastolic pressure of 100 mm Hg (sitting) during the screening period Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Renal failure requiring dialysis or renal transplant Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception Previous participation in other studies of investigational drugs (excluding vitamins and minerals) within 3 months preceding Day 0 History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or other findings giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use an investigational drug, might affect interpretation of the results of the study, or render the subject at high risk from treatment complications INR ≥ 3.0 (e.g. due to current treatment with warfarin). The use of aspirin is not an exclusion.
