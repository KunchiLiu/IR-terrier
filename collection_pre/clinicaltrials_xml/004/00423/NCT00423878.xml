	<brief_title>Comparison of Antipsychotics for Metabolic Problems in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic abnormalities associated with cardiovascular morbidity and premature mortality are more common in patients with schizophrenia than in matched controls. Although there is some evidence that patients with schizophrenia have intrinsic abnormalities in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, some antipsychotics (i.e., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone) are associated with increased rates of metabolic abnormalities that predispose patients to cardiovascular disease. This is an investigator-initiated clinical trial that will be conducted at 30 research sites that are a part of the NIMH Schizophrenia Trials Network. The aims of the study are to (1) determine the relative effects of switching to aripiprazole, versus continued treatment with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone, on metabolic parameters associated with cardiovascular disease, and (2) to determine the effects of switching to aripiprazole versus continued treatment with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone on the clinical stability of schizophrenic illness. This study design is a multi-site, single-blind (rater) randomized controlled trial of 300 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder comparing treatment with the following medications: olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole. The study will enroll patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder for whom a medication change may be indicated because of an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in spite of adequate control of symptoms on their current antipsychotic medication. Patients who are taking olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone and who have a body-mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 27 and non-HDL cholesterol greater than or equal to 130 mg/dl will be eligible (if non-HDL is between 130-139mg/dL, LDL cholesterol must be greater than 100mg/dL). All treatments will be open label. Raters will be blinded to treatment assignment. Patients will be followed for up to 6 months.</detailed_description>
