	<brief_title>Anti-Restenosis After AMI by Erythropoietin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stents coated with sirolimus or paclitaxel have been shown to significantly reduce restenosis in selected coronary lesions. However, the potential risk of late stent thrombosis forces prolonged treatment of dual anti-platelet regimen to all the patients after implantation of drug eluting stents. Patients with acute myocardial infarction may have uncertain clinical characteristics, such as occult bleeding focus or further need for surgical procedures. Thus, bare metal stent is considerably alternative for primary PCI after AMI and there remain an appreciable number of patients at risk for restenosis. Use of systemic pharmacological therapy to inhibit coronary stent restenosis of bare metal stent has been largely unsuccessful. We have reported that erythropoietin could enhance reendothelialization leading to inhibition of in-stent restenosis by directly protecting endothelial apoptosis and mobilizing endothelial progenitors. The EPOC-AMI study is designed to assess the safety and the efficacy of systemic administration of erythropoietin aiming inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia after stent implantation in the patients with acute myocardial infarction.</detailed_description>
