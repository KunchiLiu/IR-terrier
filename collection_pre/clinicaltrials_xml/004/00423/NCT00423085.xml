	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate the 5cm^2 and 10cm^2 doses of rivastigmine transdermal patch in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (MMSE [Mini Mental State Examination] 10-20). A 52-week extension phase evaluated the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment by rivastigmine transdermal patch in patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to one of the 3 treatment arms (placebo, rivastigmine 5 cm^2 and rivastigmine 10 cm^2) in a ratio of 1:1:1. During the Double-blind treatment phase, patients entered a 16-week Titration Period followed by an 8-week Maintenance Period. During the open-label extension phase, all patients started treatment with a 2.5 cm^2 patch and the dose was increased to 10 cm^2 over a 16-week titration period, followed by a maintenance period of 36 weeks.</detailed_description>
