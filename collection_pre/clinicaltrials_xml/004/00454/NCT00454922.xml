	<brief_summary>Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Non-adherence to glaucoma medication, which may result in loss of vision, is known to be prevalent. Available information regarding adherence to prescribed medical therapy suggests that some apparent treatment failures may actually be due to non-adherence. The investigators' specific aim is to conduct a study that will examine the effect of a glaucoma educator intervention on adherence to topical glaucoma therapy. The investigators' hypothesis is that patient education and counseling delivered by a trained glaucoma educator, through both planned visits and telephone contacts, will increase adherence to topical glaucoma therapy.</brief_summary>
