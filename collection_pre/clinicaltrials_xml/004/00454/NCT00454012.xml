	<brief_title>Use of Intrapartum Biophysical Profile When Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring is Non-reassuring in Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When you are in labor, the heart beat of your fetus is monitored continuously. The normal pattern is reactive and suggests that the fetus is doing well. When the pattern is different from reactive, it is difficult to say if the fetus is doing well or not. Previous investigators have shown that even with the most worrisome fetal heart rate pattern, only 2/1000 cases would require immediate delivery. Currently, we use invasive procedures like taking a drop of blood from fetal head to further assess how the fetus is doing or just proceed with the fastest way of delivery (which could increase the risk associated with surgery). In this research project we want to figure out whether ultrasound (a non-invasive method) can be used to assess how the fetus is doing during labor.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Spontaneous or induced labor Gestational ages between 35 42 weeks Singleton pregnancy Intrapartum nonreassuring or uninterpretable FHR tracing defined as any tracing that the Labor and Delivery obstetrician is uncomfortable about or feels does not absolutely provide fetal reassurance. Inclusive FHR patterns will be repetitive late decelerations, recurrent moderate to severe variable decelerations, reduced long or shortterm variability, prolonged bradycardia (&lt;120/min) that resolves, persistent fetal tachycardia (&gt;160/min for &gt;60 min,) or any other FHR patterns necessitating further fetal well being evaluation (like scalp pH or scalp stimulation). Multiple gestation Gestational age &lt; 35 weeks Patient denial to undergo ultrasound examination during labor Abnormal FHR tracing requiring stat delivery</criteria>
