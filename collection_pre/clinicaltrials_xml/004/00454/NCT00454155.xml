	<brief_title>Study of Opebacan in Patients Undergoing Myeloablative Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IV infusion of opebacan to replace endogenous BPI during the peritransplant period will result in the reduction of LPS-induced inflammatory sequelae, in particular aGvHD, in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. The rationale for using opebacan in patients undergoing myeloablative regimens and HSCT is based on the following: Endotoxemia has been demonstrated to play a central pathophysiologic role as a trigger of aGvHD in animal models. Endotoxemia following HSCT is associated with inflammatory conditions (such as inflammatory cytokine release) that have been demonstrated in humans to be associated with organ damage and increased morbidity and mortality. Endotoxemia and LBP elevation have been demonstrated in humans undergoing ablative HSCT. Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia results in a deficiency of endogenous BPI levels. The timing of the endotoxemic insult is predictable (i.e., subsequent to myeloablative chemotherapy and radiotherapy). The return to normal neutrophil levels is not immediate and takes one week to several weeks. Well established laboratory techniques for surrogate markers related to LPS presence and its activities can facilitate the evaluation of molecules designed to inhibit or antagonize LPS and its effects.
