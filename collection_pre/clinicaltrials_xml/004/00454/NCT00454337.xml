	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerance of the Switch From Enfuvirtine to Raltegravir in Antiretroviral Therapy Regimen in HIV Patients With Undetectable Viral Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients who have failed under the three main classes of antiretroviral agents (NRTI, NNRTI and PI) and in whom the control of viral replication in the plasma has ultimately been achieved with enfuvirtide, the aim is to sustain this virological success for as long as possible to thus enable satisfactory immune reconstitution, avoid further accumulation of viral mutations conferring resistance to the drugs and protect the patient from the risk of opportunistic disease and death. Indeed, enfuvirtide is the lead compound in the new class of antiretroviral drugs which inhibit the fusion of HIV-1 virus with its target cell. Its in vivo efficacy was demonstrated during the pivotal studies TORO 1 and 2. Despite its efficacy, maintaining long-term treatment with enfuvirtide is nonetheless difficult for patients because of the constraints related to twice-daily subcutaneous parenteral injections. Furthermore, these subcutaneous injections are associated with inflammatory reactions at the injection site in 98 per cent of patients, without any reduction in frequency or severity over time. It is thus critical for patients who are well controlled by enfuvirtide to be able to simplify their treatment by replacing enfuvirtide with another active compound taken by mouth, which would enable maintenance of the virological response and acceptable safety in patients who have usually failed under the three main classes of antiretroviral drugs. A new antiviral compound, viral integrase inhibitor called raltegravir, could be proposed instead of enfuvirtide.</detailed_description>
