	<brief_title>Study of Collagen Membrane in Guided Bone Regeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Guided bone regeneration is a procedure used in dentistry for the reconstruction of osseous defects around teeth, dental implants, and prior to implant placement. The main function of the membrane barrier in GBR is to mechanically prevent the undesirable penetration of epithelial cells and fibroblasts to the bone defect area, creating a secluded space where bone regeneration may occur. Resorbable and non-resorbable membranes have been used in GBR. While non resorbable membranes require another surgical procedure for removing the membrane after the healing period, the resorbable membranes have the advantage of transmitting tissue fluids, excluding undesirable cell penetration and sparing an additional unwanted surgical procedure. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Hypro-Sorb® F, a bilayered bioabsorbable membrane in inducing bone regeneration in different dental procedures requiring GBR.</detailed_description>
