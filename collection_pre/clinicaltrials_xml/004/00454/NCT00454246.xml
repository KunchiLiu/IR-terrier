	<brief_summary>This study will assess the efficacy and safety of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera) in the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in patients who have previously received treatment with epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa, and who are transitioning from chronic kidney disease stage 4 through dialysis. Patients will be randomized either to receive Mircera or to remain on their existing therapy; the initial monthly dose of subcutaneous (sc) Mircera (120-360 micrograms) will be based on the average weekly dose of epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa administered in the week preceding the switch to Mircera. At the initiation of dialysis, patients in the Mircera group will receive monthly intravenous (iv) Mircera at a starting dose based on their previous (sc) dose, and those in the control group will receive weekly (iv) epoetin alfa. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.</brief_summary>
