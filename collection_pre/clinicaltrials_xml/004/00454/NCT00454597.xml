	<detailed_description>To determine the Blood levels of glucose, curve of tolerance to the glucose, hemoglobin glycosylated, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, leptin and Adiponectin in patients with Obesity Morbid and that will be put under umbilical surgery and cholecystectomy opened. To put under them umbilical surgery or Cholecystectomy open with and without omentectomy To compare the Blood levels of of glucose, curve of tolerance wing glucose, hemoglobin glycosylated, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, leptin and Adiponectin before and after the procedure</detailed_description>
