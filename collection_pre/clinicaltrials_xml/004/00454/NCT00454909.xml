	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of Meningococcal Vaccine GSK134612 vs. Menactra® in Healthy Adolescent/Adults Aged 10-25 Years.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects 11-25 years of age will be randomized to receive either the meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 or Menactra®. An additional non-randomized group of subjects aged 10 years (&lt; 11 years of age) will be enrolled to receive meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 only (At the time the study begun, Menactra® was only licensed in the United States for individuals above 11 years of age and therefore could not be used as a control vaccine in subjects less than 11 years old). This study will be single-blind for the subjects 11 to 25 years of age and open for the subjects 10 to &lt; 11 years of age.</detailed_description>

History of meningococcal disease due to serogroup A, C, W135, or Y. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition (congenital or secondary), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing is required). A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, until the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Hypersensitivity to latex. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.
