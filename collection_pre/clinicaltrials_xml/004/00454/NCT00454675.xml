	<brief_title>Pulmonary Function Changes in 10 Pack Year Smokers With Chronic Bronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incident of COPD is dramatically increasing while other chronic disease states are decreasing in the US population. Smoking cigarettes is the leading risk factor for COPD. Smokers with chronic bronchitis may show early or late changes of COPD on pulmonary function tests. It is imperative that we define this patient population to determine whether early intervention will alter pulmonary function over the years.</detailed_description>
