	<brief_title>Correlation Between SV2A Expression in Tumour Tissue and Efficacy of Levetiracetam in Glioma Patients With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levetiracetam is a relatively novel anti-epileptic drug (AED), which has proven to be effective and well tolerated in many glioma patients with otherwise pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Moreover, levetiracetam has neither enzyme-inducing nor enzyme-inhibiting properties, which makes the drug particularly attractive for brain tumour patients, as they frequently receive chemotherapy and/or corticosteroids. Therefore, levetiracetam is the anti-epileptic drug of choice post-operatively in glioma patients suffering from epilepsy. Unfortunately, even with levetiracetam, a proportion of glioma patients is not free of seizures. It is unclear, however, which glioma patients benefit from levetiracetam treatment. It is suggested that the expression of protein SV2A is correlated with clinical response to levetiracetam. The determination of SV2A expression in brain (tumour) tissue might be used as a predictive tool for response to levetiracetam. Objective of this study: Correlation of SV2A expression in surgically removed tumour and tumour-surrounding tissue of glioma patients suffering from epilepsy with their clinical response to levetiracetam.</detailed_description>
