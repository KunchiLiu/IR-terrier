	<brief_title>Virtual Reality Helmet to Test for Problems With Memory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since many individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) appear to function normally, MCI may often be recognizable through testing in advance of any changes noticed by family members or caregivers. Early and frequent testing can therefore trigger an earlier diagnosis, which may increase the effectiveness of currently available medications used to delay onset of Alzheimer's symptoms. Primary care and geriatric physicians currently lack the necessary tools required for quick and accurate MCI screening in the doctor's office environment. The current industry-standard is a battery of pen &amp; paper neuropsychological tests that require 1.5 hours in a quiet room with a neuropsychologist. Comparison: virtual reality display device compared to the standard neuropsychological evaluation for detecting mild cognitive impairment (problems with memory, concentration, reaction time, etc.).</detailed_description>
