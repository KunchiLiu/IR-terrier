	<brief_summary>Elevated intraocular pressure is widely accepted as a risk factor for glaucoma and controlling the pressure remains the cornerstone of effective treatment. There is evidence that posture can have a significant effect on intraocular pressure fluctuations. Salat (or Salah) refers to the five daily prayers performed by Muslims. The time spent praying in a kneeling or prostrate position may be associated with wide fluctuations in intraocular pressure, potentially sight-threatening for Muslim patients with glaucoma. The researchers seek to investigate the link between traditional daily Muslim prayer postural changes and intraocular pressure changes.</brief_summary>
