Patients may also be included if they have previously been treated with FDAapproved anticholinergic agents for the treatment of OAB such as oxybutynin chloride and are no longer receiving such treatment for a minimum of 14 days immediately preceding entry into the study. These previously treated patients must present at the investigative site on no anticholinergic agents and with the desire to receive treatment for OAB. Previous nondrug treatment of OAB is allowed if it has been established at least 4 weeks prior to study entry and is continued throughout the study. Patients having urgency with or without urge incontinence accompanied by frequency of ≥8 episodes per 24 hours, and/or nocturia, for a period of ≥3 months prior to screening.
