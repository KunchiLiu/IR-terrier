	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a peptide may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, increase the number of white blood cells and platelets found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF may be an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. It is not yet known whether giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF is more effective than giving placebo together with GM-CSF in treating acute myeloid leukemia. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying vaccine therapy and GM-CSF to see how well they work compared with a placebo and GM-CSF in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia in remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy and GM-CSF in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare improvement of overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine and sargramostim (GM-CSF) vs placebo vaccine and GM-CSF. Secondary - Compare improvement of relapse-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare remission duration in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare immune response, as measured by PR1-HLA-A2 tetramer assay, in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age and complete remission (CR) (≥ 18 years of age and in second CR vs ≥ 55 years of age and in first CR), type of acute myeloid leukemia (de novo vs secondary), and cytogenetics (unfavorable vs favorable and intermediate). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC). - Arm II: Patients receive placebo vaccine and GM-CSF SC. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 244 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
