	<brief_summary>To assess the intubation rate in patients affected by severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema treated with CPAP or NPPV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPAP Versus NPPV in ACPE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Although non-invasive ventilation has shown to be an effective treatment for acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (ACPO), literature still lacks of multi-centre randomised prospective studies that compares CPAP with NPPV. Aim of the study was to assess efficacy and safety of CPAP and NPPV in patients with ACPO. Methods 80 patients with ACPO were randomly assigned to receive CPAP or NPPV (40 for each group) through a face mask. Inclusion criteria were: severe dyspnoea, respiratory rate &gt; 30, PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200, muscle fatigue. Main end-points were endotracheal intubation, length of ventilation, hospital length of stay and mortality.</detailed_description>
