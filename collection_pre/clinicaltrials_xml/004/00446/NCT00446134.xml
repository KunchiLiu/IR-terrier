	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to select an optimal dose of taribavirin by comparing the efficacy and safety of 3 taribavirin dose levels, 20, 25, and 30 mg/kg/day, versus ribavirin 800 to 1400 mg/day based on body weight, both administered in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b to therapy-naive patients with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection.</brief_summary>
