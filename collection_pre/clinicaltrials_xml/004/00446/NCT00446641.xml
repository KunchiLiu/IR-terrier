	<brief_summary>This study will recruit 316 ischemic stroke patients taking aspirin. They will be randomly assigned into cilostazol group or placebo group. Every patients will take 200mg of cilostazol a day or placebo for 1 month. The primary outcome variable of this study is rate of biochemical aspirin resistance on the Ultra Rapid Platelet Function Assay-ASA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>[Goal] To reveal the effect and safety of additional cilostazol for overcoming biochemical aspirin resistance. [Trial Design] Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Multicenter Trial [Participants] Ischemic stroke patients taking aspirin [Methods] - Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Multicenter Trial - Investigational product: Cilostazol 200mg (100mg twice per day) - Concomitant medication: Aspirin 100 mg per day - Medication Duration: 1 month [Outcome Variables] Primary Outcome Variable: • the proportion of patients with aspirin reaction units (ARUs) values ≥550 on the Ultra Rapid Platelet Function Assay-ASA Secondary outcome variables: - the proportion of patients with ARUs values ≥500 on the Ultra Rapid Platelet Function Assay-ASA - ARUs values - Bleeding time (BT) - Fatal or major bleeding complications - Any bleeding complications</detailed_description>
