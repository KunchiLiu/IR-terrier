	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to describe metabolic changes in the first 16 weeks of anti-psychotic treatment in previously drug-na√Øve patients with psychosis. We hypothesize that in drug-naive patients, greater insulin resistance prior to treatment predicts a disproportionately greater increase in insulin resistance with olanzapine treatment.</brief_summary>
