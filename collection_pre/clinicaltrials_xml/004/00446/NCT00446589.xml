	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis patients with low bone density (total hip T-score &lt;-2.5) will be assigned to receive teriparatide (those with histologic confirmation of adynamic bone disease) or ibandronate (subjects with increased osteoclast number on bone biopsy). Follow-up period: one year. A second bone biopsy at the end of the study.</brief_summary>
