	<brief_title>A Study of Oral AT2101 in Treatment-naive Patients With Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from a deficiency in the key enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). The enzyme deficiency is caused by genetic mutations, which can result in the production of misfolded GCase. AT2101 is designed to act as a pharmacological chaperone by selectively binding to the misfolded GCase and helping it fold correctly, which may restore GCase activity. This study is being conducted to test the safety of AT2101 in patients with type I Gaucher disease who have not already received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT), or who have not received ERT or SRT in the 12 months before screening. This study will also evaluate the effects of AT2101 on parameters that are commonly abnormal in Gaucher disease. The study will involve 9 visits over 29 weeks.</detailed_description>
