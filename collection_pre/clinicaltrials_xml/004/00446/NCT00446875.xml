	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine the analgesic properties of oral sucrose during routine immunizations. Hypothesis: Oral sucrose solution and maternal contact will significantly decrease the objective measures of acute pain during routine immunizations. Acute pain during early life may alter infant pain responses, cognitive development and behavioral outcomes. Infants respond to immunizations with significant pain and distress. This study will examine the analgesic properties of oral sucrose and maternal holding in postnatal infants. Comparison: Administration of oral sucrose, sterile water and maternal contact 2 minutes before routine immunizations.</detailed_description>
