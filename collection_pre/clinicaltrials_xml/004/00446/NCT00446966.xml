	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine if omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce atrial fibrillation and other outcomes after cardiac surgery. In this placebo-controlled trial, patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery with or without valve repair will be treated with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids perioperatively. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery, 2. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, administered in the perioperative period for cardiac surgery, decreases postoperative complication rates, and 3. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids decrease intensive care unit and hospital length-of-stay.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fish Oil for Reduction of Atrial Fibrillation After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation is the most common complication after bypass surgery. It is a significant burden to the healthcare system because it is associated with increased hospital costs and a longer hospital length-of-stay. Atrial fibrillation occurring after bypass surgery is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Atrial fibrillation is also associated with an increased risk for strokes, use of potentially harmful drugs, and the need for pacemaker therapy. This study is for patients who are undergoing elective bypass surgery. Patients who meet study criteria and who consent to participate in the study will be randomized to treatment with omega-3 fatty acids or matching corn oil placebo, prior to surgery. After surgery, treatment will continue until the primary endpoint, atrial fibrillation, is reached, or 14 days, whichever is first.</detailed_description>
