	<brief_summary>Considering synergism between docetaxel (D), capecitabine (X), and oxaliplatin (O) and favourable toxicity profile of oxaliplatin over cisplatin, it is to be expected that combination of docetaxel, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin (DXO) will be more effective than other regimens and feasible in advanced gastric cancer. DXO regimen can be also easily administered on out-patient setting. However, so far, DXO combination has not been tried in advanced gastric cancer. The investigators will determine maximum tolerated dose of DXO regimen in this phase I study.</brief_summary>
