	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, open-label, multicenter, pilot study of the safety and efficacy of two Docetaxel-based regimens plus bevacizumab for the adjuvant treatment of participants with node positive or high risk node negative breast cancer. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the cardiac safety, and the secondary objectives were to evaluate safety and toxicity of participants treated with bevacizumab ± trastuzumab administered with 2 different docetaxel-based combination regimens. This study was originally designed to also evaluate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS); however, based on a protocol amendment, follow-up was shortened from 10 years to 2 years, and the efficacy endpoints of disease free survival and overall survival were deleted from the protocol.</brief_summary>
