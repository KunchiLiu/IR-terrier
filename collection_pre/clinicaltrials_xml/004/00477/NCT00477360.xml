	<brief_title>Humeral Resurfacing Hemiarthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resurfacing arthroplasty is gaining popularity for the reconstruction of advanced shoulder arthritis. New generation re-surfacing prostheses are engineered to anatomically restore a smooth articulating surface to the humeral head, while preserving bone stock, and potentially minimizing the risk for diaphyseal fracture. The results for shoulder resurfacing prostheses have largely been reported in retrospective reviews and have been very favorable. The purpose of this multi-centered, prospective study will be to determine the extent to which patient self-assessed outcomes (American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES) Score) following humeral resurfacing improve compared to pre-operative ASES scores.</detailed_description>
