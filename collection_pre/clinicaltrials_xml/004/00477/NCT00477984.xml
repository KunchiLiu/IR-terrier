	<brief_summary>Previous studies have shown that alcohol significantly impairs driving performance. Acute alcohol administration also has a detrimental effect on secondary task performance during dual-tasks. The present study will investigate the effects of five different dosages of ethanol (0,0.2, 0,5, 0,8 and 1,0 % BAC) on performance in a driving simulator. Steering performance and brain activity will be recorded in both single- and dual-task conditions.</brief_summary>
