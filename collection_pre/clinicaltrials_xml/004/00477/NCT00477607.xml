	<brief_title>Alpha-Lipoic Acid in Preventing Hearing Loss in Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment With Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary Determine the ability of alpha-lipoic acid supplementation to prevent or reduce the incidence and severity of hearing loss in cancer patients undergoing treatment with cisplatin. Secondary Determine if this drug improves the oxidative state, as measured by a malondialdehyde measurement of oxidative stress, thereby protecting the patient against ototoxic-induced hearing loss. OUTLINE: This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by cancer stage and institution. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral alpha-lipoic acid supplement once a day beginning 1 week before the start of cisplatin treatment and continuing for up to 1 month after the completion of cisplatin. During cisplatin treatment, patients discontinue supplement 1 day prior to the cisplatin treatment and resume daily supplements 2 days post treatment. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo supplement once a day beginning 1 week before the start of cisplatin and continuing for up to 1 month after the completion of cisplatin. During cisplatin treatment, patients discontinue supplement 1 day prior to the cisplatin treatment and resume daily supplements 2 days post treatment. Hearing and ototoxicity are assessed at baseline, on each day of chemotherapy, and at 1 and 3 months post chemotherapy. Blood samples are collected periodically to measure malondialdehyde and alpha-lipoic acid levels. After completion of treatment with cisplatin, patients are followed for 3 months.</detailed_description>
