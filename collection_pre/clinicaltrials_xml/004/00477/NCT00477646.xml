	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Women may stay up-to-date with cancer screening if a health professional helps them overcome barriers to screening, including helping them to schedule cancer screening appointments. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the use of health professional-tailored telephone support compared with usual care from their personal doctor to help women overcome barriers to screening for colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Helping Women Stay Up-To-Date With Cancer Screening By Using a Prevention Care Manager or Usual Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Develop and evaluate an enhanced telephone support intervention (Prevention Care Manager [PCM]) to promote colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer screening more widely among women enrolled in a Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MMCO). - Explore the impact of patient, Community/Migrant Health Center (C/MHC), and MMCO characteristics on cancer screening status and the impact of the intervention. - Evaluate the impact of the enhanced PCM intervention upon colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening rates. Secondary - Compare the status of women who are up-to-date (UTD) on CRC screening versus the UTD status of cervical cancer and breast cancer screening. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. The study is conducted in 2 parts. - Part 1 (barrier interview and pilot testing): Patients are stratified according to primary language and whether or not they have had an outpatient visit in the past year. - Barrier interview: Patients undergo a 15-30 minute interview to determine barriers they face preventing them from receiving recommended cancer screenings and healthcare, as well as facilitators which have encouraged them to be screened. - Pilot testing: Patients from the barrier interviews and other eligible Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MMCO) patients receive scripted telephone calls from a Prevention Care Manager to assist them in getting up-to-date on their cancer screening tests over 3 months. - Part 2 (randomized control trial): Patients are stratified according to treatment center (Community/Migrant health center vs Diagnostic and Treatment Center) and age. Patient are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. - Arm I (Prevention Care Manager): Patients are stratified according to the number of tests for which they are up-to-date at baseline. Patients receive reminder letters encouraging them to contact their primary care provider for colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening and 3 to 4 telephone support calls to help them become up to date for colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening. - Arm II (usual care): Patients receive usual care according to their primary care physician. In both arms, patients are followed for 18 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,600 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
