	<brief_title>A Study of Cetuximab(Erbitux) With Cisplatin and Capecitabine(Xeloda)as 1st Line Treatment in the Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer remains one of the major causes of cancer deaths around the world, especially in Asia. Previous study of ML17032 has proved that XP(capecitabine plus cisplatin)is effective in advanced gastric cancer, with the overall response rate of 41%, the median PFS of 5.6 month. Recently, the EGFR monoclonal antibody of cetuximab has shown to be successful in treating advanced colorectal cancer with or without chemotherapy. Since EGFR also express in gastric cancer, A single arm, open, multicenter phase II study of cetuximab in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine as first line treatment in patient with advanced gastric cancer.If applicable, the value of mutations in k-ras, b-raf, P53, and EGFR copy number to predict the clinical response to cetuximab in advanced gastric cancer patients will also be accessed.Tumor tissue from study patients will be checked for k-ras, b-raf, and P53 mutation by sequencing and for EGFR copy number by chromogenic in situ hybridization. DNA will be extracted from paraffin-embedded samples.</detailed_description>
