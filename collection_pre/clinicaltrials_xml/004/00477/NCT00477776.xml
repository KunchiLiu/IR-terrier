	<brief_summary>Early use of oral maxalon can hasten and improve the establishment of breastfeeding in diabetic mothers after preterm and term deliveries. Maxolon promotes breastfeeding by working on the central nervous system which increases the milk producing hormone, prolactin which in turn helps to increase the milk supply for breastfeeding. Successful early breastfeeding establishment is important for continued breastfeeding.</brief_summary>
