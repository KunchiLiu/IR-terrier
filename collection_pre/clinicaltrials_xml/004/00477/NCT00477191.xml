	<brief_summary>People with psoriasis have significantly higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart failure and high blood pressure than the general public. The purpose of this study is to determine how substances produced in the fat (inflammatory markers) relate to the risk of heart disease in people with the metabolic syndrome and psoriasis. People with metabolic syndrome have insulin resistance, increased waist size, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>People with psoriasis have significantly higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart failure and high blood pressure than the general public. The purpose of this study is to determine how substances produced in the fat (inflammatory markers) relate to the risk of heart disease in people with the metabolic syndrome and psoriasis. People with metabolic syndrome have insulin resistance, increased waist size, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Insulin resistance means that the body does not respond well to the insulin in your blood. Therefore, both blood levels of insulin and glucose (sugar) are high. This causes inflammation (irritation) in the body. Inflammation can cause an unhealthy response in your body and blood vessels, and can lead to blockages in the heart and other vessels. TNF-alpha is a substance made by fat and inflammatory cells that helps cause inflammatory reactions. TNF-alpha is thought to be important in causing psoriasis. The drug Etanercept blocks TNF-alpha's actions, and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of psoriasis. We think that Etanercept may also reduce the inflammation associated with metabolic syndrome and decrease the risk of heart disease. All subjects in this study will receive etanercept.</detailed_description>
