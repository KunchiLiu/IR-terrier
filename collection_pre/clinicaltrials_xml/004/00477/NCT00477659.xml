	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to identify neural correlates of cognitive improvement after three months of donepezil HCl in subjects with mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD), measuring the Functional Hippocampus Connectivity Index (HCI) and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) Perfusion in the Medial Temporal Lobe network. The hypothesis is that donepezil HCl will improve MTL connectivity and CBF Perfusion in the MTL-projected target regions, which will significantly correlate with cognitive improvement in mild AD subjects.</brief_summary>
