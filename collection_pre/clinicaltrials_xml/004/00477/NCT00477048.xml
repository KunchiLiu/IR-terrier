	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of SQV in Patients Who Have Chronic IDV Nephrotoxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: To determine whether a switch to a SQV can cause improvements in renal function in patients with chronic IDV associated nephrotoxicity without improvement after IDV dose reduction. Secondary objective: 1. To describe the pathophysiology of chronic IDV associated renal impairment through renal biopsies at baseline and week 48 2. To describe the pathophysiology of chronic IDV associated renal impairment through renal tubular function at baseline and week 48 3. To determine whether a switch to an SQV can cause improvements in renal pathophysiology in patients with chronic IDV associated nephrotoxicity through renal biopsies performed at baseline and at weeks 48 4. To determine whether a switch to an SQV results in improvements in hypertension, lipid profiles and cutaneous side effects</detailed_description>
