	<brief_summary>Spondyloarthropathies (SpA) are often diagnosed with a considerable delay (often 8-10 years from symptom onset), because the available clinical, biochemical and radiological methods are not sufficiently sensitive. TNF-a antagonists have recently been introduced for treatment of SpA, and current data indicate a higher efficacy than previously available therapies. The improved treatment options have increased the need for improved methods for diagnosis, monitoring and prognostication of these diseases, so that the efficient therapies can be initiated at the optimal time point and monitored optimally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a number of biomarkers are promising, but not yet sufficiently studied, methods for this.</brief_summary>
