	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of karenitecin versus topotecan in patients with platinum/taxane-resistant advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Additionally, this study will assess the ability of karenitecin to extend the time to disease progression, extend the overall survival time, and reduce the incidence and severity of treatment related hematological toxicities in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
