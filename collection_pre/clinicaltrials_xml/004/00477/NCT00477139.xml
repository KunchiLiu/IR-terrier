	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluating the Immunologic Status of Patients With HER2+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study to gather preliminary data on the baseline immunologic status of patients with HER-2(+) breast cancer and to establish an immune monitoring laboratory for future clinical trial. We will ask up to 10 patients with HER-2(+) breast cancer in stable condition and in reasonable health to participate in this study. The study will establish an immune monitoring for correlative studies done in patients with HER-2(+) breast cancer. The immunologic tests that will be done are ELISpot, lymphocyte proliferation, intracellular cytokine staining, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, and ELISA.</detailed_description>
