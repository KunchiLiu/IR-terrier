	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and ease of use of subcutaneous (SC) rehydration using HYLENEX-augmented SC infusion of fluids and electrolytes for the rehydration of pediatric patients with mild to moderate dehydration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Subcutaneous Rehydration With Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase for Infants and Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric patients (2 months to 10 years of age), presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mild to moderate dehydration and requiring parenteral rehydration, were treated with HYLENEX-augmented subcutaneous (SC) rehydration. An initial volume of 20 mL/kg of isotonic fluid was to be administered by continuous SC infusion over the first hour, and additional SC rehydration could be continued as clinically indicated. The preferred anatomic site for the SC infusion was the anterior thigh, unless there was an overriding preference for an alternate site. The duration of HYLENEX-augmented SC rehydration was to be a minimum of 1 hour and a maximum of 72 hours. The investigator or designee performed a clinical assessment of the subject's hydration status at baseline and at the end of SC infusion or at discharge from the ED. Other assessments of effectiveness and safety were made directly during the rehydration period and ED stay, and by telephone on Days 3 and 7 after discharge from the ED.</detailed_description>
