	<brief_title>Phase II GM-CSF Plus Mitoxantrone in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of mitoxantrone and GM-CSF on time to progression in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. To date, there are no curative treatments for prostate cancer that has become hormone-refractory. Treatments appropriate for prostate cancer at this stage include docetaxel, which, in combination with prednisone, has recently been shown to lead to a survival benefit, and mitoxantrone, which, to date, has been shown to lead to a more favorable outcome than steroids alone, but without a survival benefit. GM-CSF is a cytokine that is thought to lead to an enhanced antitumor immune response, presumably through induction of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 expression, as well as growth and proliferation of macrophages and dendritic cells. Both preclinical models and Phase II studies have suggested that GM-CSF as a single agent may have antitumor activity in advanced prostate cancer. To date, the use of GM-CSF for the treatment of prostate cancer has been explored in different contexts, and, more specifically, as a single agent in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) and hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), in combination with thalidomide in hormone-naïve prostate cancer and androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer with ketoconazole in AIPC, and finally with CTLA4 in HRPC. For patients with HRPC who have failed first line chemotherapy, few, non-curative options are available, one of them involving the use of mitoxantrone. On the basis of GM-CSF's mechanism of action, the addition of GM-CSF to a mitoxantrone-containing regimen may lead to enhanced antitumor activity in patients with HRPC.</detailed_description>
