	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to establish the safety of ezetimibe/simvastatin and simvastatin in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes and to determine the amount of decrease in LDL-cholesterol.The study hypothesizes that simvastatin and ezetimibe/simvastatin will be safe in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes and will lower LDL-cholesterol at 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Zocor (Simvastatin) and Vytorin (Ezetimibe/Simvastatin) in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and since atherosclerosis begins in childhood, data to inform clinicians as to appropriate dyslipidemia treatment in this high-risk population are of great public health importance. In this trial of lipid-lowering medications (Zocor [simvastatin], a statin, compared to Vytorin [ezetimibe/simvastatin], a combination of a statin and Zetia, a medication that blocks cholesterol absorption) will be performed in patients ages 12-18 years with LDL â‰¥ 130 mg/dl, consistent with current ADA guidelines. The study hypothesizes that Zocor and Vytorin will be safe in adolescents with T1DM and will lower LDL-cholesterol at 6 months compared to baseline. In a two-arm design, Vytorin will lower LDL-c more than monotherapy with Zocor.</detailed_description>
