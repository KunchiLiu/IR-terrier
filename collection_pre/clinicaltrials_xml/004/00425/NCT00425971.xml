	<brief_summary>BMEC-1217B is an abbreviated version of an old Chinese formulation. The ratio of each component was adopted by the sponsor following the observation that BMEC-1217B prepared from this ratio resulted in best pharmacological profile and in vitro bioactivities. BMEC-1217B was studied for the pharmacological activity on the release of cysteinyl leukotrienes, IL-4 and TNF-alpha in vitro and the airway hyperreactivity. The result indicated that BMEC-1217B can inhibit the synthesis of several key pro-inflammatory mediators involved in the pathophysiology of allergic asthma and can also improve lung function in a mouse model of allergic asthma. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing dose of BMEC-1217B when administered orally in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
