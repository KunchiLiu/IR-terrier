	<brief_summary>The study is designed to investigate the effect of 18 weeks treatment with Sitagliptin 100 mg/day on the insulin secretion capacity of beta cells. Patients who meet the study enrollment criteria will undergo 2 experiments (see description below); a graded hyperglycemic technique and a meal test, prior to randomization and after a 12-wk double-blind study period. The treatment effect will shed light on the magnitude of the beta cell capacity to increase its mass and function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design and duration: This will be an Israeli three center study. Study drug: Sitagliptin 100 mg. The study will be a double blind, randomized two arms parallel group study. The duration of the study will be up to 18 weeks (with 8 visits) for each patient. This will include: a screening period of up to 4 weeks (Visit 1 to visit 2), a 2 week single blind, placebo run-in period (visit 2 to visit 4), and a 12 week placebo controlled, double blind treatment period (visit 4 to visit 8). Patients with T2DM who have not been treated with an AHA, or who are on AHA monotherapy or low dose oral combination therapy (low dose defined as ≤50% of the maximum labeled dose of each agent), may participate if they meet all enrollment criteria. Patients eligible to be randomized will have a HbA1c ³6.5% and £10% . Patients who meet the study enrollment criteria will undergo 2 experiments (see description below); a graded hyperglycemic technique and a meal test, prior to randomization (Visit 3 and 4). These experiments will be will be completed after a 12-hour overnight fast. The 2 experiments will be repeated at the conclusion of the 12-wk double-blind study period (Visits 7 and 8). Efficacy measurements: (1) Glycemic control : FPG, HbA1c, β-cell Function Parameters(Φs, Φd, Φb, Φ, Φob, T), Insulin Secretion Rate (determined from C-peptide deconvolution), 1st and 2nd phase insulin secretion, Insulin response after arginine injection, Insulin sensitivity index, glucose, insulin, C-peptide total and incremental area under the curve.</detailed_description>
