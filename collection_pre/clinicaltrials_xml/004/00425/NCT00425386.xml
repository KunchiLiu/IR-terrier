	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sunitinib and erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cell by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sunitinib together with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the best dose of erlotinib when given together with sunitinib and to see how well they work in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib and Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib hydrochloride when administered with sunitinib malate in patients with unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. - Determine the 8-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Determine the safety of sunitinib malate and erlotinib hydrochloride in these patients. - Determine the duration of response in these patients. - Determine the proportion of patients whose best overall response is complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the maximum percent reduction in tumor measurement in patients treated with this regimen. - Collect blood and tissue from these patients for future correlative studies. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride. Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-42. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 33% of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, patients are treated with erlotinib hydrochloride at the MTD and sunitinib malate. Patients undergo blood and tumor specimen collection periodically during study for future correlative studies. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 49 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
