Cohort 1 only: Previously received and failed one prior biotherapy, defined as IL2 therapy or interferonalpha (alone or in combination); Karnosky score of &gt; or = 70% 2. Cohort 2 only: No prior therapy except nephrectomy and fall within the Motzer intermediate group with one or two of the risk factors, as defined in teh Study Design section. Has bidimensionally measurable disease Has tumor tissue available for diagnostics (acceptable: biopsy, nephrectomy tissue, fine needle aspirate, or archived tissue that is formalin fixed and paraffin embedded). In cases when a fresh biopsy can be obtained, the biopsy should be divided into two; one half should be formalin fixed, and the other half frozen. Tumor samples must be received at the central laboratory prior to patient regisration. Adequate hematologic data, as follows: 1. ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L 2. Platelet count &gt; 100x 109/L Adequate renal function, as follows: 1. Creatinine &lt; or = 2.2mg/dL Adequate hepatic function, as follows: 1. Alkaline phosphatase &lt; or = 3x ULN 2. AST &lt; or = 3x ULN 3. ALT &lt; or = 3x ULN 4. Total bilirubin &lt; or = 1.5x ULN Brain metastases Cohort 1 only: Hypercalcemia (calcium level outside the upper limit of normal; antihypercalcemic treatment is allowed) Cancer therapy within 30 days of ABXEGF infusion (hormone therapy is allowed; steroid therapy is only allowed if it is replacement therapy) Use of any investigational drug within 30 days of ABXEGF infusion Prior treatment with any antiEGFr agents Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45%, as measured by MUGA Scan Myocardial infarction within one year prior to entering the study Has other cancer that has been active and required treatment within the past 5 years (prior renal cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma in situ are allowed) Pregnant or breast feeding female; male or female of childbearing potential (defined as: post menarche and is biologically capable of becoming pregnant) unwilling to use birth control (as defined in the inclusion criteria) during and for 1 month following treatment Known to be HIV positive History of any chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the Investigator may increase the risks associated with study participation or study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results Allergy to the ingredients of the study medication or to Staphylococcus Protein A</criteria>
