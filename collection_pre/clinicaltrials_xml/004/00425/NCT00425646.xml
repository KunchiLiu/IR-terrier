	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Imatinib mesylate and bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving imatinib mesylate together with bevacizumab as maintenance therapy may stop non-small cell lung cancer from growing or coming back. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving imatinib mesylate together with bevacizumab after first-line chemotherapy and bevacizumab works in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate and Bevacizumab After First-Line Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the clinical efficacy of maintenance therapy comprising imatinib mesylate and bevacizumab after completion of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab, in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. Secondary - Assess the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-21 and bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
