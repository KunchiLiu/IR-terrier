	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of CellCept plus corticosteroids, versus cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids in the induction phase followed by azathioprine in the maintenance phase, in maintaining remission and renal function in patients with lupus nephritis. Patients will be randomized to receive CellCept 1g bid po plus corticosteroids for 24 weeks, followed by CellCept 0.75g bid po plus corticosteroids for the following 24 weeks, or cyclophosphamide 0.5-1.0g/m2 monthly plus corticosteroids for 24 weeks, followed by azathioprine 2mg/kg/day po plus corticosteroids for the following 24 weeks. Response rate will be assessed at the end of the induction phase, and at the end of study. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
