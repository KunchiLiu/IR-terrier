	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether treatment with an extended-release opioid or topical lidocaine is effective in relieving distal symmetric lower extremity burning pain associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). If treatment with topical lidocaine is efficacious, it will have important implications for understanding this chronic pain syndrome, which is widely assumed to be caused by central nervous system pathology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Analgesia With Lidocaine or Extended-release Oxycodone for Neuropathic Pain Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single-center, double-blind, 15-week, 3-period crossover clinical trial. Subjects will complete each of the following 5-week long periods (unless they withdraw from the trial): 1) placebo pills and topical lidocaine patches, 2)extended-release oxycodone pills and placebo(vehicle) patches, and 3)placebo pills and placebo patches. Sixty subjects will be randomized to one of 6 treatment sequences. It is expected that this trial will take approximately 2 years to complete.</detailed_description>
