	<detailed_description>Grass MATA MPL has been developed by Allergy Therapeutics (UK9 Ltd.to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with proven type I hypersensitivity to cross reacting grass pollens causing rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis with or without mild to moderate asthma bronchiale. Grass MATA MPL is produced as a re-formulation of the Allergy Therapeutics product Pollinex Quattro, which has been used in Europe since 1999 on a 'named patient' basis (with approximately 65,000 treatment courses containing grass pollens). Grass MATA MPL contains an extract of the 13 grass pollens. This extract is chemically modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient, an allergoid. Such modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivity is not seen. The modified extract is adsorbed to L-tyrosine as a depot formulation. MPL®, a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell walls of Salmonella minnesota, is also included in the current product formulation. This excipient/adjuvant is included to increase the immunogenic effect of the product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to TH1-like T cell profile. The current formulation is designed to provide a product that will be efficacious with only 4 injections, in contrast to the longer schedules currently in use with unmodified extracts. The product will also be safer to use than a formulation containing a similar mass of unmodified allergen extract as regards its ability to cause severe local allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, because of its reduced reactivity with IgE antibody. The modification is greater than 75%, so that only a small amount of unmodified allergen is remaining in the product. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Grass MATA MPL versus placebo in grass-allergic subjects following 4 subcutaneous injections of study medication administered before the start of the 2007 grass pollen season.</detailed_description>

In these cases, a careful history is to be taken and if moderate or severe symptoms are reported when exposed to the aforementioned allergens, the subject is to be excluded. Exception: the source of the allergen (cat, dog, horse) can be avoided for the entire study. Subjects with mild or no symptoms when exposed to the aforementioned allergens during the 3 years prior to Visit 1 will be allowed to enroll.
