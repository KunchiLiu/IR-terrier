	<brief_title>Assessment of Anaemia Attributable to Schistosomiasis in School Children in Kenya: Mechanisms and Effect of Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be carried out in an area around Lake Victoria in Kenya where the prevalence of schistosomiasis and malaria are highest in the areas nearest to the Lake. Depending on the prevalence of schistosomiasis a sample of between 876 to 2.524 children will be enrolled in the study. The children who will be in the age between 9 to 12 year, will have their stool and urine examined for schistosomiasis and intestinal worms and a blood sample will be examined for malaria parasites and the hemoglobin level. Children will also be weight, measured and examined by a doctor and register their food intake over one week, to determine their nutritional status. Children who are found to be infected with schistosomiasis, intestinal worms or malaria will be offered treatment. Children who are found to have anemia will be offered a course of iron supplementation, children with severe anemia will be referred to the nearest health facility for treatment. 12 months after the initial examinations and treatment all children will have a re-examination of their stool, urine and blood.</detailed_description>
