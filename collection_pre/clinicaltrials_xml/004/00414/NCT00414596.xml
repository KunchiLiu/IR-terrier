	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Evaluate The Effectiveness And Safety Of Axiom Worldwide Drx9000™ Spinal Decompression System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there are no prospective safety and/or outcomes studies utilizing the DRX9000™ in the peer-reviewed medical literature. There are published trials utilizing similar machines which provided evidence in support of the FDA granted indications for use spinal decompression and of the DRX9000™. Axiom Worldwide has determined it will be of benefit to the continuing medical care of patients and a furthering of the scientific knowledge of the treatment of LBP to complete such a prospective evaluation using a standardized treatment protocol. This study will therefore attempt to establish and validate the safety and efficacy of this computerized spinal decompression system in the treatment of LBP and sciatica.</detailed_description>
