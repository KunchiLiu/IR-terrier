	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Mycophenolate Versus Cyclophosphamide in ANCA Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a clear need for improved therapy in ANCA associated vasculitis where current treatments are toxic and contribute to poor outcomes. Conventional therapy combines cyclophosphamide with prednisolone but is associated with severe adverse events in 35%, early mortality, malignancy and infertility. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a newer immunosuppressive drug which has superior efficacy to azathioprine in solid organ transplantation. MMF is an effective alternative to cyclophosphamide in lupus nephritis. Open label studies and retrospective surveys point to the efficacy and low toxicity of MMF in vasculitis. We hypothesise that MMF not be less effective than cyclophosphamide for remission induction in AASV. 140 new patients will be randomised to MMF 3g/day or a European consensus intravenous cyclophosphamide regimen, with the same prednisolone dosing. Following a six month induction course all patients will receive consensus remission maintenance treatment with azathioprine and prednisolone. The primary end-point will be remission rate by six months, secondary end-points include relapse rate at 18 months and safety. The trial will be conducted in 10 countries by members of the European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS). The trial duration will be 42 months (24 months recruitment, 18 months follow up).</detailed_description>
