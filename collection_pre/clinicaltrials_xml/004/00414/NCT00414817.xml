	<brief_summary>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are often prescribed as a treatment for asthma. However, many individuals who take these medications do not adhere to their prescribed treatment regimen. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a telephone-based program at improving medication adherence among individuals with asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telephone-Based Program to Promote Inhaled Corticosteroid Adherence Among Individuals With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is a serious, chronic disease that affects lung function and impairs an individual's ability to breathe normally. ICS reduce airway inflammation and are often prescribed to treat these conditions. However, poor medication adherence is a common problem that can lead to treatment failure, hospitalization, or death. A telephone-based system that uses interactive voice recognition technology to remind individuals to follow their medication regimen may prove beneficial in promoting adherence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of such a telephone-based intervention at improving adherence to inhaled corticosteroid regimens among individuals with asthma. If this study proves successful, telephone-based interventions may be developed to promote treatment adherence for other chronic medical conditions. This 19-month study will enroll approximately 14,000 members of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest or Hawaii health system. Participants will be randomly assigned to either take part in the telephone intervention or receive usual medical care. Over the 19-month period, participants in the intervention group will receive between one and eight phone calls that will remind them to refill their prescriptions and offer education about ICS. If needed, the call may also offer a transfer to a pharmacy refill line or to speak with a pharmacist. Approximately 2,000 participants will complete questionnaires at study entry and at the end of the 19-month intervention period. The questionnaires will assess quality of life, respiratory health, asthma control, depression, inhaler use beliefs, and satisfaction with the intervention. Electronic medical record data and questionnaires will be used to determine adherence rates.</detailed_description>
