	<brief_title>Bupropion SR for Treating Smokeless Tobacco Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CONTEXT: No pharmacotherapies have been shown to increase long-term (&amp;#8805; 6 month) tobacco abstinence rates among smokeless tobacco (ST) users, although bupropion SR has demonstrated potential efficacy in pilot studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of bupropion SR for tobacco abstinence among ST users compared with placebo. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between August 2003 to May 2005 at two research centers with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up of smoking status to week 52. INTERVENTION: Bupropion SR titrated to 150 mg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks plus weekly behavioral interventions. Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint was 7-day point-prevalence tobacco abstinence rate at week 12. Secondary outcomes included the prolonged and continuous tobacco abstinence rates at weeks 12, 24, and 52.</detailed_description>
