	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of the current proposal is that collateral flow is an important determinant of myocardial protection during an ischemic event. Increased collateral flow for any given area at risk will decrease the myocardial damage caused by the occlusion of the infarct related epicardial artery. It is further hypothesized that myocardial salvage provided by collateral flow will decrease infarct size and this in turn will decrease LV dilatation post-myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of the current proposal is that collateral flow is an important determinant of myocardial protection during an ischemic event. Increased collateral flow for any given area at risk will decrease the myocardial damage caused by the occlusion of the infarct related epicardial artery. It is further hypothesized that myocardial salvage provided by collateral flow will decrease infarct size and this in turn will decrease LV dilatation post-myocardial infarction. The two primary endpoints are infarct size as assessed by increase of biochemical cardiac markers and coronary collateral perfusion index (CPI) as obtained by transthoracic MCE. Extent of LV remodelling, i.e., LV dilatation as assessed by serial assessment of LV dimension by LV angiogram and/or echocardiography, respectively.</detailed_description>
