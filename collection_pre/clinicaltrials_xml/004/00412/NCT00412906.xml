	<brief_summary>The aim of the present protocol is to study gene activity in fat and muscle tissue in type 2 diabetics and healthy volunteers after injection of E. coli endotoxin.We hereby hope to gain insight in some mechanisms behind the association between inflammation and insulin resistance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Gene Activity in Fat and Muscle in Diabetics and Healthy Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous studies have shown an association between low-grade inflammation and insulin-resistance in type 2 diabetics. It is also well-known that septic patients often develop insulin-resistance. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind the association between inflammation and insulin-resistance is not fully understood. In this study we create an experimental inflammation by giving E. coli endotoxin 0,3 ng/kg iv to type 2 diabetics and healthy controls. Muscle biopsies are taken at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours after injection, while fat biopsies are taken 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after endotoxin. mRNA for adiponectin, leptin, PPAR-gamma, PGC-1, PAI-1 and cytokines in tissue is later measured by RT-PCR. Blood samples are drawn on an hourly basis until 8 hours after endotoxin injection for common biochemical analyses including white blood cell count. Plasma is spared and later analyzed for cytokines, PAI-1 and VCAM-1/ICAM-1.</detailed_description>
