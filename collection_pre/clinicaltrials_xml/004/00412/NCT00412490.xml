	<brief_title>Smoking Status and Body Image in Oral Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, researchers will first perform a test to check the level of carbon monoxide (CO) in your blood. To do this test, you will be asked to blow into a cardboard tube attached to a machine. You will then be asked to fill out some questionnaires and complete a one-on-one interview. All of these things combined will take about an hour to complete. You will be asked basic questions such as your age, education level, and smoking history. You will also be asked questions about your mood, quality of life, and how you feel about your appearance. If you do not have surgery, your participation in this study will end after this visit. If you have surgery, you will be asked to come back for 2 more study visits, 1 month and 6 months after your surgery. During these evaluations, you will be asked once again to blow into the cardboard tube, fill out questionnaires, and a complete a one-on-one interview. Each visit will last about an hour. You will again be asked questions about your smoking behaviors, mood, quality of life, and how you feel about your appearance. Your participation in this study will be finished after the 6-month evaluation. This is an investigational study. About 75 people will take part in this research study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
