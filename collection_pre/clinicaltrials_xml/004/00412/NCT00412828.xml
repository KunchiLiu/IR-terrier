	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CR011-vcMMAE in patients who have unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma and have failed no more than 1 line of prior cytotoxic therapy. CR011-vcMMAE will be administered intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks at escalating doses until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Once the MTD is defined, 18-32 patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CR011-vcMMAE at this dose level. Additional dosing schedules of CR011-vcMMAE will also be explored.</brief_summary>
