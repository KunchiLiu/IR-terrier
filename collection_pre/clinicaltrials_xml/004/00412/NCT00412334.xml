Patients will be randomized to one of 4 groups, to receive a)PEGASYS 360 micrograms/week plus Copegus 1000-1200mg/day, b)PEGASYS 180 micrograms twice weekly plus Copegus 1000-1200mg/day, c)PEGASYS 360micrograms/week plus Copegus 1200-1600mg/day, or d)PEGASYS 180 micrograms twice weekly plus Copegus 1200-1600mg/day. Following 48 weeks treatment, there will be a 24 week period of treatment-free follow-up.
