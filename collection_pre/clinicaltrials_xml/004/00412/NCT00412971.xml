	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to compare the 1-year recurrence rate of Hexvix assisted Transuretheral Resection of the Bladder (TURB) to standard white light TURB in patients with suspicion of non-invasive bladder cancer. The hypothesis is to test whether the 1-year recurrence rate is different with Hexvix assisted TURB compared to standard white light TURB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized, Comparative Study of Hexvix Fluorescence Cystoscopy and Standard Cystoscopy in Patients With Non-invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of the study is to compare the 1-year recurrence rate of Hexvix assisted Transuretheral Resection of the Bladder (TURB) to standard white light TURB in patients with suspicion of non-invasive bladder cancer. Patients will be followed 4, 8 and 12 months after the initial TURB. This follow-up regimen is according to standard clinical practice in Denmark. Recurrence of non-invasive bladder cancer is frequent, and this study is designed to investigate whether Hexvix assisted TURB can reduce the early recurrence compared to standard TURB</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with suspicion of noninvasive bladder cancer indicated for a transuretheral resection of the bladder Above 18 years Written informed consent obtained Gross hematuria. (Note: Gross hematuria is defined as a heavy bladder bleed resulting in marked amounts of blood in the urine, which may interfere with fluorescence cystoscopy. Where the bleed is light, the patient should not be excluded if in the investigator's opinion, rinsing during cystoscopy will alleviate the possible interference with fluorescence cystoscopy). Patient with porphyria. Known allergy to hexyl aminolevulinate hydrochloride or a similar compound. Participation in other clinical studies with investigational drugs either concurrently or within the last 30 days. Pregnant or breastfeeding (all women of childbearing potential must document a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening and use the contraceptive pill or intrauterine device (IUD) during the treatments and for at least one month thereafter). Conditions associated with a risk of poor protocol compliance.</criteria>
