	<brief_summary>Patients with congenital heart disease in whom the right ventricle is exposed to pressure or volume overload show progressive systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle, the fact of which conveys substantial morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to investigate the myocardial perfusion in these patients by myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) in order to determine whether disturbed blood flow plays a role in the development of right ventricular systolic dysfunction.</brief_summary>
