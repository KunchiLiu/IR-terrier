	<brief_summary>This is a phase I, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of TH-302 in patients with advanced solid tumors. TH-302 is a hypoxia activated product designed to exploit the hypoxic nature of tumors. The study is designed to establish the safety including the maximum tolerated dose, the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-tumor activity of TH-302.</brief_summary>
