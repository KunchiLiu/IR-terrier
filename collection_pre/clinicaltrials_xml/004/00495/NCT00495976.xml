	<brief_title>Study to Investigate the Effects of Hot Drinks on Nasal Airway Resistance and Symptoms of Common Cold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common cold medicines are often formulated as a hot drink and usually contain paracetamol and a decongestant such as phenylephrine but it is the 'hot drink' formulation that is often an attraction to the patient in deciding on which formulation of a cold medicine to purchase and use. Hot drinks have been used to relieve the symptoms of acute respiratory infections such as colds and flu for hundreds of years and are found in the traditional medicines of countries throughout the world. The idea of using a hot drink to treat colds and flu appears to originate from a perceived link between exposure to cold and chilling and the onset of a respiratory infection. In order to combat the cold exposure many traditional remedies use a warming and soothing drink or application of a warming ointment . Despite the widespread folklore that hot drinks are an effective treatment for colds and flu, and the use of hot drink formulations for many current common cold medicines, there appears to be no evidence base in the medical literature supporting the efficacy of this common treatment for common cold. The aim of the present study is to obtain new knowledge about the effects of hot drinks on nasal airway resistance and other symptoms of common cold.</detailed_description>
