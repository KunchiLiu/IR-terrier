	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to measure the amount of limb swelling (lymphedema) that sometimes occurs after melanoma treatment, and to find out how people feel and react to the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Measurement of Post-Treatment Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you choose to take part in this study, you will have measurements taken of your arms or legs using a Perometer and a bioimpedance machine. The Perometer is a machine that painlessly measures the fluid in your limb using two-directional infrared lights. These lights are located in the frame of the machine that encircles the arm or leg during the measurement. The bioimpedance is a machine that measures the fluid in your arm or leg by passing a very small current through the body similar to an electrocardiogram (EKG). These very small currents are located in electrodes that are placed on the hands and feet during the measurement. Both machines are able to pick up changes in limb size. You will also be asked to complete a set of questionnaires relating to any symptoms that you may experience in your limbs and/or trunk (chest, stomach, and hip areas) during and following your standard cancer treatment. Additional questionnaires, along with your limb measurements, will be done at your regularly-scheduled follow-up clinic visits, 3-6 months, 9-12 months, 15-18 months, 21-24 months and 27- 30 months. You will complete the additional questionnaires using a laptop computer or a hardcopy. The measurements and questionnaires will take 45-60 minutes to complete each time. Some of the data from this study may be sent to the University of Missouri for analysis. The data that is sent will not have any personal identifiers. Researchers at University of Missouri will not be able to link the data to the protected health information or personal identity of any individual participant. This is an investigational study. Up to 350 patients will take part in this study. All patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
