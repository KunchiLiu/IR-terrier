	<brief_summary>Euthanasia and assisted dying are of growing interest for patients with incurable diseases. The possible methods are widely discussed by patient-societies, physicians, lawyers, theologians and philosophers. During the last years several opinion-polls were conducted with healthy people or medical stuff, but no surveys were conducted to get the attitude of incurable ill patients. The hypothesis of the investigators' study is: "Palliative Care Medicine is a better option for incurable ill patients than an assisted suicide."</brief_summary>
