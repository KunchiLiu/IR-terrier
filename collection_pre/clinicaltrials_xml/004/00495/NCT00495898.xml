	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CYPHER sirolimus-eluting stent in maintaining minimum lumen diameter in de novo native coronary artery lesions as compared to the uncoated Bx VELOCITY balloon-expandable stent in patients with manifest diabetes mellitus. Both stents are mounted on the Raptorâ Rapid Exchange Stent Delivery System.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (19 sites), prospective, 2 arm randomized study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CYPHER sirolimus-eluting stent as compared to the uncoated Bx VELOCITY balloon-expandable stent in patients with manifest diabetes mellitus. Patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions &lt;= 42 mm in length and &gt;=2.5mm and &lt;=3.5mm in diameter (by visual estimate) will be included in the study. A total of 190 patients will be entered and randomly allocated to the CYPHERTM sirolimus-eluting stent or the uncoated Bx VELOCITY balloon-expandable stent at a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be followed for 12 months post-procedure, with all patients having a repeat angiography at 8 months (± 1 month). It is anticipated the total duration of the study will be 18 months: 6 months to complete patient enrollment and 12 months for follow up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Classification B III) OR patients with documented silent ischemia; Manifest diabetes mellitus, proven by fasting glucose (12 h) &gt; 127 mg/dl or oral glucose challenge: &gt;= 200 mg/dl after 2 h or diabetes mellitus already treated with oral antidiabetics or insulin; Treatment of a de novo native coronary artery lesion in a major coronary artery in patients with single or multivessel disease; patients with 2 or morevesseldisease can be enrolled if previous treatment(s) of those lesions other than the target lesion have taken place at least 3 months prior to the enrolment to this study. If more than 1 study stent is necessary to treat the lesion, overlapping is strongly recommended; Target vessel diameter at the lesion site is &gt;= 2.5mm and &lt;= 3.5mm (visual estimate); (stents will be available in 2.5 / 3.0 mm width); Target lesion is &lt;= 42mm in length (visual estimate); (stents will be available in 8, 18 and 33 mm length); Target lesion diameter stenosis is &gt; 50% and &lt;100% (visual estimate);</criteria>
