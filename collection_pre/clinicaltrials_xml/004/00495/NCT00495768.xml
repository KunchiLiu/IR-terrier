	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an 8-visit non-pharmacologic group intervention in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms in veterans who receive IFN and ribavirin for the treatment of Hepatitis C. We hypothesize that over the first 6 months of treatment with IFN and ribavirin for the 45 patients who receive the 8-visit intervention early in the course of treatment in addition to usual care (experimental group) will have lower scores on the CES-D, a standard depression rating scale, than the 45 patients who receive only usual care (control group).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Depressive Symptoms During HCV Therapy: A Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, subjects will be randomly assigned (by chance, like the flipping of a coin) to one of two study groups. Half the subjects will be assigned to a training program, which will consist of 8 sessions over a period of 8 weeks in which they will be instructed in cognitive therapy ( a method of identifying and "talk back" to one's negative thoughts) and a variety of other stress-reducing techniques. The other half will be assigned to a control groups, which will no receive instruction in cognitive therapy or the other stress-reducing techniques. All subjects, both those in the training program and in the control group, will receive the usual care for hepatitis C that all patients in the Hepatology Clinic receive. All subjects will also be asked to participate in 6 testing visits over the course of the study. The first testing visit will last about 3 hours, which the others will last between 1 1/2 and 2 hours. Subjects will alo be interviewed by telephone about their personal and family medical and psychiatric history. This will take about an hour.</detailed_description>

Autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosis, or sarcoidosis, is a contraindication to treatment. Active alcohol or intravenous drug use is a contraindication to treatment. Patients with a seizure disorder muct be seizurefree for 6 months prior to treatment.
