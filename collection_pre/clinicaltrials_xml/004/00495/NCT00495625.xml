	<brief_summary>An open label multi-site phase II clinical trial of dose escalated sunitinib malate given orally once daily on days 1-28 of each 42-day cycle. Treatment will be continued until there is either disease progression or cumulative or acute toxicity which in the opinion of the treating physician compromises the ability of the patient to receive treatment or patient desire to stop treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An open label multi-site phase II clinical trial of sunitinib malate given orally once daily on days 1-28 of each 42-day cycle. Sunitinib malate will be dispensed as capsules at the beginning of each treatment cycle. The dose may be escalated at the investigator's discretion. Treatment will be continued until there is either disease progression or cumulative or acute toxicity which in the opinion of the treating physician compromises the ability of the patient to receive treatment or patient desire to stop treatment. A follow up visit will be required before the beginning of every cycle every 6 weeks to assess toxicity and for physical examination. Complete blood count (CBC) and differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (including liver function tests) and alpha-feto protein (when indicated) will be obtained at every scheduled follow up visit.</detailed_description>

Female subjects must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. All female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
