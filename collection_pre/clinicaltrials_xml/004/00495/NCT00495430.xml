	<brief_summary>The primary purpose is to test intersubject variability and establish the qualitative features of normal VRI images and the range of normality of the VRI quantitative lung data values that may be used to differentiate normal from abnormal breath sound distribution. Our hypothesis was that VRI breath sound images of healthy subjects are similar in a qualitative and quantitative manner.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Computerized analyses have shown that normal lung sounds have distinctive characteristic that can be differentiated from abnormal lung sounds.However, technical issues and complicated display modes have restricted the use of computerized lung sound analyses in the clinical environment. The VRI provides dynamic gray-scale images and quantitative lung data showing the breath sound distribution of healthy individuals. Typical features that are discerned by trained raters and quantitative lung data may serve as a reference for comparison to abnormal breath sound images.</detailed_description>
