	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of caffeine compared to placebo in detoxifying cocaine dependent patients. Caffeine potentiation with biperiden will be also studied. 108 with cocaine dependence will be randomized to receive caffeine (300 - 1200 mg t.i.d.) plus biperidene (8 mg b.i.d.) or caffeine (300 - 1200 mg t.i.d.) with placebo or placebo during 6 months. Primary efficacy outcomes will be 1) patient comfort assessed with abstinence symptomatology, craving for cocaine and mental status during detoxifying period, 2) study retention and 3) cocaine use. Brain dopamine system will be assessed thru IBZM-SPECT and the apomorphine test.</brief_summary>
