	<brief_summary>The objective of this feasibility trial is to evaluate the Ethicon Endo-Surgery Endoscopic Suturing System (ESS) for tissue apposition and reduction of the size of a dilated GJ anastomosis in subjects who are regaining weight after successful weight loss following gastric bypass. Post-procedure weight will be followed to assess whether weight loss is resumed. The ESS is an FDA-cleared (510(k)) sterile, single-use, disposable suturing system indicated for endoscopic placement of suture(s) and approximation of soft tissues. It is designed to facilitate endoscopic gastrointestinal procedures.</brief_summary>
