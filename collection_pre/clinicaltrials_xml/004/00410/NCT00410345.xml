	<brief_summary>Induction of midtrimester abortion includes cervical ripening and then contraction to induce uterine evacuation. There are several protocols, but most of them include using prostaglandins (PG). The disadvantages of using PG include uncomfortable side effects and limits of using it for women after cesarean section. Mifepristone is an antiprogesterone drug and been used for induction of abortion in first and second trimesters abortions. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of Mifepristone for cervical ripening before high dose Oxytocin drip.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of Mifepristone for cervical ripening before high dose Oxytocin drip in midtrimester abortions. After informed consent, all the women will be randomized for Mifepristone or placebo. 48 hours later, high dose oxytocin drip will be started and we will examine the success rate to induce abortion, the duration from starting oxytocin till evacuation of uterus and side effects.</detailed_description>
