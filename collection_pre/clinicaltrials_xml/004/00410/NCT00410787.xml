	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study was to characterize the pain control achieved with long-term repeated dosing of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) in patients with chronic cancer pain and the secondary purpose was to characterize the effects of pain on the patients' quality of life with long-term, repeated dosing of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) taken by patients with chronic cancer pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study DO-118X was a phase-3, multicenter, open-label extension study in adult patients with cancer pain who had successfully completed Study DO-118 with dose-stable pain control taking at least 8 mg of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) or its equivalent morphine sulfate SR (slow release) dosage. Patients were started on the dose of OROS hydromorphone equivalent to the opioid dose on which they had achieved dose-stable pain control in the SR (slow release) phase of Study DO-118. Patients returned to their study clinic once a month for 1 year. Dosage adjustments to study medications and breakthrough pain medication were permitted. OROS hydromorphone HCI (slow release) tablets in 8, 16, 32 and 64mg doses administered orally every 24 hours</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who have chronic cancer pain, and who have successfully completed the OROS hydromorphone SR (slow release) study, DO118 Patients must have been in dosestable pain control in the last two days of the slow release phase of the study Patients who require at least 8mg of OROS hydromorphone slow release every 24 hours for the management of chronic cancer pain Pain which is not considered to be potentially responsive to opioids Gastrointestinal disease of sufficient severity to be likely to interfere with oral analgesia including: dysphagia, vomiting, no bowel movement or bowel obstruction due to impaction within the 5 days prior to the start of the trial, severe gut narrowing that may affect the absorption or transit of orally administered drugs, particularly the insoluble OROS outer coating Any patient in whom the risks of treatment with hydromorphone outweigh the potential benefits. Such risk categories include: raised intracranial pressure, hypotension, hypothyroidism, asthma, reduced respiratory reserve, prostatic hypertrophy, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, elderly and debilitated, convulsive disorders and Addison's disease</criteria>
