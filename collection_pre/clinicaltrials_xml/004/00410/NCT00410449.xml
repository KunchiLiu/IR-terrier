	<brief_summary>Complications of hemodialysis access are the most frequent single reason for hospitalization among patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Uremia, and particularly uremia in patients with diabetes, is a state of increased oxidative stress. The central hypothesis to be tested by this project is that oxidative stress is a major (and modifiable) trigger for vascular access complications. We hope to slow or reduce rates of stenosis, thrombosis and access complications by giving Vitamin E supplementation to patients being treated by hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxidative Stress and Hemodialysis Access Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients continued their usual treatment on hemodialysis three times per week. This was a double-blinded placebo controlled trial. Patients took either Vitamin E 400 IU bid or placebo. An initial evaluation of access patency was performed and baseline blood drawn before starting Vitamin E. Every 3 months there was a followup evaluation with blood drawn for oxidative stress markers, and with a test of vascular access patency. The study was closed to new participants, vitamin E or placebo stopped, and data analysis performed in 2003.</detailed_description>
