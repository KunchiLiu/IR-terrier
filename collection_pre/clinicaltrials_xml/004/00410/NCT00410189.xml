	<brief_title>BATTLE Program: ZD6474 in Previously Treated Subjects With NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZD6474 is designed to block the formation of new blood vessels. The growth of new blood vessels is called angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is thought to be important for the growth of tumors beyond a small size. Researchers want to find out if ZD6474 will limit new blood vessel growth in the tumor and "starve" the tumor by limiting blood flow to it. In order to enroll in this study, you must also be enrolled in Protocol 2005-0823: A Biomarker-integrated study in Chemorefractory Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Protocol 2005-0823 is the screening study in a group of studies called the BATTLE program. Participants in Protocol 2005-0823 are assigned to one of the research studies. The results of your tumor analysis helped the study doctor determine to assign you to this particular treatment study. While on study, you will take ZD6474 by mouth each morning. ZD6474 is swallowed as a whole tablet. The tablet should not be chewed, crushed, or divided and should be taken with 8 ounces of water and a small amount of food to lessen stomach discomfort. You should take ZD6474 at about the same time every day. Four (4) weeks is considered 1 treatment cycle. If you miss a dose and are unable to take the missed dose on the same day, you should take the next scheduled dose and the missed dose will not be made up. The dose of study medication may be repeated if vomiting occurs within 30 minutes of taking the study medication. You will have routine blood tests (about 2 teaspoons) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, then every 4 weeks after that. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, then every 3 months after that. Every 4 weeks, your complete medical history will be recorded and you will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate), a performance status evaluation, and weight. You will also have a routine urine test and your study doctor will ask you about any medications you are taking and your smoking history. Every 2 cycles, your tumor will be evaluated by chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the status of the disease. If you are taking coumadin, you will have blood drawn (about 1-2 teaspoons) to check your blood clotting function every week. You will be asked to bring your unused medication to each clinic visit. You may continue receiving ZD6474 for as long as the cancer responds to study treatment. Your doctor may decide to take you off this study if you experience intolerable side effects, your medical condition gets worse, and/or you are unable to comply with study requirements. If you stop study treatment, you may be able to enroll in 1 of the remaining 3 protocols of the BATTLE program. After you have stopped taking the study treatment, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will also have blood drawn (about 1-2 teaspoons) to check your blood clotting function. You will have a performance status evaluation, chest x-ray, ECG, and a CT or MRI scan. Following this evaluation, you will be contacted by telephone every 3 months for up to 3 years to see how you are doing. You have the right to leave the study at any time. If you choose to stop participating in this study, you should contact the study chair and/or research nurse. This is an investigational study. ZD6474 is an investigational drug that has been approved by the FDA for research use only. Up to 72 patients will take part in this multicenter study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>

The patient has adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine level &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dL or a calculated creatinine clearance of &gt;/= 60cc/minute. 9. The patient has prothrombin time (PT) &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal 10. If patient has brain metastasis, they must have been stable (treated or asymptomatic) for at least 4 weeks after radiation if treated with radiation and not have used steroids for at least 1 week. Reimaging performed after 2 weeks, upon completion of radiation therapy. 11. The patient is &gt;/= 18 years of age. 12. The patient has signed informed consent. 13. The patient is eligible if disease free from a previously treated malignancy, other than a previous NSCLC, for greater than two years. Patients with a history of prior basal cell carcinoma of the skin or preinvasive carcinoma of the cervix are exempt from exclusion. 14. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.Childbearing potential will be defined as women who have had menses within the past 12 months,who have not had tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy.Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating in this study,she should inform her treating physician immediately.The patient,if a man,agrees to use effective contraception or abstinence. 15.
