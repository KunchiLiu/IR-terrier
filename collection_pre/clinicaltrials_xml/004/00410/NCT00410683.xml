	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether giving radiation therapy after surgery is more effective than no radiation therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to no radiation therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has been completely removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the disease-free survival of patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer treated with conformal thoracic radiotherapy vs no radiotherapy. Secondary - Determine the toxicity, in particular cardiac and pulmonary toxicity, of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the local control in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine patterns of recurrence in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Assess second cancers in patients treated with these regimens. - Assess prognostic factors and predictive factors of treatment effect on disease-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the cost per recurrence-free year of life. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, prior chemotherapy (neoadjuvant alone vs adjuvant vs none), number of lymph stations involved (0 vs 1 vs ≥ 2), histology (squamous cell vs other), and use of pretreatment positron emission tomography scans (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Beginning within 4-8 weeks after surgery or 2-6 weeks after chemotherapy, patients undergo adjuvant thoracic conformal radiotherapy once daily, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks. - Arm II: Patients do not undergo adjuvant thoracic radiotherapy. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to10 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 700 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1. Histological evidence of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 2. Complete resection by lobectomy, bilobectomy or pneumonectomy (i.e patients with positive margins) or extracapsular mediastinal nodal extension breaching the surface of the pathological specimen should not to be included 3. Mediastinal lymph node exploration (lymph node sampling or systematic dissection of lymph nodes at stations 2, 4 and 7 in case of upper/middle rightsided lung cancer; 4, 7, 8 and 9 in case of lower rightsided lung cancer; 5, 6 and 7 in case of upper left sided lung cancer; 7, 8 and 9 in case of lower leftsided lung cancer is recommended) 4. Pathologically or cytologically documented N2 mediastinal nodal involvement, at the time of surgery if no preoperative chemotherapy or before preoperative chemotherapy, according to the criteria of the joint AJCC and UICC classification, clinical N2 patients without cytological or histological documentation of mediastinal node involvement before preoperative chemotherapy can be included in the study if and only if, they have histologically confirmed N2 disease at the time of surgery 5. Prior chemotherapy is allowed (preoperative or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, or both) 6. Patient aged ≥ 18 years 7. Good Performance status (WHO ≤ 2) 8. Fit enough to receive curative radiotherapy 9. Adequate pulmonary function with postoperative FEV1 after surgery &gt; 1 l or over 35% theoretical value 10. Signed informed consent form EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Documented metastases, (except for ipsilateral nodule(s) in a different lobe after pneumonectomy or bilobectomy) 2. Major pleural or pericardial effusion 3. Synchronous contralateral lung cancer 4. Clinical progression during postoperative chemotherapy 5. Previous chest radiotherapy 6. Intention of concomitant chemotherapy during radiotherapy 7. Weight loss in the previous 6 months before surgery ≥ 10 % 8. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease as judged by the investigator 9. Recent (&lt; 6 months) severe cardiac disease (arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, infarction, pacemaker) or pulmonary disease 10. Current or past history of neoplasm other than nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed within the last 5 years, except : basal cell carcinoma of the skin in situ carcinoma of the cervix A patient diagnosed for another neoplasm 5 years ago or more, treated and considered as cured may be included in the study if all the other criteria are respected. 11. Pregnancy or breast feeding or inadequate contraceptive measures during treatment 12. Patients who, for family, social, geographic or psychological reasons, cannot be adequately followed up and/or are incapable of undergoing regular controls 13. Patient deprived of freedom or under guardianship</criteria>
