	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory stage II or stage III multiple myeloma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab and lenalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Dexamethasone may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving bevacizumab together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients with relapsed or refractory stage II or III multiple myeloma treated with bevacizumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine time to progression in these patients. II. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen. III. Determine the effect of bevacizumab and lenalidomide on markers of myeloma activity in myeloma cells and stromal cells, including interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î±, vascular endothelial growth factor, and STAT3. IV. Assess local cytokine milieu using tissue microarrays of bone marrow biopsy specimens. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study. Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, oral lenalidomide on days 1-21, and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected at baseline and before courses 2 and 4. Blood samples are examined for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) polymorphisms by pyrosequencing and VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, interleukin-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 by immunoenzyme techniques. Relationships between plasma cell myeloma and stroma and the effect of study treatment on these relationships are examined in tissue sections of bone marrow before and after treatment utilizing microvessel density measurements, VEGF staining, and STAT3 staining (by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH]). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.</detailed_description>
