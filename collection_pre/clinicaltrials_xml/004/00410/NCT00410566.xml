	<brief_title>Safety Study of rhASM Enzyme Replacement Therapy in Adults With Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (Niemann-Pick Disease)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ASM deficiency (ASMD), also known as Niemann-Pick A and B disease, is a rare genetic disorder in which reduced activity of the lysosomal enzyme, ASM, leads to the accumulation of sphingomyelin primarily in macrophages throughout the body. This deficiency results in characteristic features such as hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, interstitial lung disease, growth retardation, coronary artery disease, fatigue, and in severe cases, neurodegeneration with death in early childhood. There is no specific treatment for this disease. This Phase 1 safety study will seek to enroll a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 30 eligible adults patients with ASMD with each patient participating for approximately 7 weeks.</detailed_description>
