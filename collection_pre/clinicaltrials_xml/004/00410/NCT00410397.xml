	<brief_summary>Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem in the adult population with many approaches to treatment, but no clear answer. One of the causes of LBP, musculoskeletal pain, can be triggered by spasm of the deep muscles of the back and pelvis. This study, therefore, focuses on treating pelvic muscle pain as a way of lessening LBP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Manual Therapy to Treat Low-Back and Hip Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) is a well-researched standard of care in the treatment of low back pain (LBP). Under the heading of OMM, many different modalities exist to decrease a patient's somatic dysfunction. Among the most commonly used are high velocity (thrusting through an immobilized joint) and muscle energy (engaging a restrictive barrier using the patient's own strength). Although a very common complaint, there is no exact etiology for LBP. Many different theories exist, including postural disturbances, leg length discrepancies, and even genetic predispositions. A study in Spine finds that among those with chronic LBP there is a subgroup of people with reduced hip flexion, and concludes that hip motion should be considered in treatment of patients with LBP. Currently, there exists no research on the manipulation of hip flexors in the treatment of LBP. This study, therefore, will test the efficacy of OMM on the deep pelvic musculature as a way of decreasing LBP.</detailed_description>
