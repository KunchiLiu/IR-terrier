History of acute or chronic bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, treated or not treated). History of clinically significant drug allergy or history of atopic allergy, urticaria, eczematous dermatitis). A known hypersensitivity to the study drugs or drugs similar to the study drugs. Any history of surgical or medical condition(s) which could change the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or which may jeopardize the subject, including history of gastrointestinal, pancreatic, liver, kidney, bladder, blood, or immune systems. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing or evidence of such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted the screening or baseline evaluations.
