	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of pathologic complete response when giving docetaxel and trastuzumab followed by caelyx (liposomal doxorubicin), cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab before surgery in treating women with operable or locally advanced HER-2 positive breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CETRA: Neoadjuvant Caelyx and Trastuzumab in Her-2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy in association with trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody, given before surgery, has been shown to reduce tumor size and permit better resection of HER-2 positive breast cancers. This study will evaluate the activity of a neoadjuvant treatment with docetaxel and trastuzumab given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by the combination of caelyx, cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients will undergo breast cancer surgery 2-5 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy after surgery will be given according to existing guidelines, and will include an additional 10 cycles of trastuzumab.</detailed_description>
