	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to demonstrate that MelaFind®, a new instrument that uses machine vision for non-invasive early detection of cutaneous pigmented malignant melanoma, is safe and effective. MelaFind® acquires digital images of the lesion with illumination in different spectral bands, from visible to near infrared, and automatically analyzes these images. Diagnostic accuracy of MelaFind® and that of study dermatologists will be evaluated. The reference standard will be final interpretation of lesions by central dermatohistopathology.</brief_summary>
