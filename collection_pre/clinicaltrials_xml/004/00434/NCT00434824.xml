	<brief_summary>In this study we have evaluated the effects of three different doses of oral testosterone undecanoate in aging men presenting with a combination of symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism and low blood levels of the male hormone testosterone. Specifically, we have studied the effects on: - symptoms suggestive of low testosterone levels - blood testosterone and other hormone levels - bone mass - muscle mass and fat mass - muscle strength - prostate - lipids, hematocrit</brief_summary>
