	<brief_summary>Aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness (functional ability and physical capacity) and safety (disease activity and damage of the joints) of long-term high-intensity weight-bearing exercises in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).The training proved to be safe and effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients in Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 300 patients with RA were randomized into two groups; exercise group and usual care group. The patients who participated in the 2 years intensive exercise training (2 times a week, training duration 65 minutes) improved their functional capacity and functional ability without detrimental effects on the large joints damage or on disease activity. Only patients with excessive large joint damage at baseline were at risk to develop additional damage when participating in intensive weight-bearing exercises. Patients who exercised were able to delay the decrease of bone mineral density of the hips.</detailed_description>
