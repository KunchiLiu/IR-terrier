	<brief_summary>Small pupils are not uncommon in situations requiring surgical intervention for glaucoma and cataract. Inadequate binocular view during combined trabeculaectomy and glaucoma surgery needs to be overcome by additional iris manupulations to dilate the pupils which increase the liklihood of inflammation, inraocular pressure rise after surgery and enhnced liklihood of failure of glaucoma surgery. The proposed trial is an observational study to analyse post operative outcome of eyes undrgoing trabeculectomy and phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation with small pupils in persons with glaucoma coexisting with cataract.</brief_summary>
