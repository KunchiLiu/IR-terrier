	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Etanercept in the Treatment of Subjects With Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel and placebo-controlled outpatient study. The study consists of 2 parts: part A is a 6-week double-blind treatment period and part B is a 6-week open-label treatment period. During part A of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment regimens: 2 etanercept 25 mg or placebo once weekly, administered subcutaneously (SC). After the completion of part A, all subjects will receive 2 etanercept 25 mg once weekly. The use of placebo as a control in part A is necessary to allow a valid comparison and to provide a quantitative assessment of effect.</detailed_description>

Complete ankylosis (fusion) of spine. 2. Previous treatment with etanercept, antibody to Tumor Necrosis Factor a (TNFa), or other TNFa inhibitors or other biologic agents. 3. Use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than hydroxychloroquine, sulphasalazine, and methotrexate within 4 weeks of baseline.
