	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Comparison of TG-873870(Nemonoxacin) to Levofloxacin in Community-Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired Pneumonia(CAP) remains a leading cause of death in both developing and developed countries. In the choice of antibacterial agents used to treat CAP, fluoroquinolones have received considerable attention because of their wide spectrum of bactericidal activity. TG-873870(Nemonoxacin), a non-fluorinated quinolone (NFQ), is a selective bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor. This study will test the safety and efficacy of TG-873870(Nemonoxacin) compared with Levofloxacin in adult patients with Community-Aquired Pneumonia (CAP) .</detailed_description>
