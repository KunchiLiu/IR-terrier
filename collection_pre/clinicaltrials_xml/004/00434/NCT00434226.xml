	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter trial designed to provide a preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of sunitinib when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC who have not received prior systemic therapy for NSCLC. All patients will have advanced, histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC (Stage IIIb with pleural effusions, Stage IV, or recurrent).</brief_summary>
