	<brief_summary>The study will be conducted at 15-20 US centers in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. Enrollees will be hospitalized sickle cell disease (SCD) patients at-risk for acute chest syndrome (ACS) based on the presence of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), fever (T ≥38.0°C) and serum sPLA2 concentration ≥50 ng/mL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IMPACTS Trial: Investigation of the Modulation of Phospholipase in Acute Chest Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled dose escalation study (2 cohorts) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) who are at-risk for development of acute chest syndrome (ACS) based on the combination of VOC, fever (T ≥38.0ºC), and a serum sPLA2 concentration ≥50 ng/mL. The first group of patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive low dose A-001 or placebo as a 48-hour continuous infusion. Pharmacokinetic and clinical data from this group will undergo review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). If there is no significant toxicity associated with A-001, then an additional group of patients will be enrolled and randomized 2:1 to high dose A-001 versus placebo as a 48-hour continuous infusion.</detailed_description>
