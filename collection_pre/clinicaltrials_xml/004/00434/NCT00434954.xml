	<brief_summary>This study in Germany is designed to compare the effects of twice-daily exenatide plus metformin and twice-daily premixed human insulin aspart plus metformin with respect to glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c, combined with the percentage of patients with at least one treatment-emergent hypoglycemic episode. Patients will be treated with study therapy for approximately 26 weeks.</brief_summary>
