	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase IV.II study. Patients with local relapse breast cancer will receive radiotherapy concomitant to the administration of capecitabine. Total dose of radiotherapy will be 50 Gy administered in daily session of 200 cGy. Radiotherapic treatment will not be longer than 6 weeks. All patients will receive 1650 mg/m2 by mouth, per day (825 mg/m2 twice a day (p.o. bid) for 35 days. Tissue samples must be analysed to determinate the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)by FISH technical.</brief_summary>
