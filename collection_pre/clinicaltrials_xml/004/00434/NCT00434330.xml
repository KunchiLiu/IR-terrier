	<brief_title>Peginesatide for Maintenance Treatment of Anemia in Participants on Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia associated with chronic kidney disease is due to several factors, primarily the inability of the diseased kidneys to produce adequate amounts of endogenous erythropoietin. Ancillary factors include the shortened lifespan of red blood cells, iron and other nutritional deficiencies, infection, and inflammation. The presence and severity of anemia are related to the duration and extent of kidney failure. Anemia is associated with increased mortality, increased likelihood of hospitalization, reduced cognitive function, and increased left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents have been established as a treatment for anemia in subjects with chronic kidney disease, and have improved the management of anemia over alternatives such as transfusion. Peginesatide is a parenteral formulation developed for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. Peginesatide binds to and activates the human erythropoietin receptor, and stimulates erythropoiesis in human red cell precursors in a manner similar to other known erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Six dose cohorts of 15 participants each were evaluated in this study. Participants received peginesatide injection once every 4 weeks administered intravenously or subcutaneously for a total of 7 doses.</detailed_description>
