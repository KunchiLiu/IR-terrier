	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether urinary PGE-M levels correlate with Crohn's disease activity and to compare how well urinary PGE-M correlates with other non-invasive biomarkers of disease activity such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urinary Prostaglandin E Metabolite (PGE-M), A Metabolite of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2): A Novel Biomarker of Crohn's Disease Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The available clinical measures of Crohn's disease activity can be overly influenced by functional symptoms. Placebo response rates in clinical trials are high. Several non-invasive biomarkers are currently available for assessing IBD disease activity including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin. Although these markers hold some promise, their performance is less than ideal. What is needed is a simple, non-invasive, biologic measure of Crohn's disease. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis and is expressed in epithelial inflammatory conditions and some cancers. We have developed an assay to quantify the major urinary metabolite of PGE2, PGE-M. PGE-M has been previously shown to be elevated in the urine of patients with advanced colorectal neoplasia relative to controls.</detailed_description>
