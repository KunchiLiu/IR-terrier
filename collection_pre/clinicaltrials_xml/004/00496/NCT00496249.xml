	<brief_summary>Many younger men are diagnosed with prostate cancer. These patients are often choosing radiation therapy as their primary treatment. The effect of this therapy on fertility will have a direct impact on their decision about therapeutic options and fertility preservation. The researchers hypothesize that when patients are treated with radiation for localized prostate cancer, infertility can occur due to direct damage to seminiferous tubules affecting sperm quality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Radiation on Semen Quality and Fertility in Men With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer is the most common malignant disease among men. Many young men are diagnosed with localized prostate cancer. Some of these men are choosing to manage their prostate cancer with radiation therapy. The radiation therapy delivers minimal dose exposure to adjacent organs. We hypothesize that when patients are treated with radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer, decreased fertility can occur due to damage of seminiferous tubules, which may affect sperm quality. This study will assess the impact of radiation therapy on semen and seminal fluid.</detailed_description>
