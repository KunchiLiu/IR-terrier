	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of intravenous anidulafungin (Eraxisâ„¢) in patients with a diagnosis of candidemia or invasive candidiasis, which is a fungus infection of the blood or tissue. Currently the drug is approved for treatment using a daily dose of IV medication until 14 days after the fungus disappears from the blood. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous anidulafungin when it is administered for 5-28 days followed by oral antifungal medication. Study patients will be assessed for response to treatment throughout the study drug treatment period.</brief_summary>
