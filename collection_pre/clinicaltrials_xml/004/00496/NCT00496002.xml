	<criteria>Nucleoside treatmentnaïve subjects of either gender, females who are nonpregnant and nonlactating, aged 16 years or older (or the legal age of consent as allowed by local regulations), with compensated hepatic function despite a diagnosis of chronic HBeAg positive hepatitis B infection (i.e., based on serological, virological and histological markers) will be eligible for this study. Subjects with historical biopsies used for entry will have chronic hepatic inflammatory injury at screening (Knodell HAI score ≥ 4 and modified Ishak fibrosis score ≤ 5). If applicable, subjects must cease previous treatment with any form of alpha interferon 12 months prior to baseline. For eligibility, subjects must meet the laboratory criteria for total bilirubin, prothrombin time, serum albumin, platelet count, absolute neutrophil count, ANA titer and have a creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 mL/min. Subjects participating in a clinical trial or receiving an investigational agent for any reason within 60 days of baseline will be excluded. Subjects with clinically significant concomitant diseases will be excluded.</criteria>
