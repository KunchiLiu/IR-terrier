	<brief_summary>Primary: • To compare the efficacy of nasal fentanyl (NF) to oral transmucosal fentanyl (Actiq®) (hereafter Actiq) in the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients. Secondary: - To compare patients' general impression and preference of NF and Actiq - To explore the relationship between NF doses and dose of current opioid for breakthrough pain (BTP) and the relationship between dose of NF and of background opioid - To assess safety and tolerability of NF</brief_summary>
