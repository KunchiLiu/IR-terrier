	<brief_title>Doppler-Guided Uterine Artery Occlusion (DUAO) Device for Fibroid Related Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE D-UAO Instruments are single-use disposable instruments consisting of a GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE Uterine Stabilizer, a GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDEM Introducer Sheath, a GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE Doppler Clamp, and a GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE Coupler.</detailed_description>
