	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of LCP-Tacro in Stable Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A three sequence, open-label, multi-center, prospective, study in stable kidney transplant patients to assess and compare the pharmacokinetics (Cmax, C24, and AUC), and safety of LCP-Tacro (tacrolimus) tablets versus Prograf (tacrolimus) capsules. Stable kidney transplant patients who fulfill all I/E criteria will be enrolled and kept on Prograf for 7 days. Following a 24-hour PK study on Day 7 to determine pharmacokinetics for Prograf, all patients will be converted to once daily LCP-Tacro for 7 days with no dose changes allowed. On Day 14 and Day 21 a 24-hour LCP-Tacro PK study will be performed. On Day 22 patients will be converted back to their original twice daily dose of Prograf for a safety follow-up period of 30 days ending with a safety assessment on day 53.</detailed_description>
