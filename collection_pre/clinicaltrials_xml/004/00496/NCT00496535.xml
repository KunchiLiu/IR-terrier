	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the first phase is to determine the safety, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of TNFerade in combination with the previously studied combination of Fluorouracil (5FU), Hydroxyurea (HU) and standard daily radiotherapy in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer (RHNC). All chemoradiotherapy is administered on a "week-on/week-off" schedule. The primary objective of the second phase II is to determine the locoregional control rate at 24 months.</brief_summary>
