	<brief_title>Study of Low-Dose Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy in Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment modalities are usually not curative and having treatment options suitable for the long-term control therefore essential. Electron beam therapy is generally applied to the skin in total doses of 30-36 Gy over a 8-10 week period.Due to the potential risk of toxicity including bone marrow supression, no more than 2-3 courses in a life time are generally recommended. In the current study we explored the possibility of using lower radiation doses for total skin electron beam therapy for long-term disease control.</detailed_description>
