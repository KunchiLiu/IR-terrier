	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to determine whether apixaban is more effective than acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of strokes associated with patients with atrial fibrillation. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An optional Long-term Open-label Extension Phase of treatment with apixaban will be provided for qualifying participants following the conclusion of the double-blind phase</detailed_description>
