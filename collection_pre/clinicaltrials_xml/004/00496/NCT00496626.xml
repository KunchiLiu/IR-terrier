A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled immunogenicity and safety study in Chinese female participants aged 9 to 45 years and male participants aged 9 to 15 years. Approximately 600 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or aluminum-containing placebo. Each participant received one injection at each visit at Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6. Vaccine or placebo was given as a 0.5-mL intramuscular injection. Serum will be collected from all participants to evaluate immune response against anti-Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11/16/18 with Luminex Assay. At Month 2, Month 6, Month 7, subjects will be evaluated for any new medical condition or health concerns and Serious Adverse Experiences throughout the study. The primary objective is to evaluate the vaccine-induced serum anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 antibody titers following 3-dose regimen of Gardasil® compared with placebo.</brief_summary>
