	<brief_summary>This study evaluated the single-dose pharmacokinetics of human fibrinogen concentrate and clot strength (maximum clot firmness [MCF]) in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency. MCF was measured to demonstrate the functional activity of replacement fibrinogen when a fixed dose of human fibrinogen concentrate was administered.</brief_summary>
