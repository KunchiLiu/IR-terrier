	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well sorafenib works in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the safety and toxicity of dose escalating sorafenib tosylate in patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell carcinoma. Secondary - Determine tumor response in these patients. - Determine time to progression in these patients. - Determine overall survival of these patients. Tertiary - Collect data on angiogenesis inhibition induced by sorafenib tosylate. - Collect data on immunomodulatory effects of sorafenib tosylate. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib tosylate (in the absence of grade 3 or 4 dose-limiting toxicity) until a pre-determined dose is reached. Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for VEGF level determination. Blood samples are analyzed for T4/T8, NK, CD25+, and Fox p3 by flow cytometry. Tumor tissue blocks or unstained slides are obtained for chemistry staining of VEGF.</detailed_description>
