	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder in which a mutation in the beta chain of human hemoglobin results in abnormal blood hemoglobin, causing red blood cells to sickle under stress with resulting symptoms including severe pains and strokes. Beta thalassemia is another genetic disorder in which there are abnormal beta hemoglobin chains, causing anemia. In both disorders, frequent red blood cell transfusions may be required to sustain life, but these often result in complications including multiple hospitalizations, iron overload, or bacterial or viral infections such as hepatitis. Standard drugs and therapies used in the treatment of sickle cell disease and/or beta thalassemia provide only supportive care, and may result in long-term side effects, and inadequate control of the disease process. Bone marrow transplant has been increasingly used for the long-term treatment and cure of sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Although, not without acute and potential long term side effects, this alternative offers long term control and potential cure of the disease. Most of the side effects seen with bone marrow transplant are directly related to the high intensity of chemotherapy used (ablative). The primary purpose of this study is to see if giving lower doses of chemotherapy (moderately ablative) will result in successful bone marrow replacement without as severe side-effects but with permanent control of the disease. Patients will receive a chemotherapy regimen with busulfan, fludarabine, and alemtuzumab followed by an infusion of stem cells, either from a family-related or cord-blood matched donor.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Further study details will be provided by Columbia University, Division of Pediatric Blood &amp; Marrow Transplantation. STUDY DESIGN: Patients will receive busulfan, fludarabine and alemtuzumab prior to the stem cell transplant to help the stem cells take and grow. The stem cells will be infused on day 0 through an intravenous catheter. Patients will receive immunosuppressive therapy such as tacrolimus and MMF to prevent graft-versus-disease. Patients will be followed up after transplant to look for special cells in the blood that show that the new bone marrow is taking hold (engrafting). Response shall be documented at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years post-SCT.</detailed_description>
