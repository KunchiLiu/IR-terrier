	<brief_title>Evaluation of Treatment of Fractures of the Humerus With a Plate.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We shall measure the following clinical parameters with the help of the Constant Shoulder Score (CSS) and Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS): 1. Pain 2. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) 3. Range of Motion (ROM) 4. Muscle strength We shall measure the following radiologic parameters: 1. Healing (migration) of tuberculum majus and minus measured with use of MB-RSA 2. Plate migration with use of MB-RSA 3. Bone density in the proximal humerus measured with Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) 4. Correlation between bone density and prosthesis migration (and tuberculum migration)</detailed_description>
