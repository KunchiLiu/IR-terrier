	<brief_summary>Recent studies have demonstrated that patients sub-optimally understand hospital discharge medication instructions Health literacy has been shown to be an important factor in patient understanding of medical information , and following medication instructions. The primary aim of this project is to test the efficacy of a low-literacy discharge medication education tool on medication adherence, and patient knowledge and understanding of inpatient discharge medications, in a low-income population with low health literacy levels. This evaluation is a prospective trial with patients randomly assigned to either receiving this tool or receiving the current standard of care. Given the complexity of the discharge medication regimen for the conditions of congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), and the proven effectiveness of these medications in the post discharge period, this trial will focus on the subpopulation of patients hospitalized with these two conditions.</brief_summary>
