	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of Rimonabant 20mg in comparison to placebo, on HDL and VLDL lipoprotein kinetics, over a 12 months period. Primary objectives: - To assess effect of Rimonabant on HDL ApoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR). Secondary objectives: - To assess effect of Rimonabant on HDL ApoA-I production rate (PR) and on other lipoprotein kinetics. - To assess effect of Rimonabant on lipids, glycemic and inflammatory parameters - To assess effect of Rimonabant on body composition - To assess safety of Rimonabant</brief_summary>
