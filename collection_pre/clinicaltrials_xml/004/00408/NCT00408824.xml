	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome is a highly prevalent disorder, which causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is closely associated with insulin resistance. The alteration of the secretion of adipocytokines from accumulated visceral adipose tissue in the obese induces insulin resistance. The purpose of this study is to identify gene polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to the metabolic syndrome and to make up a new health guidance program based on genetic risk assessment. About 25% of male employees over 45 years old in a certain company are diagnosed with the metabolic syndrome in medical examination. We, the researchers at Nagoya University, will analyze gene polymorphism and various biomarkers of over 3500 company employees.</brief_summary>
