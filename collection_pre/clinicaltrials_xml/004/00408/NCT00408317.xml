	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of ULTRASE® MT20 in Participants With Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (PI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, two-period cross-over, placebo-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Ultrase® MT20 to placebo in participants with CF and pancreatic insufficiency. The study consists of a screening period (up to 11 days) and two treatment periods (6-7 days). During screening period participants will be treated with open-label Ultrase® MT18 or MT20. Each treatment period will be preceded by a stabilization period (4 days) and the two treatment periods are separated by a break period (3-6 days). A safety follow-up visit will be performed 7-10 days after discharge from the last treatment period.</detailed_description>
