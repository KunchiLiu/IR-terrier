	<brief_summary>Primary objectives - To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a risk-adapted protocol that use idarubicin for induction and consolidation therapy in patients with APL. - To evaluate the impact of mitoxantrone reduction on the event-free, disease-free, and overall survival, as well as on the duration of remission and cumulative incidence of relapse in low- and intermediate-risk patients with APL. - To evaluate the impact of the addition of ara-C to idarubicin courses of consolidation for high-risk patients (administered as in the original GIMEMA protocols) on the event-free, disease-free, and overall survival, as well as on the duration of remission and cumulative incidence of relapse. - To evaluate the toxicity of the induction, consolidation, and maintenance chemotherapy in the whole series and in each treatment group in patients with APL. Secondary objectives • To compare all outcomes with those achieved with the PETHEMA LPA99 protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Patients With Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (PETHEMA LPA 2005)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of induction with the simultaneous administration of ATRA (45 mg/m2 day until the RC) and idarubicine (12 mg/m2 days 2, 4, 6 and 8), 3 monthly cycles of consolidation with ATRA (45 mg/m2 days 1-15) and idarubicine (5 mg/m2 days 1-4) in the cycle #1, mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 days 1-3) in the cycle #2 and idarubicine (12 mg/m2 day 1) in the cycle #3. The consolidation was reinforced for the group of patients with intermediate risk by means of an increase of the idarubicine to 7 mg in the cycle #1 and to 2 days in the cycle #3. In the patients of high risk, the consolidation was reinforced with the addition of altar-c in the cycles #1 and #3. For the maintenance treatment, one will administer to intermittent ATRA (15 days every 3 months) and chemotherapy low doses with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurina during two years</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≤ 75 years. ECOG ≤ 3. Morphologic Diagnosis of LPA (FAB M3 or variant M3). Those cases without typical morphology but with PMLRARα reordering also must be including. Genetic Diagnosis: t (15; 17) demonstrated by cariotipo conventional, FISH, PMLRARα reordering detected by RTPCR or a pattern microspeckled demonstrated with antibody antiPML (positive PGM3). Obvious, it will be had the result of these tests once initiated the treatment on the basis of a suspicion diagnoses morphologic Age &gt;75 years (the treatment with this protocol can be considered individually) Absence of PMLRare reordering. To have received previously some type of treatment for LPA, including chemotherapy or retinoides. The previous treatment with corticoids, hidroxiurea or leucoaféresis is not reason for exclusion. To have received chemotherapy or xray for the treatment of a disease vitiates previous. Associate Neoplasia. Serious psychiatric Disease. Seropositividad for VIH. Contraindication to receive intensive chemotherapy, specially antraciclinas. Sérica Creatinina ≥ 2,5 mg/dL (≥ 250 μmol/l).
