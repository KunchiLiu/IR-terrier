	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation in Substance Abuse Treatment Patients: A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of this study are: (1) to examine the efficacy of self-help materials compared to self-help materials plus prize contingency management (CM) for smoking abstinence in substance abuse treatment patients and (2) examine the effects of smoking abstinence on substance use and substance treatment retention. To address these specific aims, cigarette smokers entering treatment for alcohol, cocaine or heroin abuse or dependence, who report daily smoking (at least one cigarette per day) for the past year, and who meet other inclusion and exclusion criteria, are randomly assigned to receive self-help materials or self-help materials plus CM. Individuals in the CM group have the opportunity to win prizes, worth on average $1, $20, or $100, when they meet smoking abstinence criteria (CO &lt; 8ppm and salivary cotinine &lt; 10ng/mL). Participants meet with research staff 4 times/week during Weeks 1-4, 2 times/week during Weeks 5-8 and 1 time/week during Weeks 9-12. Follow-up interviews are scheduled 1, 3 and 6 months following the smoking quit date.</detailed_description>
