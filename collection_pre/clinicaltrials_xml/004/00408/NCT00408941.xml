	<brief_title>EEG and Auditory Evoked Potentials During Local Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spontaneous or evoked electrical brain activity is increasingly used to monitor general anesthesia. During alertness, surgery and anesthesia the quality of AEP recordings may be reduced by artefacts. This poses the question to what extent AEP are sensitive for muscular artefacts. High frequency artefacts can have its seeds in muscles and in technical instruments in the operating room. Therefore, the study will take place under the terms of laboratory. The present study was designed to measure the influence of muscular artefacts on AEP under propofol sedation with or without local anesthesia in the area of the electrodes. If artefacts influence AEP, which are used to measure anesthesia, it is particularly interesting with regard to clinical application. AEP as a measure of "anesthetic depth" may not only reflect brain, but also muscular and high frequency activity. Therefore, while using muscle relaxants, the AEP of an awake patient may indicate deep anesthesia, because muscle signals are absent.</detailed_description>
