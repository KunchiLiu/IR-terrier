	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Adalimumab in Subjects With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab (ADA) in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). The duration of the study was up to 65 weeks, including a Screening Period of up to 3 weeks, a double-blind (DB) placebo-controlled treatment period of up to 52 weeks, and a 70 day follow-up phone call for participants who prematurely discontinued or who did not enroll in the extension study NCT# 00573794 (M10-223). Adult participants with moderate to severe UC (Mayo score of 6 to 12 points with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points), confirmed by colonoscopy with biopsy or flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy, were to be enrolled at approximately 120 sites worldwide. Planned enrollment was 500 participants. Participants were to be stratified by prior exposure to infliximab and/or other anti-TNF agents, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ADA or placebo by subcutaneous injection. Participants assigned to the ADA treatment arm were to receive an induction dose of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week (eow) starting at Week 4. Participants assigned to the placebo treatment arm were to receive matching placebo during the same period of time. At or after Week 10, participants who met the criteria for inadequate response could be switched to open-label (OL) ADA 40 mg eow beginning at Week 12. Inadequate response was defined as: - Partial Mayo score greater than or equal to Baseline score on 2 consecutive visits at least 14 days apart (for participants with a partial Mayo score of 4 to 7 at Baseline). - Partial Mayo score greater than or equal to 7 on 2 consecutive visits at least 14 days apart (for participants with a partial Mayo score of 8 or 9 at Baseline). Participants who demonstrated inadequate response at 2 consecutive visits at least 14 days apart while on OL administration ADA 40 mg eow were permitted to dose escalate to ADA 40 mg weekly (ew). Participants with persistent inadequate response while on ADA 40 mg ew may have been discontinued from the study at the Investigator's discretion. Upon completion of the study, participants had the option to enroll into the OL extension Study M10-223 in which they could receive ADA treatment. Efficacy and safety measurements were performed throughout the study. A follow-up phone call was made 70 days after the last dose of study drug to obtain information on any ongoing or new adverse events (AEs) for all participants who terminated early or who did not enroll in the OL extension study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Participants &gt;=18 years of age and in good health (Investigator discretion) with a recent stable medical history 2. Diagnosis of UC for greater than 90 days prior to Baseline 3. Diagnosis of active UC confirmed by colonoscopy with biopsy or flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy during the Screening Period, with exclusion of infection 4. Active UC with a Mayo score of 6 to 12 points and endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, despite concurrent treatment with at least 1 of the following (oral corticosteroids or immunosuppressants or both as defined below): Stable oral corticosteroid dose (prednisone &gt;= 20 mg/day or equivalent) for at least 14 days prior to Baseline or maintenance, corticosteroid dose (prednisone &lt; 20 mg/day or equivalent) for at least 40 days prior to Baseline and/or At least a 90 day course of azathioprine (AZA) or 6mercaptopurine (6MP) prior to Baseline, with a dose of AZA &gt;= 1.5 mg/kg/day or 6MP &gt;= 1 mg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest available tablet formulation), or a dose that is the highest tolerated by the participant (e.g., due to leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, nausea) during that time. Participant must be on a stable dose for at least 28 days prior to Baseline. Concurrent therapy was not required for participants who were previously treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants (AZA or 6MP) during the past 5 years and in the judgment of the Investigator have failed to respond to, or could not tolerate, their treatment. 5. Participants may have been included if they had previously used an antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent (except ADA) and discontinued its use due to a loss of response or intolerance to the agent. 6. Had to be able to selfadminister or had caregiver who could reliably administer subcutaneous (SC) injections. 7. Had to be able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with the requirements of the study protocol. 8. Female had to be either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), or of childbearing potential and practicing an approved method of birth control throughout the study and for 150 days after the last dose of study drug. Examples of approved methods of birth control included the following: Condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm, or intrauterine device Oral, parenteral, intravaginal contraceptives for 90 days prior to study drug administration A vasectomized partner The results of the serum pregnancy test performed at the Screening Visit and urine pregnancy test performed at the Baseline Visit must have been negative. 9. Judged to be in generally good health as determined by the Investigator 1. History of subtotal colectomy with ileorectostomy or colectomy with ileoanal pouch, Koch pouch, or ileostomy for UC, or planned bowel surgery. 2. Received previous treatment with ADA or previous participation in an ADA clinical study. 3. Received cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil within 30 days of Baseline. 4. Received intravenous (IV) corticosteroids within 14 days of Screening or during the Screening Period. 5. Received therapeutic enema or suppository, other than required for endoscopy, within 14 days of the Screening endoscopy and during the remainder of the Screening Period. 6. Current diagnosis of fulminant colitis and/or toxic megacolon. 7. Disease limited to the rectum (ulcerative proctitis). 8. Current diagnosis of indeterminate colitis. 9. Current diagnosis and/or history of Crohns disease (CD). 10. Currently receiving total parenteral nutrition. 11. Used aminosalicylates for &lt; 90 days before Baseline or not on a stable dose for at least 28 days before Baseline or discontinued use within 28 days of Baseline. 12. Positive Clostridium difficile stool assay. 13. Previously used infliximab or any antiTNF agent within 56 days of Baseline. 14. Previously used infliximab or any antiTNF agent without clinical response at any time ("primary nonresponder") unless subject experienced a treatmentlimiting reaction. 15. Infections requiring treatment with IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 30 days of Baseline or oral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 14 days of Baseline. 16. History of malignancy other than a successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma and/or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix. If the Screening colonoscopy/flexible sigmoidoscopy showed evidence of dysplasia or a malignancy, subject was not to be enrolled in the study. 17. History of listeria, histoplasmosis, chronic or active hepatitis B infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), immunodeficiency syndrome, central nervous system demyelinating disease, or untreated tuberculosis (TB). 18.

Poorly controlled medical condition(s), such as uncontrolled diabetes, unstable ischemic heart disease, moderate to severe congestive heart failure (CHF), recent cerebrovascular accident, and any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, put the subject at risk by participation in the protocol. 20. Received any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half lives prior to Baseline (whichever was longer). 21. History of clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse during the past year. 22. Known hypersensitivity to the excipients of ADA as stated in the label. 23.
