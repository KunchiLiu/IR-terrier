	<brief_title>is Dietary Manipulation of Human Milk Total Fat and Caloric Content Feasible?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to verify whether dietary manipulations in lactating women allow increasing the fat and caloric content of human milk. specifically, we will test the following hypotheses:1) at constant caloric intake, 2 high fat (40% fat, 45% CHO) diets ( margarine e nriched versus butter enriched) lead to higher fat and caloric content of human milk than the low fat diet (5% fat, 80% CHO); and 2) All 3 groups will have strikingly different milk fatty acid profiles (mirroring the dietary fatty acid profile).</detailed_description>
