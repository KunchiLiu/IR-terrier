	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying different combination chemotherapy regimens and their side effects and comparing how well they work in treating young patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine, through randomization, the relative safety and efficacy of the addition of nelarabine (Compound 506U78) to augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (BFM) therapy (Regimen C, Children's Cancer Group [CCG]-1961). II. To determine the relative safety and efficacy of high dose methotrexate (5 g/m^2) with leucovorin (leucovorin calcium) rescue compared to escalating methotrexate without leucovorin rescue plus pegaspargase (Capizzi I) delivered during interim maintenance. III. To gain preliminary data on the use of nelarabine in patients with high risk T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and its effect on long-term survival. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the relative safety and efficacy of withholding radiation in patients with low risk T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), while treating Intermediate and high risk patients with 1200 cGy of prophylactic cranial radiation. OUTLINE: INDUCTION THERAPY: (weeks 1-5) Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; vincristine sulfate IV and daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; prednisone IV or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28; pegaspargase intramuscularly (IM) or IV over 1-2 hours on day 4, 5, OR 6; and methotrexate (MTX) IT on days 8 and 29*. Patients with Down syndrome (DS) also receive leucovorin calcium PO at 48 and 60 hours after each MTX dose (DS patients excluded as of 09/29/10). After completion of induction therapy, patients undergo risk assessment. Patients with M1 marrow and minimal residual disease (MRD) &lt; 1% (defined as low- and intermediate-risk) proceed to consolidation therapy at day 36 or when blood counts recover (whichever occurs later). Patients with M2 marrow (5-25% blasts) and/or MRD &gt;= 1% (defined as high-risk) proceed to consolidation therapy as soon as possible (i.e., they should not wait until day 36 or for blood counts to recover). Patients with M3 marrow (&gt;= 25% blasts) (defined as induction failure) proceed to consolidation therapy as soon as possible. NOTE: *Patients with CNS3 disease also receive MTX IT on days 15 and 22. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: (weeks 6-13) During the safety phase portion of the study, patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk disease are randomized to arms I or III. Patients with high-risk disease are randomized to arms I, II, III, or IV. (safety phase closed for accrual as of 09/29/10) During the efficacy phase portion of the study, patients with low-risk* disease are randomized to arms I and III. Patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk** disease are randomized to arms I, II, III, or IV. The safety phase ends when the first 20 high-risk patients to receive nelarabine have been evaluated. Patients with DS are nonrandomly assigned to arm I (DS patients excluded as of 09/29/10). Patients with induction failure*** are nonrandomly assigned to arm IV. NOTE: *Patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-NHL) are nonrandomly assigned to arm I. NOTE: ** Patients with T-NHL are randomly assigned to arms I or II without cranial radiotherapy. NOTE: *** Patients with T-NHL are nonrandomly assigned to arm II. ARM I: Patients receive MTX IT on days 1, 8, 15, and 22*; cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 29; cytarabine IV over 15-30 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-4, 8-11, 29-32, and 36-39; mercaptopurine PO on days 1-14 and 29-42; vincristine sulfate IV on days 15, 22, 43 and 50; and pegaspargase IM or IV over 1-2 hours on days 15 and 43.
