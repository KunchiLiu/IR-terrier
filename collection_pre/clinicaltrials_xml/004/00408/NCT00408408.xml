	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of breast cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving chemotherapy and bevacizumab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving bevacizumab after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying six different chemotherapy regimens to compare how well they work with or without bevacizumab in treating women with stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Women With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the efficacy of docetaxel followed by doxorubicin hydrocloride and cyclophosphamide (AC) vs docetaxel and capecitabine followed by AC vs docetaxel and gemcitabine hydrochloride followed by AC, with or without bevacizumab, in terms of an increase in the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast, in women with palpable or operable breast cancer. Secondary - Compare docetaxel/capecitabine with AC vs docetaxel/gemcitabine hydrochloride with AC vs docetaxel with AC, with or without bevacizumab, in terms of the rate of pCR in the breast and all post-therapy lymph nodes evaluated histologically (pCR breast and nodes). - Determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to the docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimens (docetaxel with AC, docetaxel and capecitabine with AC, and docetaxel and gemcitabine hydrochloride with AC) will increase the rate of pCR of the breast and nodes compared to the same docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimens without bevacizumab in these patients. - Determine whether the addition of capecitabine or gemcitabine hydrochloride to docetaxel, with or without bevacizumab, will increase the rate of clinical overall response (cOR) compared to docetaxel alone with or without bevacizumab in these patients. - Determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to the docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimens will increase the rate of cOR compared to the same docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimens without bevacizumab in these patients. - Determine whether the addition of capecitabine or gemcitabine hydrochloride to docetaxel, with or without bevacizumab, will increase the rate of clinical complete response (cCR) compared to docetaxel alone with or without bevacizumab in these patients. - Determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to the docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimens (docetaxel with AC, docetaxel/capecitabine with AC, and docetaxel/gemcitabine hydrochloride with AC) will increase the rate of cCR compared to the same docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimens without bevacizumab in these patients. - Identify gene expression profiles that can predict pCR in patients treated with the different sequential docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimens with or without bevacizumab. - Identify gene expression profiles that can predict cOR in patients treated with docetaxel alone, docetaxel/capecitabine, or docetaxel/gemcitabine hydrochloride with or without bevacizumab. - Determine the accuracy of an in vitro chemoresponse assay (ChemoFx®) as a predictor of pCR in patients treated with the different sequential docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimens without bevacizumab. - Determine the accuracy of ChemoFx® as a predictor of cOR in patients treated with docetaxel alone, docetaxel/capecitabine, or docetaxel/gemcitabine hydrochloride without bevacizumab in these patients. - Determine the impact of preoperative bevacizumab and sequential chemotherapy regimens and postoperative bevacizumab therapy on cardiac function in these patients. - Determine the impact of bevacizumab on surgical complications in these patients. - Determine the toxicity of the preoperative regimens and the toxicity of postoperative bevacizumab in these patients. - Compare the docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimens with vs without bevacizumab, in terms of an increase in disease-free survival, of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor size (2-4 cm vs &gt; 4 cm), nodal status (negative vs positive), hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER]-positive and/or progesterone-receptor [PgR]-positive vs ER- and PgR-negative), and age (&lt; 50 years vs ≥ 50 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 treatment arms. Core needle biopsies are performed at baseline. Tumor tissue samples are also collected during definitive surgery. Samples are examined for gene expression and polymorphism by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and chemoresponse assay (ChemoFx®). After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 10 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,200 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB)approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines for the study treatment and submission of preentry core biopsy material for correlative studies. Patients must be female. Patients must be 18 years of age or older. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy. The primary breast tumor must be palpable and measure greater than or equal to 2.0 cm on physical exam. All patients must have their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. The LVEF must be greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the cardiac imaging facility performing the study. Note: If the cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value. Note: Since the preentry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 75%, the investigator should have the study reviewed for accuracy prior to study entry. Following study entry, the LVEF determination may be reviewed up until the time of the postchemotherapy (preoperative) evaluation. Please note that if a more accurate value is obtained from the review of the baseline MUGA or echocardiogram, the correct value must be submitted to the NSABP before the postchemotherapy (preoperative) MUGA or echocardiogram is performed or it cannot be used for managing postoperative bevacizumab. All patients must have an EKG within 3 months prior to study entry. At the time of randomization: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1200/mm3. Platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. Hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 10 g/dL. There must be evidence of adequate hepatic function by these criteria: Total bilirubin must be less than or equal to the ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) resulting from Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome due to slow conjugation of bilirubin; and Alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than or equal 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than or equal the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than or equal 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal ULN. Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scans do not demonstrate metastatic disease. Suspicious findings on bone scan must be confirmed as benign by xray, MRI, or biopsy. Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging does not demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate bone marrow and liver function results as described above are met. The following criteria for evidence of adequate renal function must be met: Serum creatinine less than or equal ULN for the lab. Calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than 50 mL/min. Urine protein/urine creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0. Patient must be able to swallow oral medications.
