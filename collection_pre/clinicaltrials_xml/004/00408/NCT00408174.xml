Intermittent use of oral or rectal immunosuppressive therapy or corticosteroids within 30 days of screening is permitted.

Subjects with history of hepatitis B and C will be eligible provided the screening LFTs are within normal limits. subject has other infectious, ischemic, or immunologic diseases with GI involvement. subject has twice the upper limit of normal (ULN) for any of the following LFTs: alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin (except isolated elevation of unconjugated bilirubin). subject has uncontrolled, clinically significant renal disease manifested by 1.5 Ã— ULN of serum creatinine. subject has calculated creatinine clearance level of less than or equal to 60 mL/min. subject has unstable cardiovascular, coagulopathy or pulmonary disease characterized by a worsening in the disease condition that required a change in treatment or medical care within one (1) month of randomization. subject has active malignancy within the last 5 years, except basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or if female, in situ cervical carcinoma that has been surgically excised. subject has any condition or circumstance that would, in the opinion of the investigator, prevent completion of the study or interfere with analysis of study results, including history of noncompliance with treatments or visits. subject has sclerosing cholangitis. subject has positive stool culture for ovum and parasites (O&amp;P) or C. difficile. subject has been treated with infliximab, cyclosporine, natalizumab, or methotrexate for ulcerative colitis within the last 30 days prior to screening. regular use of NSAIDS except cardioprotective ASA (i.e., less than or equal to 162 mg ASA per day). subject has received celldepleting therapies such as the Adacolumn. subject requires antidiarrheal therapy during screening. subject has clinical or radiographic findings suggestive of serious UC complications such as toxic megacolon or colonic perforation.</criteria>
