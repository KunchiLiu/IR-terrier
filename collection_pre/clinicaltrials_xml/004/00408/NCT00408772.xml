	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy and bevacizumab before surgery or radiofrequency ablation may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving oxaliplatin and capecitabine together with bevacizumab followed by surgery and/or radiofrequency ablation works in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver and cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine, and Bevacizumab Followed By Surgery and/or Radiofrequency Ablation in Patients With Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the conversion rate of nonresectable disease to resectable disease in patients with nonresectable liver metastases secondary to colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant therapy comprising oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and bevacizumab followed by hepatic resection and/or radiofrequency ablation. - Evaluate progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Determine disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: - Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and bevacizumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until conversion to resectable disease. - Surgery and/or radiofrequency ablation (RFA): Patients undergo hepatic resection (with or without RFA) when tumor is deemed resectable. Patients with stable (&lt; 8 lesions) and unresectable disease undergo laparoscopic or percutaneous RFA. RFA repeats once 4-6 weeks later. - Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 6-8 weeks after surgery and/or RFA, patients may receive adjuvant therapy comprising oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and bevacizumab, as in neoadjuvant therapy, for up to 4 courses. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
