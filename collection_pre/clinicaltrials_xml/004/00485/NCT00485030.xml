	<brief_title>Diffuse Type In-Stent Restenosis After Drug-Eluting Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite a significant reduction of angiographic restenosis and the need for repeat revascularization after introduction of DES, post-DES restenosis still occur and the treatment for DES failure is challenging. However, there have been little data for therapeutic strategy for post-DES restenosis, especially diffuse type ISR. Therefore, we need the well-designed randomized trial to achieve the best therapeutic option for the treatment of diffuse type post-DES restenosis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The patient must be at least 18 years of age. 2. Restenosis after drugeluting stents (&gt;50% by visual estimate) 3. Lesion length â‰¥ 10 mm (diffuse type ISR) 4. Patients with stable (CCS class 1 to 4) or acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina pectoris Braunwald class IB, IC, IIB, IIC, IIIB, IIIC or NSTEMI) or patients with atypical chest pain or without symptoms but having documented myocardial ischemia, amenable to stentassisted percutaneous coronary intervention 5. The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical and angiographic followup, and provides informed, written consent, as approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee of the respective clinical site. 1. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following medications: Heparin Aspirin Both Clopidogrel and TIclopidine Sirolimus eluting stent Stainless steel and/or Contrast media (patients with documented sensitivity to contrast which can be effectively premedicated with steroids and diphenhydramine [e.g. rash] may be enrolled. Patients with true anaphylaxis to prior contrast media, however, should not be enrolled). 2. Systemic (intravenous) Sirolimus use within 12 months. 3. Female of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative, who possibly plan to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study. 4. History of bleeding diathesis or known coagulopathy (including heparininduced thrombocytopenia), or will refuse blood transfusions. 5. Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the prior 3 months, or major surgery within 2 months. 6. Current known current platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or Hgb &lt;10 g/dL. 7. Noncardiac comorbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that may result in protocol noncompliance (per site investigator's medical judgment). 8. Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational study, which have not completed the primary endpoint followup period. 9. Patients with EF&lt;30%. 10. Acute MI patients within symptom onset &lt; 12 hours needing primary angioplasty 11. Creatinine level 3.0mg/dL or dependence on dialysis. 12. Severe hepatic dysfunction (AST and ALT 3 times upper normal reference values). 13. Patients with left main stem stenosis and left main instent restenosis created by DES(&gt;50% by visual estimate)</criteria>
