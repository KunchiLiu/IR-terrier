	<brief_title>The OMEGA Study: Use of Eye Drops to Treat Geographic Atrophy Associated With Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Dry AMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) results in severe, irreversible central vision loss and is the leading cause of blindness in individuals older than 50 years in the western world. The vast majority of AMD patients have the 'dry' (non-exudative) form that is characterized by the presence of drusen and atrophic changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Dry AMD may remain static or progress slowly to produce areas of geographic atrophy (GA), the advanced or late-stage form of dry AMD. GA is a severe vision-threatening lesion of the macula that may impair visual function, impact daily life activities, and result in blindness. Currently, there is no approved treatment for dry AMD or GA. Pre-clinical results have shown that OT-551 may protect RPE cells and photoreceptors from oxidative damage and block angiogenesis stimulated by VEGF and other growth factors, and therefore is a therapeutic candidate for treating GA.</detailed_description>
