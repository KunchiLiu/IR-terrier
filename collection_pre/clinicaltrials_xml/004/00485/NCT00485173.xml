	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational implant (INFUSE® Bone Graft/PEEK Interbody Spacer/Anterior Cervical Plate) as a method of facilitating spinal fusion at a single level from C3-C7 in patients with symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INFUSE® Bone Graft/ PEEK Interbody Spacer/ Anterior Cervical Plate Pivotal Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pivotal clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of INFUSE® Bone Graft with the PEEK Interbody Spacer and Anterior Cervical Plate in patients with symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD). The implant under investigation in this clinical trial is INFUSE® Bone Graft, the PEEK Interbody Spacer, and Anterior Cervical Plate. The device will be implanted using an anterior surgical approach. Safety and effectiveness data for patients in this study will be compared to that of historical controls. Historical control data will be taken from the control arms of the following Medtronic studies: (1) the Artificial Cervical Disc (also known as PRESTIGE® Cervical Disc System) pivotal IDE trial (NCT00642876) and (2) the BRYAN® Cervical Disc System pivotal IDE trial (NCT00437190).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION: 1. Singlelevel cervical degenerative disc disease (from C3C7) requiring surgical treatment and involving intractable radiculopathy and/or myelopathy. 2. Herniated disc and/or osteophyte formation at the level to be treated that is producing symptomatic nerve root and/or spinal cord compression. 3. Unresponsive to nonoperative treatment for six weeks or has the presence of progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root/spinal cord compression in the face of continued nonoperative management. 4. At least 18 years of age and skeletally mature at the time of surgery. 5. A preoperative Neck Disability Index (NDI) score ≥30. 6. A preoperative neck pain score (pain intensity + pain frequency) ≥8 (out of 20) based on the preoperative Neck and Arm Pain Questionnaire. 7. If a female of childbearing potential, patient is not pregnant or nursing and agrees not to become pregnant for one year following surgery. 8. Is willing and able to comply with the study plan and able to understand and sign the Patient Informed Consent Form. EXCLUSION: 1. A cervical spinal condition other than symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease requiring surgical treatment at the involved level. 2. Documented or diagnosed cervical instability at the target level, defined by dynamic (flexion/extension) radiographs. 3. Previous surgical intervention at the involved level. 4. Any subsequent planned/staged surgical procedure at the involved or adjacent level(s). 5. Fused level adjacent to the level to be treated. 6. Severe pathology of the facet joints of the involved vertebral bodies. 7. Has osteoporosis, osteopenia, or osteomalacia as determined by DEXA scan. 8. Presence of active malignancy or prior history of malignancy (except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin). 9. Overt or active bacterial infection, either local or systemic. 10. Insulin dependent diabetes. 11. Chronic or acute renal failure or prior history of renal disease. 12. Documented allergy or intolerance to stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), or tantalum. 13. Is mentally incompetent. (if questionable, obtain psychiatric consult.) 14. Is a prisoner. 15. Is an alcohol and/or drug abuser as defined by currently undergoing treatment for alcohol and/or drug abuse. 16. On oral or injectable steroids for 6 weeks or more at the time of enrollment. 17. A history of autoimmune disease. 18. History of exposure to injectable collagen or silicone implants. 19. History of hypersensitivity to protein pharmaceuticals (monoclonal antibodies or gamma globulins) or collagen. 20. Received any previous exposure to any/all BMPs either human or animal extraction. 21. History of allergy to bovine products. 22. History of any allergy resulting in anaphylaxis. 23. History of an endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis (e.g., Paget's Disease, renal osteodystrophy, EhlersDanlos Syndrome, or osteogenesis imperfecta). 24. Condition that requires postoperative medications that interfere with the stability of the implant, such as steroids. 25. Received treatment with an investigational therapy (drug, device, or biologic) within 28 days prior to implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 24month period following the study surgery.</criteria>
