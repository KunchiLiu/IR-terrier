	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare two therapeutical strategies concerning the combination therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin) in na誰ve patients with chronic hepatitis C of genotype 1. "Reference" strategy corresponding to standards of care recommended by the French consensus conference versus "Test" strategy corresponding to adaptation strategy of ribavirin dose during the first week according to AUC (area under the curve) of ribavirin plasmatic concentration after the first intake (Day 0) of 600 mg</brief_summary>
