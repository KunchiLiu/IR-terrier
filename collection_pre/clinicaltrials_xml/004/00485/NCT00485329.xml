	<brief_title>Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of DERMASTREAM™ - ENZYSTREAM™ System for the Treatment of Chronic Venous Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I/II prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose escalating, three patient-group study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DermaStream™ - EnzyStream™ System in non-healing lower extremity chronic venous ulcers patients. The DermaStream™ - EnzyStream™ System will be evaluated during continues streaming of 3 different doses of EnzystreamTM (papain based) solution given in an escalating order (15,000, 30,000 and 60,000 papain USP units/ml) up to 5 consecutive treatment days. Each treatment session lasts for 6 hours. This study is a Multi center trial. It is anticipated that three (3) sites will enroll subjects into this study. Overall, forty eight (48) patients will be recruited, and randomly allocated to placebo or EnzyStream™ treatment in each study dose group prior to EnzyStream™ administration. The ratio of drug to placebo treated patients will be 4;1, namely 12 patients will be administered with EnzyStream™ solution and 4 patients will be placebo treated in each of the three respective EnzyStream™ dose groups. Treatment will start with the lowest dose (15,000 papain USP units/ml) administered over a 6 hour period followed with saline wash for an additional half an hour. The treatment dose will be increased to the next highest dose, for the next patients group only following safety analysis, and the procedure will be repeated. The treatment period will be followed by a 3 month follow up period. During the follow up period patients will be observed for every 2 weeks during the first month and once a month (every 20 days) during the 2 additional months (allowing a time window of ± 3 days).</detailed_description>
