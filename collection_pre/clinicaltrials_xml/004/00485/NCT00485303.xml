	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone in Participants With Prostate Cancer Who Failed Androgen Deprivation and Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study to evaluate the anti-tumor activities and safety of abiraterone acetate in participants with prostate cancer who have failed androgen deprivation and docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Abiraterone acetate oral tablet will be administered as a total dose of 1000 milligram (mg) orally (by mouth) once daily after an overnight fast and prednisone/prednisolone will be administered as 5 mg oral tablet twice daily. Participants will be enrolled and treated up to 12 cycles (or longer, if they have not progressed and continue to benefit from treatment). The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening (14 days), Open-label Treatment; and follow-up (up to 60 months). Participants will be evaluated primarily for prostate specific antigen response according to Prostate Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criteria. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
