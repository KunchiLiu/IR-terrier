	<brief_summary>Ropinirole Hydrochloride (ROP) was granted approval for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD) on 20 October 2006. ROP is expected to be used for a long term in clinical practice. However, no long-term clinical data with ROP administered three times daily are currently available from Japanese patients, and the clinical experience with ROP at &gt;10mg/day is limited. For this reason, this study was designed as a multicenter open-label uncontrolled study. This study will evaluate the long-term efficacy (Japanese Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Awake time spent "Off"/"On", Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage, Schwab-England scale, Proportion of subjects remaining in this study and Clinical Global Impression (CGI)) and the long-term safety of ROP administered three times daily for in PD patients.</brief_summary>
