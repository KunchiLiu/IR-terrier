	<brief_summary>The trial is aimed to investigate an orthodontic treatment with a new removable-part-time-wearing appliance, based on "High-Tech" technology. The appliance should be wear only 12-14 hours a day, and is made of a single silicone aligner, made specifically for the patient, using 3-D screening technology of the patient's malocclusion. The aligner has a designed pathway "built-in" for the tooth to move, from the original position of the malocclusion to the "end point" - the correct position. The force system, that is needed in order to generate tooth movement, is produced by tiny air-balloons which are incorporated in the aligner. The study hypothesis is, that an orthodontic treatment can be done successfully with this part-time wearing appliance.</brief_summary>
