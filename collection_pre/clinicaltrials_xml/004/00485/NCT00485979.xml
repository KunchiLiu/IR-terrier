	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate by treatment arm (according to Chevallier criteria). The secondary objectives are: - to assess in each treatment arm the clinical Response Rate (RR), the rate of breast conservation, the Progression-Free Survival (PFS), the Overall Survival (OS), the safety and tolerability profile, the pathological Complete Response rate (pCR) according to NSABP and Sataloff criteria, - to rank docetaxel and larotaxel alone in Her2 -ve patients, or combined with trastuzumab in Her2 +ve patients, according to the pCR rate.</brief_summary>
