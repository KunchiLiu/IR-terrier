	<brief_summary>The reason why esophagus varices suddenly rupture and start to bleed is unclear. Food intake increase the hepatic blood flow and the portal pressure, but it is yet unknown if there is also an increase in variceal pressure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a meal on variceal pressure with a non invasive endoscopic measurement device, and compare it with portal pressure.</brief_summary>
