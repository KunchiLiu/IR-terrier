	<brief_summary>This study was designed to determine whether post-operative pain following a tonsillectomy can be reduced by adding an antacid-like medication to the medications taken after surgery. It is hypothesized that even a small amount of stomach acid backing up and entering the mouth can increase post-tonsillectomy pain. Therefore, the use of an antacid-like medication should help to decrease pain and reduce the amount of narcotic medication required for pain control.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study has been limited to children and adolescents ages 5-18 who are undergoing tonsillectomy for an indication of obstructive sleep disturbance (snoring, choking/gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep.) Study participants will be randomized to two groups: study medication (Lansoprazole) or an inactive substance(placebo). Participants will be asked to do all of the following: 1. Take the study medication twice a day for 14 days. 2. Keep a log book which will include: - Record the medications and amount of each medication taken each day for 14 days. This includes pain medication and the study drug. - Record your child's activity level daily for 14 days. - Collect your child's urine one time daily and test it using special medicated strips to monitor their daily liquid intake for 14 days. 3. Meet with a Research Assistant or Study Physician 14-21 days after the study to collect the log book and perform a post-operative examination.</detailed_description>
