	<detailed_description>Our aim is to investigate the incidence of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) signs and evaluate the relationship of IFIS signs as well as complete IFIS with pseudoexfoliation, diabetes, hypertension, and alpha-1 adrenergic blocker (A1AB) use. Five-hundred patients will be included in this prospective study. Preoperatively, pupil diameter before and after dilation, presence of pseudoexfoliation, history of diabetes, hypertension, and use of any A1AB will be recorded. Intraoperative adverse events such as pupillary constriction, iris billowing, and iris prolapse from the wound will be noted. Multinomial regression analysis will be used to evaluate the relationship of IFIS signs with pseudoexfoliation, diabetes, hypertension, and A1AB usage. According to the results we will determine the incidence of IFIS in our patient population and evaluate its relationship with alpha-1 adrenergic blocker use. We will also investigate the relationship of floppy iris problems with pseudoexfoliation, diabetes, high blood pressure.</detailed_description>
