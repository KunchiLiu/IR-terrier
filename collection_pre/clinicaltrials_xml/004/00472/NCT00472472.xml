	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Coated Balloon Catheter for Prevention of Restenosis in Femoropopliteal Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Treatment of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the femoropopliteal arteries by percutaneous intervention is still limited by high rates of restenosis. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel method of short time local drug delivery based on a paclitaxel-coated balloon in femoropopliteal arteries. Methods and results: The double-blind and randomized study enrolled n=79 patients with occlusion or stenosis of femoropopliteal arteries. Inclusion criteria were clinical Rutherford stage 1-5, occlusion or hemodynamic relevant stenosis (â‰¥ 70 % diameter) of femoropopliteal arteries and successful guiding wire recanalization. The primary endpoint was the late lumen loss after 6 months follow-up as seen in angiography. Secondary endpoints included the rate of restenosis (a binary variable), change of ankle brachial index (ABI), rutherford class and major adverse events.</detailed_description>
