	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the afamelanotide (CUV1647) formulation is effective in preventing PLE episodes or reducing the severity of PLE symptoms in patients with a well documented history of the disease. The study also aims to determine whether treatment with afamelanotide (CUV1647) can reduce the use of rescue medication in this group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Trial of CUV1647 in Polymorphic Light Eruption (PLE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polymorphic Light Eruption (PLE) is a prevalent photosensitivity disorder, occurring in up to 20% of the European and US populations and up to 5% of the Australian population. The disease is characterised by a rash that is intensely itchy with blisters, bumps and patches presenting on areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun. There is a lack of effective treatment available for the condition but the most common available forms of therapy include sun avoidance and the use of the use of steroids and/or phototherapy.</detailed_description>
