	<brief_summary>This is an open label extension study of romiplostim for treatment of thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤ 50 x 10^9/L) in MDS subjects. The study is designed to assess the long-term safety of treatment with romiplostim, as measured by incidence of overall adverse events, the incidence of bleeding events, the utilization of platelet transfusions, and the duration of platelet response. The study will further describe the time to disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and survival.</brief_summary>
