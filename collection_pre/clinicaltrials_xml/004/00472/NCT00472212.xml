	<brief_summary>Hyperopia (farsightedness) has been reported to be associated with reduced visual perceptual and reading abilities. However, there is controversy regarding whether or not to prescribe for low to moderate amounts of hyperopia. The Correction of Hyperopia In Children Study (CHICS) is a placebo-controlled, randomized, masked investigation of the effect of spectacle correction for moderate amounts of hyperopia on visual function, symptoms, attention, and reading skills in children.</brief_summary>
