	<brief_summary>Cancer and its complications are common problems. In most cases, this condition has a profound impact on survival and quality of life (QoL).

However, these symptoms also are seen in men with other conditions including those with low testosterone levels. The objective of this study is to determine the number of male patients with cancer that have low testosterone levels and to establish the relationship between testosterone levels and the symptoms that these patients experience.</brief_summary>
