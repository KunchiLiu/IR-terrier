	<brief_title>Use of EMG to Assess Clinical Hypertonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: Qualitative surface EMG measurement during passive movement will increase the inter-rater reliability of clinicians for diagnosis of spasticity and dystonia in children with hypertonia. Specific Aims: 1. Develop a handheld surface EMG device with auditory output that can be used similarly to a stethoscope to listen non-invasively to the activity of muscles. 2. Provide clinicians at 5 different institutions with a device to test for 2 months in their own clinics. 3. Bring all 5 clinicians to Stanford University for a single-day exercise in which each clinician will examine 10 children with hypertonia. Each clinician will rate the children without using the device, and then again with the device. Intra-class correlations and kappa statistics will be used to assess whether the use of the device leads to improved inter-rater reliability.</detailed_description>
