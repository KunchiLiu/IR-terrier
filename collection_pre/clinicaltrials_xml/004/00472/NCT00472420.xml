	<brief_summary>This single arm study will evaluate the benefit of adding MabThera to standard induction chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma. The safety and tolerability of a MabThera-containing first line regimen will also be assessed. All patients will receive MabThera (375mg/m2 iv) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles, in combination with standard chemotherapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
