	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is the examine the precision of acceleromyography and mechanomyography during recovery from a neuromuscular blocking agent and to examine whether there is any difference in monitoring block at the dominant or non-dominant arm. Our hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in neither the precision nor the level of block in the contralateral arms.</brief_summary>
