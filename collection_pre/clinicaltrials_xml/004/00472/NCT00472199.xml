	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the current study will be the evaluation of long-term efficacy of a 26-weeks treatment with pramipexole in patients with idiopathic moderate to severe Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in comparison to placebo. The key secondary objectives are to assess the effects on clinical global impressions - global improvement (CGI-I) (based on CGI-I responder rate) and on RLS (based on IRLS responder rate) for 26 weeks under pramipexole in comparison to placebo. Further secondary objectives are to investigate the incidence and severity of augmentation and rebound and to assess the effects on patient global impression (PGI) (based on PGI responder rate), on RLS symptoms (based on the RLS-6 scales), on associated mood disturbance (based on item 10 of the IRLS), on pain in limbs (based on a visual analogue scale (VAS)), on quality of life in RLS (based on Johns Hopkins RLS-QoL), on general quality of life Short Form 36 (SF-36) and on safety (based on adverse events (AE) profile) of pramipexole in comparison to placebo.</brief_summary>
