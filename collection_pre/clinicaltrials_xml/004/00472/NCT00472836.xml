	<brief_summary>CP-945,598 is eliminated following extensive metabolism. For some drugs, decreased renal (kidney) function can affect their elimination from the body via metabolism. This study will therefore compare the pharmacokinetics (time course of drug concentrations in the body), safety and tolerability of CP-945,598 in patients with severe renal impairment and healthy control subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Examining The Effect Of Renal Impairment On Safety, Toleration And How The Body Processes An Experimental Drug</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Normal Subjects: 1.Healthy. 2.Matched for age (± 5 yrs), weight (± 10 kg), and gender ratio (± 2 subjects per gender). Subjects with Renal Disease: 1. Severe impairment (Creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) 2. Stable renal disease:no change in the last 30 days. 3. Stable dose of medication and/or treatment. 4. Reasonably wellcontrolled type 1 and type 2 diabetics All subjects: Nonprescribed use of drugs of abuse/ recreational drugs; recent treatment with experimental drugs or herbal experiments; EKG and blood pressure parameters falling outside of protocolspecified limits; history of regular alcohol or tobacco use exceeding protocolspecified limits Normal subjects: Medically important health conditions; recent use of prescription or nonprescription medications. Subjects with renal disease: Subjects requiring dialysis; certain chronic medical conditions; patients who have received renal transplant; severe and/or poorly controlled diabetes; Treatment with protocolspecified drugs that may alter the way the body absorbs or processes CP945,598.</criteria>
