	<brief_title>Vandetanib and Radiation Therapy in Treating Young Patients With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Brainstem Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vandetanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving vandetanib together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. Patients undergo conformal radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Patients also receive oral vandetanib once daily beginning on the same day as radiotherapy and continuing for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vandetanib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic studies, polymorphism analysis (e.g., CYP3A4/5), and immunological laboratory methods (e.g., western blot assay). Imaging studies are also conducted periodically.</detailed_description>
