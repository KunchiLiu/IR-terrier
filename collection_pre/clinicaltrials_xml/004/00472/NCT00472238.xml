	<brief_summary>A severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction is associated with increased mortality due to pump failure as well as to malignant ventricular arrhythmia. We hypothesize that targeted training may lead to improved survival and to increased parameters of risk stratification for malignant arrhythmia. Additionally, the training may lead to an improved psychological and mental condition of the patients</brief_summary>
