	<brief_title>Study Comparing Perceptions and Satisfaction for Two Different Delivery Mechanisms for Etanercept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study describes patient perceptions related to device attributes, which are of importance in describing overall patient perception. A range of potential device benefits (e.g. ease of use, convenience, confidence, presence or absence of fear, side effects related to administration) is captured using a questionnaire based on the outputs of patient interviews. The study aims to characterize patient attributes that will indicate when one device may result in greater patient satisfaction than another. Patient attributes are composed of patient characteristics (e.g. age, sex, self efficacy, expectations of treatment, perception of their illness) and RA characteristics (e.g. disease severity, disease duration, prior treatment, functional impairment).</detailed_description>
