	<criteria>Male and females 12 75 years of age Fungal toenail infection of one or both of the large (great) toenails The nail infection must be due to a dermatophyte, (mixed infections [dermatophyte and nondermatophyte] are not allowed) The target toenail area must have at least 25% to no more than 75% disease involvement without spikes. Target foot must not have severe plantar (moccasin) tinea pedis that would require systemic therapy. Mild to moderate tinea pedis (athlete's foot) infection should be treated with terbinafine prior to baseline or at any time during the trial. Other topical treatments for athlete's foot may be recommended at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects must not have abnormalities of the nail that could prevent a normal appearing nail if clearing of infection is achieved No administration of systemic antifungal medications within 6 months prior to screening visit No application of prescription topical antifungal medications for toenail fungus within 3 months or other commercially available topical medications for toenail fungus applied directly to the toenails within 1 month prior to screening visit Patients with the target toenail involving the matrix (lunula) or having less than 2mm clear (unaffected) nail plate length beyond the proximal fold. Presence of dermatophytoma (defined as thick masses of fungal hyphae and necrotic keratin between the nail plate and nail bed) on the target nail. No professional pedicures or application of any nail polish product or nail cosmetic to the toenails after the screening visit Known pregnancy or lactation at time of enrollment Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
