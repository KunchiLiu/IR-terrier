	<brief_summary>This study is to compare intraindividually the functional vision provided by two different posterior chamber intraocular lenses: AMO Tecnis Z9000 and Alcon SA60AT Acrysoft. To see if the aspherical intraocular lenses provide better functional vision than traditional spherical intraocular lenses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Functional Vision Provided by AMO Tecnis Z9000 and Alcon SA60AT Acrysof</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective study, 20 patients with bilateral catarct presenting for cataract surgery are randomly assigned to recieve an aspherical intraocular lens(AMO Tecnis Z9000) in one eye and a spherical intraocular lens(Alcon SA60AT Acrysof)in the other. All surgeries are performed by one experienced surgeon(Fung-Rong Hu,MD)with clear cornea small incision phacoemulsification and in-the-bag posterior chamber intraocular implantation. The patients are followed for 3 months, and postoperative contrast sensitivity, contrast acuity, corneal &amp; total ocular high-ordered aberrations are measured and compared intraidividually between two different IOL groups. Outcome Measurement: 1. Contrast sensitivity testing: measured with spectacle correction for the target distance of three meters using wall-mounted FACT sine-wave grating chart with nine levels of contrast.The graphic contrast sensitivity is recorded as a log functional units on the y-axis and displayed for five spatial frequency targets (1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cycles per degree (cpd))on x- axis. 2. Contrast acuity testing: measured with spectacle correction for the target distance of three meters using logMAR letter chart(Precision VisionÂ®)represented on a wall-mounted illuminator cabinet.Two types of contrast charts are used, high contrast(Cat.No.2103 SLOAN translucent chart)and low contrast(Cat.No.2132 10% SLOAN translucent chart),and are tested under both photopic and mesopic conditions. 3. Pupil diameters: measured by Colvard infrared pupillometer (Oasis. Medical, Glendora, CA, USA )under both photopic and mesopic luminance levels. 4. Corneal aberration analysis: performed with TMS-4 (Tomey, Japan).The corneal HOAs are described with Zernike polynomials of 3rd-to 5th- order root-mean-square(RMS)of central 6mm diameter using VOLPro 6.89 software(Fa. Sarver and Associates, Carbondale. Ill, USA). 5. Total ocular aberration analysis: performed with a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer(Zywave, Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., Rochester, New. York)under maximal mydriasis with Mydrin-P(phenylephrine hydrochloride 0.5% and tropicamide 0.5%, Santen).The wavefront errors were described using Zernike polynomials RMS for total HOA at pupil diameter of 5 mm and 6 mm, primary spherical (Z 4,0) and 3rd-to 5th-order aberration at pupil diameter of 6 mm. Data Analysis: - Mann-Whitney U matched-paired test was used with STATA software - P values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant</detailed_description>
