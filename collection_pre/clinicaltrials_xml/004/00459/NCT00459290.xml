	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Progesterone can cause the growth of ovarian epithelial cancer , primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer. Hormone therapy using mifepristone may fight ovarian epithelial cancer and primary peritoneal cancer by lowering the amount of progesterone the body makes. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well mifepristone works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mifepristone in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of mifepristone in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the potential impact of platinum sensitivity, initial performance status, and age on prognosis in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral mifepristone once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma* Recurrent or refractory disease NOTE: *Histological confirmation of original primary tumor required Measurable disease, defined as ≥ 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion ≥ 20 mm by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain xray, CT scan, and MRI OR ≥ 10 mm by spiral CT scan Must have ≥ 1 target lesion Tumors within a previously irradiated field are designated as nontarget lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence ≥ 90 days after completion of radiotherapy Prior treatment with 1 platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen (comprising carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound) for management of primary disease required Initial treatment may have included any of the following: Highdose therapy Consolidation therapy Extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment Patients must meet ≥ 1 of the following criteria: Treatmentfree interval after platinum therapy of &lt; 12 months Progressed during platinumbased therapy Persistent disease after a platinumbased regimen Not eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol, if one exists PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: GOG performance status 02 Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN AST ≤ 2.5 times ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN No active infection requiring antibiotics No other invasive malignancies within the past 5 years, except nonmelanoma skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics Recovered from prior surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy No prior cancer treatment that would preclude protocol therapy No prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis unless for treatment of ovarian cancer Prior radiotherapy for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, provided it was completed &gt; 3 years prior to study entry and no recurrent or metastatic disease exists No prior chemotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis unless for treatment of ovarian cancer Prior chemotherapy for localized cancer of the breast is permitted, provided it was completed &gt; 3 years prior to study entry and no recurrent or metastatic disease exists At least 1 week since prior hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor At least 2 weeks since other prior hormonal therapy (e.g., testosterone, estrogen, progestin, or gonadotropinreleasing hormone antagonists) At least 3 weeks since other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including biological or immunologic agents One prior cytotoxic regimen (defined as any agent that targets the genetic and/or mitotic apparatus of dividing cells, resulting in doselimiting toxicity to the bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa) for management of recurrent or persistent disease allowed No prior noncytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma No prior mifepristone</criteria>
