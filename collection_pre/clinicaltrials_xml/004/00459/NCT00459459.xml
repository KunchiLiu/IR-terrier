	<brief_title>Prognostic Significance of Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology Features in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common thyroid malignancy worldwide. The influence of clinicopathologic features on prognosis has been examined, but the relationship between cytologic features obtained by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and prognosis has been minimally studied. We retrospectively studied the cytologic features with computerized morphometry in 83 patients with usual-type papillary thyroid cancer and followed them for more than 10 years except for one with metastasis at diagnosis. The cytologic features of FNA and recurrence of cancer were examined statistically.</detailed_description>
