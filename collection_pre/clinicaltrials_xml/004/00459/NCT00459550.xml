Exclusion criteria: History and/or evidence of any other central nervous system (CNS) disorder that could be interpreted as a cause of dementia. Subjects currently living in a nursing home. Subjects who are unable to provide informed consent due to cognitive status Screening brain MRI with 1 or more of the following conditions: not consistent with AD, evidence of other CNS conditions, shows more than minimal vascular changes, more than 3 microhaemorrhage lesions. Focal findings on the neurological exam. Any contraindication to lumbar puncture. History or evidence of significant psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder or significant neurological disease other than AD. TIA/stroke in the last 3 years, type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, active cardiovascular disease, or other uncontrolled risk factors for stroke.

History of seizures (excluding febrile seizures in childhood), current blood clotting or bleeding disorder or conditions that predispose to these (e.g. cancer), current clinically significant systemic illness or significant infection within 30 days that is likely to result in deterioration of the subject's condition or affect the subject's safety during the study. History of cerebral amyloid antiopathy and/or hypertensive cerebral haemorrhage or with a known risk of intercerebral haemorrhage/microhaemorrhage. Treatment which cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine or selegiline unless the therapy was instituted at least 3 months prior to the administration of GSK933776, at a stable dosage in the 2 months prior and the same regimen will be continued for the duration of the trial and the subject is free from any clinically significant side effects attributable to the drug. Subjects who have discontinued cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, cognitive enhancing agents, or drugs that potentially affect cognition in the 60 days prior to screening.
