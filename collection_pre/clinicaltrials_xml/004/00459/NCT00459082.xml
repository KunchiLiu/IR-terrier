	<brief_summary>Blind randomized trial of a single bolus dose of dexmedetomine followed by a continuous infusion (CIVI) for up to 24 hours in infants who immediately post-operative from cardiac surgery and require tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation in the post-operative period. Three bolus and infusion dose will be administered to a total of 36 patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Study of Dexmedetomine in Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial of three dose rates of dexmedetomine will determine the pharmacokinetics of the drug in infants who remain tracheally intubated postoperatively. An exploratory pharmacodynamic study of a non-invasive device measuring sedation will be performed. Although the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomine have been described for pediatric patients, the drug disposition in infants has not been well described. A range of doses has been studied, yet there are no reports describing the optimal dose for post-operative pediatric patients. This study will provide data that may allow for improved dosing recommendations in this critically ill population of children.</detailed_description>
