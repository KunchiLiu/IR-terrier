	<brief_summary>Vitamin D is a natural nutrient in normal daily diet. It can also be made in the skin after exposure to sunlight and is essential for maintaining normal calcium balance. One past study has suggested that vitamin D may be helpful for blood pressure. This study will test whether pills containing cholecalciferol (a form of vitamin D) or calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) can treat high blood pressure. The investigators plan to enroll up to 80 subjects at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Participation in the study is expected to last up to 4 weeks. Subjects will be assigned to cholecalciferol, calcitriol or placebo). A 24-hour blood pressure monitor will be worn at the beginning and end of the study to determine blood pressure changes. Renin, PTH, angiotensin-II, and aldosterone levels will also be measured at the beginning and end of the study.</brief_summary>
