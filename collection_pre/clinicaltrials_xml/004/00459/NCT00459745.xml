	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, double blind, prospective, longitudinal, randomized, 12-week study with a 52-week open-label follow-up to evaluate the safety and efficacy of daily administration of Pravastatin 40 mg or Fenofibrate 160 mg or Pravafen (the combination of both Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160 mg) in the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia. There will be an open-label, 8-week, Selection Phase prior to randomization in which all patients will be stabilized on Pravastatin 40 mg/day. Following the Selection Phase, and if the patients meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be randomized to a three arm, double blind, 12-week Efficacy Phase during which they would receive either Pravastatin 40 mg or Fenofibrate 160 mg or Pravafen (the combination of Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160 mg). The 12-week Efficacy Phase will be followed by an open-label, 52-week, Safety Phase in which all patients will receive Pravafen. After the 8-week Selection Phase, patients that still meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized on a 1:1:2 ratio to Pravastatin 40 mg or Fenofibrate 160 mg or Pravafen (the combination of both Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160 mg) for 12 weeks. After the completion of the 12-week double-blind phase of the study, all patients that haven't had changes in their well being, will be allowed to roll-over into the 52-week, open-label, follow-up portion of the study. During the 52 week, open label, Safety Phase of the study, all patients will receive Pravafen (the combination of Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160 mg). Patients will be evaluated at baseline and every three weeks thereafter throughout the initial 12-week Efficacy Phase of the study. Patients that roll-over into the 52-week, open-label, follow-up Safety Phase will be evaluated at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks. Participation in the study can be up to 72 weeks.</brief_summary>

If the patient is female and of childbearing potential and sexually active, an acceptable birth control method must be used (abstinence, IUD, oral, transdermal, injectable or implantable contraceptives, at least 2 years postmenopausal, one year post hysterectomy, double barrier device and/or partner at least one year post vasectomy), a negative serum pregnancy test must be obtained at the Selection Visit (Visit 1) and a negative urine pregnancy test must be obtained prior to study drug administration at Baseline Visit (Visit 3). 4. Able to comply with all study procedures. 5. Patients that provide a written informed consent to participate in the study indicated by a personal signature and date on the patient consent form. At the end of the Selection Phase, patients meeting all of the criteria listed below may be selected and randomized into the Efficacy Phase of the study: 1. Selected patients with LDL Cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dl and/or TG ≥ 150 mg/dl and ≤ 400 mg/dl at Week1 / Visit 2 after taking Pravastatin 40 mg/day from Visit 1. 2. Patients still meeting the selection criteria a, c, d and e as listed under section 4.1. 3. Patients with a compliance ≥ 80% during the 8week Pravastatin phase of the study. Patients will be excluded from the study if any one or more of the following apply: 1.

Acute liver disease or persistent elevations in liver function tests (2 times the upper normal limit or greater) 5. Levels of creatine phosphokinase (CK) 3 times the upper normal limit or greater 6. Change in diuretic or βblocker treatment for hypertension within 30 days of enrollment into the selection phase (Visit 1) 7. Positive personal history of abuse of any of the following: Alcohol (as per the DSMIV criteria) and/or Recreational drugs (as per the DSMIV criteria) 8. Usage of any of the following medications (patients must have discontinued these medications for 5 or more halflives or for 30 days, whichever is greater prior to study drug administration on Visit 3 / Day 0) : Corticosteroids Immunosuppressants Macrolide antibiotics Azole antifungal agents, or 9. Recent use of any investigational drug. These drugs must have been discontinued for either 5 or more halflives or for 30 days whichever is greater prior to Visit 1 10. Hyperlipidemia type IIIaIVV 11.
