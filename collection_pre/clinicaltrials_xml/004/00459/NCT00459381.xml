	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well pazopanib works in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Pazopanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the therapeutic efficacy of pazopanib hydrochloride, as measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. II. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of this drug, as measured by radiographic response, time to progression, and overall survival, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme, including gliosarcoma Recurrent disease Must have unequivocal radiographic evidence of tumor progression by MRI, as defined by any of the following: 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease) using the same techniques as baseline Clear worsening of any evaluable disease Appearance of any new lesions or site Clear clinical worsening Must have failed prior radiotherapy that was completed ≥ 42 days ago Patients who received prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease, rather than radiation necrosis, based on positron emission tomography (PET) scan, thallium scanning, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or surgical documentation of disease Treatment for no more than 2 prior relapses allowed Relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e., radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, if that was used as initial therapy; therefore no more than 3 prior therapies [initial therapy and therapy for 2 relapses] allowed) If the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no anticancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as 1 relapse For patients who had prior therapy for a lowgrade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of a glioblastoma multiforme will be considered the first relapse Karnofsky performance status 60100% Life expectancy &gt;
