	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well dasatinib works in treating patients with advanced liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate and response rate (complete and partial response) at 4 months in patients with unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with dasatinib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the median PFS and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. II. Assess the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3-6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
