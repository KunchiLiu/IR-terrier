	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine if combination therapy (reduced-fluence Visudyne followed by Lucentis [within 2 hours] or either of two regimens of reduced-fluence Visudyne followed by Lucentis-Dexamethasone triple therapy [within 2 hours]) reduces retreatment rates compared with Lucentis monotherapy while maintaining similar vision outcomes and an acceptable safety profile.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Treatment naive for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to agerelated macular degeneration (AMD) in the study eye except for laser treatment outside the subfoveal area Subfoveal CNV due to AMD CNV must be = or &gt;50 % of the entire lesion All lesion composition types with a lesion greatest linear dimension (GLD) &lt; 5400 microns (approximately = or &lt;9 disc areas [DA]) Bestcorrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity (VA score) of 25 73 letters (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/40 20/320), inclusive Subfoveal geographic atrophy or subfoveal fibrosis of the study eye Intraocular surgery within 3 months of enrollment Inability to attend the protocolrequired visits Known allergies or hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments. Other systemic diseases or active uncontrolled infections that would make subject a poor medical risk Uncontrolled glaucoma, defined as (1)subject is on &gt;1 glaucoma medication (includes combination treatments) or (2)subject has glaucoma that could lead to progressive visual field deterioration If subject has had a stroke within the last year</criteria>
