	<brief_title>Phototherapeutic Keratectomy (PTK) With Mitomycin in Adenoviral Opacities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is a very common disease, some patients developed a complication after the infection wich is corneal infiltration. Topical treatment sometimes helps to avoid loss of visual acuity. Therefore recurrence of the opacities after topical drops is observed. When corneal fibrosis occur is difficult to achieve visual rehabilitation with topical approach. This study evaluate pre and postoperative data of patients with subepithelial fibrosis caused by adenoviral infiltrates submitted to phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) using mitomycin C.</detailed_description>
