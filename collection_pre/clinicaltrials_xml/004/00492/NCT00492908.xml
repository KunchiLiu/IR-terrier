	<brief_summary>A Randomized Comparison of a Titanium-Nitride-Oxide Coated Stent (Helistent Titan2, Hexacath) With a Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent (EndeavorTm, Medtronic) for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Comparing Titan Stent With Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: The purpose of this study is to compare the Titanium-Nitride-Oxide Coated Stent (Helistent Titan2, Hexacath) with a Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent (EndeavorTm, Medtronic) in a non-inferiority trial. Design: Prospective, multi-center, randomized, non-inferiority trial to be conducted at 3 Swiss interventional cardiology centers. Patients will be randomized in a single-blind fashion (1:1 randomization) to either the Titanium-Nitride-Oxide Coated Stent (Helistent Titan2, Hexacath) or the Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent (EndeavorTm, Medtronic). Study Population: Patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease including patients with chronic stable angina, silent ischemia, unstable angina, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, who qualify for percutaneous coronary interventions Antiplatelet Therapy: Aspirin 100 mg qd indefinitely; Clopidogrel 75 mg qd for 3 months Enrollment: A total of 300 patients will be enrolled All patients will undergo repeat angiography at 6-8 months. All patients will be followed for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
