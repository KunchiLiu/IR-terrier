	<brief_summary>Randomized controlled trial comparing effects of ergometer exercise during hemodialysis to effects of pedometer use outside of hemodialysis on exercise capacity, functional status, quality of life and adequacy of hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Aerobic Exercise in Patients Undergoing Outpatient Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial of chronic hemodialysis outpatients within the Manitoba Renal Program. Potential patients include any individual receiving chronic outpatient hemodialysis in Winnipeg (Seven Oaks, Sherbrook, Central and St. Boniface dialysis units) and the Brandon hemodialysis unit. Exercise Interventions: Patients will be block randomized to one of the following 2 interventions: Group A: Cycling on an ergometer GOAL 60 minutes 3 times per week on hemodialysis for 24 weeks A cycling ergometer will be placed on the floor in front of the patient's dialysis chair or at the foot of the bed (if there are only beds available in that unit). The patient will be allowed to exercise anytime during the first half of each dialysis treatment. Goal frequency will be 3 times per week during their usual scheduled hemodialysis treatments. Group B: Pedometers This group will each receive a pedometer (StepsCountÂ®) at the onset of the study following exercise testing. They will be educated regarding the technical use of the pedometer and will receive the handout entitled "Pedometer Information Sheet: Get Physically Active One Step at a Time!" They will also receive verbal education regarding use of the pedometer and goal activity levels from the exercise study supervisor.</detailed_description>
