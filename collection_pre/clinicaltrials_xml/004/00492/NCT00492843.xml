	<brief_title>Loading Dose or Standard Dose of Intravenous Ibandronate in Treating Patients With Lung Cancer and Skeletal Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with lung cancer and bone metastatic disease may experience moderate or severe bone pain. Some researches have reported that loading doses Bondronat (6mg Bondronat on three consecutive days) had great efficacy in reducing pain in patients with malignant bone disease without unacceptable toxicities. So,we designed this clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety profiles between loading doses Bondronat and standard dose Bondronat.Enrolled patients will receive an intravenous infusion of either 6mg Bondronat on three consecutive days or 6mg Bondronat on one day. The targeted sample size is 120 individuals. Primary outcome measures will be bone pain response ( ≥ 25% decrease in mean pain score with a maximum of 15% increase in mean analgesic consumption). Secondary outcome measures will be efficacy including ECOG Performance status, analgesic consumption, bone markers, and safety profiles including AE and laboratory parameters.</detailed_description>
