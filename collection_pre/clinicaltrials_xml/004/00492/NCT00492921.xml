	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: High-dose cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment for acute graft-versus-host disease that did not respond to steroid therapy. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects, best dose, and how well high-dose cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with acute graft-versus-host disease that did not respond to steroid therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease That Did Not Respond to Steroid Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of high-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. - Determine the efficacy of this regimen at 28 days post-treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide once daily for 1-4 days beginning on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood counts recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
