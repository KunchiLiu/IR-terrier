	<brief_title>Facilitation of Zolpidem (â‰¥10 mg) Discontinuation Through Use of Ramelteon in Subjects With Chronic Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 60 to 70 million adults in the United States alone are affected by insomnia. Daytime symptoms of insomnia include tiredness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. Recent epidemiologic research focusing on the quality of life has identified significant insomnia-related morbidities that relate to work productivity, health care utilization, and risk of depression. Insomnia is associated with diminished work output, absenteeism, and greater rates of accidents. Zolpidem is the most commonly prescribed hypnotic in the United States for patients suffering from insomnia. The purpose of this study is to assess whether ramelteon therapy can facilitate the discontinuation of benzodiazepine therapy in long term users. Subject participation in this study is anticipated to be about 17 weeks. Subjects were screened and enrolled in a 4-week placebo run-in period, may have been randomized to a 10-week double-blind treatment period, and may have completed with a 2-week open-label treatment period. In the double-blind treatment period, subjects were randomized to one of two treatments: either ramelteon 8 mg tablets taken orally once-daily with concomitant current zolpidem therapy or to placebo-matching tablets once daily with concomitant current zolpidem therapy. Subjects incrementally reduced zolpidem therapy by dose, frequency, or both for up to 10 weeks. Only those subjects who completed the double-blind treatment period and had achieved a 50% reduction in zolpidem therapy during the double-blind treatment period participated in the open-label treatment period in which 8 mg ramelteon was administered. Zolpidem consumed during the open-label treatment period was recorded.</detailed_description>
