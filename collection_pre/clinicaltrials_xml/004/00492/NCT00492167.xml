	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Beta-glucan may stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as 3F8, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving beta-glucan together with monoclonal antibody 3F8 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of beta-glucan when given together with monoclonal antibody 3F8 in treating patients with metastatic neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Beta-Glucan and Monoclonal Antibody 3F8 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the clinical toxicity of beta-glucan in combination with monoclonal antibody 3F8 in patients with metastatic neuroblastoma. - Evaluate the biologic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of beta-glucan. Patients receive oral beta-glucan once daily on days -4 to 12 and monoclonal antibody 3F8 IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and with a human antimouse antibody (HAMA) titer &lt; 1,000 U/mL. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of beta-glucan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients undergo urine, bone marrow, and blood sample collection periodically for biological studies. Samples are analyzed for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-mediated cytotoxicity, and serum HAMA response via immunohistochemistry. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
