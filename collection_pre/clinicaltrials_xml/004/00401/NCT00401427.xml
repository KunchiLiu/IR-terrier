	<brief_summary>The combination of vinorelbine with weekly trastuzumab has produced high response rate in HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The present phase 2 study was planned to test activity of the same combination, with trastuzumab given every 3 weeks, rather than weekly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HERVIN: Trastuzumab and Vinorelbine in Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The schedule of treatment includes vinorelbine (30 mg/m2 on days 1 &amp; 8 every 21 days) and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg on day 1 and then 6 mg/kg every 21 days). Vinorelbine is planned for maximum 9 cycles, while trastuzumab can be continued until progression. This study is a single-stage phase 2 design, and patients eligible for response evaluation are required.</detailed_description>
