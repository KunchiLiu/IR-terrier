	<brief_title>Assessing Efficacy and Safety of Lacosamide Compared to Placebo in Reducing Signs and Symptoms of Fibromyalgia Syndrome.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a proof-of-concept study and not powered for statistical comparisons. The trial consisted of a 4-week Titration Phase, an 8-week Maintenance Phase, a 1-week Taper Phase, and a 2-week Safety Follow-Up Phase. If subjects met the eligibility criteria, they were randomized to receive either lacosamide 400mg/day or placebo during the Maintenance Phase. Subjects assigned to lacosamide were titrated from 100mg/day to 400mg/day at weekly intervals of 100mg. All subjects who completed the 4-week Titration Phase entered an 8-week Maintenance Phase. No dose adjustment was allowed during the Maintenance Phase. The Treatment Phase was defined as the combined Titration and Maintenance Phases.</detailed_description>
