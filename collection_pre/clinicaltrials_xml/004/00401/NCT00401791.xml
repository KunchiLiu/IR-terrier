	<brief_summary>The study is designed to compare muscle energy capacity in men with obesity or diabetes as compared to athletes. This study will also enable researchers to determine whether MRS can replace muscle biopsy for this type of assessment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Skeletal muscle mitochondrial defects are a sine qua non of insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obese and subjects with family history of T2DM (FH+). Exercise increases mitochondrial capacity whereas lipid infusion or high fat diet decreases genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. In this study 2 cohorts will be involved: Cohort I (athletes, T2DM and obese) and Cohort II (healthy with "FH+" or without "FH-" family history of T2DM). This randomized, parallel arm clinical trial will consist of 4 periods: screening, stabilization (3 days), baseline (for Cohort I and II) and exercise period (14 days, only for Cohort II). The overall objective of the study is to validate a paradigm for the evaluation of compounds and drugs that activate mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. In Specific Aim 1 we will compare and contrast biopsy and MRS power to detect differences in mitochondrial capacity in 78 subjects: athletes (N=10), FH- (N=24), FH+ (N=24), obese (N=10) and T2DM (N=10). In Specific Aim 2 we will compare mitochondrial changes in response to exercise in subjects FH - vs. FH + subjects. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine if HFD impairs mitochondrial changes in response to exercise in FH+ subjects. In Specific Aim 4 we will determine the role of mitochondrial capacity in metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity in T2DM, obese, FH+, FH- and athlete subjects.</detailed_description>
