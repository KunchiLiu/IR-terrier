	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to provide immunogenicity and safety data of the investigational hexavalent vaccine when it is given concomitantly (the same day at separate injection sites) with Prevnar, according to the 2-4-6 month immunization schedule, following one dose of HB vaccine at birth. Primary Objective: To demonstrate that the hexavalent DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T combined vaccine induces an immune response that is at least as good as the response following Infanrix™-Hexa in terms of seroprotection rates to HB and PRP, one month after a 3 dose primary series (2, 4, and 6 months), when co-administered with Prevnar® Secondary Objectives: Immunogenicity: To describe in each group the immunogenicity parameters to each vaccine component (for DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T and Infanrix™-Hexa) one month after the third dose of the primary series. Safety: To describe the overall safety after each injection.</brief_summary>
