	<brief_title>Rubella Susceptibility in Multiparous Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to investigate why multiparous women might still be susceptible to rubella. All pregnant women are checked for rubella immunity, and if they are non-immune, there are standard orders in our hospital to administer the rubella vaccine on the post-partum floor prior to discharge home from the hospital. Despite this, some multiparous women are found to be susceptible (non-immune), and this study will explore the reasons for this.</detailed_description>
