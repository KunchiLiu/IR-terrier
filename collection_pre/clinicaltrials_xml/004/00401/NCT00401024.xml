	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn how patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients receiving imatinib mesylate for malignant glioma to see how much imatinib mesylate is found in the tumor tissue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tumor Tissue Analysis in Patients Receiving Imatinib Mesylate for Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy, of imatinib mesylate, in terms of achieving a therapeutic tumor:plasma concentration ratio, in patients with primary malignant glioma. Secondary - Correlate tumor grade (low vs high) and/or tumor enhancement on MRI with tumor concentration of this drug in these patients., OUTLINE: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for 7-12 days. Patients then undergo surgical resection. Blood and tissue samples are collected at the time of surgery and analyzed for imatinib mesylate concentration. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 7 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
