	<brief_title>Transplantation of Autologous RPE Versus Translocation of Autologous RPE and Choroid in AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Submacular surgical trials have shown that submacular membrane extraction alone did not improve or preserve visual acuity in patients with AMD. Transplantation of autologous RPE and translocation of autologous RPE and choroid represent two promising therapeutic interventions in patients with AMD. This prospective, randomized clinical trial compares the two surgical treatments and additionally compares the clinical results (visual acuity, FLA) with OCT- and UHR-OCT data.</detailed_description>
