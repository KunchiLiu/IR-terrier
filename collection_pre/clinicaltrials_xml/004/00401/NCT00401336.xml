	<brief_summary>Iron excess is increasingly regarded as an important cofactor in the morbidity attributed to many disorders. Assessment of body iron stores by measurement of serum ferritin concentrations has poor specificity and the most reliable method is histological or biochemical assessment from a liver biopsy. Because liver biopsy is an invasive procedure, imaging methods have been developed to detect and quantify hepatic iron content. The aim of the study is to use a simplified magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to quantify simultaneously iron and fat contents in the liver and to compare the results to the quantification obtained biochemically.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Iron excess is increasingly regarded as an important cofactor in the morbidity attributed to many disorders. Assessment of body iron stores by measurement of serum ferritin concentrations has poor specificity and the most reliable method is histological or biochemical assessment from a liver biopsy. Because liver biopsy is an invasive procedure, imaging methods have been developed to detect and quantify hepatic iron content. The aim of the study is to use a simplified magnetic resonance imaging technique to quantify simultaneously iron and fat contents in the liver and to compare the results to the quantification obtained biochemically. Patients who need a liver biopsy will be proposed to be enrolled in the study. A magnetic resonance (MR) study will be performed using breath-hold gradient echo sequences with a single echo and a new multiple-echo gradient-echo sequence. Liver and muscle MR signal will be quantitatively determined and compared to biochemical assessment of liver iron concentration and steatosis quantification.</detailed_description>
