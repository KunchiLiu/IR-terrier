	<brief_summary>Previous experimental data strongly suggest that B lymphocytes have intrinsic abnormalities during lupus in mice spontaneously affected by the disease. This study tries to define these abnormalities by looking at the gene expression profile of purified B lymphocytes from patients with non active systemic lupus , compared with the gene expression profile of purified B lymphocytes from healthy donnors.</brief_summary>
