	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Antiviral Activity of ACH-0137171 in Subjects With Chronic Hepatitis C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study of ACH-0137171 in subjects with chronic HCV infection. Sequential cohorts of 10 subjects will be randomized (8:2) to receive multiple doses of ACH-0137171 or placebo for 4 days (Days 1 through 4) with a single dose on Day 5 followed by a complete pharmacokinetic profile. Dosing will be 300 - 600 mg administered either every 12 hours or every 6 hours (maximum daily dose of 2400 mg). All doses will be administered with food. The dose cohorts are as follows: Study Schema: Cohort 1: 300 mg ACH-0137171/placebo every 12 hours (600 mg/day)* Cohort 2: 300 mg ACH-0137171/placebo every 6 hours (1200 mg/day)* Cohort 3: 600 mg ACH-0137171/placebo every 6 hours (2400 mg/day)* A full review of all safety data will occur following each cohort. Depending on the data, the Sponsor, in consultation with the Principal Investigator(s), may consider modifying the planned dose escalation. The Sponsor may choose to interject an intermediate dose cohort between 2 planned dose escalations or repeat a given dose level, or extend the dosing period, or add an additional cohort. If a similar Grade 3 or 4 adverse event occurs in three or more subjects, and is considered to be at least possibly related to study drug, escalation to a higher dose will not occur. Serial HCV RNA measurements, pharmacokinetic measurements of plasma concentrations of ACH-0137171, and periodic safety monitoring will occur on Days 1 through 5. Additional HCV RNA and PK measurements will be taken on Days 6 through 9. Follow up safety evaluations will be completed out to 14 days after last study drug administration (i.e., on Days 12 and 19).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chronic HCV infection must be documented by positive anti HCV antibody using a third generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and persistent detection of HCV RNA in the blood for at least 6 months. Subjects must be infected with HCV genotype 1 (line probe assay; INNOLiPA HCV II, Innogenetics) and may be treatmentnaïve or treatmentexperienced (treatment experienced specifically means prior treatment with interferon, standard or pegylated, with or without ribavirin with therapy stopped &gt; 6 months prior to screening). In addition, eligible subjects must have ALT and AST &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), plasma HCV RNA&gt; 5 log10 IU/mL, and have no clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic decompensation for inclusion (must have platelets &gt;100,000/mm3, total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN, prothrombin time &lt; 1.5 x ULN, or albumin &gt; 3.0 g/dL for inclusion). Women are eligible if not pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., not surgically sterile or confirmed post menopausal) must have confirmed negative pregnancy tests. All subjects must practice a medically acceptable form of contraception described in Section 7.2.1. HIV or HBV coinfection, known cirrhosis, prior history of clinical hepatic decompensation (ascites, jaundice, encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage), alcoholic or other forms of chronic liver disease, evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (αfetoprotein &gt; 50 ng/mL), creatinine clearance &lt; 80 mL/min (using CockcroftGault equation), hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL, neutrophils &lt; 1500/mm3, abnormal thyroid function tests (TSH &gt; 2.5 µIU/mL, free T4 &gt; ULN), or, a positive test result for illicit drugs, alcohol, or drug abuse within the past 12 months. Subjects who have significant gastrointestinal, thyroid, renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, oncologic, or neurological disease, or who are currently receiving immunomodulators (corticosteroids, etc), investigational, nephrotoxic or hepatotoxic drugs (e.g phenytoin, carbamazepine, INH, azole antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, and aminoglycoside antibiotics, etc.), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, ibuprofen or acetaminophen (on a daily basis) will also be excluded.</criteria>
