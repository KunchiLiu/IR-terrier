	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Effects of MTR107 in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present clinical trial aims to investigate and provide a more precise characterization of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of MTR107 in a population of ESRD patients predisposed to developing intradialytic hypotension. The study is also designed as a dose esclating study aiming to assess MTR107 safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 2075 years, inclusive. 2. Presence of frequent bouts of hypotension defined as 3 or more intradialytic hypotensive events per month for the last six months prior to baseline, despite standard adjustments in dry weight. 3. ECG performed up to one month before study start. 4. Wellpreserved hepatic function (within normal laboratory ranges) at study entry as judged by: Serum Bilirubin (Total Bilirubin (direct and indirect) 0.31.0 mg/dL, and Direct Bilirubin 0.10.5 mg/dL) Serum Albumin (&gt;3.6 g/dL), Serum aminotransferases (AST (037 U/L) and ALT (040 U/L)), GGT (Gamma Glutamine Trans Peptidase) 5. Normal coagulation status at study entry as judged by PTINR, PTT, fibrinogen and platelet count. 6. Willingness to participate in the study and adhere to the study design. 7. Willingness to sign an informed consent form. 1. Uncontrolled hypertension &gt;140/90 mmHg. 2. Unstable angina. 3. Abnormal ECG which may indicate acute disease 4. Variable weight gains. 5. Mental retardation. 6. Pregnancy. 7. Malignancy or other concomitant serious diseases. 8. Current participation in another clinical trial involving an investigational drug/device, or participation in such a trial within the last 30 days.</criteria>
