	<brief_title>Haptoglobin Phenotype and Cardiovascular Complications in Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3054 diabetic patients from Clalit Medical Services were screened for Haptoglobin Phenotype as part of the ICARE study (NCT00220831) and composite the I CARE registry, 1434 Hp 2-2 patients were treated as part of the I CARE study with vitamin E vs. Placebo, this study was recently terminated due to significant differences between the groups and data was sent to publication. During the follow up period of the I CARE study all 3054 registry patients were followed in a passive way, which means that the patients were not called for follow up visits but the reports for CVD events were centrally collected from patient's Hospital admission summaries. Admission summaries were collected using the computerized systems of the Clalit Health Services assuring that when ever a patient in the registry is hospitalized for what ever reason the study coordination them would be aware of that and receive the admission summary. An events adjudication committee adjudicated each event in a blinded fashion to determine the nature of the events. 1434 patients who were treated by vitamin E or placebo in the I CARE study were also followed by follow-up telephone calls. once I CARE study was officially terminated we have decided to continue and follow the whole 3054 registry patients in the same manner to complete a nearly 3 year follow up to determine in a prospective manner the incidence of CVD events in Diabetic patients which were pre-stratified by Haptoglobin type.</detailed_description>
