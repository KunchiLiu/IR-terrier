	<brief_summary>It is known that individuals with spinal cord injury are at increased risk for respiratory tract infections like pneumonia. Part of this risk is due to weakened chest and abdominal muscles that are vital to deep breathing and the ability to cough. The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of two different treatments in preventing pneumonia and other respiratory problems in persons with SCI. This is a randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of two different treatments. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. They will not be told the details of the other intervention since this could influence or change their activities during the study.</brief_summary>
