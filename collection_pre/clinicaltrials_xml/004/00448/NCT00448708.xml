	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center clinical study in subjects requiring arteriovenous grafts in the upper extremity for hemodialysis access. All subjects will provide informed consent before undergoing any study procedures. The study will consist of multiple subject visits and telephone contacts during the 52 week study period. During the study period subjects must also maintain an appropriate hemodialysis schedule. IDE Number: G060250</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. be ≥ 18 years of age; 2. if female of childbearing potential, provide evidence of a negative pregnancy test within 3 days prior to graft placement (Day 3 to Day 0); 3. be a candidate for a new endtoside arteriovenous anastomosis graft placed in the upper extremity; 4. have an outflow vein of greater than or equal to 3 mm in diameter; 5. be able to effectively communicate with study personnel; 6. be considered by the physician to be available for subsequent visits; 7. be willing to comply with all aspects of the treatment and evaluation schedule over a 52 week duration; 8. allow representatives of the sponsor, designated CRO, Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Ethics Committee, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review his/her relevant medical records; 9. sign and date an IRBapproved written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures, including screening procedures; 10. must agree to participate in protocol 014VWAV07, a safety study to run consecutively for an additional 4 years or until PostMarket Approval (PMA), whichever is longer; and 11. have the Lifespan® ePTFE Vascular Graft successfully implanted. 1. pregnant, breastfeeding, or female of childbearing potential who do not agree to remain abstinent or to use a contraceptive method during the study period. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as either postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 1 year) or surgically sterile. Surgically sterile is defined as tubal ligation or the absence of the uterus and/or ovaries; 2. male of childbearing potential, who does not agree to remain abstinent or to use contraception to prevent fathering a child during the course of the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as vasectomy or bilateral orchiectomy; 3. a central venous stenosis on the ipsilateral side is documented; 4. a hypercoagulable state is documented; 5. life expectancy is less than one year; 6. an organ transplant is expected within 6 months of test or control product (study products) placement; 7. hypersensitivity to any component of the study products or procedural materials or medications is known; 8. concurrently involved in another investigational study; 9. a study product being investigated by others has been received within 30 days prior to randomization in this trial; 10. the study product being studied in this trial has previously been received; 11. uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP &gt;200mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;115mmHg is present at screening; 12. currently receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy; or 13. placement of a new endtoend arteriovenous anastomosis graft is required.</criteria>
