	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as floxuridine, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works as first-line therapy in treating patients with stage IV gastric cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Gastric Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the overall response rate in patients with unresectable stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma treated with floxuridine, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel as first-line treatment. Secondary - Determine the feasibility of this regimen in managing patients with unresectable stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. - Determine disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Evaluate overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and docetaxel IV over 30 minutes, floxuridine IV over 24 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
