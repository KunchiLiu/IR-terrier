	<brief_summary>This study will be a descriptive comparison of the effects of live attenuated influenza virus (FluMist) on nasal inflammation and oxidative stress in healthy young adults who are not exposed to smoke vs smokers. It is hypothesized that passive exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) results in increased susceptibility to the effects of influenza virus in nasal epithelium in humans and that these effects are mediated by SHS-induced oxidative stress</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cigarette Smoke and Susceptibility to Influenza Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiologic evidence supports a significant relationship between passive cigarette smoke exposure and increased risk for viral respiratory illnesses. Published and preliminary data suggest that airborne pollutants including tobacco smoke increase susceptibility of respiratory epithelium to infection with influenza A and that this effect is at least partially mediated by oxidative stress. However, no studies have specifically looked at the interaction between smoking and the effects of influenza virus in human volunteers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>age 1835 years healthy nonsmoking who are rarely exposed to SHS OR smokers pregnancy or nursing; history of egg allergy; aspirin therapy; asthma; immunodeficiency (HIV or other); on immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids; history of GuillainBarre Syndrome; any chronic medical condition; febrile and/or respiratory illness within past 3 weeks prior to entry into study; prospective subjects with high baseline antibody titers against influenza will be excluded because they may be less likely to develop viral replication with LAIV.</criteria>
