	<brief_title>Family-supported Smoking Cessation for Chronically Ill Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ANTICIPATED IMPACT(S) ON VETERAN'S HEALTHCARE: Veterans with chronic disease who continue to smoke exact a significant burden on the VA health care system. Effective smoking cessation programs, that target veterans who continue to smoke after the diagnosis of a smoking-related chronic illness, are needed. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Chronic diseases related to tobacco exposure are common among veterans. Persistent tobacco use after being diagnosed with these diseases decreases quality of life and survival. Yet, 30% of veterans with these conditions continue to smoke. Researchers have found that the social environment is important for smokers. In our current NCI-funded study, 70% of veterans with lung cancer identified at least one family member who smokes and 45% live with a family member that smokes. A family-supported smoking cessation intervention timed to follow a veteran's diagnosis of cancer or heart disease could be effective for helping veterans quit smoking. OBJECTIVES: The overarching aim of the study is to evaluate in a randomized trial the impact of a family-supported intervention compared to a standard veteran-focused telephone counseling control group to promote smoking cessation among cancer and heart disease patients. AIM 1: To evaluate the impact of a family-supported intervention on rates of abstinence from cigarettes (self-reported 7-day point prevalent abstinence) at 2 weeks, and 12-month post-treatment follow-ups. Hypothesis 1: Abstinence rates will be significantly higher among veterans who receive the family-supported intervention than those who receive the standard telephone counseling control. AIM 2: To evaluate the impact of a family-supported intervention on perceived support for quitting 2 weeks and 12-month post-treatment follow-ups. Hypothesis 2: Perceived support for quitting smoking will be significantly greater among veterans who receive the family-supported intervention than those who receive the standard telephone counseling control. AIM 3: To measure the impact of a family-supported intervention on quality of life in veterans 2 weeks, and 12-month post-treatment follow-ups. Hypothesis 3: Symptom-related quality of life will be significantly greater among veterans who receive the family-supported intervention than those who receive the standard telephone counseling control. METHODS: Proposed is a two-group design in which 470 veterans who smoke will be randomized to receive: STANDARD TELEPHONE COUNSELING control including a letter from a VA physician encouraging the patient to quit smoking, nicotine replacement (if not contraindicated), a self-help cessation kit, and 5 standard telephone counseling calls; or FAMILY-SUPPORTED intervention that includes all components of the control arm plus a Family-supported intervention that includes a support skills booklet and an additional telephone counseling protocol focusing on social support. .</detailed_description>
