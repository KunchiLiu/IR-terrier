	<brief_summary>Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease all the world in spite of progress in new treatment for diabetes and anti hypertensive drugs. Additional treatments are thus needed to arrest the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Although there is insufficient evidence to suggest that a low-protein diet improves renal dysfunction, it is recommended as a mainstay of nutritional management. We here assessed the role of low protein diet in renal function as well as albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy for a median of 5 years.</brief_summary>
