	<brief_title>Effects of Tea Catechin Extracts on Oxidative Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental studies have revealed that tea catechin extracts induce preventive effects on oxidative stress, but there have been few clinical trials conducted to verify the effects. Also, there have been few clinical markers indicating oxidative damage, and therefore, more accurate and reliable markers have been expected. The study is designed for evaluating the effects of tea catechin extracts on the frequency changes of micronuclei in peripheral lymphocytes as the indicator of oxidative damage, compared with other oxidative stress markers in late middle aged healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>
