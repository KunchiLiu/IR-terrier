	<brief_title>Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC) Assessment in Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject recruitment Patients who had been admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital with AECOPD were recruited for this study. Subjects with pneumonic changes on the chest radiographs were excluded. Age and sex-matched COPD subjects at stable state (without AECOPD for at least 10 weeks) and healthy, non-smoking subjects were recruited as controls. Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) EBC was collected using the EcoScreen (VIASYS Healthcare, Conshohochen, PA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EBC was stored in 250 microL aliquots immediately at -70oC until analysis. EBC was collected on Day 5, 14, 30 and 60 after hospitalization for subjects with AECOPD. For the stable COPD patients and normal controls, EBC collection was performed once. Measurement of TNF alpha, LTB4 and IL-8 The concentrations of TNF alpha, LTB4, and IL-8 in EBC were measured in one batch by high-sensitivity sandwich enzyme immunoassays (TNF alpha and IL-8 from BioSource International, Camarillo, CA, USA; LTB4 from Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Intra-subject repeatability of TNF alpha, LTB4 and IL-8 was assessed by collection of EBC in stable COPD subjects. EBC was collected as described above at the same time (09:00 to 10:00) on 2 consecutive days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who had been admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital with AECOPD were recruited for this study. AECOPD was defined when a patient with background COPD according to the GOLD guideline presented with at least two of the following major symptoms (increased dyspnoea, increased sputum purulence, increased sputum volume) or one major and one minor symptom (nasal discharge/congestion, wheeze, sore throat, cough) for at least two consecutive days. Age and sexmatched COPD subjects at stable state (without AECOPD for at least 10 weeks) and healthy, nonsmoking subjects were recruited as controls. Current smokers (defined as cigarette smoking in the last 6 months) were excluded from this study. Subjects with pneumonic changes on the chest radiographs were excluded. Current smokers (defined as cigarette smoking in the last 6 months) were excluded from this study.</criteria>
