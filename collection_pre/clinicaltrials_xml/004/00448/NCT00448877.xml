	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not a new brain function monitor can distinguish between anesthetized and awake patients. The device implemented utilizes functional near-infrared (fNIR) technology to detect anesthesia depth as well as reaction to stimuli during surgical procedure. After obtaining consent the device is placed across the forehead of the patient. A baseline signal is obtained prior to induction. The fNIR signal is continuously recorded throughout the procedure. Key events as well as administration of drug are recorded in order to observe changes in the signal trend. Neither the device nor the light emitted is hazardous to the patient - no risks or discomforts are involved.</brief_summary>
