	<brief_summary>The diagnosis of GH deficiency (GHD) in adults is established by laboratory testing in patients with an appropriate clinical history of hypothalamic pituitary disease. Two tests that are considered to be gold standard tests for the diagnosis of GHD are the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and GHRH combined with arginine. However, these tests are either bothersome (given intravenously) to the patient or are linked with side effects. Therefore, an orally available compound like AEZS-130(formerly ARD-07), if demonstrated to be safe and providing adequate sensitivity and specificity could be a welcome alternative and/or complement to the current available tests. The intent was to recruit 40 AGHD patients and 40 normal control subjects into this trial, but the original sponsor (Ardana Biosciences Ltd.) discontinued the study for financial reasons before this was completed. At the time of withdrawal of GHRH from the market in 2008, 42 AGHD patients and 10 normal controls had completed the study at 9 US sites. This study is now being reactivated to complete the remaining 30 matched control subjects. Additionally upon agreement with the FDA in a SPA, 10 additional adult grown hormone deficient and their matched control will be enrolled into this trial for a total treated population approximatively 100 subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of a New, Oral Growth Hormone Secretagogue, Macimorelin (AEZS-130) as a Growth Hormone Stimulation Test.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty control subjects (i.e., without AGHD) will be matched to the 30 AGHD patients who were not previously matched. Matching will be based upon gender, age, BMI, and estrogen status for females. They will receive one oral dose of AEZS-130 followed by serial blood draws for growth hormone, IGF-1 and PK determinations. There will be no cross over due to the unavailability of GHRH (Geref) in the United States. Under Amendment #4 to this protocol, 10 additional AGHD subjects will be enrolled and matched as described above.</detailed_description>
