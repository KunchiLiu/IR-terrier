	<brief_title>Compare Perceptions and Satisfaction for Two Different Delivery Mechanisms for Etanercept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For the measures of patient's satisfaction with and perceptions of, their device, standard Likert scales are used. This allows the magnitude of individual's perceptions and satisfaction to be measured on a multipoint scale anchored at each end. In addition, the study will describe patient perceptions related to device attributes, which are of importance in describing overall patient perception. A range of potential device benefits (e.g. ease of use, convenience, injection site pain, injection anxiety, injection confidence) will be captured using a questionnaire. The study aims to characterize patient attributes that will indicate when one device may result in greater patient satisfaction than another. Patient attributes are composed of patient characteristics (e.g. age, sex, demographics, social and educational status psychological status, willingness to self-manage, injection experience) and Psoriasis characteristics (e.g. disease severity, disease duration, co morbidities, prior treatment, quality of life). The study will also take the opportunity to measure health outcome measures as there may be important differences in cost of training and patient support between the two devices.</detailed_description>
