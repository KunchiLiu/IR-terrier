	<brief_title>A Study of the Drug Interactions Between a Hormonal Emergency Contraception and an HIV Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of hormonal contraceptive pills in women with HIV is complex due to potential interactions between these agents and HIV medications. HIV-infected women taking efavirenz have an even greater need for effective birth control as this medication may cause severe brain damage to a developing fetus. The use of an emergency contraceptive agent in cases of unprotected sex or condom failure can prevent pregnancy. This study seeks to establish that Plan B can be used effectively and safely in women taking efavirenz.</detailed_description>
