	<brief_summary>Drug-eluting stents have been shown to decrease restenosis, but were associated with an increased rate of death, as compared with bare-metal stents. Recently, thiazolidinediones effectively reduced restenosis and the risk of repeat target vessel revascularization. We conducted a study to compare the performance of a drug-eluting stent with that of a bare-metal stent with pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Pioglitazone and SES With type2 DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective cohort trial involving 38 type 2 diabetic patients referred for coronary stenting who were assigned to either the sirolimus-eluting stent group or the pioglitazone group. Quantitative coronary angiography will be performed at study entry and at six months follow-up to evaluate in-stent late luminal loss and the percentage of the luminal diameter and the rate of restenosis. We also analyze major adverse cardiac events at 12 months.</detailed_description>
