	<brief_summary>For people with Type 1 Diabetes, blood glucose control is achieved by matching insulin doses directly to the amount of carbohydrate consumed. We are looking at new ways to help our patients with type 1 diabetes manage their diabetes control more effectively. We are testing if "Diabetes Interactive Diary" (DID), a novel programme designed to be used on a mobile phone, can represent an important tool in carbohydrate counting while avoiding the use of complex calculations and in depth knowledge about the carbohydrate content of their food.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing the Effectiveness of Diabetes Interactive Diary (DID) in Diabetes Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is randomized control trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a DID compare to the standard education approach in order to help the patients with Type 1 diabetes to estimate the carbohydrate in their food and adjust insulin doses. It involves individuals with Type 1 diabetes who are not habitually using carbohydrate counting. They should be testing their blood sugar levels at least 3 times a day, using multiple daily injections of short-acting and long-acting insulin analogues, with HbA1c between 7.5% and 10% and are familiar with the use of mobile phones and possess a personal SIM card. Patients will be randomized to the standard education programme run for 4 full days over a 4 week period or to the DID programme run as three 2-hour sessions over a two-week period. The DID is a novel software programme installed on the patient's mobile telephone. It facilitates the communication between the dietitian and the patient by using SMS text messages, so that the dietitian can monitor glycaemic control and suggest adjustments if necessary. It can be described as a little computer, where the patient can record their blood glucose value, the amount of insulin injected and the amount of carbohydrate consumed.</detailed_description>
