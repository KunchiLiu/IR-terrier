	<brief_title>Analgesic Effect of Breast Feeding vs Sucrose in Neonatal Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood sampling heel lance for neonatal screening is the most frequent painful manoeuvre in Neonatal Units in healthy neonates. Some techniques showed efficacy evidence in reducing pain response: sucrose solutions, breastfeeding during blood sampling, topical local anaesthetics. A Cochrane Review in 2004 recommends the administration of sucrose 0.24-0.48 g (1-2 ml of 24% sucrose solution). It reduces PIPP scale rate about 20%. Our purpose is to compare the antinociceptive effect of 1 ml 30% sucrose solution administered 2 minutes before heel lancing vs blood sampling heel lance during breastfeeding. PIPP scale is a validated 7-indicator scale for the assessment of procedural pain in preterm and term neonates. Informant consent was asked parents during consultation by a Pediatrician of the Neonatal Unit of the Hospital in the last months of pregnancy. After parent written consent was obtained, 100 three day old neonates were randomized for treatment A (breastfeeding) or B (sucrose solution administration). The nurse opened consecutively numbered envelopes. Timing of operators: Group A Breastfeeding - The heel of neonate was warmed up by a glove full of water at 40° C for 2 minutes. - Monitoring of Oxygen Saturation and Heart Rate. - The neonate was breastfed by the mother till the nurse watched a continuous active suction. - Administration of first phase of PIPP scale (15 seconds before heel lance). - Digital Voice Record started - Heel Lance with an automated piercing device . - Squeezing for blood sampling till filling 4 catch basins for neonatal screening. If necessary a new heel lance was practiced. - Administration of the second phase of PIPP scale. - Record of duration of blood sampling and collateral effects - Stop Digital Voice Recording Group B Sucrose administration - The neonate was laid on a baby-changing table. - The heel of neonate was warmed up by a gloves full of water a 40° C for 2 minutes. - Oral administration of 1 ml of 30% sucrose solution. - Monitoring of Oxygen Saturation and Heart Rate. - Administration of first phase of PIPP scale (15 seconds before heel lance). - Digital Voice Record starts - Heel Lance with an automated piercing device. - Squeezing for blood sampling till filling 4 catch basins for neonatal screening. If necessary a new heel lance was practiced. - Administration of the second phase of PIPP scale.Record of duration of blood sampling and collateral effects. - Stop Digital Voice Recording Blood sampling was practiced by skilled pediatric nurses. Registration of data, PIPP scale, voice record was made by a second operator, blind to the pur pose of the study. A third blind operator collected paper data and checked voice record (outcome cry behaviour).</detailed_description>
