	<brief_title>Phase II Poor Risk Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) of Total Lymphoid Irradiation (TLI) and Antithymocyte Globulin (ATG) Followed by Matched Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation as Consolidation to Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (AHCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This purpose of this clinical trial is to develop an alternative treatment for patients with relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma who are not likely to be cured by the conventional transplantation regimen. This study tests a tandem transplant approach that starts with transplantation of the patient's own hematopoietic (blood) cells (AHCT) as preparation for an allogeneic transplantation whereby the blood cells from a matched donor are used to try to support the patient's immune system to fight the cancer cells. A novel combination of lymphoma-specific radiation that only impacts the lymphoid organs (lymph nodes and spleen) and an immune suppressing drug is given to prepare the patient body to receive the donor's cells. This conditioning regimen is used because it has been shown to reduce the likelihood of a very common side-effect, known as graft versus host disease, a negative reaction of the donor's cells against the patient's tissues. By carefully preparing the patient for this immune-based strategy, it is hoped that an improvement in event-free survival and a reduction in the risk of disease relapse after AHCT will be seen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 to 70 years. Histologically proven diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL) by the WHO classification. Relapse after achieving initial remission or failure to achieve initial remission. Patients with residual radiographic abnormalities after primary therapy are eligible if abnormalities are FDGPET positive. Receipt of 2 cycles of secondline therapy and FDGPET positive per Stanford (central) review. FDGPET to be done 2 weeks after cycle 2 of second line chemotherapy. ECOG performance status &lt; 2 Matched related or unrelated donor identified and available Bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic analysis within 8 weeks of registration Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to use an accepted and effective method of birth control. Patients must have a pretreatment serum bilirubin &lt; 2 x the institutional ULN, a serum creatinine &lt; 2 x the institutional ULN and measured or estimated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min by the following formula (all tests must be performed within 28 days prior to registration): Estimated Creatinine Clearance = (140 age)X WT(kg) X 0.85 if female 72X serum creatinine(mg/dl). Patients must have an EKG within 42 days prior to registration that shows no significant abnormalities that are suggestive of active cardiac disease. Patients requiring therapy for coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, or congestive heart failure are not eligible. Patients must have a radionuclide ejection fraction within 42 days of registration. If the ejection fraction is &lt;40%, the patient will not be eligible. If the ejection fraction is 4050%, the patient will have a cardiology consult. Patients must have a corrected diffusion capacity &gt;55%. Patients with known allergy to etoposide or a history of Grade 3 hemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide are not eligible. Patients with &gt; grade 2 sensory or motor peripheral neuropathy from prior vinca alkaloid use are not eligible. Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are ineligible due to the known birth defects association with the treatments used in this study. Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive are ineligible because the concern for opportunistic infection and hematologic reserve are considered to be significantly greater in this population. The antibody test for HIV must be performed within 42 days of registration. No chemotherapy other than corticosteroids should be administered within 2 weeks of the initiation of protocol therapy. No prior malignancy is allowed except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer or other cancer for which the patients has been diseasefree for five years. Patients with a prior diagnosis of nonHodgkin's lymphoma are not eligible. Patients with active infection requiring oral or intravenous antibiotics are excluded. No prior autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. No prior radioimmunotherapy Donor Selection/Evaluation: Related or unrelated HLA identical donors who are in good health and have no contraindication to donation. No contraindication for the donor to collection by apheresis of mononuclear cells mobilized by GCSF at a dose of 16 Âµg/kg of body weight. Donors will be evaluated with a full history and physical examination. Virology testing including CMV, HIV, EBV, HTLV, RPR, Hepatitis A, B and C will be performed within 30 days of donation. Prospective donors will be screened for CMV seroreactivity and seronegative donors will be utilized if available. If the possibility of more than one HLAmatched related donor exists, then the donor will be selected on the basis of CD31 allotype.</criteria>
