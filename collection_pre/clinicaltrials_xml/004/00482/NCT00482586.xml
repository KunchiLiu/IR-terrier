	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Develop a data repository for clinical and health-related quality of life outcome measures in patients with hepatic malignancies treated with image-guided therapies. OUTLINE: This is a pilot, prospective, longitudinal study. Patients complete a standard questionnaire assessing health-related quality of life at baseline, during routine follow-up care after image-guided therapy, and then annually thereafter. Health and disease status and the development of other illnesses are assessed by medical record review. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified</detailed_description>
