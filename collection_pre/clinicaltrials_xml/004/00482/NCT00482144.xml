	<brief_title>Study of the Effects of the Pulsed-dye Laser at 585nm and 595nm to Treat Post-operative Scars on Suture-removal Day</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many treatment modalities have been used for the treatment of scars such as dermabrasion, cryotherapy, intralesional corticosteroids, surgical scar revision, and lasers, among others. Previous studies have shown that treatment of scars with the pulsed dye laser (PDL) alone or in combination with other modalities (e.g. corticosteroids, 5-Fluoruracil, silicone sheets) improves the vascularity, pliability, color, and height of hypertrophic scars and keloids. Currently, the PDL has become the laser of choice for the treatment of scars. To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature comparing the effects of different wavelengths of the PDL for the treatment of scars. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of the PDL at 585nm vs 595nm in the treatment of postsurgical linear scars starting the day of suture removal.</detailed_description>
