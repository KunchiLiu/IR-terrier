	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, randomized, four-arm, dose-escalating, double blind, placebo controlled study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of four dose levels of MTR105 in patients undergoing cardiac surgery utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass presenting hypotension upon weaning off bypass.</detailed_description>
