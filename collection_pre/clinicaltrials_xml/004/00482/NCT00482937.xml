	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacodynamic Study of CD-NP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase, “ascending dose phase”, will be an open-label study in cohorts of four (4) subjects (entered two subjects at a time) with the primary objective of establishing the safety of CD-NP. The second phase, “MTD confirmation phase”, will be conducted under randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions in a larger cohort of subjects (10 subjects). The primary objective of this phase will be to confirm the safety and pharmacodynamic findings at the apparent MTD. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the effect of CD-NP on: mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), urinary sodium and potassium excretion (UNaV and UKV, respectively), urinary flow rate (UV), and creatinine clearance. Plasma concentrations of CD-NP, angiotensin II, and aldosterone, and the urinary excretion rates of cGMP and CD-NP will also be determined.</detailed_description>

Positive screen for Hepatitis B (HbsAg, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen), Hepatitis C (anti HCV, Hepatitis C Antibody), or HIV (antiHIV 1/2). Received an investigational drug within a period of 30 days prior to enrollment in the study. Received any drug therapy within 1 week, or 5 halflives, prior to administration of the first dose of any studyrelated treatment. This exclusion is extended to 4 weeks for any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism. Use of NSAIDs, sulfonamides, probenecid or other drugs known to alter renal or tubular function is specifically prohibited for at least 5 halflives prior to the first dose of any study related treatment. Consumption of alcohol within 48 hours prior to dose administration or during any inpatient period. A positive urine drug screen including ethanol, cocaine, THC, barbiturates, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and opiates. A history (within the last 2 years) of alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, significant mental illness, physical dependence to any opioid, or any history of drug abuse or addiction. A history of difficulty with donating blood. Donated blood or blood products within 45 days prior to enrollment</criteria>
