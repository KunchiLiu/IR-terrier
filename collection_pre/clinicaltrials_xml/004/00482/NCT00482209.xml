	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to provide answers to the following four questions: 1. Is a regimen of medical abortion with mifepristone using 400mcg buccal misoprostol as effective and acceptable as using 800mcg buccal misoprostol up to 63 days since the last menstrual period (LMP)? 2. Are the side effects with buccal use tolerable for women? 3. Is buccal administration of misoprostol acceptable to women? 4. When given a choice, do women prefer to take misoprostol at home or in the clinic?</detailed_description>
