	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, the effect of rennin inhibition and the relationship among pharmacokinetics, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) biomarkers, and blood pressure lowering effects of oral doses of SPP100 in Japanese patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Safety will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
