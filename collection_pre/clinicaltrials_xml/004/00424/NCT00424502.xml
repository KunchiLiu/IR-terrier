	<brief_summary>This single arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MabThera in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis whose current treatment with one or more TNF blocker had produced an inadequate response.

The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
