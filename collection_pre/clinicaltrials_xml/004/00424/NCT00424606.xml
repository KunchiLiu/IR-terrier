	<brief_summary>The combination of taxanes, and especially docetaxel, with an anthracycline seems to be an important part of the chemotherapy regimens used in the adjuvant setting of patients with early-stage node-positive breast cancer patients. Whether sequential or concurrent administration of these drugs is preferable is not yet known, especially in patients with node-negative high risk tumors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast adenocarcinoma. Within 2045 days after the surgical excision of the primary tumor with tumorfree operation margins; at least 10 axillary lymph nodes have to be removed. Absence of lymph node involvement after eclosion and hormone (E&amp;H) staining and light microscopy evaluation. Premenopausal or postmenopausal women with at least one of the following tumor characteristics is required in order to characterize the tumor as high risk: Estrogen receptor (ER) () and progesterone receptor (PR)(); Ki67 + &gt; 30%; Grade III; HER2 (3+) (after an amendment on 15.05.2008 women with HER2 (3+) were not included); Perineural infiltration or presence of tumor emboli in blood or lymph vessels. Postmenopausal women with tumors 12 cm are eligible if the tumor has at least 2 of the above mentioned high risk criteria. Premenopausal and postmenopausal women with tumors measuring &gt; 2 cm are eligible irrespectively of the expression of the above adverse prognostic tumor criteria. Absence of any clinical or radiological evidence of local or metastatic disease. Age &gt; 18 years. Performance status (WHO) &lt; 3. Adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm^3, platelet count &gt; 100000/mm^3, hemoglobin &gt; 9 gr/mm^3). Adequate liver (bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal and SGOT/SGPT &lt; 2 times upper limit of normal) and renal function (creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl). Adequate cardiac function (LVEF &gt; 50%). Negative pregnancy test. Informed consent. Other invasive malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer. Other concurrent uncontrolled illness that could affect compliance with the study. Psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance. Pregnant or nursing women.
