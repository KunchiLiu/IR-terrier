	<brief_summary>The study compared the efficacy of oral lenalidomide in combination with oral pulse high-dose dexamethasone to that of placebo and oral high-dose pulse dexamethasone as treatment for participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Lenalidomide Plus Dexamethasone Versus Dexamethasone Alone in Previously Treated Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was initiated in 2003 and enrolled a total of 351 participants. The study was unblinded starting on 03 August 2005 after a preplanned interim analysis demonstrated a highly significant treatment benefit in favor of the lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination based on results for the primary endpoint, time to progression (TTP). In March 2008, the specified number of at least 194 death events needed for full statistical power of the overall survival (OS) analysis was reached. At the time of the 02 March 2008 cutoff date, there were still 29 participants in active treatment in Europe (Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Poland, Spain and Ukraine) and Israel. Only safety data were collected for these participants beyond the 02 March 2008 cutoff date. The last visit for the last patient occurred on 25 June 2013.</detailed_description>
