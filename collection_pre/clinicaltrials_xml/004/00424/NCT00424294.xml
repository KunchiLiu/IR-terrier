	<brief_title>A Study Of CP-195543 And Celecoxib Dual Therapy In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial enrollment was prematurely discontinued on December 3, 2007. The results of an interim efficacy and safety analysis demonstrated an overall poor tolerability profile and high discontinuation rate when dual therapy with CP-195543 and Celecoxib was administered. The decision to discontinue further enrollment in the trial was not based on any efficacy or serious safety concerns. Previously enrolled study participants continued in the study and the trial completed on February 27, 2008.</detailed_description>
