	<detailed_description>Phase1 study of GSK1325760A - A double blind, single center, randomised, placebo-controlled, partially crossover, single dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and to assess the effect of food on pharmacokinetics of ascending oral doses of GSK1325760A in healthy Japanese male subject -</detailed_description>
	<criteria>They are considered as healthy by the investigator at screening. Healthy subjects are defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant illness or disease as determined by their medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign, 12lead ECG, immunology tests and urinary drug screening tests.

Standard weight is in the range of 5585 kg inclusive. Blood pressure and pulse rate at screening within the normal range (systolic 90140 mmHg, diastolic 4090 mmHg, pulse rate 4090bpm). They have the following clinical laboratory test Biochemistry (AST(GOT), ALT(GPT), ALP, LDH and gammaGTP : within normal range at screening. Haematology (RBC, Hb and Ht) below upper limit normal range at screening. Normal ECG at screening (QTc value of &lt;440msec). They give their consent to be able to abstain from sexual intercourse or use condom for contraception from at screening until poststudy screen. They are capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. They are nonsmokers (at least 6 months). They are able to attend all visits and complete the study. The subject has any clinically relevant abnormality on medical examination, vital sign, clinical laboratory test or medical history at screening in the medical opinion of the investigator or the subject has a medical history that is not considered as eligible for inclusion in this study by the investigator. The subject has an allergy for any drug or idiosyncrasy. This excludes a pollen allergy without current symptoms. The subject has participated in a clinical study or postmarketing study with an investigational or a noninvestigational product or device during the previous 4 months of the first dosing. The subject is concurrently participating in another clinical study or postmarketing study in which the subject is or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product or device. The subject is positive for syphilis, HBs antigen, HCV antibody, HIV antibody, HTLV1 antibody. The subject is positive for urine drugs of abuse test. The subject has donated a unit of blood (&gt;400mL) within the previous 4 months or (&gt;200mL) within the previous 1 month of screening. The subject is currently taking regular (or a course of) medication (including prescribed drug, overthecounter medication and herbal preparations). Medication nor permitted during the study must be discontinued 14 days prior to dosing. The subject has a history or current conditions of drug abuse or alcoholism according to ICD10.
