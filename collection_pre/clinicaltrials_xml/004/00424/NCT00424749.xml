	<brief_summary>Churg-Strauss Syndrome (CSS) is a disease characterized by asthma, abnormally high amounts of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), and blood vessel inflammation. About 25% of CSS patients develop kidney disease. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Rituximab in inducing remission of kidney disease in patients with CSS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituxan in Churg Strauss Syndrome With Renal Involvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is a small vessel systemic vasculitis associated with asthma and eosinophilia that causes glomerulonephritis in about 25% of patients. Rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells and is effective in numerous autoimmune disease including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Rituximab in inducing remission of renal disease activity in patients with CSS.</detailed_description>
