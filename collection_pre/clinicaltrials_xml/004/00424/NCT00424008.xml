	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to demonstrate the non-inferiority between two inhaled glucocorticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilator combination drugs called mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate in a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol in a dry powder inhaler (DPI) on lung function. Information on the onset of action, the overall safety, and how the drugs control asthma will also be assessed. The study is approximately 1 year in duration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must have a diagnosis of asthma for at least 12 months' duration. A participant must have been using a medium daily dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroids (alone or in combination with longacting beta 2agonist [LABA]) for at least 12 weeks and must have been on a stable regimen for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening. If there is no inherent harm in changing the participant's current asthma therapy, the participant must be willing to discontinue his/her prescribed inhaled glucocorticosteroid (ICS) or ICS/LABA prior to initiating MF MDI runin medication. The diagnosis of asthma must be documented by either demonstrating an increase in absolute forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of at least 12% and a volume increase of at least 200 mL within approximately 15 to 20 minutes after administration of 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol or of nebulized shortacting beta 2agonist (SABA) OR peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability of more than 20% OR a diurnal variation PEF of more than 20% based on the difference between prebronchodilator (before taking albuterol/salbutamol) morning value and the postbronchodilator value (after taking albuterol/salbutamol) from the evening before, expressed as a percentage of the mean daily PEF value on any day during the openlabel Runin Period. A participant must have a history of &gt;= 2 asthmarelated unscheduled visits to a physician or to an emergency room within the past year AND &gt;= 3 asthmarelated unscheduled visits within the past 2 years. Prior to randomization participants must have used a total of 12 or more inhalations of SABA rescue medication during the last 10 days of runin. Clinical laboratory tests (complete blood counts [CBC], blood chemistries, including serum pregnancy for females of childbearing potential, and urinalysis) conducted at the Screening Visit must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator/sponsor before the participant is instructed to start using openlabel MF MDI runin medication. An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the Screening Visit, using a centralized transtelephonic technology, must be clinically acceptable to the investigator. A chest xray performed at the Screening Visit, or within 12 months prior to the Screening Visit, must be clinically acceptable to the investigator. A nonpregnant female participant of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable, adequate form of birth control. A female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening in order to be considered eligible for enrollment. A participant who demonstrates a change in absolute FEV1 of &gt; 20% at any time between the Screening and Baseline Visits on any 2 consecutive days between the Screening and Baseline visits. A participant who requires the use of greater than 8 inhalations per day of SABA MDI or 2 or more nebulized treatments per day of 2.5 mg SABA on any 2 consecutive days between the Screening and Baseline Visits. A participant who experiences a decrease in AM or PM PEF below the Runin Period stability limit on any 2 consecutive days prior to randomization. The average AM and average PM PEF respective values from the preceding 7 days are added, divided by the number of nonmissing values, and multiplied by 0.70 to determine the stability limit. A participant who experiences a clinical asthma exacerbation: defined as a clinical deterioration of asthma as judged by the clinical investigator between the Screening and Baseline Visits, that results in emergency treatment, hospitalization due to asthma, or treatment with additional, excluded asthma medication (including oral or other systemic corticosteroids, but allowing SABA).</criteria>
