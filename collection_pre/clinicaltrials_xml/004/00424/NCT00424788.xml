	<brief_summary>Natalizumab (TYSABRI) is a protein-based drug that is manufactured by Biogen Idec in partnership with Elan Pharmaceuticals. Natalizumab is approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The purpose of this study is to determine whether the amount of natalizumab (TYSABRI) that is present in your blood (plasma) can be reduced or eliminated by separating and removing the plasma and replacing it with other fluids, a process called plasma exchange.</brief_summary>
