	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Docetaxel and Gemcitabine Versus Gemcitabine in Elderly Patients With NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel and gemcitabine are well known active agents in the treatment of NSCLC. The standard treatment of elderly patients with advanced NSCLC is monotherapy with a third generation agent. However, there are only few randomized trials evaluating a two drug combination specifically addressed to elderly patients. The role of comprehensive geriatric assessment in treatment efficacy and tolerance is an area of investigation</detailed_description>
