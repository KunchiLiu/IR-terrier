	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Chloroquine Associated With Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate to Treat Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide progression of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine (CQ), amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance leaves few alternative for the control of malaria, particularly in Africa. For some strains of P. falciparum and P. berghei, the resistance to CQ and AQ is linked to an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and GSH-related enzyme activity, such as glucose 6-phosphate deshydrogenase (G6PD). The pro-hormone dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate can be used to potentiate the antimalarial action of CQ on drug resistant P. falciparum strains, by inhibiting parasite G6PD activity. This hormone has a second advantage: it is metabolised in human into a series of potent immunomodulatory steroids which may be in the causal pathway that allowed the induction of protective immune responses against several infections, included malaria. This first study evaluated the tolerance and efficacy of a standard CQ regimen supplemented with dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate for the treatment of drug resistant uncomplicated falciparum malaria.</detailed_description>
