	<brief_title>Comparison of Autologous Serum and Umbilical Cord Serum Eyedrops for Dry Eye Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ninety-two eyes of 48 patients with severe dry eye syndrome (34 eyes of 17 patients with Sjögren’s syndrome and 58 eyes of 31 patients with non-Sjögren’s syndrome) were treated with either 20% autologous serum (41 eyes of 21 patients) or umbilical cord serum eyedrops (51 eyes of 27 patients). Symptom scoring, corneal sensitivity test, tear film break-up time (BUT), Schirmer test, tear clearance rate (TCR), corneal fluorescein staining, and conjunctival impression cytology were performed before and 1 month and 2 months after treatment.</detailed_description>
