	<detailed_description>Anterior vaginal wall prolapse is a common problem. Until now many different surgical techniques have been evaluated but so far recurrence is often still observed. Therefore, synthetic mesh or biomesh for vaginal prolapse reconstruction have been introduced. However, is is now known whether these methods are superior to the replication of the pubocervicale fascia, a method which is well described and have been used for many years. Furthermore, most studies evaluating the used of mesh for anterior vaginal wall prolapse have not been controlled studies and been irrespective to whether the repair was a primary or secondary operation.</detailed_description>
