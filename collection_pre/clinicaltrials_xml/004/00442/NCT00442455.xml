	<brief_title>Erlotinib,Radiation and Cisplatin in Patients With Complete Resected Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I: 3 cohorts of 3-6 patients, patients will received: - Erlotinib 100-150 mg/day po for 7 weeks. - Cisplatin 30-40 mg/m2 iv weekly for 7 weeks. - Radiation therapy 63 Gy, five days a week, for 7 weeks. Cohort 1: 3 patients will be included in cohort 1. If no DLT has been recorded in the first three patients during the 7-weeks treatment, the dose level of erlotinib will be escalated to 150 mg and enrollment of cohort 2 will be initiated. If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients during the during the 7-weeks treatment, then the first cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. - If no further DLT has been recorded in patients 4 to 6 of cohort 1 during the 7-weeks treatment cycle, the dose level of erlotinib will be escalated to 150 mg and enrollment of cohort 2 will be initiated, after patient 6 has completed the 7-weeks treatment. - If DLT has been recorded in one out of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 1 during the 7-weeks treatment cycle, the dose level of erlotinib will be escalated to 150 mg and enrollment of cohort 2 will be initiated, after patient 6 has completed the 7-weeks treatment. - If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 1, during the during the 7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will be considered as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the first three patients during the during the 7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will be considered as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). Cohort 2: If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients or 1-2 of the 6 patients in cohort 1, 3 patients will be included in cohort 2. If no DLT has been recorded in the first three patients during the 7-weeks treatment, the dose level of cisplatin will be escalated to 40 mg/m2 and enrollment of cohort 3 will be initiated. If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients during the during the 7-weeks treatment, then the second cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. - If no further DLT has been recorded in patients 4 to 6 of cohort 2 during the 7-weeks treatment cycle, the dose level of cisplatin will be escalated to 40 mg/m2 and enrollment of cohort 3 will be initiated, after patient 6 has completed the 7-weeks treatment - If DLT has been recorded in one out of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 2 during the 7-weeks treatment cycle, the dose level of cisplatin will be escalated to 40 mg/m2 and enrollment of cohort 3 will be initiated, after patient 6 has completed the 7-weeks treatment - If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 2 during the during the 7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will be considered as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the first three patients of cohort 2 during the during the 7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will be considered as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). Cohort 3: If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients or 1-2 of the 6 patients in cohort 2, 3 patients will be included in cohort 2. If no DLT has been recorded in the first three patients during the 7-weeks treatment, then the Maximum Tolerated Dose has not been reached. If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients during the during the 7-weeks treatment, then the third cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. - If no further DLT has been recorded in patients 4 to 6 of cohort 3 during the 7-weeks treatment cycle, then the Maximum Tolerated Dose has not been reached. - If DLT has been recorded in one out of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 3 during the 7-weeks treatment cycle, then the Maximum Tolerated Dose has not been reached. - If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 3 during the during the 7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will be considered as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the first three patients of cohort 3 during the during the 7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will be considered as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). Inclusion of the third patient of each cohort will not be allowed until the safety data from the two previous patients have been analyzed Inclusion of the third patient of each cohort will not be allowed until the safety data from the two previous patients have been analyzed DLT is defined as: - Any clinically intolerable hematological or non-hematological grade 3-4 toxicity. - Grade 3-4 diarrhoea. - Grade 3-4 or clinically intolerable grade 2 skin rash. - Grade 4 mucositis implying a temporary interruption of radiation therapy (for longer than 2 consecutive weeks). - Grade 4 mucositis occurring within the first 3 weeks of treatment. - Grade 3-4 mucositis accompanied by one of the following toxicities: - Worsening of performance status, defined as ECOG ≥ 2 or a decrease of 40% in the Karnofsky performance status scale. - Grade 3 Weight loss (corresponding to a weight loss of ≥ 20% with respect to baseline weight). - Underlying pain (not including swallowing) VAS &gt; 7. - Parenteral nutrition. - Any clinically significant toxicity, involving treatment interruption for a period longer than two weeks. Maximum Tolerated Dose is defined as the dose level at which 2 patients of the first three patients of one cohort or ≥ 3 of the 6 patients of one cohort exhibit one DLT, during the 7-weeks treatment. Phase II: 75 patients will be treated at dose step below MTD to determinate: - Progression Free Survival, defined as the period of time from the surgery until disease progression or death. - Overall survival. - Locoregional progression-free survival. A tumor assessment will be performed 30 days after the end of treatment and every 3 months until disease progression afterwards.</detailed_description>

Patients capable of oral deglutition or requiring gastrostomy. No problems of intestinal transit such as malabsorption syndrome, chronic inflammatory bowel disease and other diseases, which might impair drug absorption Histology other than squamous cell carcinoma. Presence of macroscopic residual disease. Previous treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy or EGFRtargeted agents. Incomplete resection of the primary tumor or incomplete neck dissection. Patients being diagnosed with any other malignant disease, excluding resected nonmelanoma skin cancer or resected uterine cervix carcinoma. Pregnant or nursing women. Active infection. Concomitant severe illness (according to the opinion of the investigator) or whose estimated survival for this concomitant pathology is lower than that estimated for the neoplasm disease. Uncontrolled psychiatric illness. Inability to take oral medication, requiring intravenous feeding or prior surgical procedures affecting absorption or having active peptic ulcer. Impossibility to appropriate followup. Evidence of any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding suggesting a condition that contraindicates the use of the study medication (erlotinib, cisplatin, radiotherapy), which might interfere with the analysis of the results or increase the risk of treatment complications. Any known significant ophthalmologic abnormalities, including severe xerophthalmia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Sjögren syndrome, severe exposure keratopathy or other abnormalities, which may increase the risk of corneal epithelial damage (the use of contact lenses during the study may increase the risk of corneal damage and its use is strongly discouraged. Those patients still using contact lenses will need a closer ophthalmologic followup. Frequent vomiting or medical disorder impairing swallowing of drugs</criteria>
