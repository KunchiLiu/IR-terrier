	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study evaluating Asmanex Twisthaler 220 mcg once daily (QD) in the evening (PM) compared with "Asmanex" Placebo QD PM for 12 weeks. Efficacy will be measured for the changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline to the end of treatment period (Week 12 or end of the study).</brief_summary>

Those using a combination ICs plus longacting beta2 agonist (LABA) medication, such as Advair 100/50 twice daily (BID), must be changed to fluticasone propionate 100 mcg BID for at least 5 days prior to the start of RunInPeriod. Those using LABA as monotherapy must be switched to SABA prn for at least 5 days prior to the start of RunIn Period Be off treatment with leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) for at least 14 days prior to Screening Have an FEV1 &gt;=65% but &lt;=85% of predicted normal value at Screening and at Baseline when SABAs have been withheld for at least 6 hours Demonstrate an increase of absolute FEV1 of &gt;= 12% with an absolute volume increase of at least 200mL during Screening. Written documentation of FEV1 reversibility of &gt;= 12% within 2 years prior to Screening was acceptable in lieu of testing. FEV1 reversibility testing should be done after withholding inhaled SABA for at least 6 hours Have a frequency of asthma score of at least 2 (at least 2 symptoms) and/or frequency of bronchodilator use score of at least 2 at Screening Have a Total Asthma Severity Score (TASS) of at least 4 on 8 or more of the AM and PM recordings from the last 7 days during the Runin period prior to Baseline and the AM of the Baseline Visit At Screening Visit, have sleep disturbance and scores of &gt;=2 on the interference with sleep rating scale (recall over the past 7 nights), and at least 30 on the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep scale (MOSSS) Sleep Disturbance Sleep Scale (recall over the past 7 days) At the Baseline Visit, must have sleep disturbance and scores of &gt;= 2 on interference with sleep rating scale (recorded in a diary during the past 7 nights), and at least 30 on the MOSSS Sleep Problems Index II 9 items(SLP 9) Exclusion Criteria Women who are pregnant or intend to become pregnant during the study Women who are nursing or intend to nurse during the study or within 30 days after completion Have participated in any clinical trial within the last 30 days or in one involving antibodies for asthma or rhinitis within 3 months prior to Screening Have had an unscheduled medical visit (due to exacerbation of asthma) within 1 month prior to Screening Have been treated in the emergency room or admitted to the hospital due to exacerbation of asthma on two or more occasions within the 12 months prior to Screening Have used &gt;12 puffs of rescue SABAs or 2 treatments with a nebulized beta2agonist per day on 2 consecutive days within 4 weeks prior to Screening Required more than 2 courses of oral/systemic corticosteroids for asthma within 12 months prior to Screening Have a history of sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, or use of medications that affect alertness or sleep Have sleep apnea, obstructive sleep apneahypopnea, or are being treated with the ventilation devices Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP), or are receiving oxygen by inhalation Are smokers or exsmokers who have smoked within 6 months prior to Screening or have a cumulative smoking history of 10 packyears or greater Are allergic to corticosteroids, SABAs, or LABAs Required ventilator support for respiratory failure secondary to asthma in the last 10 years Have a BodyMassIndex greater than 35</criteria>
