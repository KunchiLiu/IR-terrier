	<brief_title>Safety and Acceptability of SPL7013 Gel (VivaGelâ„¢) in Sexually Active Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women continue to comprise a growing proportion of the new HIV infections around the world. A growing body of data suggests that a safe and effective topical microbicide will be a real option of prevention for women in the future. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and acceptability of 3% SPL7013 Gel when administered intravaginally, twice daily for 14 consecutive days in healthy, sexually-active, HIV-uninfected women. The expected duration of this study for each participant is 21 days. Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two arms. Participants in Arm 1 will apply 3.5 g of SPL7013 gel intravaginally twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Participants in Arm 2 will apply a placebo gel intravaginally twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Starpharma produces SPL7013 gel (VivaGel) and will provide it for this study. After enrollment, participants will attend three study visits. These visits will occur on Days 7, 14, and 21. A follow-up safety visit will occur if necessary. Medical and menstrual history, targeted physical exam, urine and blood collection, cervical swabs, and vaginal smears will occur at all visits. A colposcopy will occur at least once. On Day 2, participants will take part in a phone assessment.</detailed_description>
