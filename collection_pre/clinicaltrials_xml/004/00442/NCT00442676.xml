	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and a leading cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Recent findings indicate preeclampsia is an inflammatory disorder associated with increased expression of COX-2. This study will test the hypothesis that treatment of women with a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, will stop the inflammatory process and reverse symptoms of preeclampsia.</brief_summary>
