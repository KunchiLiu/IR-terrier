	<brief_title>Prediction of NODAT After Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients transplanted in our department receive a formal oral glucose tolerance test (and thus also fasting plasma glucose concentration) in the first week after renal transplantation. This testing for DM or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is part of our standard clinical protocol and data are collected prospectively in all these patients in an electronic patient medical file. The development of diabetes mellitus in all transplant patients is documented, including DM therapy.</detailed_description>
