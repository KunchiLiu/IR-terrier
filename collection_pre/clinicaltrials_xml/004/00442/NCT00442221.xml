A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant); or, Childbearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at screen, and employs one of the following acceptable measures of contraception: Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the investigational product, throughout the study, and for a time interval after completion or premature discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of the investigational drug (a minimum of 24 hrs); subjects utilizing this method must agree to use an alternate method of contraception if they should become sexually active and will be queried on whether they have been abstinent in the preceding 2 weeks when they present to the clinic for randomized treatment; or, Female sterilization; or, Sterilization of male partner; or, Implants of levonorgestrel; or, Injectable progestogen; or, Oral contraceptive (combined or progestogen only); or, Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year (not all IUDs meet this criterion); or, Any other method with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate for that method is less than 1% per year. Barrier method only if used in combination with any of the above acceptable methods 2. Subject is 18 – 65 years of age. 3. Subject’s first migraine occurred prior to the age of 50 years. 4.

Subject has a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. 11. Subject has a history of basilar or hemiplegic migraine. 12. Subject has a history of impaired hepatic or renal function that, in the investigator’s opinion, contraindicates participation in this study; or the subject has any other abnormal laboratory value of clinical significance for this study. 13. Subject has a history of nonmigraine (i.e., tensiontype, sinus, etc.) headache frequency greater than or equal to 15 days/month in each of the 3 months prior to screening. 14. Subject has had &gt;6 migraine attacks/month in either of the 2 months prior to screening. 15.
