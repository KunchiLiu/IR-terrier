	<criteria>Male, with postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (either after radical prostatectomy or prostatectomy of prostate adenoma, whatever the route used), and for whom there has been more than 6 months followup since the date of that procedure. The patient should have been proposed urinary reeducation, which was refused for personal reasons, or should still suffer from urinary incontinence despite the reeducation. Urinary incontinence is materialized in this population by a score between 4 and 16 (inclusive) for the three questions of the ICIQ questionnaire. A urodynamic assessment including flow measurement and residue will have been carried out. A urethroscopy or urethrography will have been carried out to eliminate cases of urethral stenosis. Inclusion is subject to obtaining informed written consent, after remittance of the information sheet, and having had a detailed medical examination carried out. Medication for urinary incontinence and in particular anticholinergic drugs must have been stopped at least 15 days prior to initial assessment and for the duration of the trial. The same goes for urinary reeducation. Progressing prostatic neoplasia materialized by testing of PSA levels. Prostate radiotherapy. Neurological disorder which might lead to urinary incontinence or hinder assessment. Urethral or anastomotic stenosis materialized by urethroscopy or urethrography. Hyperactive detrusor muscle with leakage contemporaneous with uninhibited contractility. Chronic retention of urine with leakage due to overflow. Current urinary infection. This would be a temporary exclusion since assessment can take place after treatment and monitoring for sterility of urine.</criteria>
