	<brief_title>Study to Investigate the Induction of an Protective Immune Response to Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efforts to develop vaccines against malaria still represent a substantial focus of current research activities. Factors that have hampered the development of a subunit vaccine include the complexity of the malaria life cycle, the wide variety of immune response induced by the malaria parasite, and an incomplete knowledge of protective immunity. This study is therefore aimed at inducing protective immunity against malaria in 15 healthy volunteers. Volunteers will be exposed to the bites of infectious mosquitoes 3 times with live P. falciparum sporozoites under chloroquine prophylaxis. Challenge with infected mosquitoes will be given after stopping chloroquine prophylaxis. Five volunteers will form a control group; they will be exposed to non-infectious mosquitoes under chloroquine prophylaxis. Endpoints include the time and height of parasitemia after challenge, the development of fever and immunological parameters.</detailed_description>
