	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intermittent treatment with PEGASYS in HBeAg negative patients with chronic hepatitis B who have demonstrated virological and biochemical response after treatment with interferon alfa. After 48 weeks therapy with interferon alfa, and 24 weeks treatment-free follow-up, eligible patients will be randomized into the PEGASYS or the observational group. Those in the PEGASYS group will receive 4 therapeutic cycles of long term intermittent treatment with PEGASYS (135 micrograms sc weekly for 12 weeks, followed by a treatment-free period of 12 weeks) and those in the observational arm will receive no specific antiviral treatment. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is 100 individuals.</brief_summary>
