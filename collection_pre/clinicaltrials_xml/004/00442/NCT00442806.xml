	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish safety and feasibility of utilizing Adipose-Derived Stem and Regenerative Cells (ADRC's) in patients who have suffered a ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial of Adipose-Derived Stem Cells in the Treatment of Pts With ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects who have coronary artery disease and have suffered a ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction will be evaluated for eligibility in this study. Eligible subjects will undergo standard treatment after admission to the hospital and will then undergo liposuction under local anesthesia, after which ADRC's will be isolated from the lipoaspirate. According to randomization subjects will receive either ADRC's or placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Clinical symptoms consistent with AMI for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 12 hours from onset of symptoms to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), and unresponsive to nitroglycerin Successful revascularization of the culprit lesion in the major epicardial vessel Area of hypo or akinesia corresponding to the culprit lesion, as determined by left ventriculogram at the time of primary PCI Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥30% and ≤50% by Left Ventricular Angiography at the time of successful revascularization. Ability to undergo liposuction Key Prior MI, prior known cardiomyopathy, or prior hospital admission for congestive heart failure (CHF) More than 24 hours after acute PCI Significant valvular disease More than twelve hours between the onset of first symptoms of AMI and revascularization Hemodynamic instability within 24 hours prior to randomization Neoplasia Acute or chronic bacterial or viral infectious disease Pacemaker, ICD or any other contraindication for MRI LVEF &lt;30% or &gt;50% by Left Ventricular Angiography Moderate or severe COPD</criteria>
