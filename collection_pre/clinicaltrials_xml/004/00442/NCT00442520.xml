	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at several genes that might determine how the body processes the drugs used to treat lung, colorectal and head and neck cancers. The goal of this examination is to help investigators determine the proper dosage to give future cancer patients or to better predict which future patients will respond to particular drug therapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomic Study in Patients of Lung, Colorectal and Head/Neck Cancers Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to establish a pilot pharmacogenomic program in identifying genetic variation to predict the safety, toxicity and/or efficacy of drugs. DNA will be extracted from patients' peripheral blood to study SNPs in DPD, TS, MTHFR, UGT1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, HO-1, ERCC1, XPD, XRCC1 and EGFR genes. The results of genetic study will be compared to treatment efficacy and toxicity. The ultimate goal is to use genotype profiles to provide individualized cancer treatment to improve outcome and decrease toxicity.</detailed_description>
