	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of Mircera and darbepoetin alfa in the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis and who are receiving subcutaneous darbepoetin alfa maintenance therapy. Patients will be randomized either to remain on darbepoetin alfa therapy as per local label, or to switch to monthly subcutaneous Mircera, at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms, depending on the weekly dose of darbepoetin alfa administered prior to the first dose of Mircera. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
