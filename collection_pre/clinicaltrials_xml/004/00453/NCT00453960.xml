	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to verify the anti-estrogenic activity of Genistein, on the "non atypical endometrial hyperplasia", in premenopausal women.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although isoflavones alone (example: Genistein) have weak estrogenic effects on endometrial stromal and glandular cells, it was demonstrated, in several research efforts, that in the presence of E2 they act as antiestrogens. Considered that endometrial hyperplasia is due to strong and extended estrogenic stimulation, not offset by a proportionate amount of progesterone, we suppose that genistein could be therapeutic in these cases inducing a decrease of the hyperplasia and a change from the proliferative to a secretory phase of the endometrium.</detailed_description>
