	<criteria>Must be 12 years of age or older, of either sex and of any race. Must have at least a 2year documented history of SAR which exacerbates during the study season. Must have a positive skinprick test response to an appropriate seasonal allergen at Screening (Visit 1). Immunoglobulin E (IgE)mediated hypersensitivity to an appropriate seasonal allergen (ie, prevailing trees and/or grasses) must be documented by a positive response to the skin prick test with wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than diluent control after 20 minutes. Must be clinically symptomatic at the Screening Visit. Must be clinically symptomatic at the Baseline Visit. Must be in general good health as confirmed by routine clinical and laboratory testing and electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Clinical laboratory test (complete blood count [CBC], blood chemistries, and urinalysis) must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator and the sponsor. Must be free of any clinically significant disease, other than SAR, that would interfere with the study evaluations. A history of anaphylaxis and/or other severe local reaction(s) to skin testing. A subject with asthma who requires chronic use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids. Current or history of frequent, clinically significant sinusitis or chronic purulent postnasal drip. A subject with rhinitis medicamentosa. A history of allergies to more than two classes of medications or who are allergic to or cannot tolerate nasal sprays. A subject who has had an upper respiratory tract or sinus infection that required antibiotic therapy without at least a 14day washout prior to the Screening Visit, or who has had a viral upper respiratory infection within 7 days before the Screening Visit. A subject who has nasal structural abnormalities, including large nasal polyps and marked septal deviations, which significantly interfere with nasal air flow. A subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, is dependent on nasal, oral, or ocular decongestants, nasal topical antihistamines, or nasal steroids.</criteria>
