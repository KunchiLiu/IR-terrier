	<brief_summary>Basic objective of the German Adrenocortical Carcinoma Registry is to improve the care of patients with adrenocortical cancer. The registration of as many patients as possible helps to collect data for the prognosis and prospects of success regarding different treatment plans. This data will be taken into consideration for planning prospective studies. With this registry, the recruitment of patients for prospective studies will be significantly facilitated. In this way - and in cooperation with networks in other countries (e.g. in Italy and France) - a structure allowing systematic improvement of therapy will be developed.</brief_summary>
