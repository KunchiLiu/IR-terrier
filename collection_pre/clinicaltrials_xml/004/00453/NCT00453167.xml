	<brief_summary>As a single agent, paclitaxel has a response rate of 33% and 25-29% in SCLC patients with sensitive relapse and with resistant relapse, respectively. As a single agent, gemcitabine also has a response rate 16% and 6-13% in SCLC patients with sensitive relapse and with resistant relapse, respectively. Because of single-agent activity, different mechanism of action, non-overlapping toxicities, and beneficial pharmacologic interaction, paclitaxel and gemcitabine combinations are attractive for testing in clinical trials.</brief_summary>
