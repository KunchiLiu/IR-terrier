	<brief_title>Betamethasone Dosing Interval - 12 or 24 Hours?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Betamethasone is a medicine given to women expected to deliver after 24 but before 34 weeks of pregnancy. It is very advantageous in preventing or decreasing the many problems these small babies may face if born early. Betamethasone makes breathing easier for them, also decreases the chance of them bleeding in the head and makes their chances of survival better. This medicine is used routinely in pregnancy but the best timing between doses in not well established. The 'standard' dosing schedule involves giving 2 injections of 12mg of the medicine 24 hours apart. However, many women deliver before reaching the 24-hour mark, despite the doctors best efforts to try and delay delivery, and therefore miss the opportunity for the 2nd dose.</detailed_description>
