	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, international pilot study to evaluate changes that occur in 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)- and 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine(FLT)-PET (Positron Emission Tomography) imaging as a result of treatment with erlotinib in patients with recurrent or refractory non−small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will enroll approximately 30 patients at approximately 4 sites in Australia and 2 sites in the United States.</brief_summary>
