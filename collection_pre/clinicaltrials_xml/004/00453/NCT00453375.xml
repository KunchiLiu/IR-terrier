	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of BHT-3021 injections given weekly for 12 weeks and to evaluate the effect of BHT-3021 on antibody and immune (T cell) responses to autoantigens (e.g. insulin). Changes in pancreatic beta cell function, insulin requirements and blood glucose levels will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study of BHT-3021 in Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes results from an attack by the body's own immune system on the insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Around 80% of diagnosed patients have detectable antibodies to islet cell self-proteins including, insulin IA-2 and glutamic acid decarboxylase. The drug, BHT-3021 is being studied because an agent that stops autoimmune damage could offer patients benefit. Study Description: A Randomized, Blinded, Placebo Controlled, Safety and Pharmacodynamic Study of BHT-3021 with Open Label Cross-Over in Subjects with Type I Diabetes Mellitus that will enroll up to 72 subjects in this trial. Subjects will be randomized to BHT-3021 or BHT-placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The duration of the study is approximately 25 to 37 months depending on treatment assignment: 4 week Screening Period; 12 month Blinded Treatment and Evaluation Period; 12 month Cross-over Treatment and Evaluation Period (BHT-placebo subjects only); 12 month Long Term Follow-Up period.</detailed_description>
