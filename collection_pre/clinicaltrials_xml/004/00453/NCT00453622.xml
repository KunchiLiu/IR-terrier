	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to identify if the combined use of cardiac troponin enzyme (cTnT) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can predict Heart Failure (HF)improvement and all-cause mortality in patients implanted with cardiac pacemaker-defibrillation devices (CRT-D). Novel biochemical markers identifying patients with high risk cardiac mortality detected by plasma protein analysis will also be evaluated. Hypothesis #1: The combined use of cTnT and BNP at just before implant will predict and risk stratify all cause mortality or HF hospitalization up to 12 months. Hypothesis #2: The change in levels of said biomarkers at different points of follow-up can predict response to CRT through 12 months. Hypothesis #3: The levels of a panel of novel inflammatory mediators, namely chemokines, will be correlated with improvement in 6-minute walk testing, quality of life, and left ventricular ejection fraction in CRT patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the occurrence of either death or first HF hospitalization. HF hospitalizations must satisfy both of the following criteria: 1. Admission to hospital for &gt;24 hours with at least one of the following HF worsening symptoms: - Increased CHF class - Orthopnea - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea - Edema - Dyspnea on exertion, or - Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms attributable to HF - Placement on the Status I heart transplant list AND 2. One or more of the following intensive treatment(s) for HF within 24 hours of admission: - Intravenous (IV) diuresis - IV inotropic medications prescribed during the hospitalization, or - Increasing frequency of dialysis for patients with chronic renal failure 2.3 Secondary Endpoints Secondary endpoints include: - Cause of death - Change in NYHA functional class - Number of HF related hospitalizations - Performance on a standard 6-minute hall walk test - Quality of Life as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHFQ) questionnaire - Patient global clinical assessment - Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by echocardiography - LV volume measured by echocardiography - LV lead placement position - QRS duration at baseline and with CRT - Number of AT/AF, VT/VF episodes - Frequency of appropriate/inappropriate ICD therapy - % Atrial and Ventricular Pacing - Antiarrhythmic drug utilization - Study related complications 2.3.1 Response to CRT 1. A positive response to CRT is defined by the following: Improvement in NYHA functional class by at least one grade 2. Improvement in echocardiographic LVEF &amp; left ventricular end diastolic index (LVEDI) 3. Improvement in patient global clinical assessment 4. Improvement in 6-minute hall walk by 10%</detailed_description>
