	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with metastatic germ cell tumors that have relapsed or not responded to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors That Have Relapsed or Not Responded to Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of sunitinib malate in patients with refractory or relapsed metastatic germ cell tumors. Secondary - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to tumor response and duration of tumor response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a open-label study. Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 28 days and then periodically thereafter.</detailed_description>
