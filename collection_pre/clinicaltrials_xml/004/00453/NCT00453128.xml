	<brief_title>Diagnostic Rentability of Screening for Associated Conditions in Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnostic usefulness of screening for hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism and hypophosphatasia in patients diagnosed with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition disease is uncertain. Patients diagnosed with CPPD deposition disease were compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis over a 9-year period. All patients were prospectively followed for at least 12 months. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, thyroid-stimulating hormone, ferritin, iron, and total iron binding capacity were determined in all patients.</detailed_description>
