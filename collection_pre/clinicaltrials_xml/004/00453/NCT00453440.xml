	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine the prevalence of a genetic marker, HLA-B5701, in the UK population. HLA-B*5701 has been strongly associated with the risk of an allergic reaction to a HIV medicine, Abacavir. The allergic reaction is known as a hypersensitivity reaction. The study is a prospective study inviting HIV-1 positive patients over the age of 18 years to participate. Each participant will complete one study visit. They will be asked for details of their background including their age, sex, ethnicity, country of origin and parental country of origin. They will be asked to give two samples to test for the presence of the genetic marker HLA-B*5701. The two samples are: - A cheek swab - A blood sample In selected centres patients may be asked to provide up to two additional blood samples. These samples will be used to help develop and validate new methods of determining HLA-B*5701 testing.</brief_summary>
