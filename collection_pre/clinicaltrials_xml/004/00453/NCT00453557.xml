	<brief_title>Mechanism of Growth Hormone Effects on Adipose Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth hormone (GH) replacement in GH deficient adults results in an improvement in metabolic status, an increase in lean body mass and a reduction in visceral adiposity. GH might also decrease visceral adiposity in obese adults that are not GH deficient. The objective of the study is to determine the effects of GH on the metabolic syndrome and visceral adiposity in men with low blood levels of IGF-1 and the durability of these effects after stopping GH therapy. We will use a double blind, placebo controlled 6 month intervention trial followed by a blinded follow-up period of 6 months. Thirty non-diabetic middle aged men with central adiposity (BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2, waist circumference &gt; 102 cm) will participate.</detailed_description>
