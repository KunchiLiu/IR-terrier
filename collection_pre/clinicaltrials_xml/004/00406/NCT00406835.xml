	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Trial Between WBRT Plus SRS Versus SRS Alone for 1-4 Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT) had been a mainstay in the treatment of brain metastases. However, treatment strategy which rely on Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) has becoming popular in Japan. It is not well understood if the Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT) combined with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) resulted in improvements in survival, brain tumor control, functional preservation rate, and frequency of neurologic death. In orer to determine the role of WBRT, we conducted prospective randomized trial between WBRT+SRS and SRS-alone for 1-4 brain metastatic patients.</detailed_description>
