	<brief_summary>Artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) are currently recommended for malaria treatment. Artemether-lumefantrine(A-L) and Artesunate+amodiaquine (A+A) have been the most commonly adopted of the recommended ACT regimens. In Ghana, A+A is the current first-line antimalarial treatment in Ghana, but there has been 1 efficacy report of this regimen in Ghana till date. Moreover, the safety of repeated treatments with ACT has been little studied. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of A+A vs. A-L, as well as the safety of repeated treatments of these regimens in a longitudinal trial in which recruited children will be followed up for 1 year.</brief_summary>
