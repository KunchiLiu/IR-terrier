	<brief_summary>Choroidal neovascularization is a leading cause of visual loss in people older than 60 years and for its treatment there had been performed multicentric studies with Lucentis (Ranibizumab) with a significant improval of visual acuity. In our institution we evaluated efficacy of bevacizumab in several pathologies but we dont know what would be the results if we use the same dose several times. Our purpose was to determine the efficacy of bevacizumab for improve or stabilize visual acuity with two or more intravitreal inyections of bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
