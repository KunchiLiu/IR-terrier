	<brief_summary>The study is designed as a phase III, randomized, open label, multicenter, prospective, comparative trial of sirolimus and tacrolimus versus tacrolimus and methotrexate as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, related, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in individuals with hematologic cancer. Participants will be stratified by transplant center and will be randomly assigned to the sirolimus/tacrolimus or tacrolimus/methotrexate arms at a 1:1 ratio.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus/Tacrolimus Versus Tacrolimus/Methotrexate for Preventing Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) (BMT CTN 0402)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Stem cell transplantation is a standard therapy for acute and chronic leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders. A common problem that may occur after a stem cell transplant is a condition known as GVHD. The purpose of this study is to compare two combinations of medications to see which is better at preventing GVHD. The combinations of medications in this study are: - Sirolimus and tacrolimus - Methotrexate and tacrolimus Doctors want to know if one combination is better than the other or if they both have the same result. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Participants will receive one of the two conditioning regimens described in the protocol, at the discretion of the transplant physician. The transplant physician must choose among these regimens prior to the participant's assignment to the GVHD prophylaxis treatment. Conditioning regimens will vary by center, but will be the same for all participants at each center. Stem cell donors will donate peripheral blood stem cells according to local institutional practices. Peripheral blood stem cells will not be manipulated or T-depleted prior to administration. Standard post-transplant care will be administered. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two GVHD prophylaxis regimens and will be followed for the endpoints of interest. Participants will be followed for 114 days post-randomization for evaluation of the primary endpoint, with additional follow-up for 2 years after transplantation for evaluation of secondary endpoints.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>6/6 HLAmatched sibling, defined by Class I (HLAA and B) serologic typing (or higher resolution) and Class II (HLADRBI) molecular typing, who is willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells, and meets institutional criteria for stem cell donation. The donor must be medically eligible to donate stem cells, according to individual transplant center criteria. Pediatric patients for whom a pediatric sibling donor is not anticipated to be a suitable leukapheresis candidate are not eligible.

Cancer treated with curative intent for more than 5 years previously will be allowed. Cancer treated with curative intent for less than 5 years previously will not be allowed unless approved by the protocol officer or protocol chair.</criteria>
