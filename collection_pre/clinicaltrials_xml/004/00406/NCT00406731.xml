	<brief_summary>Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure. The existence of an effective autoregulation in the optic nerve circulation has been shown in animals and humans. The exact mechanism behind this autoregulation is still unknown. The motive for the investigation of optic nerve head (ONH) blood flow autoregulation is to enhance the understanding of pathologic eye conditions associated with ocular vascular disorders. To clarify the regulatory mechanisms of ONH microcirculation is of critical importance to understand the pathophysiology of glaucoma because there is evidence that glaucoma is associated with optic nerve head ischemia. Several studies indicate that a disturbed autoregulation might contribute to glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Previous findings suggest endothelial dysfunction in glaucomatous optic neuropathy, in particular alterations in endothelin- and nitric oxide- system, which both play an important role in local regulation of vascular tone. In the present study, changes in ocular perfusion pressure will be performed during administration of drugs, which may potentially alter the pressure-flow relationship. These drugs include endothelin-1 and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA).</brief_summary>
