	<brief_summary>The RAVE (Rubeosis Anit-VEgf) trial, utilizes monthly intravitreal Ranibizumab (Lucentis) injections for 9 months to see if total VEGF blockade will prevent neovascular glaucoma and eliminate the need for panretinal photocoagulation in patients with ischemic central retinal vein occlusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rubeosis Anti-VEGF (RAVE) Trial for Ischemic Central Retinal Vein Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The most devastating complication of ischemic CRVO is the development of anterior segment neovascularization and the resulting morbidity from neovascular glaucoma. This complication appears to be directly correlated with intraocular VEGF levels. Currently there is no proven treatment to decrease the formation of rubeosis. Current management of the disease consists of pan-retinal photocoagulation once significant anterior segment neovascularization becomes manifest. This treatment destroys peripheral retina (with peripheral retinal field) and presumably works by eventually lowering ocular VEGF levels which causes secondary regression of rubeosis. As ranibizumab blocks VEGF, this treatment when delivered intraocularly may prevent neo-vascular glaucoma while preserving peripheral visual fields in this patient population. Risks of intravitreal injections are well known and include endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. This risk should be less than 1% with proper injection technique and experienced retinal surgeons. As the incidence of neovascular glaucoma (with resultant loss of central and peripheral visual fields) is approximately 50% in ischemic CRVO, the small risk of intravitreal injection is warranted if the drug shows efficacy. In a small number of subjects in previous animal and human trials, intraocular pressure was acutely elevated when the drug volume was placed intravitreally. An eye with a compromised circulation (such as ischemic CRVO) may experience less perfusion if this occurred. Previous intravitreal studies of ranibizumab have not utilized anterior chamber paracentesis to compensate for the volume of intravitreal drug to be placed. This was reasonable because an eye with a normal retinal circulation can tolerate relatively high intraocular pressure for a limited time. This protocol for this study will include anterior chamber paracentesis prior to intravitreal injection to minimize this potential risk.</detailed_description>
