	<brief_summary>The impact of continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) on sepsis-induced multiple organ failure severity is controversial. We thus sought to assess the effect of early application of haemofiltration on the degree of organ dysfunction and plasma cytokine levels in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Continuous Venovenous Haemofiltration on Organ Failure During the Early Phase of Severe Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>prospective, randomized, open, multicentre study was performed between 1997 and 1999 in 16 French intensive care units. Patients were enrolled within 24 hours of development of the first organ failure related to a new septic insult. They were randomized to group 1 (HF), who received haemofiltration for a 96 hr period, or group 2 (C) who were managed conventionally. The primary end-point was the number, severity and duration of organ failures at 14 days, as evaluated by the SOFA score, on an intention-to-treat analysis. Strict guidelines were provided to perform continuous haemofiltration under the same conditions and objectives in all centres.</detailed_description>
