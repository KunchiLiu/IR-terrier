	<detailed_description>OculusGen® Collagen Matrix is a porous, scaffold matrix. It is to be implanted on the top of the scleral flap and beneath the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule at the end of trabeculectomy. The pores in the scaffold matrix range from 20 to 200µm, a size that is suitable for fibroblasts to grow randomly, through the body of the matrix without causing scarring. The space occupied by the collagen matrix scaffold creates room for the development of a filtration bleb. Immediately after implantation, the collagen matrix is absorbed with the aqueous humor that bring a certain pressure press on the top of scleral flap which makes the dynamic balance for the aqueous system to keep the IOP in the right side. The collagen matrix is bio-degraded within 90 days and will leave a physiologic space for the filtration bleb to facilitate control of intraocular pressure (IOP).</detailed_description>
