	<brief_summary>Progression of nuclear sclerotic cataract after pars plana vitrectomy has been recognized for many years The mechanism for the rapid progression of nuclear sclerotic cataract remains unclear. The objective of this trial is to evaluate and compare the level and progression of cataract advancement in controls versus eyes that have undergone 20-gauge pars plana vitrectomy and 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Scheimpflug Photos of the Crystalline Lens in Patients Who Have Undergone Vitrectomy Surgery and Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 105 patients will be recruited to obtain 35 control eyes that have not had pars plana vitrectomy and 35 eyes who will have undergone 20-gauge pars plana vitrectomy and 35 eyes will have undergone 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy. Scheimpflug crystalline lens photographs will be taken for evaluation of level and progression of cataract development.</detailed_description>
