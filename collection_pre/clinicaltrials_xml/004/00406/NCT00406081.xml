	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis (AD) causes people to be susceptible to skin infection and inflammations. The purpose of this study is to determine the immune response to chicken pox vaccine in children with or without AD who received the vaccine 2 to 16 weeks prior to the study visit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response to Varicella Vaccination in Children With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent viral skin infections. Children with AD given the smallpox vaccine could develop a life-threatening condition known as eczema vaccinatum. This immune response is not currently understood. The purpose of this study is to understand the immune response to a viral vaccine in children with AD. This will be accomplished by studying immune response to the chicken pox vaccine in children with AD in comparison to those without AD. This study will consist of one study visit occurring about 2 to 16 weeks after the child received the chicken pox vaccination. During this visit, physical and skin exams will occur. Personal and family medical histories and blood collection will also occur. The chicken pox vaccine will not be given as a part of this study. Subjects will receive the results of radioallergosorbent (RAST) testing that will tell if they are allergic to some common items (e.g., mold, grass).</detailed_description>
