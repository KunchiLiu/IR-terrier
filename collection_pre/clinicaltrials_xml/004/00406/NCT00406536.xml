	<brief_summary>The purpose of this phase II research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the next generation LYM-X-SORB™ in improving the essential fatty acid (EFA) and choline status for children and adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency (PI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of LYM-X-SORB™ to Improve Fatty Acid and Choline Status in Children With CF and PI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fat malabsorption is common in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency (PI). This places them at risk for caloric, essential fatty acid, and choline deficiency, which may in turn, lead to growth failure and a poorer clinical course. The purpose of this research study is to find whether or not taking LYM-X-SORB™ over an 18-month period, every day, will correct the problem people with CF and PI have with absorbing fat and choline. Participation will help CF doctors and other healthcare professionals learn more about the potential benefits of LYM-X-SORB™ to children and adolescents with CF and PI. These benefits may include better absorption of fat, better choline status, better growth in height, weight, muscle and bone, better lungs, and improvement of health status. The study will enroll a total of 78 participants from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and from several other Cystic Fibrosis Centers. One half of the participants will be randomly picked to receive the active powder with the LYM-X-SORB™ supplement and one half will receive a placebo (with no active supplement).</detailed_description>
