	<brief_summary>Octreotide is a somatostatin analog with a long half-life in vivo. Octreotide has interesting anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties in vitro and in vivo. Somatostatin receptors are increased and Octreotide uptake is increased in the lung in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our hypothesis is that octreotide may slow the degradation of lung function in patients with IPF. In this proof of concept study, patients with IPF will receive an intramuscular injection of slow release octreotide (Sandostatin LP, 30 mg)every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Lung function (FVC, DLCO), HRCT scores for fibrosis and ground glass, 6 minute walking test,quality of life and survival will be monitored.</brief_summary>
