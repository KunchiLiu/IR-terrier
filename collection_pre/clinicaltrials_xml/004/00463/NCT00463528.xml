	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the extent of schistosomasis infections in women and children, their daily activites that encumber contact with water and their knowledge and attitudes towards the prevention of schistosomiasis. The hypothesis that will be explored is that women and children spent more time with agricultural and household activities which bring them in contact with water and therefore give them an increased risk of being infected by schistosoma. Prevention and control of schistosomiasis has to be focusing on women and children.</brief_summary>
