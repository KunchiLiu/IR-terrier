	<brief_summary>Aim of this study is to define a CT-based "tissue window" for stroke thrombolysis. Our primary hypothesis is that 1. patients with a "tissue window" (favourable non-contrast CT (NCCT) scan and an intracranial occlusion on CT angiography (CTA) or perfusion-CT-mismatch" (area of reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) &gt; area of reduced cerebral blood volume (CBV)) represent a significant proportion (&gt; 20%)of acute stroke patients and therefore are an important target group for future interventional studies 2. patients with a "tissue window" suffer an unfavourable outcome (&gt; 50 % mRS =&gt;4 at 3 months)if the occluded artery was not recanalized.</brief_summary>
