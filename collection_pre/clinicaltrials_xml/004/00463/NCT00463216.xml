	<detailed_description>Workers on sick leave due to back, neck or shoulder pain are randomized into 2 groups. Individuals in the intervention group are offered an extra multidisciplinary diagnostic evaluation. The multidisciplinary team consists of an occupational physician, a physiotherapist, a chiropractor, a psychologist and a social worker. The result is a coordinated evaluation of the individuals problems with suggestions as to further actions. The focus is on evaluating, if and when the individual can return to work. No treatment is given. Verbatim exemption from the local medical ethics board: "February 19, 2004 Journal no. VF 20040030 JK/csf Re: research project: A Coordinated Return to Work Program (KIA) The The Medical Ethics Committee of Vejle and Funen Counties has reviewed this research project at its meeting on February 9, 2004. The entire committee decided that this project is an HTA (Health Technology Assessment) study and not a biomedical research project. Therefore the committee decided that the project is not within the committee's legal competence areas, and is exempt from approval by a medical ethics committee before being carried out. The committee has no further comments to this case. on behalf of the committee Sincerely Erik Laier Jette Krarup __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Odense University Hospital direct telephone: +45 6541 3425 Kl√∏vervaenget 10, 2.sal e-mail: Vejle-fynkomiteen@ouh.fyns-amt.dk 5000 Odense C fax: +45 6619 4392 Denmark"</detailed_description>
