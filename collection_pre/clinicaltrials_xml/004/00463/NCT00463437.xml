	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety in terms of fever (rectal temperature) higher than 39 degree Celcius (Â°C) and the immunogenicity in terms of antibody response following a booster vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine GSK1024850A at 11 to 18 months of age in children previously primed with the same vaccines including a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine co-administered with a diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTPa)-combined and meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) or combined meningococcal serogroup C and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib-MenC) vaccine. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00334334).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 1118 months of age at the time of the booster vaccination. A male or female who previously participated in study 107005 and received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period (active phase and extended safety followup), in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within one month preceding the booster dose of study vaccines, or planned use during the entire study period Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to the booster dose of study vaccines. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol, during the period starting one month before the booster dose of study vaccines and up to the followup visit (one month after the booster dose of study vaccines). Administration of any pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, MenC and/or HibMenC vaccines other than the study vaccines from study 107005. History of, or intercurrent, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, meningococcal serogroup C disease. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. History of seizures (this criterion does not apply to subjects who have had a single, uncomplicated febrile convulsion in the past) or progressive neurological disease. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within three months preceding the booster dose of study vaccines or planned administration during the active phase of the study (starting with the administration of the booster dose of study vaccines up to the followup visit one month after).</criteria>
