	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether overall response to cetuximab combined with cisplatin is better than overall response to cisplatin alone together with showing that the overall response for cetuximab and cisplatin was above a pre-specified threshold of 0.2 in the treatment of "triple negative" metastatic breast cancer. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the differences between the two treatment groups using the following criteria : Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time, Overall Survival (OS), Time to Response (TTR) and Safety.</brief_summary>
