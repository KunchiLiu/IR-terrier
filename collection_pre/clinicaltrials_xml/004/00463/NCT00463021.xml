The central laboratory assessment must be within the following ranges: serum iPTH between 150600 pg/mL, inclusive; corrected calcium &lt; 10.0 mg/dL; phosphorus &lt; 7.0 mg/dL. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject currently has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled hypertension, active vasculitis, HIV infection, or any other clinically significant, unstable medical condition. Abnormal liver function as measured by ALT/AST greater than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The subject currently has malabsorption, severe chronic diarrhea, or ileostomy.
