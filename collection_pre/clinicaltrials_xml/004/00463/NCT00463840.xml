	<brief_title>Chemoradiation With Oxaliplatin and Fluorouracil (5FU) for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have demonstrated that neoadjuvant chemoradiation can lead to improved survival with a portion of patients proceeding to resection. This trial will incorporate a similar trial structure using newer agents in patients who present with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. Specifically oxaliplatin will be used owing to its greater activity in comparison to cisplatin and favorable therapeutic index in combination with radiation compared to gemcitabine. In summary, the primary outcome measure of the phase I portion of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of this combination. Following the determination of this dose, the phase II portion of the trial will characterize the toxicity of this regimen as well as evaluate for long-term efficacy.</detailed_description>
