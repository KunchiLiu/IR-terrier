	<brief_summary>Acetylcystein is a potent antioxidans which is able to prevent contrast dye induced nephropathy in stable patients undergoing additional hydration. In primary percutaneous intervention for infarction hydration is not possible. Therefore Acetylcystein might prevent contrast dye induced nephropathy. Furthermore, it might reduce infarct size as a result of its antioxidant properties. Clinical trials are missing so far examining the effects of Acetylcystein on nephropathy and infarct size.</brief_summary>
