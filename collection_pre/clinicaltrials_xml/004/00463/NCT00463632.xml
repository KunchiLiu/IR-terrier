	<brief_title>Schistosomiasis in Women of Reproductive Age in Burkina Faso: Implications for Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of schistosomiasis and anaemia among pregnant and non-pregnant women in Burkina Faso and explore the implications for the national schistosomiasis control programme and future studies. Specific objectives are: - to determine the prevalence and intensity of schistosome infection in pregnant women attending for antenatal care and in non-pregnant women of reproductive age in an area which is hyperendemic for S.haematobium infection and in which there is little or no S.mansoni infection - to determine the prevalence and intensity of schistosome infection in pregnant women attending for antenatal care and in non-pregnant women of reproductive age in an area in which S.mansoni infection is common - to determine Haemoglobin concentration in pregnant women attending for antenatal care and in non-pregnant women of reproductive age in the regions described above - to investigate the association between infection and haemoglobin concentration in pregnant and non-pregnant women - to determine the prevalence of other parasitic infections in pregnant women and non-pregnant women including hookworms, ascaris, trichuris and malaria - to demonstrate the research team's ability to follow-up pregnant women recruited at antenatal care clinics onto the postpartum period</detailed_description>
