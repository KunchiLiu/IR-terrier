	<brief_summary>Japanese encephalitis virus is the leading cause of viral neurological disease and disability in Asia. The severity of sequelae, together with the volume of cases, make JE the most important cause of viral encephalitis in the world. Approximately 3 billion people—including 700 million children—live in areas at risk in Asia for JE. JE most commonly infects children between the ages of 1 and 15 years, and can also infect adults in areas where the virus is newly introduced. More than 50,000 cases are reported annually and cause an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 deaths. This figure is believed to represent only a small proportion of the disease burden that actually exists. Data from a previous trial, also sponsored by PATH and conducted by investigators in the Philippines, indicate that there was no immunologic interference between Japanese encephalitis live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine and measles vaccine when administered at the same time. Additionally, the safety profile of the coadministered vaccines was the same as for the vaccines administered separately. This research study, to be conducted among infants in Sri Lanka, is being done to confirm the Philippines trial results.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy child 9 months (±2 weeks) of age at the enrollment visit. Subject was a fullterm infant. Subject's parent or legal guardian is literate and willing to provide written informed consent. Subject is uptodate for all vaccinations recommended in the Sri Lankan childhood immunization schedule. Enrolled in another clinical trial involving any therapy. Subject and/or parent(s) or guardian(s) are unable to attend the scheduled visits or comply with the study procedures. Received any nonstudy vaccine within 2 weeks prior to enrolment or refusal to postpone receipt of such vaccines until 28 days after study entry. Prior or anticipated receipt of immune globulin or other blood products, or injected or oral corticosteroids or other immune modulator therapy except routine vaccines within 6 weeks of administration of study vaccine. Individuals on a tapering dose schedule of oral steroids lasting &lt;7 days may be included in the trial as long as they have not received more than one course within the last 2 weeks prior to enrolment. History of documented or suspected encephalitis, encephalopathy, or meningitis. History of measles. History of Japanese encephalitis. Serious adverse event related (i.e., possible, probably, definite) to previous receipt of any JE vaccine, if applicable. Persistent inconsolable crying (&gt;3 hours) observed after previous receipt of any JE vaccine, if applicable. Hypotonic hyporesponsiveness after past receipt of any JE vaccine, if applicable. Suspected or known hypersensitivity to any of the investigational or marketed vaccine components. History of serious chronic disease (cardiac, renal, neurologic, metabolic, or rheumatologic). Underlying medical condition such as inborn errors of metabolism, failure to thrive, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or any major congenital abnormalities requiring surgery or chronic treatment. History of thrombocytopenic purpura. History of seizures, including history of febrile seizures, or any other neurologic disorder. Known or suspected immunologic function impairment of any kind and/or known HIV infection. Parent with known or suspected immunologic function impairment of any kind and/or known HIV infection. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to the participant or interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.</criteria>
