	<brief_summary>Background: Patients following allogeneic keratoplasty are treated with topical and frequently with systemic steroids to prevent immune reactions. Steroids are known to yield good results, but exert a wide range of side effects. The efficacy of topial FK506 in preventing immune reactions has already been demonstrated experimentally. FK506, an IL-2-inhibitor like Cyclosporin A (CSA), is known to be approximately 100 fold more potent than CSA. Aim of the study: In this study the efficacy and safety of topical FK506 will be compared to our standard treatment (i.e. steroids) after penetrating normal-risk keratoplasty.</brief_summary>
