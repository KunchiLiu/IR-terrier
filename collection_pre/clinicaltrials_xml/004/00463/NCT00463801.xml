	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Subjects with a diagnosis of complicated skin and skinstructure infections (cSSTI) defined as infection normally requiring surgical/local debridement of sufficient severity to warrant hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial treatment Infection to be due to Grampositive bacteria Hospitalized subjects Written informed consent Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test urine or serum at baseline and must use effective contraception throughout the study period. Exclusion criteria: Complicated skin and skinstructure infections of the following categories: Infected burns Severely impaired arterial blood supply Decubitus ulcers Infected diabetic foot ulcers associated with osteomyelitis Infected human or animal bites Perirectal abscess Necrotising fasciitis or gangrene Infections expected to require more than 14 days of intravenous antimicrobial therapy Skin and/or skin structure infection that can be treated by surgery alone Infections associated with a permanent prosthetic device that will not be removed within 2 days of study enrollment Uncomplicated skin or soft tissue infection Documented bacteremia at baseline Concomitant infection nearby the site of infection at baseline, potentially interfering with the evaluations Hospitalization for conditions related to rhabdomyolysis Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with cluster of differentiation (CD) &lt; 200 or &lt; 14% Immune function alterations Lack of sufficient purulent material for culture and Gram test Systemic or local antibiotic administration with known antiGram positive activity in the preceding 48 hours Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) known or believed to be related to fungal, parasitic or viral infection Pneumonia Local or systemic known or suspected allergy to daptomycin Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min Severe liver damage (ChildPugh class C) or Alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 3 x Upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN Use of any experimental drugs in the preceding 30 days Severe medical conditions that in the investigator's opinion could counter indicate participation in the study</criteria>
