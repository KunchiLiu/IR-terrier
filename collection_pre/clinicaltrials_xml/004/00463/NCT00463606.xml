	<brief_title>A Multicenter Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of ABT-335 and Rosuvastatin Calcium Combination Therapy to Monotherapy in Subjects With Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are 3 treatment groups in the study: ABT-335 135 mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg, ABT-335 135 mg monotherapy, and rosuvastatin 5 mg monotherapy. The 3 primary outcome measures only compare 2 of the treatment groups for each variable (mean percent change in HDL-C and TG comparing ABT-335 135 mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg to rosuvastatin 5 mg monotherapy, and mean percent change in LDL-C comparing ABT-335 135 mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg to ABT-335 135 mg monotherapy. The 6 secondary outcome measures only compare 2 of the treatment groups for each variable (mean percent change in Non-HDL-C comparing ABT-335 135 mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg to ABT-335 135 mg monotherapy, mean percent change in Non-HDL-C, VLDL-C, ApoB, and Total Cholesterol comparing ABT-335 135 mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg to rosuvastatin 5 mg monotherapy, and median percent change in hsCRP comparing ABT-335 135 mg in combination with rosuvastatin 5 mg to rosuvastatin 5 mg monotherapy).</detailed_description>
