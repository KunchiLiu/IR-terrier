	<brief_summary>Irinotecan has demonstrated activity in malignant gliomas in multiple phase II studies. The activity is limited, with an approximately 15 % response rate and a progression-free survival of 3-5 months. Given the synergy between irinotecan and bevacizumab in colorectal cancer, and the high-level expression of vascular endothelial growth factor on malignant gliomas, one would expect synergy between bevacizumab and irinotecan against gliomas. In addition, 40-50 % of GBM have EGFR amplification/mutation making the EGFR an additional target. By combing cetuximab, with irinotecan and bevacizumab, one would expect further response, than irinotecan and bevacizumab alone. In addition, recurrent gliomas have an extremely poor prognosis, so innovative therapies are needed.</brief_summary>
