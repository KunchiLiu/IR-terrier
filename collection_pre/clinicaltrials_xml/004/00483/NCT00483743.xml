	<brief_summary>This study will assess and compare the safety and tolerability of inhaled TPI 1020 (repeated nominal doses; 500 μg BID x 6 weeks) versus inhaled budesonide (repeated doses; 800 μg BID x 6 weeks) and a matching placebo. Pharmacodynamic (PD) activity on FEV1, sputum and blood cells and cytokines will also be studied.</brief_summary>
