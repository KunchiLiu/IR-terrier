	<brief_summary>Commercially available external photoprotectors (EP) do not provide adequate protection against ultraviolet A (UVA) and visible wavelengths. The proposed medicinal product V0096 CR (formula RV3131A-MV1166) is a broad spectrum EP (bsEP). The rationale for the use of V0096 CR (formula RV3131A-MV1166) in the proposed condition is based on its ability to broadly block the UVA radiations and visible light that are known to trigger solar urticaria (SU).</brief_summary>
