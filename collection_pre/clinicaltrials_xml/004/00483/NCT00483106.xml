	<brief_summary>Attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a very common behavioral problem during childhood. It is estimated that up to 80% of this disorder could be related to genetic factors. The most common treatment for ADHD is psychostimulants. In this study, the researchers investigate the effect of genetic variants in increasing the risk for behaviours pertinent to ADHD or in modulating the response of these behaviours to methylphenidate. Response to methylphenidate is evaluated through a double blind placebo controlled one week study.</brief_summary>
