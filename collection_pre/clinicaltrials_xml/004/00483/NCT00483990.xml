	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of repeated application of PSD502 to the glans penis in healthy male volunteers</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of PSD502 (Lidocaine Prilocaine Spray) Applied to the Glans Penis up to Three Times a Day for 21 Days in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I, double-blind, stratified, parallel group, placebo-controlled repeat dose study in a minimum of 8 circumcised and 8 uncircumcised healthy male volunteers. Subjects will attend 2 study visits, of which 1 will be a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and the other, a consecutive 21-day treatment visit (Visit 2; Days 1-21) which commences no more than 14 days after the Screening visit. Subjects will reside in the phase I unit throughout the treatment period. The duration of each subject's participation in the study will be up to 5 weeks. Subjects are stratified based on whether they are circumcised or uncircumcised and within each stratified group subjects are randomized to PSD502 (lidocaine prilocaine spray) or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Procedures during the 21 day treatment period include: visual examination of the glans penis, blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic analysis of lidocaine and prilocaine, swabbing of the glans penis for residual PSD502, vital signs and 12-lead ECG, adverse event enquiries and collection of concomitant medications. Subjects are discharged from the clinic on Day 21 following a safety evaluation.</detailed_description>

Safety testing abnormalities at the Screening Visit, in particular liver function tests, that are indicative of a medical condition and that would preclude further participation, in the opinion of the Investigator.
