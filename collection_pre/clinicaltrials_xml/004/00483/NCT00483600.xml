	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Fondaparinux in Outpatients With Renal Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the PK of fondaparinux in patients who have renal insufficiency. Fondaparinux is cleared from the body mainly by the kidneys. Therefore in patients with kidney diseases, full doses of fondaparinux could cause bleeding problems. The correct dose of fondaparinux that should be used in patients with kidney disease is not known. The purpose of this research is to determine the PK and safety of a preventative dose (2.5mg subcutaneously every other day) of fondaparinux for patients with kidney disease.</detailed_description>
