	<brief_title>VentrAssistTM LVAD as a Bridge to Cardiac Transplantation - Pivotal Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LVADs are efficacious in improving survival and functional status when used as a bridge to transplantation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the VentrAssist LVAD in providing circulatory support in individuals who are awaiting heart transplants. The VentrAssist LVAD is a centrifugal flow pump. Its small size and mechanical simplicity offers benefits not available with currently approved LVADs, including facilitating a more limited implantation procedure, which could reduce surgical morbidity and mortality.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(The following are general criteria; more specific criteria are included in the study protocol): Approved and listed for cardiac transplantation. Patient for whom LVAD implantation is planned as a clinically indicated bridge to cardiac transplantation. (The following are general criteria; more specific criteria are included in the study protocol): Presence of heart conditions that would contraindicate LVAD implantation by adversely affecting patient survival or LVAD function. Primary coagulopathy or platelet disorder; contraindication to anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents. Presence of any mechanical circulatory support other than intraaortic balloon pump. Therapy with an investigational intervention at the time of screening.</criteria>
