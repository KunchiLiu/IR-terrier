	<brief_summary>This is a study to assess the safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment of thoracoabdominal (TAAA) and paravisceral abdominal (PVAAA) aortic aneurysms. The investigational operation involves placing a stent-graft over the aortic aneurysm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endovascular Exclusion of Thoracoabdominal and/or Paravisceral Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A TAAA or PVAAA is an abnormal enlargement of the aorta, the main artery in the chest and abdomen. The standard operation for TAAA of PVAAA is performed through a long incision extending down the side of the chest and the front of the abdomen. In the standard operation, the weak area of the aorta is replaced with a fabric sleeve (graft). The investigational operation is done making small incisions in both groins and the right arm and placing a graft in the aorta through tubes that are inserted through the femoral and brachial arteries, than fastening it in position with metal springs(stents). The combination of a stent and a graft is known as a stent-graft. Compared with standard operation, the potential advantages of endovascular TAAA/PVAAA repair include less pain, less disturbance of intestinal function, a lower risk of pulmonary or cardiac complications and shorter hospital stay. The main disadvantage of endovascular TAAA/PVAAA is an unknown success rate.</detailed_description>
