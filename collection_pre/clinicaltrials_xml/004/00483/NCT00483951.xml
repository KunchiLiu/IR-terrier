	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate volunteers 18 years of age and older to see if they qualify for one of NHLBI s research studies. Tests include the following: - General medical evaluation, which may include blood tests, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (heart ultrasound). - Other tests as appropriate, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cardiac computed tomography (CT scan of the heart), nuclear stress test and echocardiography stress test. - X-ray contrast studies of the heart and blood vessels. (These may be excluded in patients with kidney risk factors.)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Disease Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a screening protocol. This protocol allows two functions: 1) the protocol allows physicians in the Suburban/NHLBI Cardiovascular Imaging program to evaluate patients referred to the program with clinically indicated studies and research studies. 2) It is also designed to determine if patients may be suitable candidates for one of our NHLBI research protocols. Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age referred for possible cardiovascular disease will be enrolled in the protocol for a period of one year. At one year, patients will either be: 1) transferred to one of our specific research MRI or CT protocols, 2) removed from the screening protocol and made inactive, or 3) re-enrolled on the screening protocol with the patient s consent.</detailed_description>
