	<brief_title>One Year Glargine Treatment in CFRD Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effect of glargine treatment on BMI, lung function, acute pulmonary infections and HbA1c in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with different glucose derangements, eighty-seven patients were screened for glucose derangements with fasting hyperglycaemia or abnormalities at the oral glucose tolerance test. They were classified on the basis of a “gluco-score” ranging 0-5. Patients with gluco-score &gt; 1 were treated with glargine. We report on the results of the first 20 patients who completed 12 months of treatment. BMI z-score, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), number of acute lung infections in the previous year and HbA1c were the study outcomes.</detailed_description>
