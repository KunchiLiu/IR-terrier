	<brief_title>Telephone Follow-Up on Outcome After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study examines the effect of scheduled telephone calls on the outcome after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) or concussion. These calls offer subjects information, focused counseling, and referrals. MTBI is extremely common in the United States, numbering well over a million cases per year. Although recovery for most is quite good, 10-20% of persons have persisting symptoms that affect employment, quality of life, and health care expenses. We are examining one means to decrease persisting symptoms by offering early, consistent intervention before symptoms become persistent. The subjects are enrolled in the emergency departments (ED) of the hospital and receive the baseline assessment while still in the ED. Subjects are randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 standard care and Group 2 standard care, toll-free telephone number, and scheduled telephone calls for follow-up at 1-2 days, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after injury. All subjects are contacted again at 6 months for an outcome assessment that is done over the telephone. On the telephone, subjects are asked about current problems, and are given both information about recovery from MTBI and some counseling on dealing with symptoms or other complaints. They are also given community resources to obtain assistance if needed. Telephone call are reviewed by supervisors (physician and psychologist) for adherence to protocol and for training purposes.</detailed_description>
