	<brief_summary>A new immunosuppressive drug, based on the inhibition of an important enzyme in the immune system called JAK3, is being developed by Pfizer to prevent transplant rejection. In this research study, a JAK3 inhibitor or cyclosporine will be given to new kidney transplant patients for 12 months. Patients will be assigned to one of three treatment groups after receiving a kidney transplant. Two of the treatment groups will receive 2 different dosing regimens of the JAK3 inhibitor that will be taken by mouth. The third treatment group will be a standard-of-care control arm. Patients will continue to take the assigned study medication for 12 months as well as other standard transplant medications such as prednisone.</brief_summary>
