	<brief_summary>The main objective of the trial is to document the safety of the combination (escalation doses of NGR-hTNF, from 0.2 mcg/sqm to 1.6 mcg/sqm , with a fixed dose of cisplatin, 80 mg/sqm). Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC ).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of NGR-hTNF in Combination With Cisplatin in Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase IB, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study that will be conducted in sequential cohorts of patients. Three patients per each cohort are planned.
