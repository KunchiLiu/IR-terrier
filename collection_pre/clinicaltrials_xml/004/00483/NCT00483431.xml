	<brief_summary>Earlier studies have shown that high vitamin K-intake leads to improved bone and vascular health by increased carboxylation of Gla-proteins in these tissues. From all K-vitamins, menaquinone-7 (MK-7) has been identified as the most effective cofactor for the carboxylation reaction of Gla-proteins such as osteocalcin and matrix-gla protein. The question remains which dosage of MK-7 leads to optimal carboxylation levels of these proteins. The primary objective of this double-blind randomized intervention study is to establish the optimal dose of MK-7 for carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent proteins osteocalcin in bone and matrix-gla protein in the vessel wall. The optimal dose will be the concentration at which osteocalcin and matrix-gla protein are &gt; 90% in the active (=carboxylated) form.</brief_summary>
