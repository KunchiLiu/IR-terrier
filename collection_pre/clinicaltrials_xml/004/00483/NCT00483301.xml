	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial OF Carboplatin, ABI-007 (Abraxane) And Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this phase II multicenter trial is to: Measure the response rate (RR) of this combination and schedule in patients with metastatic melanoma The secondary objectives are to: Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in this patient population Determine the 1-year and median PFS of patients treated according to protocol Determine overall survival (OS) STUDY DESIGN This will be a Phase II study single arm study with a two-stage design with a maximum sample size of 43 patients, 18 in the first stage and 25 in the second stage. Study duration: A minimum yearly accrual of 10-15 patients/institution is expected. Therefore, to reach the first stage, the study will take 1.2 to 1.8 years with one institution, 0.6 to 0.9 years with 2 institutions, and 0.4 to 0.6 years with 3. If the study continues to full accrual to 43 patients, completion will take 2.9 to 4.3 years with one institution, 1.4 to 2.2 years with two and 0.96 to 1.43 years with three institutions.</detailed_description>

Men and women should use adequate birth control for at least three months after the last administration of protocol drugs. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of treatment. Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent document.

Patients must not have unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new onset angina (began within the last 3 months) or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management. No known severe hypersensitivity or suspected allergy to sorafenib, ABI007 or any of the excipients Patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a CT scan/MRI of the brain to exclude progressing brain metastasis.

Thrombotic or embolic events such as a cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks within the past 6 months. Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE Grade 2 within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Any other hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first study drug.
