	<brief_summary>This study will compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with pegylated-interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in participants with non-genotype 2/3 CHC who, after 12 weeks of study treatment, have undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV)-ribonucleic acid (RNA) or a greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 log10 drop in HCV-RNA. Participants will be randomized to receive pegylated-interferon alfa-2a 180 micrograms subcutaneously weekly plus ribavirin (1000-1400 milligram [mg]) orally daily for the specified duration, followed by 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. Participants with detectable HCV-RNA and less than (&lt;) 2 log10 drop in HCV-RNA at week 12 will discontinue therapy.</brief_summary>
