	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, tolerability and immune response of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) compared with 23-valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (23vPS). Although the study started with only 1 population, amendments to the original protocol will now reflect three participant populations. Three age cohorts will be enrolled. The first cohort (age 60-64) will be blinded. Cohort 2 (age 50-59) and cohort 3 (age 18-49) are open label. Subjects in cohorts 1 and 2 will receive 2 vaccinations 3-4 years apart. Subjects in cohort 3 will receive 1 vaccination. All participants should be na√Øve of 23vPS. Comparisons of immune responses from the different cohorts will be done.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>First Cohort: Healthy Male and female adults 60 to 64 years of age at time of enrollment. Second Cohort: Healthy Male and female adults 50 to 59 years of age at time of enrollment. Third Cohort: Healthy Male and female adults 18 to 49 years of age at time of enrollment. Previous immunization with any licensed or experimental pneumococcal vaccine. Serious chronic disorders including metastatic malignancy, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring supplemental oxygen, end stage renal disease with or without dialysis, clinically unstable cardiac disease, or any other disorder which in the investigator's opinion precludes the subject from participating in the study. Known or suspected impairment of immunological function.</criteria>
