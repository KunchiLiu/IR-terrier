	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of a home program of exercises for the hip muscles which support the pelvis on walking patterns and hip muscle strength in people with knee osteoarthritis. Following a hip muscle strengthening program, we hypothesize that participants with knee osteoarthritis will demonstrate decreased loading at the knee joint during walking and greater strength of the hip muscles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence of Hip Strengthening Exercises on Walking Patterns and Muscle Strength in Persons With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis is a common age-related impairment that may progress to cause significant pain and physical disability. Excessive loading at the knee joint is believed to contribute to the progression of knee osteoarthritis. The hip joint and surrounding muscles have been shown to influence the amount of stress occurring at the knee joint during walking. In particular, the hip abductor muscles may have an effect on the knee joint by controlling the position of the pelvis and/or by acting as lateral stabilizers for the knee. Research suggests that the function of the hip muscles during walking may be decreased in people with knee osteoarthritis and that greater loads may be placed on the knee joint as a result. Thus, interventions aimed at strengthening the hip abductor muscles may be effective for reducing stress on the arthritic knee and slowing the rate of progression of knee osteoarthritis. The design of the study is a two-group pretest-posttest design using an untreated control group. Thirty-five individuals with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis will be recruited through newspaper advertisements and from the practices of orthopedic surgeons in Kingston, Ontario. Each participant with knee osteoarthritis will be matched with an asymptomatic volunteer for age (+/- 5 years), height (+/- 5 cm), mass (+/- 5 kg) and gender. Participants in the control group will have no clinical or radiographic diagnosis of knee or hip osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and no history of hip or knee trauma or pain.</detailed_description>
