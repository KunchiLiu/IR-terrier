	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to asses the relative influence of genetic and environmental influence on the tortuosity of retinal arterioles in eyes of 218 healthy Danish twins aged 20-46 years. We expect to find a high heredity for the variation in tortuosity. This knowledge can contribute to the elucidation of the pathology in retinal diseases.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All persons underwent an ophthalmic examination including refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy and digital fundus photography. Two independent graders (both with an MD degree) made a visual grading of the severity of tortuosity of the retinal arterioles in the fundus images.</detailed_description>
