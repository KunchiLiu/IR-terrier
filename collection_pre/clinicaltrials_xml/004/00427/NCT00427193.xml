	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that two years of sustained 25% caloric restriction (CR) in men age 21-50 (inclusive) and women age 21-47 (inclusive) will slow aging and protect against age-related disease processes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CALERIE: Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim of CALERIE Phase 2 is to test the hypothesis that two years of sustained caloric restriction (CR), involving a reduction in energy intake to 75% of baseline (25% CR), in healthy, non-obese men aged 21-50 (inclusive) and women aged 21-47 (inclusive), will result in the same adaptive changes that were observed in a wide variety of animal studies. Particular emphasis is on the adaptive responses thought to be involved in slowing the aging process and protecting against age-related disease processes. Primary outcomes include core body temperature and resting metabolic rate. Secondary outcomes include risk factors for cardiovascular disease, inflammatory markers, immune function, psychological and physical function; oxidative changes in lipids, proteins, and DNA; and, risk factors for age-related conditions such as diabetes and body composition. An important secondary aim is to identify potential adverse effects of CR in humans. The study will be conducted as a multi-center, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial (RCT). A sample of 200 participants will be enrolled, and assigned to either the CR intervention or a control group. Control participants will be advised to simply continue their current diets. Participants in both treatment arms will be followed over a period of 24 months. A comprehensive set of evaluations will be performed prior to initiating the intervention, with follow-up evaluations at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months afterwards.</detailed_description>
