	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Measuring how often hot flashes occur in postmenopausal women may be done by using a skin conduction device or by using a diary. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying a skin conduction device and a patient diary for measuring hot flashes in postmenopausal women with hot flashes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skin Conduction Device and Patient Diary for Measuring Hot Flashes in Postmenopausal Women With Hot Flashes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the differences in frequency, severity, and duration of hot flash activity using an ambulatory sternal skin conductance recording tool and patient hot flash diary in postmenopausal women with hot flashes. - Assess the recordings made by an ambulatory sternal skin conductance measuring and recording tool during a 30-minute exercise period in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients wear an ambulatory sternal skin conductance hot flash device continuously for 24 hours. Patients complete hot flash diaries over 24 hours. Patients undergo treadmill exercise over 30 minutes and record hot flash activity using the skin conductance device during 10 minutes of sweating. Patients also complete the Comfort, Bother, and Weight Questionnaire at the completion of the study. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
