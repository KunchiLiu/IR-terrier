	<brief_summary>This study has 2 phases, a vaccination phase and a long-term follow-up phase. In the vaccination phase of this study, the new meningococcal vaccine 134612 will be evaluated in children using Mencevax™ ACWY (in children above 2 years) or Meningitec™ (in children below 2 years) as controls. In the long-term follow-up phase of the study, the long-term protection offered by the vaccines will be assessed up to 5 years after vaccination. Subjects will be randomized in the primary vaccination phase of the study; no new subjects will be enrolled during the long-term follow-up phase of the study.</brief_summary>
