	<brief_summary>The study objective was to determine if liver injury develops in alcoholic patients during or following 5 days of therapeutic acetaminophen dosing. Volunteers were recruited from two community detoxification centers to take either acetaminophen (4g/day) or placebo for 5 consecutive days. All subjects were monitored an additional two days following the dosing period. The primary measures were aminotransferase measures taken at baseline and Days 2, 4, 6 and 7. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in aminotransferase means between the groups at any study period.</brief_summary>
