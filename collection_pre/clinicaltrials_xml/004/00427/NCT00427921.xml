	<brief_title>Human Anti-TNF Monoclonal Antibody Adalimumab in Canadian Subjects With Moderate to Severe Crohn's Disease (ACCESS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, Early Access Study with an induction regimen of adalimumab 160 mg subcutaneous (SC) at Baseline and 80 mg SC at Week 2, followed by maintenance dosing of 40 mg every other week (eow) starting at Week 4 in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease (CD) who were eligible to receive biologic therapy or who had failed to respond to, lost response to, or were intolerant to infliximab.
