	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Optimal Tolerated Regime and Safety of PEP005 Topical Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actinic keratoses (AK) is a common skin condition characterized by rough, scaly patches or sores on the top layer of the skin which if left untreated can progress to skin cancer. Current treatments can cause scarring and hypopigmentation, be inconvenient, or require long treatment duration. Non-invasive alternative therapy for treatment of AK lesions is thus being researched.</detailed_description>
