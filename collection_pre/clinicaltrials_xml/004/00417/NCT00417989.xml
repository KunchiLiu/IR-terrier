	<brief_summary>Primary Outcomes: Average decrease in A1c from baseline to end of Study Phase (52 weeks) for subjects in the "722 Group" is greater than that for subjects in the "Control (MDI) Group". Secondary Outcomes: Incidence and frequency of severe hypoglycemia; Measure of glycemic variability, Area Under the Curve (AUC); Quality of Life; and Health Economic Outcomes (MRU)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Compare Efficacy of the MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System Vs. MDI in Subjects Naive to Insulin Pump Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glycemic control remains a significant challenge for adult, adolescent and pediatric Type 1 diabetics. The current first line standard of care continues to be MDI therapy utilizing a long acting analog insulin. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGMS) is currently used by clinicians to record continuous, retrospective glucose measurements, which aid in identification of glycemic excursion patterns. This data is then used to make future therapy change recommendations. The MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System transmits real-time glucose measurements to the insulin pump every 5 minutes, allowing users to view their current glucose values, as well as to review glycemic excursions and trends over a 24-hour period. Additionally, data can be downloaded from the monitor to a personal computer, using appropriate software, so that the patient and physician can see a complete picture of glucose trends over time. The System will also alert users of high and low glucose levels, and allow subjects and their clinicians to treat to a therapeutic target HbA1c under carefully monitored conditions. Subjects wearing the MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System will be compared to subjects that continue on their current MDI therapy, that includes a long acting analog insulin, over a 12 month period to evaluate changes in glycemic control (HbA1c).</detailed_description>

Subjects who are taking antihypertensive medication will not be excluded provided they are maintained at a stable dose for 3 months prior to screening Has serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions (e.g., eating disorders, clinical depression, anxiety disorder) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the study Is undergoing renal dialysis, including hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) Has evidence of any allergic dermatological condition (e.g., severe adhesive sensitivity) Has recurrent episodes of skin infections or history of staphylococcus infection carrier state Has potential for lack of compliance or any other issue that may preclude the subject from satisfactory participation in the study, based on Investigatory judgment</criteria>
