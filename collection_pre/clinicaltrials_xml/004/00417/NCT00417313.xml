	<brief_title>Osteopuncture for Osteoarthritis-Associated Knee Pain &amp; Disability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is painful in 6.8% of men and 11.4% of women age 63-93, with over 20 million Americans affected nationwide, and may lead to a variety of untoward consequences including limitations in physical function, postural instability, sleep disturbance, psychosocial disability, and substantial utilization of health care resources. While oral analgesics represent the mainstay of treatment for chronic pain associated with knee OA, non-responders with limiting comorbidities may have few therapeutic alternatives. The aims of this research study are to (1) reduce pain severity and disability in community-dwelling older adults with OA-associated chronic knee pain using periosteal electroacupuncture (osteopuncture), and (2) improve the physical performance, psychosocial function, sleep, and appetite of these individuals. 88 older adults with persistent knee pain and x-ray evidence of OA, no other rheumatologic disorders, no history of knee surgery, and no prominent pain in sites other than the knee(s) will be randomized to receive either osteopuncture or control osteopuncture once a week for 6 weeks. All outcome measures for pain and disability, as well as physical performance, psychosocial function, sleep, and appetite, will be collected pre-treatment, at the completion of the 6-week protocol, and 3 months later.</detailed_description>
