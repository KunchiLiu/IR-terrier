	<brief_title>A Study Combining Treatment With Temsirolimus and Sunitinib for Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of temsirolimus and sunitinib in subjects with advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) (dose escalation phase). Once the MTD is determined, this study will also evaluate the efficacy of this combination by determining progression free survivial (PFS) at 12 months in subjects with advanced RCC (expanded cohort phase).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Dose Escalation Phase 1. Histologically confirmed advanced RCC. 2. Up to 2 prior systemic regimens for RCC. 3. Subject must have at least 1 measurable lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension with the longest diameter ³10 mm when measured by spiral computed CT (5mm slice thickness contiguous) or ³20 mm when measured by conventional CT (10mm slice thickness contiguous) (lesion must be ³ 2 times the size of the slice thickness per RECIST). More criteria apply Exclusion Criteria for Dose Escalation Phase 1. Subjects with known active central nervous system (CNS) malignancy (primary or metastatic). 2. Prior therapy with sirolimus, temsirolimus or sunitinib. 3. Subjects receiving known strong Cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 isoenzyme inhibitors and/or inducers. Subjects receiving other CYP3A4 isoenzyme inhibitors and/or inducers not classified as strong inhibitors or inducers are eligible, provided they have been on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks before screening. More criteria apply Inclusion Criteria for Expanded Cohort Phase 1. Subjects with histologically confirmed advanced RCC regardless of nephrectomy status who have received no prior systemic therapies for their disease. 2. Subjects with histologically confirmed advanced RCC regardless of nephrectomy status who have a least 4 weeks since prior treatment with palliative radiation therapy, and/or surgery and resolution of all toxic effects of prior therapy to NCI CTCAE (version 3.0) grade £1. 3. Subjects must have at least 1 measurable lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension with the longest diameter ³10 mm when measured by spiral CT (5mm slice thickness contiguous) or ³20 mm when measured by conventional CT (10mm slice thickness contiguous) (lesion must be ³2 times the size of the slice thickness per RECIST). More Criteria apply Exclusion Criteria for the Expanded Cohort Phase 1. Subjects with a history of a CNS malignancy or metastatic disease to the CNS and subjects with a known, active CNS malignancy (primary or metastatic). 2. Prior antivascular endothelial growth factor (antiVEGF) therapies (with either monoclonal antibodies and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKIs]) and/or mTOR inhibitors. 3. Subjects receiving known strong CYP3A4 isoenzyme inhibitors and/or inducers. Subjects taking other CYP3A4 isoenzyme inhibitors and/or inducers not classified as strong inhibitors or inducers are eligible, provided they have been on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks before screening.
