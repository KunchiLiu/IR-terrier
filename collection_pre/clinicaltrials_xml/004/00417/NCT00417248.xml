	<brief_title>Cisplatin/Etoposide/Radiotherapy Followed by Consolidation Sorafenib for Inoperable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outline: This is a multi-center study. Chemotherapy/radiation therapy (2 cycles) - Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 8 of 28 day cycle - Etoposide 50 mg/m2 IV days 1-5 of 28 day cycle - Concurrent chest radiation (planned dose is 5940 cGy with an additional, optional boost of 1080 cGy to a total allowed dose of 7020 cGy) with the following: Maintenance therapy of Sorafenib 400 mg PO BID of 28 day cycle, to begin a minimum of 6 and maximum of 9 weeks from completion of chemo-radiotherapy until PD, intolerable toxicity, or up to 1 year. Patients with progressive disease will discontinue treatment. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 mm3 - Platelet count ≥ 100,000 mm3 - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL - PT or INR &lt; 1.5 x ULN unless on anti-coagulant therapy - PTT &lt; 1.5 x ULN unless on anti-coagulant therapy Hepatic: - Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN - ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement) - AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement) Renal: - Creatinine &lt; 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) Cardiovascular: - No significant history of cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure &gt; class II NYHA. - Patients must not have unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new onset angina (began within 90 days prior to registration for initial therapy) or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to registration for initial therapy. Respiratory: - FEV1 ≥ 1 liter by spirometry within 60 days prior to registration for initial therapy.</detailed_description>

No history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to registration for initial therapy. No use inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome p450 system CYP3A4 enzyme or other medications such as aprepitant, ketoconazole, itraconazole, quinidine, digoxin, cyclosporine, ritonavir, grapefruit products, St. John's Wort, rifampin (rifampicin), carbamazepine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, and phenobarbital. No evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. No serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. No known or suspected allergy to sorafenib. No uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg, despite optimal medical management. No thrombolic or embolic events such as a cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks within 6 months prior to registration for initial therapy.
