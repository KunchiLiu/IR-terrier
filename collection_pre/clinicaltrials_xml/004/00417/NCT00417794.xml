	<brief_title>Assess the Effectiveness of Atomoxetine in Children With Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and ADD/ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abnormalities of attention, function, and activity level in children exposed to alcohol in utero share similarities and differences to children who do not have alcohol exposure. Previous psychological studies have examined either core attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity or hypothesized neuropsychological differences in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and ADHD. Atomoxetine Hydrochloride is a non-stimulant medication used to treat ADHD. This study will determine if atomoxetine HCL significantly reduces symptoms of ADD/ADHD in children with fetal alcohol exposure.</detailed_description>
