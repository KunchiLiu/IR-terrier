	<brief_summary>This study will quantify the intraocular pressure elevation in the immediate time period following intravitreous injection. With more widespread use of intravitreous injections in patients that may require several injections per year, it is important to document the sudden increase in intraocular pressure, including the maximum intraocular pressure and the time required for the intraocular pressure to return to baseline. This data may be useful in stimulating additional studies to evaluate the long term ocular effects of repeated intravitreous injections. We hypothesize that the intraocular pressure increases significantly following intravitreous injection and then returns to baseline during the initial thirty minutes following ranibizumab injection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraocular Pressure Immediately Following Intravitreous Injection of Ranibizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will assess the trend of intraocular pressure immediately following intravitreal injection of ranibizumab 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) by taking serial intraocular pressure readings every five minutes for thirty minutes after injection. This study is a prospective descriptive data collection consisting of measuring intraocular pressure immediately following intraocular injection, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes following injection of ranibizumab 0.5 mg.</detailed_description>
