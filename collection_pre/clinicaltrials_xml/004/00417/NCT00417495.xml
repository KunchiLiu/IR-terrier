	<brief_title>Sentinel Lymph Node Technique in Multifocal Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sentinel lymph node is located preferentially by: - association of subareolar injection of technecium and blue dye - or, in case of blue dye allergy, by the subareolar injection of technecium only - or, in case of no possibility of radioactive isotope subareolar injection , by blue dye injection only This procedures are made the day before the surgery or the day of the surgery - This procedure is immediately follows by complete axillary dissection during breast surgery - The anatomopathologic analysis of the 2 samples (sentinel lymph node and axillary dissection) and the histologic confirmation on the removed tumor of the multifocal nature of the breast cancer correspond to the end of the study for the patient.</detailed_description>
