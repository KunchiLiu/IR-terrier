	<brief_summary>COPD patients requiring ventilation may benefit from invasive or non invasive ventilation. Non invasive ventilation is often incompatible with oral or enteral feding, due to gastric dilatation and full mask therapy. At the other hand, invasive ventilation is associated with incomplete enteral feeding and nutrition requirements are not reached. The aim of the study was to compare the feeding delivery of COPD patients receiving invasive or non invasive mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
