	<brief_summary>Cluster headache is characterized by unilateral excruciating head pain and autonomic dysfunction. Hypothalamic overactivity was observed in nitrate-induced cluster-headache and in only one case of spontaneous cluster headache 'Sprenger et al, 2004). This prompted the application of hypothalamic deep brain stimulation. The aim of this data is to precise the localisation of the hypothalamic activation.</brief_summary>
