	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well cediranib maleate works in treating patients with recurrent or newly diagnosed metastatic head and neck cancer. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of head and neck cancer by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective clinical response in patients with recurrent or newly diagnosed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with AZD2171 (cediranib maleate). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. II. Assess the early and late physiological and biological effects of this drug on tumor interstitial fluid pressure, pO2, and tumor microvasculature. III. Assess the value of potential noninvasive biomarkers of response, including plasma levels of molecules involved in angiogenesis, circulating endothelial cells and progenitor cells, and functional imaging changes before and after treatment. IV. Assess the gene expression patterns before and after treatment as predictors of clinical and biological response. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral cediranib maleate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced CT imaging and blood collection periodically during study for research studies assessing plasma levels of angiogenic/antiangiogenic molecules, circulating endothelial cells (by flow cytometry), progenitor cells, and protein analysis of potential biomarkers.</detailed_description>
