	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as talotrexin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of talotrexin in treating young patients with recurrent solid tumors or leukemia that is recurrent or does not respond to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Talotrexin in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumors or Leukemia That is Recurrent or Does Not Respond to Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of talotrexin in younger patients with recurrent solid tumors or recurrent or refractory leukemia. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients. - Assess the tolerability of the defined MTD of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (solid tumor vs leukemia). - Stratum 1 (recurrent solid tumor): Patients receive talotrexin IV over 10 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of talotrexin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). - Stratum 2 (recurrent or refractory leukemia): A cohort of 3-6 patients with leukemia receive treatment as in stratum 1 at the MTD determined in stratum 1. If 2 or 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT at the solid tumor MTD, accrual is stopped. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
