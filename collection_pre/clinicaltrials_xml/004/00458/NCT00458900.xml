	<brief_summary>In the Intensive Care (IC)-unit moxifloxacin treatment is often started with intravenous administrations. As moxifloxacin is known to have a high oral bioavailability in healthy volunteers, patients are switched to oral or enteral therapy as soon as possible. However, no data on plasma levels for moxifloxacin during such a switch-therapy in IC-patients are available. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the moxifloxacin-plasma levels and their inter-individual variability during IV to enteral switch therapy in IC-patients.</brief_summary>
