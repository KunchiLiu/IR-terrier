	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary safety and immunogenicity (ability of an antigen to provoke immune response in the human body) of CNTO 2476, administered subretinally, in participants with advanced retinitis pigmentosa (RP; disease of the eye that leads to loss of vision and blindness) with either light perception only (LP) or hand motion (HM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety of CNTO 2476 in Patients With Advanced Retinitis Pigmentosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), first in human safety study. Nine adult men and women with advanced RP with LP only (first 5 participants) or not better than HM bilaterally (subsequent 4 participants) in both eyes will be enrolled. Participant 5 may have combination visual acuity of LP in the treated eye and no better than HM in the fellow eye. Treatment will proceed on a cohort basis ie, Cohort I: Participant 1; Cohort II: Participant 2; Cohort III: Participant 3 and 4; Cohort IV: Participant 5, 6, and 7; and Cohort V: Participant 8 and 9. The initial participants for each cohort must have completed at least 4 weeks of post-treatment follow-up before participants in the next cohort may be treated. There are 2 safety assessment phases in this study: the main phase approximately 12 months from the time the participant is eligible to enter the study and the long-term safety follow-up phase of 4 additional years. The total length of the participation in the study could last up to 5 years (including both the main and safety follow-up phases).</detailed_description>
