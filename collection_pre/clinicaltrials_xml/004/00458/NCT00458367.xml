	<brief_title>RiSPECT: Risperdal Safety Protocol Evaluation Consta Treatment, a Post Authorization Safety Survey to Obtain Information on the Safety and Efficacy of Risperidone When Used in Routine Clinical Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This post-authorisation safety survey (PASS) is an international, multicentre, naturalistic, descriptive survey to confirm safety of risperidone in daily practice. This is a single-arm, prospective, observational survey to compare the safety profile between groups defined by existing risk or disease factors or patient characteristics. The study duration is 6 months with 4 patient visits. The primary objective of this PASS is to confirm safety, as identified in phase III clinical trials of risperidone, by collecting data when the drug is used under marketed conditions in routine clinical practice. A secondary objective is to evaluate effectiveness and reasons for initiating risperidone. Each investigator is to document data for 4-10 treated patients for whom risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) treatment is determined to be clinically indicated. Risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) is given as intramuscular injections every 2 weeks. The starting dose of RLAI will be in accordance with the product label (usually 25 mg). If necessary, the dosage of the injection may be increased gradually. Treatment duration is 26 weeks. To ensure continued antipsychotic coverage until the main release of risperidone from the microspheres, previous antipsychotic therapy will be continued concomitantly during the first three weeks of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients treated with longacting injectable risperidone as decided after agreement between the physician and the patient, in accordance with the local Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), are eligible for inclusion in this survey. According to the global SmPC, longacting injectable risperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder According to the SmPC, longacting injectable risperidone is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the product or any of its components. These patients must be excluded from the survey</criteria>
