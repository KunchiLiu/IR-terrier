	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New ways to find out about hearing loss after treatment with chemotherapy may improve the ability to plan cancer treatment and may help patients live more comfortably. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is assessing ear damage in young cancer patients treated with cisplatin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Ear Damage in Young Cancer Patients Treated With Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the optimal criteria for determination of ototoxicity in younger cancer patients treated with cisplatin. - Determine the feasibility of including ultrahigh frequency and evoked otoacoustic emission testing as adjunctive measures of ototoxicity. - Determine the feasibility and necessity of central review of audiometry data. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, prospective, cohort study. Patients undergo hearing tests (conventional, otoscopy, ultrahigh frequency, and otoacoustic emission testing) before the first course of planned cisplatin, before each subsequent course of cisplatin, and 4 weeks after the last dose of cisplatin. Patients who are scheduled to receive hematopoietic progenitor stem cell transplantation undergo hearing tests before the transplantation and 4 weeks after transplantation. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 282 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
