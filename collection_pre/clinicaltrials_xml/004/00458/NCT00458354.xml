	<brief_title>Use of Spinal Sealant System During Spinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CSF provides a liquid cushion for the brain and spinal cord. The dura holds in the CSF. In order to do spinal surgery, the doctor will cut an opening in the dura. At the end of surgery, the dura must be sealed in order to keep the CSF from leaking out. The doctor will close the dura with stitches and also a piece of tissue taken from another place on your body, to help close the opening. Other standard sealant methods have included the use of Oxicel, Gelfoam, or fibrin glue, but these methods were not designed for closing the dura. Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called "screening tests." These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. Your doctor will see you within 30 days before your operation. At this visit, your medical history will be recorded, and you will be asked questions about any other operations you have had in the past. You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate), height, and weight. You will have a sample of your blood (about 2 tablespoons) collected for kidney and liver function tests to make sure they are functioning properly. You will also be asked to fill out 2 questionnaires about your health, daily activities, and back pain. The questionnaires will take about 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of 2 treatment groups. Participants in one group will receive the Spinal Sealant. You have a 2 out of 3 chance of being randomly assigned to the spinal sealant group. Participants in the other group will receive other standard methods such as the closing of the dura with stitches. However, you will not know which one of the two treatments you receive. Also, (if needed) a piece of your muscle, fat, or other soft tissue may be taken from another place on your body to help seal the opening. Doctors may also use Oxicel, Gelfoam, or fibrin glue to help with the sealing of the dura . After your already scheduled spinal surgery, your doctor will try to close the opening in the dura, which may be done with stitches alone or, if needed, stitches and a piece of your muscle, fat, or other soft tissue taken from another place on your body. After this try, if there is still some CSF leaking from the dura, you will be assigned to one of the 2 groups for treatment. If you do not have a CSF leak that needs treatment, you will not be able to take part in this study, and you will not have to come back for any study visits. Participants assigned to the first group will receive treatment with the Spinal Sealant, which will be sprayed over their stitches to close the opening in their dura. The Spinal Sealant is made of 2 plastic-type liquids. When mixed together, a gel is formed that is mostly made up of water. The gel looks and feels sort of like a soft contact lens. After the doctor tries to seal the opening in the dura, the Spinal Sealant is then sprayed over the stitches. It acts like a thin, stretchy covering to help stop the CSF from leaking out through the stitches until the area has properly healed on its own. It is blue-colored, so that the doctor can see where it has been sprayed. Within 1 to 2 months, the gel is naturally broken down by the body and is removed through the urine. Participants assigned to the second group will be treated with the doctor's choice of other standard treatments to close the opening in their dura. You will not know which group you were assigned to until after the end of your study participation (about 90 days). While you are still in the hospital (within 7 days after your operation), you will have a physical exam, and your doctor will do a clinical test to check for any CSF leaks. Also, you will have a sample of your blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn for kidney and liver function tests. For follow-up, you will be seen by your doctor at about 30 days and again at about 90 days after your operation. It will be very important for you to return to see your doctor at your scheduled follow-up visits, even if you are feeling fine. At the follow-up visits, your doctor will perform a physical exam and check to see how your dura wound is healing and if there is any CSF leakage. You will have a sample of your blood (about 2 tablespoons) collected for kidney and liver function tests. You will also be asked to fill out 2 questionnaires about your health, daily activities, and back pain. The questionnaires will take about 20 to 30 minutes to finish. Your participation in this study will be over after your 90-day follow-up visit. THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY. The Spinal Sealant has been authorized by the FDA for use in research only. About 158 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Between 15 to 20 participants will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
