	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To assess the effect on microalbuminuria levels of treatment with rimonabant 20 mg versus a placebo during a 12 month period. Secondary objectives: - Percentage of patients in both arms of the study whose levels of microalbuminuria decrease, stabilise, increase towards macroalbuminuria or are unchanged after 12 months of treatment with rimonabant or placebo. - To assess the effect of treatment with rimonabant 20 mg versus placebo over a 12 month period on: - Weight and waist circumference. - Glycaemia profile: fasting glycaemia, fasting insulinaemia and HbA1c. - Lipid and lipoprotein profile: triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, apolipoproteins A1 and B. - Inflammatory markers - Adipocytokines. - Blood pressure. - Glomerular filtration rate. - To assess the quality of life by means of questionnaire filled in. - Safety parameters</brief_summary>
