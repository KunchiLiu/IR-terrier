	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. A peripheral stem cell transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. When the healthy stem cells are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Giving combination chemotherapy together with imatinib mesylate and peripheral stem cell transplant may be an effective treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nevertheless, in the last few years GIMEMA has pubblished a paper in which 100% of Ph+ ALL patients reach HCR only with Imatinib, without any chemiotherapy. Thus, this treatment will be implemented in patients pertaining to this category.</brief_summary>
