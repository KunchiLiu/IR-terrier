	<brief_summary>It has been estimated that 80% of deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysms results from rupture. Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) has been applied to RAAA (Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm) patients with reports of improvements. Despite the use of EVAR, patients have developed complications with lung and kidney function. This study will investigate certain biochemical processes that will potentially reduce these complications. Knowledge gained from this study may also be used to further research in this field through larger studies.</brief_summary>
