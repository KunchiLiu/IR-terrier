	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to evaluate the presence, location and intensity of FDG uptake in the large arteries using the new technology of fused PET/CT imaging and to compare FDG uptake with the presence of arterial calcifications as seen on the simultaneously acquired CT, in order to determine if FDG was increases incalcified plaque or in a different location in the arterial wall. we will also evaluate the relationship between FDG localization and future cardiovascular events in out patient population</brief_summary>
