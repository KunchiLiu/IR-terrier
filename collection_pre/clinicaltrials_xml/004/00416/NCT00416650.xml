	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the major objective response rate (partial response and complete response) in patients with advanced bronchoalveolar cell non-small cell lung cancer treated with erlotinib hydrochloride. Secondary - Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the duration of response and time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the median survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
