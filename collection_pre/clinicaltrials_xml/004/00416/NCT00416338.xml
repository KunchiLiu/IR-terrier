	<brief_summary>Peritoneal dialysis accounts for more than 70% of the dialysis modality in Hong Kong. Exit site infection (ESI) is one of the causes leading to peritoneal catheter removal. Appropriate exit-site care can prevent ESI. As the presence of a causative organism is essential in ESI, eliminating organism invasion may be useful in preventing ESI. In the present study, an exit site care method aiming at preventing organism invasion is developed to investigate its effectiveness in reducing ESI. It is also hoped the present study can help to develop an exit site care method that can reduce the frequency of exit site dressing so as to reduce the burden of patients and to improve their quality of life. Weâ€™ll recruit one hundred new chronic peritoneal dialysis patients into the study. The patients will be divided into two groups. One group of the patients will use film-dressing method (F) and the other group will use simple gauze dressing method (G). F group patients will have the exit site covered with a dressing film and keep it intact for 7 days after having the exit site cleaned with antiseptic solution. G group patients will clean the exit site with antiseptic solution and change the simple gauze dressing daily. The outcomes of the two groups will be compared. The outcome will be expressed in terms of exit site infection free period, peritonitis free period and exit site condition classification. Patient subjective quality of life will also be compared at first and twelfth month.</brief_summary>
