	<brief_title>Nasally Delivered Pulmozyme for Sinusitis in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of Pulmozyme(dornase alfa) in decreasing post-operative sinusitis symptoms in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) PROCEDURES: 20 patients with CF will be randomized to receive either Pulmozyme or placebo via nasal inhalation daily for 12 months. Consent will be obtained following surgery and treatment will begin 1 week post-operatively. Monitoring will include examination and recording of adverse effects and follow up weekly for one month and then at 2.5, 6, 9 and 12 months. Outcome measures will include ciliary function testing, pulmonary function testing, sinus questionnaires and CT scan.</detailed_description>
