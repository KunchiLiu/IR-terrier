	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn how fluvastatin effects biomarkers related to breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how fluvastatin effects biomarkers in women undergoing surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ or stage I breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Fluvastatin on Biomarkers in Women Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ or Stage I Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine differences between measures of cell proliferation (Ki-67) in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or stage I breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant fluvastatin sodium. Secondary - Determine whether statin use differentially affects specific types of DCIS/early-stage breast cancer (comedo, estrogen receptor [ER]-positive, ER-negative). - Compare differences between tissue staining of CD68, circulating macrophages, and regulatory T cells in these patients. - Assess the feasibility of using inherent susceptibility (mRNA polymerase chain reaction testing) to predict response to statins in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, multicenter, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (arms I or II). Patients accrued as control participants are assigned to arm III. - Arm I: Patients receive oral fluvastatin sodium once daily for 3-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive oral fluvastatin sodium as in arm I at a higher dose. - Arm III (control): Patients do not receive fluvastatin sodium. All patients then undergo definitive surgery. Patients in arms I and II undergo blood collection at baseline and at the time of surgery for biomarker analysis. Patients in arm III undergo blood collection at baseline and then approximately 1 month later. Tissue is collected from patients in all arms at the time of surgery. Blood and tissue samples are examined for biological markers, including Ki-67, C-reactive protein, cleaved caspase 3, HER2, CD68 gene, and estrogen and progesterone receptors by immunohistochemistry. Markers of inflammation (e.g., comedo necrosis macrophages and CD25-positive T cells), low-density lipoprotein, and cholesterol are also analyzed. Serum mRNA is measured by polymerase chain reaction. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
