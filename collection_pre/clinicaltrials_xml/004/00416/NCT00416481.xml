PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying ways to assess older patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Older Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the feasibility of administration of the geriatric assessment in elderly patients with cancer. - Determine the percentage of patients able to complete the self-administered portion of the geriatric assessment without assistance. - Determine the length of time necessary to complete the geriatric assessment. - Determine the variance and number of missing items. - Assess patient satisfaction with the questionnaire by identifying items that are distressing or difficult to comprehend. - Assess the percentage of geriatric assessments that contain all three of the following items: Timed Up and Go Assessment, Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test, and healthcare professional-rated Karnofsky performance status. Secondary - Determine the proportion of patients who are able to complete the self-report portion of the questionnaire without assistance and the length of time needed to complete the geriatric assessment within patients of various sociodemographic factors and educational status. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (65 to 69 years vs 70 years and over). Patients undergo assessments of cognition using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test; functional status using the Timed Up and Go Assessment (measures physical mobility); and performance status using the healthcare professional-rated Karnofsky performance scale. These assessments are performed by healthcare personnel. Body mass index and the percentage of unintentional weight loss and the number of falls in the past 6 months are also assessed. Patients also complete the following self-administered questionnaires: Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (measures level of functioning and need for services); Activities of Daily Living (measures higher levels of physical functioning); Karnofsky Self-Reported Performance Rating Scale (related to survival and clinically significant illness); Physical Health Section of the Older American Resources and Services Questionnaire (measures comorbidity and the impact on daily activities); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Activity Limitations Measure (measures the impact of cancer on patients' social functioning); and MOS Social Support Survey Emotional/Information and Tangible Subscales (measures perceived availability of social support). Patients then begin planned treatment.</detailed_description>
