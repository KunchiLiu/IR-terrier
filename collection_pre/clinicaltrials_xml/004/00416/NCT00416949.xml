	<brief_title>Iodine I 131 in Treating Patients With Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the relationship between estimated absorbed dose of iodine I 131 and tumor response or normal organ toxicity for different dosimetric measures, using data derived from clinical radionuclide therapy studies in patients with thyroid cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dosimetric iodine I 131 (^131I) on day 2 and then undergo nuclear medicine imaging at 0.5-4 hours, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosimetric ^131I. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT scans are performed at 0.5-4 hours and 24 or 48 hours over the head and neck region, including the salivary glands. Subsequent SPECT/CT scans are performed over the candidate tumor sites. Patients undergo ^131I therapy on day 11. Saliva is collected on days 1 and 2, weeks 2 and 4, and months 3 and 6 to measure saliva flow rate. Blood is collected at baseline and periodically during study to measure FLT3 ligand levels. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
