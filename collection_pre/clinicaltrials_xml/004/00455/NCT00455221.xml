	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a peptide-gene vaccine against CML in patients under Imatinib treatment. We will also perform some laboratory tests suggesting biological response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Assessment of a Multipeptide-gene Vaccine in CML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients will continue to take their current dose of Imatinib. - Patients will undergo HLA-typing to define the HLA A, B, and DR. - One constant dose of ten bcr-abl peptides (100μg each) will be administered subcutaneously in all patients triweekly for 8 doses. - Four different doses of IL-12 and GM-CSF plasmids will be tested in this trial. The plasmids will be administered subcutaneously near the vaccination site 24 hours before vaccination. - The first three patients will receive the lower dose of both IL-12 and GM-CSF plasmids. If this is well tolerated, then the next three patients will receive the lower dose of IL-12 plasmid and higher dose of GM-CSF plasmid. If this is well tolerated, then the next three patients will receive the higher dose of IL-12 and lower dose of GM-CSF plasmids. If this is well tolerated, then the next three patients will receive the higher dose of both IL-12 and GM-CSF plasmids. Once assigned to a dose, the patient will receive the same dose throughout their participation in this trial. - Each vaccination may consist of one to several shots placed under the skin on the forearm, thigh or trunk area, and the sites will rotate per vaccination. - During the clinic visit for vaccinations, blood tests will be drawn. If, during the course of therapy, side effects develop that the doctor feels pose a threat to the patient, treatment will be stopped. - Patients will also undergo DTH skin tests before and after vaccination to see if an immune reaction is occurring at the injection site. - Patients' lymphocytes will be tested before and after vaccination regarding IFN-γ and IL-4 production to assess immune system activation. - During the course of treatment we will measure the effect the vaccine is having on the patients CML every three months by: 1. doing a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate analysis, and 2. measuring the amount of BCR-ABL that is detectable by RT-PCR in the patients' peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate.</detailed_description>
