	<brief_summary>The study will be conducted at up to 80 centers worldwide and will be a double-blind randomized parallel group placebo controlled study among subjects with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo tablets or one of 4 orally active doses of A-002. The duration of study drug therapy will be 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PLASMA Trial: A Dose-Response Study of A-002 In Subjects With Stable Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A-002 represents a novel therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). Through the inhibition of activity A-002 may provide multifunctional activity directed against key facets of the disease process, namely a) inflammation, b) atherogenic lipid profiles and c) the atherosclerotic process. Non-clinical and clinical data from recent studies have demonstrated the benefit of early and aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. Recent clinical studies have provided a strong association between levels and cardiovascular event risk. The proposed Phase 2 clinical pharmacology study (Study No. AN-CVD-2221) will examine the effects of 4 different doses of A-002 compared with placebo, on enzyme levels and activity after 8 weeks of treatment. In addition, the effect of treatment on inflammatory markers of cardiovascular risk (C-reactive protein [CRP]), lipid levels and lipoprotein subclasses and other soluble biomarkers (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, TNF, MCP-1 etc) will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
