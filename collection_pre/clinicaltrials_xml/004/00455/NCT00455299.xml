	<brief_summary>The study aims to prove differences or equalities in outcome for patients operated with laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with different methods of fixation of mesh and with or without approximation of defect prior to meshfixation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LVHR Multicenter Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to 4 groups: non-absorbable suture fixation and hernia approximation, double crown mesh fixation with titanium spiral tacks with hernia approximation and the same fixations without hernia approximation. Primary endpoint is recurrence. Secondary endpoints are operating time, adhesion score, mode of entering abdominal cavity, time to recovery, pain durance, seroma formation, aesthetic result (protrusion), organ traumatization infection. Endpoints are correlated to hernia size, body mass index, previous recurrence, age, concurrent illness. Patients are followed 3 years after operation with clinical examination. 300 patients are planned included in primary study. A subgroup of organ transplanted patients is evaluated in a separate study with identical criteria for inclusion.</detailed_description>
