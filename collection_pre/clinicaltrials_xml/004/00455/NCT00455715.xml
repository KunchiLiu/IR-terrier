	<brief_summary>The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, random-order, single-dose crossover trial of sildenafil 50 &amp; 100 mg added to stable antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia patients to assess whether this PDE5 inhibitor improves cognitive functioning (including verbal memory, fluency, attention, spatial memory, motor speed, and executive function) and clinical symptoms (psychotic, negative, mood symptoms, and self-reports of side-effects).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Placebo-Controlled Single-Dose Trial of Sildenafil in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: 1. Evaluate the effects of single doses of sildenafil 50 &amp; 100 mg compared to placebo on cognitive functioning, including verbal memory, fluency, attention, spatial memory, motor speed, and executive function. 2. Evaluate the effects of single doses of sildenafil 50 &amp; 100 mg compared to placebo on psychotic, negative, and mood symptoms. 3. Assess self-reports of side effects of sildenafil 50 &amp; 100 mg. Location and Subjects: 25 adult outpatients with schizophrenia will be recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital outpatient clinic or the Freedom Trail Clinic of the Lindemann Center.
