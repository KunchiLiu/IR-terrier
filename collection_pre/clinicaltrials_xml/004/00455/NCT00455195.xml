	<brief_summary>Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their normal function. The objective of this extension study is to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of alglucosidase alfa treatment in patients with Late-Onset Pompe Disease who were previously treated under the placebo-controlled, double-blind study AGLU02704 (NCT00158600).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must have completed protocol AGLU02704 (NCT00158600) Patient must provide signed, informed consent prior to performing any studyrelated procedures Patient (and patient's legal guardian if patient is under 18 years of age) must have the ability to comply with the clinical protocol A female patient of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Baseline. (note: all female patients of childbearing potential and sexually mature males must use a medically accepted method of contraception throughout the study.) The patient has a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude treatment with alglucosidase alfa.</criteria>
