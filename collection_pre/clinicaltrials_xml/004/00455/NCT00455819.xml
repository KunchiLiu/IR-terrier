	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the safety of treatment of pulmonary embolism in an outpatient setting based on normal pro-BNP levels. The mortality rate and the incidence of hemodynamic instability as well as major bleeding and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the outpatient group will be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home Treatment of Patients With Pulmonary Embolism Based on Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary embolism is a major health problem. Because of risk for early hemodynamic instability and mortality, all patients with a recently diagnosed pulmonary embolism are treated in hospital. The clinical course of most patients is without complications. In practice most of the patients are only waiting in hospital in a good, clinical stable condition until their INR range is stable. This prospective management study is to investigate the safety of treatment of pulmonary embolism in an outpatient setting based on normal pro-BNP levels (&lt; 500 pg/ml). The incidence of complications due to the pulmonary embolism or its treatment will be followed during the first ten days of treatment.</detailed_description>
