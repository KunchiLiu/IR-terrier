	<brief_title>Effects of Weekly Dosing of D-cycloserine on Cognitive Function in Individuals With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a ten-week, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial examining the cognitive effects at weeks 1, 2, 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 &amp; 10 of once-weekly oral D-cycloserine 50 mg added to a stable dose of antipsychotic for 8 weeks in 60 adult outpatients with schizophrenia. Specific aims: 1. Assess the effects of a single dose of D-cycloserine 50 mg on cognitive functioning compared to placebo. 2. Assess the effects of repeated weekly dosing of D-cycloserine on cognitive functioning at week 8 compared to placebo. 3. Assess the effects of repeated weekly dosing of D-cycloserine on memory functioning once a week 1 hour after medication administration compared to placebo. 4. Assess the persistence of learned information in a no-treatment follow-up assessment at Week 10 in the D-cycloserine group compared to the placebo group. 5. Assess effects of weekly D-cycloserine dosing on positive &amp; negative symptoms at week 8 compared to placebo. 6. Assess tolerability and side effects of weekly D-cycloserine compared to placebo. 7. Assess the effects of d-cycloserine dosed weekly for seven weeks on reward responsiveness as measured with the response bias task compared with placebo. 8. Assess the effects of d-cycloserine dosed weekly for seven weeks on measures of functioning.</detailed_description>
