	<brief_summary>We will obtain data using multi-slice CT technology to detect subclinical coronary disease in the HIV population. Determination of subclinical cardiovascular disease using noninvasive technology and elucidation of the associated risk factors will help to guide targeted therapy to prevent cardiovascular events in this patient population. We will investigate the prevalence of coronary plaque lesions and coronary artery calcifications in men and women with HIV disease as determined by 64-row multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and MDCT coronary angiography in comparison to age-matched control subjects without HIV infection. We hypothesize that evidence of coronary artery calcification and coronary plaque lesions as seen by MDCT will be present in individuals with HIV more than non-HIV control subjects of the same age. We also hypothesize the degree of atherosclerosis will be increased in HIV patients compared to control subjects. We will evaluate the metabolic and inflammatory factors associated with coronary artery disease in HIV-infected individuals. We hypothesize that traditional cardiac risk factors as well as metabolic and inflammatory changes associated with HIV and its treatment such as dyslipidemia, increased secretion of inflammatory markers, decreased adiponectin, increased insulin resistance and increased visceral fat may be associated with coronary artery disease in HIV-infected individuals.</brief_summary>
