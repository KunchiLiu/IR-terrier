	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if belatacept (BMS-224818) is expected to show acceptable rates of acute rejection (AR) in steroid-free belatacept-based immunosuppressive regiments compared to a similar steroid-free tacrolimus regimen. The long-term safety and tolerability of belatacept based regimens following long-term administration in subjects who have received a kidney transplant</brief_summary>
