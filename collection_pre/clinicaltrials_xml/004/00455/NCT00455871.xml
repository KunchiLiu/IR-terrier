	<brief_title>Study of Treatment Effects of Combination Therapy of Lucentis Plus Reduced Fluence PDT With Visudyne in Patients With Exudative AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will have two treatment groups. Each group will receive intravitreal injections (injection of medication in the jelly-like part of the back of the eye). One group (Group1) of approximately 15 patients will receive 0.5 mg of Lucentis™ followed by reduced fluence Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) with Visudyne ® 1-2 weeks later. The other group (Group 2) of approximately 15 patients will receive 0.5 mg of Lucentis™ followed by Photodynamic Therapy with Visudyne on the same day. patients will be assigned at random to receive one of the two treatments arms in the study. The dose received at the first injection will be the same dose received throughout the study.</detailed_description>
