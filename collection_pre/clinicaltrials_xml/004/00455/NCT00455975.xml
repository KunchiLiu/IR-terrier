	<brief_title>High-dose Bevacizumab in Advanced Renal Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bevacizumab is considered a targeted drug. Targeted drugs act on specific receptors on a cell. Bevacizumab blocks receptors that help cancer cells develop blood supplies so that the cancer can grow. These specific receptors are found in greater numbers in kidney cancer. In that regard bevacizumab will be tested in 2 doses that are higher than non-kidney cancer treatments with bevacizumab. One group of patients will receive bevacizumab at 15 mg per kg by vein every 2 weeks. A total of 75 patients will be treated with this dose. If this dose is well tolerated a second group of patients will receive bevacizumab at 15mg per kg by vein weekly.</detailed_description>

The study center will determine if you meet all of the criteria. If you do not qualify for the trial, study personnel will explain the reasons. If you do qualify, study personnel will explain the trial in detail and answer any questions you may have. You can then decide if you wish to participate.</criteria>
