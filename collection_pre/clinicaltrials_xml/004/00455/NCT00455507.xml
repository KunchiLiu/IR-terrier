	<brief_title>A Phase 2b Study of Istradefylline (KW-6002) for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease in Patients Taking Levodopa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish the efficacy of 20 mg/day and 40 mg/day doses of istradefylline for reducing the mean total hours of awake time per day spent in the OFF state in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with levodopa. Patients who meet entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to double blind treatment with oral doses of 20 or 40mg/day istradefylline or matching placebo.
