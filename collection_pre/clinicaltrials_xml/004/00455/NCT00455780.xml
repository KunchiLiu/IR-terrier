	<brief_summary>After a three month weight loss phase involving the use of meal replacements, participants are randomized into different weight loss maintenance conditions. Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the meal replacement (MR) and reduced energy density eating (REDE) interventions, when added separately to the LEARN program, will produce superior weight loss maintenance compared to a LEARN-only intervention. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the weight loss maintenance condition that combines MRs and REDE will produce better maintenance of weight losses than either individual component and than the LEARN-only condition. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that the two conditions receiving the REDE intervention will experience longer-lasting improvements in the energy density and nutritional composition of the diet compared to the two non-REDE conditions.</brief_summary>
