	<brief_summary>The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of naltrexone in compulsive sexual behavior. Twenty subjects with DSM-IV compulsive sexual behavior will receive 8 weeks of naltrexone or placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that naltrexone will be effective in reducing the urges to act out sexually in patients with compulsive sexual behavior. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.</brief_summary>
