	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the optimum dose(s) of BI 1744 CL inhalation solution delivered by the Respimat® inhaler for four weeks in patients with asthma. The selection of the optimum dose(s) will be based on bronchodilator efficacy (how well it helps your breathing), safety evaluations and pharmacokinetic evaluations (the amount of the medication found in your blood).</brief_summary>

Male or female patients, 18 years of age or older 3. Diagnosis of asthma (GINA) 4. Prebronchodilator FEV1 greater than or equal to 60% predicted and &lt;90% predicted (ECSC); 5. Increase in FEV1 greater than or equal to 12% and 200 ml 15 minutes after 400µg salbutamol (albuterol) at Visit 1 6. Patient must have been taking Inhaled Corticosteroids for at least 12 weeks prior to screening, and must have been receiving a stable low/moderate dose for at least 6 weeks prior to screening. 7. Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and PEF measurements, and must be able to maintain records (Patient Daily eDiary) during the study period as required in the protocol 8. Patients must be able to inhale medication in a competent manner from the Respimat® inhaler and from a metered dose inhaler (MDI). 1. Patients with a smoking history of more than 10 pack years 2. Patients with any of the following conditions: a diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, a diagnosis of paroxysmal tachycardia (&gt;100 beats per minute), a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms), a history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (TdP) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome) 3.
