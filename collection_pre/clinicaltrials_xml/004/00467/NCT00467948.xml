Patients having recurrences or another primary tumor, and those who underwent reconstruction with a flap were excluded from the study, because they had been submitted to prolonged antibiotic administration. Also cases with Diabet mellitus and Immune suppression or tumor types other than squamous cell carcinoma were excluded from the study. In addition, the following exclusion criteria were taken into account: pregnancy, hypersensitivity to penicillins or cephalosporins, patients who received a systemic antibiotic drug within one week prior to the planned procedure, those who had clinical or laboratory evidence of a preexisting infection or had serious systemic renal disease.</criteria>
