	<brief_title>Transarterial Ethanol Ablation (TEA) Versus Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolisation (TACE) for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard loco-regional treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma is transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, The drawback of conventional chemoembolization (TACE) for liver cancer is that it cannot effectively embolize portal venules supplying the tumors, therefore chemoembolization is difficult to completely eradicate the tumor. Usually multiple treatments are required and tumor recurrences are common. Transarterial Ethanol Ablation (LEM) can potentially provide a better treatment outcome with fewer treatment sessions. Preliminary results from a clinical study showed that the complication rate is reduced while survival rate may be improved. This study aims to compare survival duration and response rate between the treatments TACE and LEM.</detailed_description>
