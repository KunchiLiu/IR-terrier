	<brief_summary>In a previous study we used the FreeStyle Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System to obtain 30 days of glucose measurements from 30 people with diabetes treated with insulin. The purpose of this study is to characterize glycemia (glucose) control in 30 people without diabetes and to compare these data to the 30 people with diabetes from a previous study. Through this approach it may be possible to develop a means of establishing a model of normal glucose patterns and a basis of comparison with glucose patterns in people with diabetes.</brief_summary>
