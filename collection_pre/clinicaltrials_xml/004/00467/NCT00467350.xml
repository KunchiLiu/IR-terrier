	<brief_title>Comparison Trial of Enema vs. PEG 3350 for Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constipation is a common condition in childhood and occurs without evidence of a pathological condition in most children. Symptoms range from decreased appetite to abdominal pain and constipation is frequently diagnosed in children evaluated in emergency departments. A general guideline for constipation treatment is fecal impaction removal before initiation of maintenance therapy. Disimpaction may be achieved using various oral therapies (e.g. including Polyethylene Glycol 3350 or PEG); however, rectal therapies, most commonly enemas, are frequently used, especially in the emergency/urgent care setting. The optimal treatment has not been established. There are no published randomized studies that compare effectiveness of oral versus rectal treatments. Comparison: One milk and molasses enema given to the patient in the emergency department compared to three oral doses of PEG 3350 for relief of symptoms due to fecal impaction and constipation.</detailed_description>
