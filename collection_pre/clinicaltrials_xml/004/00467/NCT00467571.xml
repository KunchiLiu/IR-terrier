	<brief_title>Helicobacter Pylori Infection in Children With Chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura who have Helicobacter pylori infection are enrolled. Helicobacter pylori infection is diagnosed by urea breath test. Patients who have Helicobacter pylori infection will be randomized into 2 groups: control and treatment groups. The treatment group will receive 2 antibiotics and proton-pump inhibitors for 14 days for eradication of infection. Repeated urea breath test at week 6-8 after treatment. Blood tests for platelet count will be performed every month for 6 months in both groups. Platelet count at 6 months in both group will be compared.Blood for platelet antibody will be performed at 3 and 6 months. Control group will receive treatment for Helicobacter pylori at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
