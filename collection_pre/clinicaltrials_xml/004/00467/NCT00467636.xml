	<detailed_description>Hyperglycaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to hospital with acute critical illness, myocardial infarction and stroke. Moreover patients with hyperglycaemia have a significantly longer hospital stay, higher rates of ICU admission, increased in-hospital mortality and are more likely to require transfer to a nursing home. Recently, interventional studies have linked reversal of hyperglycaemia to better clinical outcomes especially in acute myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery and in critically ill patients. In England and Wales, it is estimated that the number of people with COPD is approaching 1.5 million. The morbidity and economic costs associated with the condition are extremely high with approximately 10% of all acute medical admissions caused by exacerbations of the underlying condition. As a corollary about 15% of patients with COPD need admission to hospital each year. Acute hyperglycaemia is common among patients admitted with acute exacerbations of COPD. The reasons for this are likely to be multi-factorial including an association between COPD and increased risk of developing diabetes at least in women, the elderly nature of the two populations and the use of glucocorticoids which markedly increases the risk of hyperglycaemia. Admission hyperglycaemia (&gt;11 mmol/l) also appears to predict increased morbidity for patients with COPD admitted to intensive care. The trial will be a randomised trial of comparison of usual treatment vs intensive insulin treatment for patients with COPD who may or may not have diabetes. Patients will take part in the trial for the first 5 days during their hospital stay.</detailed_description>
