	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, open label, parallel group, multicenter study. There will be two phases in the study. Phase 1 (Baseline to Week 24) will compare the efficacy and safety of regimens of basal insulin intensified with either Symlin or rapid acting insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes who have either been on a prior regimen of insulin for less than 6 months and were taking less than 50 U total of insulin per day OR are candidates for the initiation of insulin therapy. The purpose of Phase 2 (Week 24 to Week 36) is to explore further intensification of diabetes regimens in patients failing to achieve HbA1c &lt;=6.5% at Week 24.</brief_summary>
