	<brief_summary>The objective of this cross over study is to access if continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS) with a real time feed back and hypoglycemic as well as hyperglycemic glucose alerts vs. only retrospective analysis of glucose values is able to improve course of glucose with special regard to time spent in hypoglycemic glucose ranges in type 1 diabetic patients with impaired hypoglycemia awareness or a history of severe hypoglycemia.

	<brief_title>Effect of Continuous Glucose Monitoring on Course of Glucose in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this cross over study is to access if continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS) with a real time feed back and hypoglycemic as well as hyperglycemic glucose alerts vs. only retrospective analysis of glucose values is able to improve course of glucose with special regard to time spent in hypoglycemic glucose ranges. The second objective is to access satisfaction with CGMS during both conditions. This study is conducted in an inpatient setting with type 1 diabetic patients. Partisans are asked to have twice a continuous glucose measurement with the GlucoDay System (Menarini Diagnostics). Each measurement period is limited to maximal 48 hours. In one condition the have real time access to current glucose values and alerts are given if glucose is dropping below 70 mg/dl or exceeding 180 mg/dl. During the other condition the participants are blind against their current glucose values and no alerts are given. Glucose course is retrospectively analyzed. The order of these two conditions is randomized. Expected outcome: The primary outcome variable is the daily time spent in hypoglycemic range in type 1 diabetic patients with and without impaired hypoglycemia awareness or a history of severe hypoglycemia. Additionally the patients will also complete questionnaire about satisfaction with CGMS, diabetes related distress, treatment satisfaction, depressive and anxiety symptoms which belongs to the secondary variables. Inclusion criteria: - Type 1 diabetes - Age &gt; 18 years - Informed consent Exclusion criteria: - Diagnosis and/or treatment of a current psychiatric disease - Severe late complications</detailed_description>
