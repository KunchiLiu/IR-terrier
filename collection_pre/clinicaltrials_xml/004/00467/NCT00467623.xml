	<brief_summary>Background and objective: Plasma cobalamins decrease during pregnancy but it is not fully elucidated how this is reflected in the total and cobalamin saturated transport proteins, transcobalamin (total TC, holoTC) and haptocorrin (total HC, holoHC). TC transports cobalamin into the cells. The function of HC is unknown, but in contrast to TC it binds both cobalamins and cobalamin analogues. Design and methods: Healthy pregnant women (N=141) had blood samples drawn at 18th, 32nd, 39th gestation week and 8 weeks postpartum. The protein moiety of TC and HC (total and holo) was measured by in-house ELISA methods.</brief_summary>
