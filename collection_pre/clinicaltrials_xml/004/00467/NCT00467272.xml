	<detailed_description>THE STUDY DRUG: Daptomycin is an antibiotic designed to treat a variety of bacterial infections that are difficult to treat. SCREENING TESTS: Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called "screening tests." These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. - You will be asked about your medical/surgical history. - You will be asked about any medications that you may have taken in the past 2 weeks. You should tell the study doctor or study staff about any medications or therapies you may be taking while on this study) - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (heart rate, temperature, breathing rate, and blood pressure). - You will have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for routine tests and to check for bacterial infection. This routine blood sample may be drawn from the CVC, if the CVC is still in place. - Your CVC exit site (where the CVC will be removed from) will be examined. - You may have an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound waves to make pictures of your heart, which helps show how well your heart pumps blood). This test will only be performed if you have a specific type of infection (to make sure you do not have inflammation in the lining of the heart). Your primary doctor and/or your study doctor will decide if you will have this test. If you are found to have this inflammation, you will not be able to take part in this study. - Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test. STUDY TREATMENT: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be given daptomycin by vein over 30 minutes every 24 hours for at least 7-14 days, depending on the type of bacteria that you have. The CVC will either be removed, or it will be exchanged over a guide wire. The decision to remove or exchange the CVC and timing of the placement of the CVC will be decided by your primary physician and the willingness of you to remove or exchange your infected CVC. This will be done within 96 hours after your first positive blood culture (first blood drawn that showed bacteria). A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure. If the study doctor and/or your primary doctor suspects that you have a mixed infection (2 or more certain types of bacteria) or pneumonia, you will also be treated with different types of antibiotics, by vein or mouth, in combination with the study drug. These antibiotics may include aztreonam, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, bactrim, and/or amoxicillin/clavulanate (a combination antibiotic). If you are discharged from the hospital before completing the study medication, arrangements will be made to provide infusions on an outpatient basis (by a nurse, yourself, or a family member). You and/or a family member will be taught (by a nurse) how to take the study medication at home. Before you are discharged from the hospital, you will receive the kits that include enough supplies for you and/or a family member to give daptomycin by vein. If medication will be given at home, a prescription will be given to you to pick up your medication from the pharmacy before you discharge from the hospital. If possible, your primary doctor may arrange for you to receive medication at the M. D. Anderson outpatient treatment center, or a nurse will be scheduled to visit you at home to give you the medication. STUDY TESTS/PROCEDURES: During each week of treatment, you will have the following exams/procedures performed once a week. - You will have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for routine tests. It may be drawn from the CVC, if the CVC is still in place. The CVC exit site will be examined at each visit until you have no more signs or symptoms of infection. - You will also have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for a blood culture every other day until it no longer shows signs of infection. - You will be asked about any symptoms or illnesses that you may have experienced since your last visit. LENGTH OF STUDY: Participation on this study will last for no more than 60 days (about 2 months). You will be taken off this study if the infection gets worse or any intolerable side effects occur. END-OF-STUDY VISIT AND FOLLOW-UP VISIT: The end-of-study visit will occur within 7 days after your last dose of the study drug. The follow-up visit will occur about 32 days (about 1 month) after your last dose of the study drug. At each of these visits, you will have the following exams/procedures performed. - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - You will have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for routine tests and to check for bacterial infection. The blood sample may be drawn from the CVC, if the CVC is still in place. The CVC exit site will be examined. - You will be asked about any symptoms or illnesses that you may have experienced since your last visit. - You will be asked about any medications or therapies that you may be taking. This is an investigational study. Daptomycin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment infections of the skin and soft tissue. Its use in this study is investigational and authorized for use in research only. Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or nonpregnant, nonlactating females with an age of greater than or equal to 18 years. The suspected culprit on exchangeable central venous catheter (CVC) is tunneled or nontunnel (including ports and PICC) and antibiotic or nonantibiotic coated catheter inserted in the subclavian, jugular, peripheral or femoral vein. Patients must have at least two signs of sepsis from the list below, in any combination, within 48 hours prior to Daptomycin therapy and no other source for the bacteremia other than CVC: a. Core temperature =/&gt;38.0 degrees C or =/&lt;36.0 degrees C, measured orally, rectally, tympanic ally or via a central catheter. If auxiliary add 0.5 degrees C to the measured temperature; b. Pulse rate =/&gt; 100 beats/min.; c. Respiratory rate =/&gt; 20/min.; d. WBC count =/&gt;12,000/mm^3 or =/&lt;4,000/mm^3 differential count showing &gt;10% band forms; e.
