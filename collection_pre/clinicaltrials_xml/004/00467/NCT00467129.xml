	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and help doctors understand how patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is examining genes that affect disease outcome in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genes That Affect Disease Outcome in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Collect blood samples for DNA extraction for genetic studies from patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. - Collect detailed clinical, pathological, and chemotherapy data from these patients. - Identify genetic factors that relate to treatment response and outcome in these patients. OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected and relevant genes and regions are amplified by PCR. PCR products are then sequenced or genotyped for known biological markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Tumor samples from surplus pathology specimens are analyzed for expression of candidate genes and mutation in the candidate genes. Clinical and family history data is also collected by questionnaire. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
