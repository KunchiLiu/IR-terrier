	<brief_summary>An epidemiologic study of pregnant women in western Washington to measure the relationships between exposure to air pollutants and risks of preeclampsia and preterm delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ambient Air Pollution, Preeclampsia, and Preterm Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will design models that use local traffic, weather, and population characteristics to predict monthly ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO). These models will be used to estimate study participants' PM2.5 and CO exposures during and before pregnancy. We will test whether these air pollutant exposures are associated with subsequent risk of preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Additionally, we will test biological markers of maternal lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) in maternal blood samples drawn during early pregnancy. We will also examine carboxyhemoglobin measured in early-pregnancy maternal blood samples as a marker of CO exposure.</detailed_description>
