	<brief_summary>Intravitreal triamcinolone has been effective for central macular thickness reduction and concomitant visual acuity improvement in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). VEGF is a very effective inducer of permeability, being 50.000 times more potent than histamine, and may exert its effect on retinal vascular permeability by altering tight-junctions proteins, such as occluding and VE-cadherin. Based on these principles, there is a rationale for anti-VEGF agents treatment of increased retinal capillary permeability conditions, such as diabetic macular edema. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, prospective study to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide and intravitreal bevacizumab injection for refractory diffuse DME.</brief_summary>
