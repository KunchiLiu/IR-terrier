	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous Vascular Repair Cells (VRC) for patients with peripheral arterial disease as a treatment for critical limb ischemia. The double-blind study is expected to enroll 150 patients, randomized into two patient groups. The treatment group will receive intramuscular (IM) injections of the VRCs into the affected limb; the control group will receive intramuscular injections with an electrolyte solution (without cells). Both groups will receive the standard of care appropriate for their medical condition.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will assess the safety and ability of Aastrom TRC autologous bone marrow cells to restore peripheral blood flow affected by critical limb ischemia. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), also known as Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), occurs when peripheral arteries are damaged by arterial hypertension and/or by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. PAD is a chronic disease that progressively constricts arterial circulation of limbs. The term critical limb ischemia (CLI) is used for all patients with chronic ischemia rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene in limbs attributable to objectively proven PAD. These sequelae represent the end stage of PAD. PAD is associated with several other clinical conditions, i.e. hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, tobacco use, obesity and stroke. The double-blind study is expected to enroll 150 patients, randomized into two patient groups. The treatment group will receive intramuscular injections of the TRC product into the affected limb; the control group will receive intramuscular injections with an electrolyte solution (without cells). Both groups will receive the standard of care appropriate for their medical condition.</detailed_description>
