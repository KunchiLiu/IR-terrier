	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and exposure of SB-751689 when administered alone at supratherapeutic doses and when SB-751689 is co administered with ketoconazole, a PGP/CYP3A4 inhibitor that increases exposure of SB-751689. Data from this study will enable the planning and conduct of a QTc study for SB-751689.</brief_summary>
