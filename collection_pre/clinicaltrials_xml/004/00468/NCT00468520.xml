	<brief_summary>The transcervical Foley catheter (TFC) is a proven and effective mode of cervical ripening. It is common practice to use TFC with simultaneous low-dose oxytocin under the assumption that the combination results in a more successful labor induction. Scientific validation of this practice is lacking. We seek to determine if the addition of oxytocin to TFC improves induction success.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Oxytocin for Preinduction Ripening With a Foley catheter--a Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized trial that aims to enroll 200 singleton pregnancies presenting for preinduction ripening. Patients will be randomized to receive either TFC alone (control) or TFC plus low-dose oxytocin (treatment). Providers will not blinded to use of oxytocin and labor was managed according to routine obstetric protocols. This study is powered to detect a 20% difference in the proportion of patients delivered within 24 hours, the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are related to vaginal delivery rate, duration of induction, complications, and pain management.</detailed_description>
