	<brief_title>Can Blood Glucose Levels During the Perioperative Period Identify a Population at Risk for Hyperglycemia?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study to define the relationship between time profile of glucose control before, during and after surgery with patient variables, surgical variables and anesthetic variables. Serum glucose levels will be measured preoperatively and then at 30 minute intervals during surgery. Pain score, pain medication and glucose levels will be measured in the post anesthesia recovery room. Subjects will be contacted 2 weeks following the date of surgery to determine the incidence of postoperative complications.</detailed_description>
