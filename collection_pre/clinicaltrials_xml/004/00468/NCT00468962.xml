	<brief_summary>Functional properties of chitooligosaccharides have been studied for antitumor activity, immunostimulating effects, antimicrobial activity, free radical scavening activity, adn angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activity. Recent in vitro, and in vivo toxicity and absorbability studies have demonstrated that chitooligosaccharides have high absorbability and are essentially non-toxic. In the present study, we prepared a chitooligosaccharide with high absorbability and evaluated its effects on activation of immune function and cardiovascular funciton(lipid, atrial stiffness, etc) in healthy adults. This study was a 8-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The 30 volunteers were divided into a control group(n=10), half dose chitooligosaccaride(FACOSTM) intake group(n=10), and full dose FACOS intake group(n=10). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs) were isolated and cultured in 12 well plate for 48 hours. Cytokine production by PBMCs pre- and postintervention were measured simultaneously after stimulation with lipopolysaccaride.</brief_summary>
