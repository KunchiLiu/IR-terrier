	<brief_title>Efficacy of Aripiprazole Versus Placebo in the Reduction of Aggressive and Aberrant Behavior in Autistic Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic medication which is currently approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Multiple clinical trials in both children and adults have shown the effectiveness in the treatment of autism with medications like Aripiprazole. This study aims at assessing the effect of aripiprazole vs. placebo treatment on symptoms of irritability and aggression associated with autism, as well as the effect on the global severity of child and adolescent autistic disorder. Children or adolescent outpatients, with age ranges from 5-17, will be enrolled into an 8-week placebo controlled, double blind treatment study. During the 8 weeks, patients will be monitored by the treating psychiatrist. Study assessments will be administered at designated time points.</detailed_description>
