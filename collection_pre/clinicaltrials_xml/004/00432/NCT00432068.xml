	<brief_summary>This study will assess the pharmacokinetic profile, safety and tolerability of an octreotide extended long-acting formulation after a single dose in humans. It will investigate the profile of a single dose of drug in a healthy volunteer subject in order to understand the timing and extent of fluctuations in octreotide concentrations in the blood with this formulation, the relationship of drug concentration with dose, and how long the drug remains in the body system.</brief_summary>
