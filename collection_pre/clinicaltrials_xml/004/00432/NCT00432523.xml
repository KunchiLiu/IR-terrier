	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To compare if, when given concomitantly with VARIVAX® by the same route at 12-18 months of age using separate injection sites, a single dose of M-M-RTMII administered by IM route is as immunogenic as a single dose of M-M-RTMII administered by SC route in terms of response rates to measles, mumps and rubella at 42 days following the vaccination. AND/OR To compare if, when given concomitantly with M-M-RTMII by the same route at 12-18 months of age using separate injection sites, a single dose of VARIVAX® administered by IM route is as immunogenic as a single dose of VARIVAX® administered by SC route in terms of response rate to varicella at 42 days following the vaccination Secondary objectives: - To summarise the antibody titres to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at 42 days following the vaccination in children immunised with M-M-R™II and VARIVAX® administered concomitantly at two separate injection sites by the same route IM or SC, - To evaluate the safety profiles of M-M-R™II and VARIVAX® administered concomitantly at two separate injection sites by the same route IM or SC.</brief_summary>
