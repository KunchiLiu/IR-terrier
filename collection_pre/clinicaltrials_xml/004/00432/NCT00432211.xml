	<brief_summary>This study is being undertaken to investigate the efficacy and safety of Juvista (given as an intradermal injection of 200ng/100Âµl per linear centimetre of wound margin) in the prevention or improvement of scar appearance when administered intradermally to approximated wound margins following surgical scar revision. In addition, this study will compare the scar revision techniques of complete excision (excision of the entire scar during one surgical procedure) and staged excision (excision of the outmost segments and central core separately).</brief_summary>

Subjects with additional scars less than 3cm away from the area to be revised. Subjects with a history of a bleeding disorder. Subjects with diseases or conditions that could, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with the assessment of safety, tolerability or efficacy. Subjects who have had surgery in the area to be excised within one year of Day 0. Subjects with a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or involves the areas to be examined in this trial. Subjects who on direct questioning and / or physical examination, have evidence of any past or present clinically significant medical condition that would impair wound healing. Subjects with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to any of the drugs or surgical dressings to be used in this trial.
