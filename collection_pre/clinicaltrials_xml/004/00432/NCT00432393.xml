	<brief_summary>Purpose: There are some controversies about the effect of Levodopa-Carbidopa on treatment of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). This study was performed to evaluate the effect of Levodopa-Carbidopa on visual acuity, color vision, and visual field in patients with recent onset NAION (less than 6 weeks duration). Patients and Methods: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 13 patients were treated with levodopa-carbidopa and 12 patients took placebo for 3 weeks. Visual acuity, color vision, and visual field were tested before and at 4th, 12th, 16th, and 24th weeks after enrollment, and evaluated.</brief_summary>
