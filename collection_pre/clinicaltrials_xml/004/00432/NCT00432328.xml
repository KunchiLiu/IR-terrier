	<brief_summary>Severe scarring is a common problem following breast reduction surgery, studies have shown that over 64% of patients develop a hypertrophic scar at three months after the operation. Scar severity can be influenced by a large number of factors including age, sex, skin thickness and tension, ethnicity and the position of the scar on the body. Therefore the most sensitive and reliable method to assess the efficacy of an anti-scarring treatment is to compare bilateral wounds on the same individual. Bilateral breast reduction surgery provides an ideal model for a within patient evaluation of anti-scarring activity in wounds which develop into bad scars. This study is being undertaken to investigate the efficacy and safety of Juvista (given as an intradermal injection of 200ng per 1cm wound margin) in the reduction of scar appearance applied to approximated wound margins following bilateral reduction mammaplasty.</brief_summary>

Patients who have had surgery in the area to be incised within one year of trial surgery. Patients with a history of a bleeding disorder. Patients with a history of breast malignancy. Patients with a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of the wounds or involves the areas to be examined in this trial. Patients who on direct questioning and/or physical examination, have evidence of any past or present clinically significant medical condition that would impair wound healing. Patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to any of the drugs or surgical dressings to be used in this trial.

Patients undergoing investigations or changes in management for an existing medical condition. Patients who are or who become pregnant up to and including the day of surgery or who are lactating. Patients with diseases or conditions that could, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with the assessment of safety or efficacy of the investigational product.
