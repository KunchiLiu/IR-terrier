	<brief_summary>This is an open-label study that includes two substudies of random distribution. First,a sample of the primary tumor will be obtained and will be analyzed by an immunohistochemical technique to determine several markers.Depending on the expression of these markers, the patients will be characterize as group 1 (Luminal A phenotype) or group 2 (Basal phenotype) and a random assignment will be performed to standard or experimental treatment.</brief_summary>
