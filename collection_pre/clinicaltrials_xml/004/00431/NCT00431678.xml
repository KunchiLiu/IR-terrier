	<brief_summary>Sequential therapy with intravenous to oral moxifloxacin, was tested at 69 study centres in 17 countries to determine if this treatment regimen is safe and effective in treating hospitalized adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. 748 patients were participated in the study over an 18 months period. Individual patient involvement in the study was approximately 4-6 weeks. Moxifloxacin was compared to a combination treatment regimen of high dose intravenous ceftriaxone plus high dose intravenous levofloxacin followed by high dose oral levofloxacin.</brief_summary>
