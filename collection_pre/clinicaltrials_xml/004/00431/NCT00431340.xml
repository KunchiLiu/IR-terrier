	<brief_summary>This open-label study will assess anti-tumor activity and safety of belinostat in combination with bortezomib (Velcade®) in multiple myeloma patients refractory to or relapsed from at least one prior bortezomib-containing regimen. Subjects will be administered both PXD101 and bortezomib on the same days: i.e. days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle, for up to 8 cycles.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Status of refractory to or relapsed from at least one prior bortezomibcontaining regimen. Progressive disease. Age &gt;= 18 years. Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 60% Acceptable liver function: Bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) =&lt; 3 x ULN Acceptable hematologic status: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count &gt;= 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Coagulation status PTINR/PTT =&lt; 1.5 x ULN or in the therapeutic range if on anticoagulation therapy. (PTINR/PTT= prothrombin international normalized ratio / prothrombin time) Serum potassium within normal range. Estimated life expectancy greater than 3 months. Signed, written IRB (institutional Review Board)approved informed consent. Nonsecretory multiple myeloma or symptomatic amyloidosis. Hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol. Less than 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, or immunotherapy, except if disease is rapidly progressing. Less than 4 weeks since prior use of other investigational agents. Serious concomitant systemic disorders (e.g. active infection). Significant cardiovascular disease. Marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc (corrected QT interval)interval. Central nervous system disorders requiring neuroleptics / anticonvulsants. Peripheral sensory neuropathy of ≥ Grade 2 Renal insufficiency defined as a creatinine clearance of &lt; 30 ml/min. Nonwillingness to use effective contraceptive methods for patients of childbearing age / potential. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Known HIV positivity. Prior treatment with belinostat (PXD101), or any other HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor. Altered mental status which precludes an understanding of the Informed Consent Document.</criteria>
