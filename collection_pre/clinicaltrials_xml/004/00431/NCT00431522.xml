	<brief_summary>- To determine the total and local gray matter volumes, and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels in patients with bipolar disorders who are within euthimic, depressive or manic/hypomanic period and who are not taking drug; - To investigate the neuroprotective effects of long-term (6 weeks) use of valproate on total and local gray matter volumes and NAA levels. - To measure the brain electrical response to visual and auditory impulses before and after valproate treatment in patients within euthimic, depressive or manic/hypomanic period and who are not taking drug, and to compare the data with each other and with normal groups. - To determine the cognitive functions before and after the valproate treatment in the same patient group, to compare the data with each other and with age- and sex-paired normal controls; - To determine the relationship between these effects of valproate and clinical improvement; - To investigate the relationship between cognitive ability status and electrical activity of brain, to compare this with that in control group; to determine the relationship between the data and brain imaging (MRI/MRS) findings in conjunction with localization</brief_summary>
