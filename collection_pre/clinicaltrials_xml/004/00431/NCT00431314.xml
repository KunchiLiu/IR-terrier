	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the vascular condition of hemodialysis patients with toe pressure measurement, finger pressure measurement and measuring glycated and oxidated proteins by skin autofluorescence. Hypothesis: Lowering of finger pressure/toe pressure during hemodialysis, especially in whom with a arteriovenous fistula, may contribute to critical limb ischemia in the extremities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Hemodialysis on Toe Pressure- and Finger Pressure and Skin Autofluorescence in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To determine the macrovascular status of hemodialysis patients by measuring toe pressure, finger pressure and skin autofluorescence. 2. Measuring toe- and finger pressure before and during hemodialysis to determine the chance of developing critical limb ischemia in the extremities. 3. To assess the differences in finger pressure in hemodialysis patients before and during hemodialysis in patients with either arteriovenous fistula in the upper extremity or not. 4. To predict mortality and cardiovascular disease by determine the fastness of accumulation of Advanced-Glycation-Endproducts (this concerns follow-up measurements of skin autofluorescence; another study has collected data of skin autofluorescence in hemodialysis patients in our centre in 2003)</detailed_description>
