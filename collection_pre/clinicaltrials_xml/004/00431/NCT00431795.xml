	<brief_summary>DOXORUBICIN is recognized as one of the most active drugs for breast cancer, but its clinical utility is limited because of a cumulative dose-dependent cardiac myopathy that can lead to potentially fatal congestive heart failure. Caelyx (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) was designed to reduce the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin while preserving its antitumor efficacy</brief_summary>
