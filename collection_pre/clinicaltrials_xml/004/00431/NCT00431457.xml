	<brief_summary>Patients will be prospectively randomized to 3 different treatment arms: - Treatment group 1: patients who undergo medial temporal lobe resection - Treatment group 2: patients who receive immediate hippocampal neurostimulation - Treatment group 3: patients who are implanted with an intracranial electrode but in whom hippocampal neurostimulation is delayed for 6 months. Twelve months after inclusion unblinding will occur. Patients in group 2 and 3 will have the option to choose between continuing neurostimulation treatment or resective surgery. Study visits will occur every 3 months.</brief_summary>
