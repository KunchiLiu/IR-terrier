	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of two different group-based exercise programs on fall risk (muscular strength and balance) and bone strength in older women aged over 65-75 years who have low bone mass. We are also trying to determine if once a week exercise is as effective on health outcomes as twice a week. We hypothesize that twice a week exercise will be more effective than once a week or sham exercise.</brief_summary>
