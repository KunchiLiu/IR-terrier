	<brief_summary>Anthracycline-containing regimens are recommended as adjuvant treatment for women with node positive breast cancer. In at least three large randomized clinical trials the addition or sequential administration of a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) to an antracycline-based regimen resulted in superior clinical outcome for women with node positive early breast cancer. In two large randomized studies the dose dense administration with G-CSF support of anthracycline-based and paclitaxel combination was superior to the same regimen administered every three weeks without growth factors as adjuvant therapy in women with axillary node positive breast cancer. In one randomized trial, docetaxel was proved superior to paclitaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Phase III Trial Comparing Sequential Administration of FE75C Followed by Docetaxel Versus Paclitaxel as Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Axillary Lymph Node (+) Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will compare the dose dense, G-CSF supported sequential administration of 4 cycles of 5-Fluoruracil (F) plus Epirubicin (E 75mg/m2) plus Cyclofosfamide (C) followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel versus 4 cycles of paclitaxel as adjuvant chemotherapy in women with axillary lymph node positive breast cancer</detailed_description>
