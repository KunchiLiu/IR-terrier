	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that niacin ER and simvastatin (NS) tablets, when compared to atorvastatin (Lipitor®; Pfizer, Inc.), has superior high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) elevating effects at Week 12 in subjects with type II hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia who are currently off lipid-modifying therapy. This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet all of the following laboratory criteria: HDLC &lt;40 mg/dL for men and &lt;50 mg/dL for women. LDLC ≥130 mg/dL but &lt;250 mg/dL. TG &lt;350 mg/dL. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT); serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST); serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT] &lt; 1.3 x ULN. Subjects must also be reasonably compliant with the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet during the 4 to 5 week Screening Period prior to randomization (and be willing to comply for the duration of the study).
