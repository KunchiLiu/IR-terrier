	<brief_title>IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) for Upper Limb Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) is a botulinum toxin type A preparation free of complexing proteins. Injected into a muscle, incobotulinumtoxinA causes a reversible local weakening of the muscle for several months, and may improve an impaired muscle function by lessening the muscle tightness within few days. IncobotulinumtoxinA is widely used for various severe neurological conditions. There is some evidence that the treatment effect may be influenced by the amount of the solvent in which incobotulinumtoxinA is diluted before injection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main Female or male patients ≥ 18 years Stable upper limb spasticity of diverse etiology Focal spasticity with equal or more than 2 points on the Ashworth scale in the wrist flexors Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) ≥ 2 points for primary therapeutic target at both screening and baseline visits Main Fixed contracture Bilateral upper limb paresis/paralysis Previous treatment with BoNT of any serotype and for any body region within the 4 months prior to screening Previous or planned treatment with phenol or alcoholinjection in the target limb Other muscle hypertonia (e.g. rigidity) Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, LambertEatonSyndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or any other significant neuromuscular disease which might interfere with the study Severe atrophy of the target limb muscles</criteria>
