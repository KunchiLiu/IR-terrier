	<detailed_description>Randomized multiple crossover trial in 18 healthy males aged 18 to 40 years each are required to complete a total of five iso-caloric meal tests lasting approximately 8Â½ hours. Test meals will be given as breakfast meals, in which different fractions of flaxseeds are incorporated into baked products. Appetite will be registered using visual analogue scales during 7 hours after the test meal and a total of 10 blood samples will be drawn to evaluate TAG in chylomicrons, plasma LDL, HDL and total cholesterol, plasma TAG, insulin, glucose and appetite hormone levels. At the end of the test day an ad libitum meal will be served and food intake registered.</detailed_description>
