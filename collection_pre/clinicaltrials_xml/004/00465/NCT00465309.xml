	<brief_summary>30% of ARDS patients ventilated according to NIH protocol presents morphological (CT) and functional (Stress Index&gt;1) conditions of hyperinflation even with Plateau pressure (Pplat) &lt; 30 cmH2O; values of Pplat lower than 26 cmH2O were associated with more a condition of more protective ventilation. In patients at risk of hyperinflation, use of alternative techniques such as CO2-removal my allow the reduction of Tidal Volume (Vt) and Pplat.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim of the study was to verify the efficacy of CO2-removal technique in reducing Vt and consequently Pplat to obtain a Stress Index value equal to 1.</detailed_description>
