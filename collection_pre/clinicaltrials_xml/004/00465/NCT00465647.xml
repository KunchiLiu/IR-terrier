	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of hydromorphone oral solution in pediatric subjects aged 28 days to 16 years inclusive. The secondary objectives are to characterize the safety and efficacy of hydromorphone oral solution in pediatric subjects aged 28 days to 16 years inclusive.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label Study of Hydromorphone Oral Solution in Subjects Aged 28 Days to 16 Years for Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydromorphone is an opioid analgesic that has been used for decades as an alternative to morphine in the treatment of moderate to severe malignant and nonmalignant pain. Only a small number of analgesics have been studied in children. The benefits to the subjects include contribution of knowledge that will provide for appropriate dosing regimen recommendations for future pediatric subjects. Treatment consisted of both parenteral and oral hydromorphone. For up to 48 hours immediately following surgery, subjects were administered hydromorphone by IV PCA pump. Dosing with the oral hydromorphone HCl began when the subject was ready to take clear oral liquid. Subjects were administered oral hydromorphone HCl every 6 hours for up to 9 doses. The investigator determined the timing of the first dose based on each subject's clinical condition. The duration of the treatment phase was up to 102 hours (up to 48 hours for the Parenteral Treatment Period and up to 54 hours for the Oral Treatment Period). Efficacy was based on the oral hydromorphone treatment. Adverse events were collected for both the oral and parenteral treatments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pediatric subjects aged 28 days to 16 years, Prospective subjects anticipated to have postoperative pain requiring oral opioid analgesics for at least 24 hours (up to 48 hours) following postoperative parenteral analgesia (up to 48 hours), Prospective subjects have received no more than a total of 7 doses of opioids in the 30 days prior to surgery. Prospective subjects with clinically significant hepatic or renal dysfunction and impaired cardiac and/or respiratory reserve, Prospective subjects who have received opioid analgesic therapy other than hydromorphone or morphine sulfate during the up to 48hour postoperative period prior to administration of first dose of oral hydromorphone, Prospective subjects who have received regional anesthetic blockade OR analgesic treatment with nonopioid medication within 6 hours prior to administration of first dose of oral hydromorphone. Other protocolspecific inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
