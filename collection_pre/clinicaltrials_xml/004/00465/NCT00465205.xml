	<brief_summary>Over 80% of HIV-1 infected persons are also seropositive for HSV-2. Increasingly, clinical and epidemiologic evidence show the role of HSV in increasing HIV infectiousness. The evidence suggests that HSV is an important co-factor in HIV transmission. The trial's purpose is to assess the reduction in HIV systemic and mucosal replication associated with valacyclovir for suppression of HSV-2 reactivation. This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover trial of 20 HIV/HSV-2 co-infected women assessed the effects of daily valacyclovir on HIV-1 levels in blood and body fluids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HSV-2 Suppression to Reduce HIV-1 Levels in HIV-1 Co-infected Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conducted in Lima Peru, 20 HIV-1 and HSV-2 seropositive women with CD4 counts greater than 200 and on no antiretroviral therapy were randomly assigned to receive valacyclovir 500 mg bid or placebo for the first 8 weeks of the study. After these 8 weeks, a 2-week washout period followed, which was then followed by the alternative regimen for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
