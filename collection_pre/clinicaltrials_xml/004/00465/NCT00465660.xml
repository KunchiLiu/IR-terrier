	<brief_summary>Female subjects over the age of 40 will be recruited and randomised into a progressive resistance training (PRT) or sham-exercise group. The PRT group will train at 80% of their peak strength, using Keiser pneumatic resistance machines, and progress approximately 3% per session. Strength will be re-assessed fortnightly. Exercises will target muscles around the hip and knee. The sham-exercise group will train on the same equipment as the PRT group except hip adduction, but without added resistance or progression. Both groups will train 3 days per week for roughly 45 minutes for 6 months. It is hypothesised that high intensity PRT will decelerate the tibial and femoral cartilage degeneration in the knee affected most by OA. Primary Outcome: Articular cartilage morphology following 6 months high intensity progressive resistance training Secondary Outcomes: Muscle and fat cross-sectional area (CSA) (pre and post) Muscle strength, power, endurance, and contraction velocity (pre, 3 months, &amp; post) Medications (pre, 3 months, &amp; post) Body composition (pre, 3 months, &amp; post) Balance; Physical function (pre, 3 months, &amp; post) Questionnaires (pre, 3 months, &amp; post) - Habitual exercise (PASE) -WOMAC index (pain, stiffness and functional ability) - Depressive symptoms (Depression Scale) -Quality of life (SF36) - Confidence performing physical activity (Ewart) -Demographics</brief_summary>
