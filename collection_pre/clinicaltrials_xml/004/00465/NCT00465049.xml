	<brief_summary>The standard treatment for skin abscesses in drainage followed by packing to prevent premature closure and reaccumulation of pus. Studies from the 1950s and later conducted outside of the US suggest that when drained abscesses are drained and sutured closed they actually heal faster without complications. The current study compares the time to healing and scar formation when drained abscesses are packed or sutured.</brief_summary>
