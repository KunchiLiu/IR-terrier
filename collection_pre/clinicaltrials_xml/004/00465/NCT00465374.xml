	<brief_summary>30% of ARDS patients ventilated according to NIH protocol presents CT scan evidence of hyperinflation. Functional analysis of pressure-time curve (Stress Index=SI) has been shown to identify this condition in experimental settings. We tested the hypothesis that the SI is an accurate predictor of mechanical stress due to overdistention in ARDS patients.</brief_summary>
