	<brief_summary>This study will demonstrate the non-inferiority of GSK Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine 134612 when given in an experimental co-administration versus vaccine 134612 alone and versus the experimental co-administration alone in healthy subjects aged 11 through 17 years. There will be 3 groups in this study.</brief_summary>
