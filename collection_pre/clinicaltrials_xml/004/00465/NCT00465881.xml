	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain sufficient continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data in a manner that provides clinical information that is not available using conventional self-monitored blood glucose. Currently, a formal method does not exist for evaluating CGM data except for looking at each glucose reading across the days a CGM system has been worn and evaluating it based on clinical practice experience. The hope is that a mathematical model can be developed that will enable health care providers to quickly and easily determine what changes in diabetes treatment need to be made after CGM data is obtained.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Develop Novel Methods to Display, Report and Analyze CGM Data for Clinical Decision-Making in People With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two purposes to the study. First, to use an investigational device, the FreeStyle Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System (Abbott Diabetes Care) to obtain sufficient longitudinal data in order to develop a method for reporting CGM data in a manner that provides clinical information that is not available using conventional SMBG. The long-term goad is to determine the manner and degree to which CGM contributes to clinical decision-making. Because of the evidence that glucose regulation may be indirectly related to blood pressure levels, a second purpose of the study is to monitor variation in BP control by means of self-monitored BP.</detailed_description>
