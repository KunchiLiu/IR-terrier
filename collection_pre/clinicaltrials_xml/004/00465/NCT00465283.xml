	<brief_summary>This is a double blind randomized investigation of donepezil for patients suffering from schizophrenia, undergoing ECT. Patients will be randomized to receive either donezepil or plasebo, in order to gauge whether donezepil has a protective effect on memory disfunction, while patients are treated with ECT. Several parameters will be invistigated at baseline: general psychopathological measures, memory function scales, side effects scales. The same measurements will be taken throughout the trial and one month after ending the ECT.</brief_summary>
