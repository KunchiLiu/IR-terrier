	<brief_summary>Children with congenital heart defects have shown to develop motor coordinative deficiencies. In this study we want to show that a motor pedagogic physical training can improve the coordinative capabilities of children aged 4-6 years.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be performed with a randomized crossover design. After the first assessment of coordinative capabilities children were randomized into two groups. One starts with exercised training for three months. After midterm assessment of the capabilities they will pause for another 3 months and reassessed. The second group will start without training for the first three months. After midterm assessment they will train for three months and have their final assessment.</detailed_description>
