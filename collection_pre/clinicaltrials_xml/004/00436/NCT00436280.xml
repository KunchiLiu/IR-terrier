	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions: - To assess whether Enzastaurin combined with rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GEMOX) can help patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma remain free from disease and thus live longer. - To assess for any side effects that might be associated with enzastaurin and R-GEMOX . - To look at the characteristics and levels of certain genes and proteins to learn more about DLBCL and how enzastaurin works in the body. - To look at the level of enzastaurin in the body and how long it remains.</brief_summary>
