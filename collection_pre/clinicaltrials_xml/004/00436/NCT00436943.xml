	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Program: A Quality Improvement Trial in a Resident-Based Outpatient Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that smoking cessation counseling improves with the implementation of a smoking status assessment data sheet in routine consults. This is a quality improvement study design to evaluate the impact of the implementation of a more formal smoking status evaluation in a resident/faculty driven outpatient clinic. This will be an observational study in which differences in quality measures will be compared between baseline and re-measurement periods. Population target: 900 patients screened before and after the implementation of the QI intervention. Primary outcome: smoking status evaluation. Secondary Outcome: number of patients advised to quit, plan implementation for smoking cessation, smoking cessation program referrals, number of NRT and bupropion prescription.</detailed_description>
