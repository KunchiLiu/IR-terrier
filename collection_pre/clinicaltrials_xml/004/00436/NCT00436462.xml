	<brief_title>Expression of Steroid Receptors in Endometrium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine in stimulated cycles a) whether there is a difference in expression of steroid receptors in stroma and glands of endometrium between different days during the follicular phase b)whether there are secretory changes detected by endometrium histology before ovulation c)whether there is an association between expression of steroid receptors in endometrium and exposure to oestradiol and progesterone during the follicular phase.</detailed_description>
