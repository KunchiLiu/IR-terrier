	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well ABT-751 works in treating children with neuroblastoma that has relapsed or not responded to previous treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ABT-751, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ABT-751 in Treating Children With Neuroblastoma That Has Relapsed or Not Responded to Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the time to disease progression in children with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma treated with ABT-751 vs historical controls. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with measurable disease treatment with this drug. II. Determine whether ABT-751 improves quality of life of these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of ABT-751. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-751 in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral ABT-751 once daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 52 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood is collected periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and prior to each course of treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5.1 years.</detailed_description>
