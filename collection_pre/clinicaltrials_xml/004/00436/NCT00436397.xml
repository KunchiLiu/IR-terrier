	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: A new radiation therapy planning system may help doctors plan better treatment for patients with cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying a new radiation therapy planning system in patients undergoing radiation therapy for extracranial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Radiation Therapy Planning System in Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the ability of the Radionics Body System™ to immobilize and re-localize patients receiving radiotherapy to extra-cranial sites of cancer. - Determine the accuracy of radiation dose calculations for extra-cranial sites of cancer when using the XPLAN™-intensity modulated radiation therapy (XPLAN™/IMRT) integrated software in this system. OUTLINE: Patients receiving radiotherapy have a Body Localizer cast constructed and undergo a CT scan while immobilized in the Body Localizer. Patients undergo another CT scan in the treatment position using the standard alpha cradle. The XPLAN™-intensity modulated radiation therapy (XPLAN™/IMRT)-generated treatment plan is compared to the standard treatment plan to verify that the calculated dose is within 2-3 percent of the planned dose using standard technique. Patients undergo sets of CT scans 3 additional times over the next few weeks for a total of 8 CT scans Patients may undergo additional CT scans before and after radiotherapy treatments for a maximum of 5 CT scans per week performed over the course of radiotherapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
