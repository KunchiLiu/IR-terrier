	<brief_summary>The genetic contribution to the development of obesity is now well recognized. However obesity is a polygenic disease and thus many genes are likely to be involved. This study aims to investigate the possible association between specific variants of the gene coding for the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1)and the development of severe obesity in an Italian population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frequency of ICAM-1 Polymorphisms in Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severely obese subjects referred to our institution will be evaluated. For the aim of the study, a venous blood sample will be obtained from these subjects and from a group of normal weight volunteers. Genomic DNA will be extracted from the blood samples and analysed by standard molecular biology techniques.The allelic and genotype frequencies of the two ICAM-1 variants will be calculated in the obese and control groups. The statistical significance of possible differences will be determined</detailed_description>
