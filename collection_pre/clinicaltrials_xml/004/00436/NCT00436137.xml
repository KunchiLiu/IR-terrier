	<brief_title>Improving Followup of Abnormal Colon Cancer Screening Tests</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening programs using the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) have demonstrated a significant reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, although only when accompanied by a complete diagnostic evaluation of the colon in the setting of a positive result. 90% of patients with a positive FOBT result have completed a subsequent colonoscopy within Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates. This project will use a pre-post study design to increase the rate of followup colonoscopy in the setting of positive FOBT results. Patients in the intervention group will receive a personalized mailing highlighting their positive result and need for colonoscopy, followed by telephone outreach from a centralized gastroenterology scheduling office. The primary outcome will be the performance of colonoscopy, however we will also perform chart reviews to identify predictors of completing appropriate followup.</detailed_description>
