	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Identifying genes related to cancer may help in the study of cancer. It may also help doctors predict who is at risk of developing neuroblastoma. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at genes in participants with neuroblastoma or noncancerous conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Using Blood or Bone Marrow From Participants With Neuroblastoma or Noncancerous Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Perform a whole genome scan for association of neuroblastoma with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and SNP haplotypes. - Identify true disease-associated SNP alleles using a customized genotyping platform enriched for haplotype analyses in an independent sample set. - Validate disease-associated SNP alleles and haplotypes in a final independent sample set. - Identify neuroblastoma predisposition genes. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to presence of high-risk disease (yes vs no) and MYCN amplification (yes vs no). DNA samples are derived from participants' banked blood or uninvolved bone marrow. A whole genome scan of DNA samples is employed to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The candidate SNPs are investigated, using a gene-centric haplotyping approach, to identify 10-20 true disease-associated alleles. The disease-associated alleles are again investigated, using a gene-centric haplotyping approach, to validate 5-10 disease-associated SNPs. SNPs are then analyzed for heritable predisposition. Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing. A certificate of confidentiality protecting the identity of research participants in this project has been issued by the Children's Oncology Group. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4,675 patients and 4,675 controls will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
