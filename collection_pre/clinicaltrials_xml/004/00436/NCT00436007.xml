	<brief_summary>This study is being done to assess the possibility of the potential integration of malaria vaccine into the EPI regimen. It will evaluate whether the malaria vaccine is safe and immunogenic in infants aged 6 to 10 weeks at first dose, when co-administered with other EPI vaccine antigens. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Study of GSK Biologicals' Malaria Vaccine 257049, When Incorporated Into an EPI Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two vaccination schedules will be studied, which constitutes the two alternative three dose regimens for the malaria candidate vaccine 257049 integration into EPI. The co-administered EPI vaccines include GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™, a measles vaccine (depending on the supply availability), Aventis Pasteur's Yellow Fever vaccine Stamaril™ and GSK Biologicals' Oral Polio vaccine Polio Sabin™. Tuberculosis vaccine (Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin, BCG) will be administered according to national medical practice and will not be administered as part of this protocol, but will be documented.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A male or female infant between 6 and 10 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination. Signed or thumbprinted informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the child. Where parent(s)/guardian(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by a witness. Subjects who have received one previous dose of OPV and BCG. Subjects who are born after a normal gestation period (between 36 and 42 weeks). Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Serious acute or chronic illness determined by clinical or physical examination and laboratory screening tests. Laboratory screening tests out of range, specifically: ALT and creatinine above acceptable limit; Hemoglobin, Platelet count and Total white cell count below acceptable limit. Previous vaccination with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (wholecell or acellular), Hemophilus influenzae type b or hepatitis B vaccines. BCG administration within one week of proposed administration of a study vaccine. OPV administration within four weeks of proposed administration of a study vaccine. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days of the first dose of vaccine(s). Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Administration of immunoglobulins, blood transfusions or other blood products since birth to the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Simultaneous participation in any other clinical trial. Twins (to avoid misidentification). Maternal death. History of allergic reactions (significant IgEmediated events) or anaphylaxis to previous immunizations. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Any other findings that the investigator feels would increase the risk of having an adverse outcome from participation in the trial.</criteria>
