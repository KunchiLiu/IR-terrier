	<brief_title>Interpersonal Therapy-Based Treatment to Prevent Postpartum Depression in Adolescent Mothers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postpartum depression is believed to be one of the most common complications after pregnancy. This type of depression often occurs within the first year after the baby is born and is most likely caused by dramatic changes in hormone levels after pregnancy. Pregnant teenagers are even more at risk for experiencing complications throughout pregnancy and parenting difficulties after delivery. Minimal research has been done on preventive ways to reduce postpartum depression in teenagers. Therefore, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of an interpersonal therapy-based program at preventing postpartum depression in financially disadvantaged pregnant teenagers. Participants will first undergo a 15-minute interview about their background and emotions. Participants will undergo a second interview and then be randomly assigned to receive either interpersonal therapy-based treatment or standard care. Participants assigned to receive interpersonal therapy-based treatment will focus on the psychological aspects of pregnancy and factors that may play a role in the development of postpartum depression in teenage mothers, such as poor social support, role transitions, and life stressors. Participants assigned to receive standard care will focus more on the health issues associated with pregnancy and postpartum. Both groups will attend weekly 1-hour sessions for 5 weeks. Homework may be assigned to review topics discussed, and all participants will receive the book Baby Basics. Following treatment, participants will meet with researchers again when they are 34 to 36 weeks pregnant; in the hospital after the baby is born; and 6, 12, and 24 weeks after the baby is born.</detailed_description>
