	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Zoledronate may reduce bone loss in patients receiving letrozole for breast cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well zoledronate works in treating osteopenia or osteoporosis in postmenopausal women receiving letrozole for stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA primary breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronate in Treating Osteopenia or Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Letrozole for Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Primary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess changes in total lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to 12 months in postmenopausal women treated with zoledronate for osteopenia or osteoporosis and letrozole for hormone receptor-positive, stage I-IIIA primary breast cancer. Secondary - Determine changes in total lumbar spine BMD from baseline to 2, 3, 4, and 5 years in these patients. - Determine changes in femoral neck BMD from baseline to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years in these patients. - Determine time to disease progression in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. - Adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy: Patients receive oral letrozole daily for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Osteoporosis management: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive oral elemental calcium twice daily and oral vitamin D daily for 6 months. Treatment repeats every 6 months for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo total lumbar spine and hip (femoral neck) bone density testing by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and annually for 5 years. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
