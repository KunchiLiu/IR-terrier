	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular risk factors cluster in hyperandrogenic women - including those presenting with the polycystic ovary syndrome - in association with insulin resistance, obesity, and other metabolic disorders. The present clinical trial intends to compare the effects of oral contraceptives and metformin on PCOS patients, focusing on classic and non-classic cardiovascular risk markers and indexes of cardiovascular performance, in order to whether or not, as suspected by previous data obtained in non-hyperandrogenic women, oral contraceptives worsen the cardiovascular risk profile of PCOS women, favoring the use of metformin if the latter actually ameliorates such a risk.</brief_summary>
