	<brief_summary>Rationale: respiratory complications are the most frequent complications following lung resection and represent a noticeable cause of mortality. Benefits from non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in acute respiratory failure are now clearly demonstrated. The use of preventive NIV after lung resection, in the absence of acute respiratory failure and/or hypercarbia, could be justified by the physiological benefits expected. The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of post-operative NIV in moderate-to-severe COPD, for prevention of respiratory complications. Material and Methods: This is a prospective randomised multicenter trial with an open parallel design in moderate-t-o-severe COPD patients hospitalised in thoracic surgery for lung resection. Expected results: This study will determine whether post-operative NIV decreases the incidence of acute respiratory events (acute respiratory failure) and whether some subgroups of patients benefit more from this strategy. Conclusion: This study should help evaluating the utility of post-operative NIV after lung resection.</brief_summary>
