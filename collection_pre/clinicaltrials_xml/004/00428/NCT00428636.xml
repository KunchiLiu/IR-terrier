	<brief_title>Early Temporary Stoma Closure After Proctectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this multicentric prospective randomized study is to compare for patients requiring rectal resection followed by under Douglassienne anastomosis (low colorectal, coloanal, ileoanal) protected by ileostomy, two strategies about delay of ileostomy closing : delayed closing of ileostomy when second hospitalization two months later (classical attitude) ; precocious closing of ileostomy during the same hospitalization (at Day 8 of first operation). All patients aged 18 years or older with disease (carcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease, benign disease) requiring colorectal or rectal resection with low pelvic anastomoses (LPA) (ie low colorectal, coloanal, or ileoanal procedures) were eligible to participate in the study. A water-soluble contrast enema examination through temporary loop ileostomy was performed at day 7. If there were no radiologic signs of contrast leakage, patients were allotted to the group of early closure (EC) or to the group of late closure (LC). The primary end point was the rate of either postoperative death or postoperative complications occurring at 90 days after the first initial procedure.Postoperative complications will be considered present for a patient if one of the following elements is observed during the study : post operative death, anastomotic fistula, postoperative peritonitis ; serious event requiring hospitalization : prolapsus or peristomial eventration, erosive peristomial dermitis, serious wall sepsis, dehydration with hydroelectrolytic disorders, occlusive syndrome.</detailed_description>
