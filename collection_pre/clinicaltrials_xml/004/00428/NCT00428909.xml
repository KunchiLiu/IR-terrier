	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Ability to provide written informed consent prior to participation to the study. Male or female patients ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age Patients with CMLCP within 6 months of diagnosis (date of initial diagnosis is the date of first cytogenetic analysis). FISH analysis will not be accepted.

Patients who received acetaminophen or medications containing acetaminophen within 72 hours prior to study entry. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
