	<brief_title>Safety Study of Mini-dystrophin Gene to Treat Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I randomized double blind dose escalation study investigates the safety and efficacy of the mini-dystrophin gene transferred to the biceps muscle for Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, ages 5 to 12 years of age, using a recombinant adeno-associated virus. Eligible participants must have a known dystrophin gene mutation and may be concurrently treated with corticoid steroids. The mini-dystrophin gene or a placebo agent (normal saline or empty viral capsids) are injected directly into both biceps muscles while under conscious sedation. Following the gene transfer, patients are admitted to the hospital for 48 hours of observation followed by weekly outpatient visits at the Columbus Children's Hospital Neuromuscular Clinic. A bilateral muscle biopsy is preformed following 6 weeks with long term follow up will consisting of bi-annual visits for the next 2 years.</detailed_description>
