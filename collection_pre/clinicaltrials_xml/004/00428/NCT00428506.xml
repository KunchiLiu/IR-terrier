	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the infusion of albumin 4 gr per liter of ascites removed is as effective as the infusion of albumin 8 gr per liter of ascites removed in the prevention of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Albumin 4 gr/L vs 8 gr/L in the Prevention of Post-Paracentesis Circulatory Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Large-volume paracentesis associated with plasma volume expansion is the first-line treatment of tense ascites in cirrhotic patients. When paracentesis is performed without volume expansion, an high proportion of patients develop a complication named post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, which is characterized by a marked activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. PPCD has been associated with renal impairment, rapid recurrence of ascites and shorter survival. Infusion of albumin is very effective in the prevention of PPCD, but has sever inherent drawbacks: the theoretical possibility of transmission of infectious diseases and the high costs. Other synthetic plasma volume expanders have been proposed in the last decades, but they are less effective than albumin when large (&gt; 5 L) volume paracentesis are performed. Albumin is conventionally given in a dosage of 8 gr per liter of ascites removed; however no information has yet been reported on the use of lower dosages of albumin in this context. This would be interesting, because of the obvious advantages in terms of costs reduction. The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of the infusion of albumin 4 gr vs 8 gr per liter of ascites removed in the prevention of PPCD.</detailed_description>
