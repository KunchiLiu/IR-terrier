Your child's school and other schools in the area have been working with a program called the Models of Implementation and Dissemination of Environmental Health and Science Across Subjects (MIDAS) Project. The MIDAS Project was developed by The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX. Purpose: Students will be asked to share about the topics that they learned about over the past year, including their field trip experiences. Participation in the focus group is strictly voluntary, and your child may or may not choose to take part. This focus group will not be graded, and your child's name will not be recorded with his or her responses. If your child chooses not to participate in this focus group, he or she will not be penalized in any way.</detailed_description>
