	<brief_summary>This study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of switching from donepezil to an initial dose of 5cm^2 rivastigmine patch formulation in patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (MMSE 10-24). The study included a 5-week, open-label, randomized period followed by a 20-week open-label extension period. Patients were randomized to either an immediate switch from donepezil to rivastigmine patch formulation or to a switch to rivastigmine patch formulation following a 7-day withdrawal period.</brief_summary>
