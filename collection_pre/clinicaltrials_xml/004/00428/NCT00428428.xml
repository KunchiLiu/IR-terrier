	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of endoluminally administrated isoproterenol on pelvic pressure increase during flexible ureterorenoscopy in 14 humans. We propose that isoproterenol has potential of reducing intrarenal pressure during ureterorenoscopies. Lower intrarenal pressures may have the advantage of facilitating the procedure and reducing intraoperative complications as bleeding and infections.</brief_summary>
