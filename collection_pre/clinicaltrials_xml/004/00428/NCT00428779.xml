	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the present study is to determine the relative contributions of central and peripheral fatigue during an ultra-endurance exercise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuromuscular and Cognitive Fatigue During a 24 Hour Treadmill Running Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For that purpose, 14 subjects running 24 hours on a treadmill will be compared with a control group being awake during the same period. Subjects who running will have electrically evoked forces on the muscles associated EMG activity, blood samples and muscle biopsy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subjects of the experimental group will be recruited among experienced ultrarunners . They all have run at least a 12 hour race or longer. The control group will be recruited among experienced ultrarunners . Age of control group will be age experimental group more or less 2 years. The subjects will not be selected if: they were injured in the 3 months before the experiment they had a tendon or joint pathology that could impair strength measurements. they participate to an other experiment at the same time</criteria>
