	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate how easily gas can be taken up by the lung. We are comparing infants born premature &lt;32 weeks gestation to infants born full term &gt;37 weeks. We hope to evaluate the differences between the two groups in order to learn more about premature lung growth and development.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of the Pulmonary Diffusion Capacity in Healthy Infants and Infants With Chronic Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that infants who were born prematurely but are clinically without chronic respiratory disease have a lower lung diffusion capacity than healthy infants born at full term, when evaluated at comparable post-conception ages. In addition, prematurely born infants that develop chronic lung disease have an even lower diffusion capacity than healthy premature infants and full term infants. A lower diffusion capacity, when normalized to lung volume, would be consistent with decreased alveolarization and alveolar surface area in the infants born prematurely. We will study the age range of 1 to 24 month as this represents the period of rapid lung growth.</detailed_description>
