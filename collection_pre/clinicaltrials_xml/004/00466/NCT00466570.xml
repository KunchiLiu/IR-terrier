	<brief_summary>Topical ophthalmic antibiotics are common prescribed just prior to eye surgery to lower the risk of infection. Previous studies have suggested that antibiotics containing a preservative (Zymar) kill bacteria much quicker than those without a preservative (Vigamox). The purpose of this research is to compare how quickly to the two commonly prescribed antibiotics eliminate bacteria from the eye surface.</brief_summary>
