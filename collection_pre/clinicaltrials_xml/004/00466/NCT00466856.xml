	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well internal radiation therapy works in treating patients with liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internal Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases From Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine tumor response to selective internal radiation therapy with yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) in patients with progressive liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients. - Determine the symptomatic relief of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the health-related quality of life of patients receiving this treatment. OUTLINE: Patients have an catheter placed into the hepatic artery percutaneously through the groin and then undergo selective internal radiation therapy with yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) via the catheter on day 1. Patients also receive octreotide acetate IV 1 hour prior to, during, and 2 hours after Sir-Spheres® injection. Patients may undergo above treatment in another lobe of the liver (if each lobe is treated separately) 4 weeks later. Patients undergo functional performance, health-related quality of life, and symptom severity assessment prior to initial treatment and after completion of study treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
