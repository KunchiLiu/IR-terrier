	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-to three center study. The study will consist of 2 treatment groups (Betahistine 48 mg/day or matching placebo). Approximately 30 subjects (15 per treatment group) will be randomized into this 6-week study. A single blinded placebo treated period of up to 14 days will be used to determine subjects suitability for inclusion in the trial. In order that a patient will be defined as valid for inclusion in the study, patients should be able to present consistent LDL-C values, taken prior to randomization (at screening visit 1 and screening visit 2), without deviation of more than 12% of each value from their mean. Within one week from the second screening visit, subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of the following treatment groups: - Betahistine 24 mg BID (48 mg/day total), or - Matching placebo BID. Double-blind treatment will continue for 4 weeks. Study medication (betahistine and/or matching placebo) will be administered BID (before lunch and before dinner). During the study, subjects will undergo dietary assessment. The primary efficacy parameter is change in LDL-C from baseline (randomization) to Week 4 and the percentage of patients that reduce their LDL-C by 10% or more.</brief_summary>
