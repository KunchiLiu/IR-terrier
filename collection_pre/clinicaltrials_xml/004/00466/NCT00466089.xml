	<brief_summary>A phase II, multicenter, randomized trial of 3D Radiotherapy versus 3D Radiotherapy and erlotinib (Tarceva®) in patients with localized-unresectable (IA-IIIB) non-small cell lung cancer non susceptible for chemotherapy treatment, to compare safety and toxicity profile, and the progression-free survival in both arms of treatment (3D Radiotherapy versus 3D Radiotherapy + erlotinib) in patients who have not received previous chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

Pregnant or lactating women. Any other severe disease or clinical conditions, as, but not only: 1. Unstable cardiopathy despite treatment, myocardial infarction within the 6 months before entering the study 2. Uncontrolled active infection 3. Uncontrolled peptic ulcer, unstable diabetes mellitus or any other contraindication for treatment with corticosteroids. 4. Autoimmune diseases. Concomitant treatment with any other antineoplastic therapy. Prior experimental pharmacological agent within the 3 weeks prior to the inclusion of the study. Prior treatment with EGFR targeted therapies. Erlotinib known hypersensibility. Any radiotherapy treatment contraindication. History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders, including epileptic seizures.
