	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effects of rosiglitazone, a medicine commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, on the utilization of glucose by the heart in patients with heart failure which is not due to heart attacks. The primary purpose of the study is to determine whether treatment with an insulin-sensitizing medication will improve the heart's ability to metabolize glucose (sugar).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Defining the Role of Insulin Resistance in 'Idiopathic' Dilated Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nondiabetic patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who are insulin-resistance or insulin-sensitive based on a fasting homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) value are eligible for the trial. At baseline, a 6-minute walk test is performed, followed by assessment of coronary flow reserve with ammonia-PET imaging before/after adenosine infusion. Subjects are then given an oral glucose load (75g), followed by PET imaging with F-18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG). Subjects then begin taking rosiglitazone 4 mg qd x 12 weeks, after which the 6-minute walk test &amp; PET imaging is repeated.</detailed_description>
