	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerance, and pharmacologic profile of EZN-2968, a locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotide against hypoxia-inducible factor 1α administered as a 2-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion weekly for 3 weeks per 6-week cycle. In patients treated at a recommended Phase 2 dose of EZN-2968, dose intensification will proceed by maintaining the dose, but gradually increasing the number of doses per 6-week cycle. Up to 3 intensification cohorts will receive the recommended Phase 2 dose of EZN-2968.</brief_summary>
