	<brief_title>Psychological and Social Factors That May Increase the Risk of Developing Chronic Pain After Surgery in Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the psychological and sociological factors that predispose post-mastectomy pain syndrome after surgery in women with resectable breast cancer. Secondary - Determine the psychological and sociological factors that predispose post-surgical pain in these patients. - Evaluate emotional distress over time in these patients. - Evaluate the acute and chronic pain over time in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients complete multiple questionnaires, including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI), PCS, and QLQ-C30, to evaluate psychological variables (alexithymia, neurosis, repression of negative emotions, solicitude, dramatization, emotional distress) and quality of life. Post-mastectomy chronic pain (PMCP) syndrome is measured immediately after surgery and at 24 hours, day 6, and 5 months post-surgery. A subgroup of patients (20 with PMCP and 20 without PMCP) are followed at months 5 and 6 months post-surgery for medication use, pathological problems, morbid events, family history, and environmental factors. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
