	<brief_summary>Main objective: - To evaluate the applicability of the treatment: 1. To evaluate the treatment toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). 2. To evaluate opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections after 6 cycles of treatment with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) administered every 14 days and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and HIV infection. 3. To evaluate the adherence to the treatment with 6 cycles of R-CHOP considering the delays in the administration of the cycles and the reductions in the doses of chemotherapy (planned dose administered in predicted term). Secondary objectives: - To evaluate the efficacy of the treatment in patients with DLBCL and HIV infection after 6 cycles of treatment with R-CHOP administered every 14 days (R-CHOP/14): 1. To determine the global response and complete remission tax. 2. To evaluate the duration of the response. 3. To evaluate the probability of event-free survival in 5 years. 4. To evaluate the probability of global survival in 5 years. - To identify predictive factors of response after 6 cycles of treatment with R-CHOP administered every 14 days in patients with DLBCL and HIV infection. - To evaluate the impact of the therapeutic combination of R-CHOP and HAART in the parameters of the HIV infection (HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte count).</brief_summary>
