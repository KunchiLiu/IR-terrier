	<brief_title>Automatic Control of Pressure Support Ventilation in Surgical Intensive Care Units</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the weaning process vigilance, pulmonary mechanics and respiratory drive of the patient are changing. Consequently, ventilation settings have to be modified very often. The modifications can be conducted either according to a weaning protocol or automatically by an expert system (SmartCare/PS). This trial compares protocol-guided weaning with automatic weaning in post-surgical patients and examines the effect on total ventilation time, numbers of manipulations and alarms of the ventilator, length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital, 28- and 90-day mortality.</detailed_description>
