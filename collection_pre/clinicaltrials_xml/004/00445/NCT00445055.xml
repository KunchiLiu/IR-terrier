	<brief_summary>In this prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study, the researchers determined whether 0.625 mg or 2.5 mg of IV droperidol given 30 min before emergence from general anaesthesia reduces the incidence of immediate and delayed post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in thyroid surgical female population. Two hundred and forty six female patients receiving general anaesthesia for thyroid surgery received either droperidol 0.625 mg or droperidol 2.5 mg or placebo before emergence.</brief_summary>
