	<brief_summary>To establish a large, longitudinal collection of high quality samples and data from subjects with MS, selected other demyelinating diseases (Transverse Myelitis (TM), Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) or Devic's, Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and Optic Neuritis (ON)), and related and unrelated unaffected controls. Samples and data will be available as a shared resource to scientists researching the causes, sub-types, and biomarkers of MS and related demyelinating diseases.</brief_summary>
