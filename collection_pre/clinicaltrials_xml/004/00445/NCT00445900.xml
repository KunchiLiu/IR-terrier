	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving thalidomide together with prednisone and cyclophosphamide may lessen symptoms caused by myelofibrosis and myeloid metaplasia. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving thalidomide together with prednisone and cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with myelofibrosis and myeloid metaplasia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide, Prednisone, and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis and Myeloid Metaplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the benefit of thalidomide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide in alleviating disease-associated anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or splenomegaly in patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). - Determine the benefit of this regimen in palliating four hypercatabolic constitutional symptoms (i.e., weight loss, fatigue, drenching night sweats, and unexplained fevers) in these patients. - Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine the effect of this regimen on leukocyte count. - Determine the effect of this regimen on bone marrow histology, including microvessel density and reticulin fibrosis. - Determine the effect of this regimen on intramedullary and urinary markers of angiogenesis. - Determine the effect of this regimen on circulating myeloid progenitor cells by quantifying CD34+ cells. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide, oral prednisone, and oral cyclophosphamide (TPC) once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses. After 3 courses (3 months) of treatment, patients who respond to TPC therapy may receive oral thalidomide alone once daily for up to 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy prior to study entry, 6 months after starting therapy, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years. Samples are analyzed by microvessel density/angiogenesis studies (i.e., CD34 immunohistochemical and vascular endothelium-specific staining) to determine the effect of therapy on markers of bone marrow angiogenesis. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
