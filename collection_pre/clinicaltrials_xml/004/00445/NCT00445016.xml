	<brief_summary>To evaluate the incidence of neurologic complications as a consequence of peripheral regional anesthesia, all patients receiving peripheral nerve blocks will be evaluated according to a standardized protocol screening pain, motoric and sensory function recovering to defined periods, and according to a study protocol defining the items.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurologic Complications in Peripheral Regional Anesthesia - An Evaluation Based on a Standardized Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurologic complications as an adverse effect occur in all types of regional anesthesia. Reviewing the literature, the incidence spreads from 0.02 up to 3 percent. The incidence remains unclear because of different types of definitions, too. In this study, we evaluate all patients receiving peripheral regional anesthesia 24 hours after block performance according to a standardized study protocol. In case of any conspicuousness concerning motoric or sensory function or pain, the patient will be evaluated again after 48 hours. Further on, in case of neurologic dysfunction, periods of investigation will be after 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. This study includes the definition for nerve damage concerning motoric and sensory neural function and pain. The patients will be recruited among all patients from our hospital receiving continuous peripheral regional anesthesia.</detailed_description>
