	<brief_summary>Pevion Biotech has designed a therapeutic vaccine to treat patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The vaccine is based on a combination of the PeviPRO and PeviTER platforms using synthetic peptide antigens from the hepatitis C virus. Generally, a cellular immune response by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) seems to be crucial in overcoming a hepatitis C virus infection. In-depth research in recent years has shown that the cellular immune response is even more effective when supported by helper T-cells. Pevion Biotech's HCV vaccine candidate utilizes this effect inducing specific CTL responses (PeviTER) together with a supportive helper T cell response (PeviPRO). This virosome-based technological combination in a single product represents a new generation of modular therapeutic vaccines.</brief_summary>
