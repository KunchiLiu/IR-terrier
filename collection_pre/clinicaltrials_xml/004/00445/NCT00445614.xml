	<brief_summary>Fish from the aquaculture sector constitutes an increasing part of the fish consumption in Denmark. The most important farmed fish in Denmark is the rainbow trout. Due to limited access of wild fish for the feed production, alternative feeding regimes of vegetable origin such as vegetable proteins and rapeseed oil are used instead of marine feed. This change in feeding regime may affect flesh quality and health and nutritional properties as the content of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) will presumably decrease in the meat. The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of vegetable based feed versus marine feed of farmed trout and its effect in healthy men on cardiovascular risk markers associated with the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Trout Fed With a Vegetable Based Feed on Cardiovascular Risk Markers and Plasma Proteome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a two month parallel study including 60 healthy men aged 40-70 years, the cardiovascular effect of one daily meal of trout fed with a vegetable based feed are compared with that of trout fed with marine feed (estimated intake of n-3 LCPUFA 2.6 g/day) and a standard Danish diet with poultry. Men are randomised to one of the three groups. Red blood cell fatty acid composition, classical cardiovascular disease (CVD)-risk markers (blood pressure and plasma lipid profile), newer CVD-markers (arterial compliance and plasma markers of endothelial function and inflammation) and plasma proteome analysis are measured at the beginning and end of the intervention period.</detailed_description>
