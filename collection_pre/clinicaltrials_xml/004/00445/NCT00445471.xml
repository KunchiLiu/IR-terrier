	<brief_summary>The current study aims at comparing outcomes achieved using the Mifne approach of treating autistic children with results obtained when routine standard treatment is used. A prospective comparative study will be performed comparing the results of 12 children treated at Mifne with 12 children treated with treatment as usual. A child and adolescent psychiatrist using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) will make the diagnostic assessment and a developmental psychologist will make the developmental and psychological assessments using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Revised and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID II) before the child enters the study. Each child will be reassessed following completion of the Mifne intervention, at three and at six months after commencement of treatment. The control child will also be reassessed at three and at six months after commencement of a therapeutic intervention.</brief_summary>
