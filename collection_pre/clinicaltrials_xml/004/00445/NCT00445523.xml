	<brief_summary>Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer will be enrolled to receive either Trovax® alone or Trovax® plus Interferon Alfa. The study will try to determine whether the use of Trovax® will delay tumor progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of TroVax Alone vs. TroVax Plus Interferon Alpha in Patients With Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer will be enrolled in the study if all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Once the patient is enrolled, and baseline tests have been completed, the patient will start treatment. Trovax® alone arm: Trovax will be given as an intramuscular injection every two weeks for the first two months, then once a month for the next 2 months, and then once every 2 months for up to a year. Trovax® plus IFN-α: Trovax® schedule will be the same as the Trovax® alone arm. IFN will be given on the first, third and fifth day of the week for a total of twelve weeks. At every office visit vital signs will be taken. Every eight weeks a medical history, physical exam, performance status evaluation, chest x-ray or CT scan, abdomen/pelvis CT scan or MRI will be done. A blood sample (about 8-10 tablespoons) will be taken to test the immunological response to TroVax® on the same days that the patient receives TroVax® injections.</detailed_description>
