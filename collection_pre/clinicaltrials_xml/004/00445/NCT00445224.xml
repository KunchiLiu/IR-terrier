	<brief_summary>Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common knee disorder affecting physically active people. Despite the growing base of support for the early introduction of hip strengthening exercises into the rehabilitation of PFPS, there have been few randomized clinical trials comparing isolated hip to isolated quadriceps strengthening. The purpose of this study is to determine how different exercises affect pain, strength, muscle activity, and function in female subjects with patellofemoral pain. The researchers hypothesize that females diagnosed with PFPS who initially participate in a hip strengthening program will report a greater perceived level of function, greater strength, less pain, and improved neuromuscular activity than those who participate in a progressive quadriceps strengthening intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods: Thirty-three females with PFPS will perform either initial hip strengthening (hip group) or initial quadriceps strengthening (quad group) for 4 weeks, prior to 4 weeks of a similar program of functional weight-bearing exercises. Self-reported pain, function, and functional strength were measured. Isometric strength was assessed for hip abductors, external rotators, and knee extensors. A mixed-model analysis of variance will be used to determine group differences over time.</detailed_description>
