	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and clarithromycin in treating patients who have undergone stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide and clarithromycin, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving lenalidomide together with dexamethasone and clarithromycin may be an effective treatment for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone, and Clarithromycin in Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Stem Cell Transplant for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the toxicity of the use of lenalidomide/biaxin (clarithromycin)/dexamethasone as maintenance therapy after autologous/syngeneic transplant. II. Evaluate the median time to disease progression. III. Evaluate survival. OUTLINE: Patients receive clarithromycin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and dexamethasone PO once a week. Treatment with clarithromycin and dexamethasone continues for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive lenalidomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Courses with lenalidomide repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *After one year of treatment, dexamethasone is tapered for an additional 4 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
