	<brief_summary>The Phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of ABT-263 with the objective of defining the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose. (This portion of the study is complete). The Phase 2a portion of the study will evaluate ABT-263 at the defined recommended Phase 2 dose to obtain additional safety information and a preliminary assessment of efficacy.</brief_summary>

Recent history of nonchemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia associated bleeding within 1 year prior to first dose of study drug. Active peptic ulcer disease or other potentially hemorrhagic esophagitis/gastritis. The subject has active immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),active autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), or a history of being refractory to platelet transfusions (within 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug). Currently receiving or requires anticoagulation therapy or any drug or herbal supplements that affect platelet function, with exception of lowdose anticoagulation medications that are used to maintain the patency of a central intravenous catheter. Received any anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal (with the exception of hormones for hypothyroidism or estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), anti estrogen analogs, agonists required to suppress serum testosterone levels), or any investigational therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug, or has not recovered to less than a grade 2 adverse effect(s) of the previous therapy.
