	<criteria>Inclusion: (All must Apply) Males and females aged 18 to 55 years inclusive. Documented history of bronchial asthma, first diagnosed at least 6 months prior to the screening visit and currently being treated only with intermittent shortacting beta agonist therapy by inhalation. Prebronchodilator FEV1 &gt;75% of predicted at screening. Documented sensitivity to AMP with a provocative concentration of AMP resulting in a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20 AMP) of &lt;80 mg/ml at the screening visit. Demonstrate stable bronchoconstriction in response to inhaled AMP at the runin visit. 'Stable bronchoconstriction' is a term to define a population of asthmatics who have a repeatable and reproducible response to a challenge agent that induces bronchoconstriction. The runin PC20 needs to be within 1.25DD of the screening PC20. Nonsmoking status as verified by urinary cotinine levels below 300 ng/mL cotinine at the screening visit. This can include exsmokers who have given up smoking for &gt;6 months and have less than a 5 packyear smoking history. Able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study. Available to complete all study measurements. Exclusion: Pregnant or nursing females. Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the outcome of this study. Subject has known history of hypertension or is hypertensive at screening. Respiratory tract infection and/or exacerbation of asthma within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication. History of lifethreatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnoea, respiratory arrest and/or hypoxic seizures. Unable to abstain from prescription medication, other than short acting inhaled betaagonists and paracetamol for the treatment of minor ailments eg headache from 48h before the first dose until the followup visit. The subject has participated in a clinical trial during the previous 3 months. History of blood donation (450 mL) within 2 months of starting the clinical study. The subject regularly drinks more than 28 units of alcohol in a week if male, or 21 units per week if female. The subject has tested positive for hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen or HIV antibodies. The subject has positive drugs of abuse test. Subjects weighing less than 50kg are to be excluded from participating in the study.</criteria>
