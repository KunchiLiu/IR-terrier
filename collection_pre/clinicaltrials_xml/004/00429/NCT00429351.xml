	<brief_summary>This research may explain whether a shortage of three special compounds called aromatic amino acids is responsible for the severe illness and high death rate of children with the kwashiorkor type of malnutrition and whether supplying adequate amounts of these compounds in the treatment diet will speed up recovery from this condition. We propose that decreased availability of the aromatic amino acids may be the reason why children with kwashiorkor are sicker and more difficult to treat.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Malnourished children between 6 to 18 months of age. To standardize for degree of malnutrition, only patients whose weight is &lt; 80 % of that expected for age will be enrolled. By the Wellcome Classification (22), enrolled patients will have marasmus (&lt; 60 % weight/age and no edema), marasmickwashiorkor (&lt; 60 % weight/age plus edema) or kwashiorkor (&lt; 80 % weight/age plus edema). Presence of infection at admission. Infection will be defined by the presence of two or more of the following: Leukocyte count &gt;11,000 cells/dl, temperature at admission &gt; 99 oF, positive blood or urine cultures. Criteria for exclusion will include presence of cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, metabolic disease or HIV/AIDS.</criteria>
