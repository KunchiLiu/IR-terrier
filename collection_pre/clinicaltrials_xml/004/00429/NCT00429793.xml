	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well temsirolimus works in treating patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) or objective tumor response in patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer treated with temsirolimus. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. Secondary I. Determine the duration of PFS and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
