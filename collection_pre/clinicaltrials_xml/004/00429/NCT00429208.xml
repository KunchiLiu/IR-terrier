	<brief_summary>This research project addresses the hypothesis that a neurocognitive profile characterized by impairment of response inhibition and sustained attention may be a risk factor for smoking initiation and nicotine dependence among young women. Nicotine has short- term, facilitating effects on attention and response inhibition. Therefore, individuals who are impaired on cognitive functions such as these and initiate cigarette smoking may be more likely to maintain the habit and develop nicotine dependence. The research protocol specifically tests whether administration of nicotine to non-abstinent, regular cigarette smokers improves cognitive function in those domains where the participants had previously been shown to manifest performance deficits</brief_summary>
