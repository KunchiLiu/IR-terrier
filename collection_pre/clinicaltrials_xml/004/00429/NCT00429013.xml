	<brief_summary>Will the use of sensory substitution by lingual electric stimulation improve in a suitable way, for paraplegic subject, the spatial distribution of pressure applied at the seat/skin interface in order to prevent the formation of pressure ulcer? We will try to demonstrate that paraplegic subject move in an appropriate matter, in term of pressure, after a movement way advised by periodical electric stimuli on the tongue.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this study will be, to validate or not, the possibility to inform, in a suitable way, paraplegic subject by a lingual electric stimulation. Two A and B study groups of paraplegic subjects will be built-up in a randomized way. Under standardized conditions, the A study group subject will modify his usual behavior by using the cosmetically acceptable interface to get back information for moving his chest in a suitable way in order to correct identified maxima of pressure at the seat/skin interface. Under the same conditions but without the developed device, the B study group subject will have an usual behavior. The analysis of the different behavior in these two groups will enable to evaluate, in an objective way, the potential interest of this new medical device for the prevention of pressure ulcer.</detailed_description>
