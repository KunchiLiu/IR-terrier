	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate whether there is an interaction occurs between etoposide and aprepitant in patients with testis carcinoma treated with the standard BEP regimen. Also to determine how long treatment with aprepitant is necessary in BEP regimen for 5 consecutive days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Aprepitant in BEP Treatment of Patients With Testis Carcinoma (A-BEP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aprepitant is a novel, potent and selective nonpeptide neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist that was licensed in 2004 for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.More recently the indication for use of aprepitant was extended to patients with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Based on experience with the use of aprepitant it appears rational to consider aprepitant as part of the anti-emetic regimen for patients treated with BEP. There are, however, no published data available for the use of aprepitant in this situation.</detailed_description>
