	<brief_title>Simvastatin as an add-on Treatment to Copaxone for the Treatment of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised, phase 3 study. Patients that have been treated with Copaxone for at least 6 months at the screening visit will be randomised for treatment with simvastatin or placebo as an add-on to their Copaxone treatment. Patients will start treatment with 40 mg peroral simvastatin daily (or an apparently identical placebo) for one month. Hereafter, patients will escalate dosage to 80 mg daily. The patients will be examined clinically at screening, baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Blood samples for immunology will be performed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Blood samples for safety assessments will be performed at all study visits. MRI will be performed (T1-weighted and T2-weighted) at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>

Has been treated with Copaxone for at least 3 months. The patient must be prepared to and considered able to follow the protocol during the whole study period and to attend the planned visits, even if the treatment has to be withdrawn. The patient must not be included if any of the criteria mentioned below are fulfilled: Any condition that might give rise to similar symptoms as MS. Has received treatment with glucocorticoids or ACTH later than one month prior to inclusion into the study, i.e. at the screening visit.
