	<brief_title>Treatment of Good Prognosis, BCL-6 Negative Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma With CHOP-R in Patients &lt; 61 Years Old.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with rituximab and chemotherapy (R-CHOP)is the accepted treatment for young patients with diffuse large B cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. However not every patient benefits with this expensive therapy. Recent data suggest that patients with BCL-6 negative lymphoma are more sensitive to Rituximab therapy. It is also known that patients with high-intermediate and high IPI risk does not benefit form standard three weekly CHOP chemotherapy. In this study we intend to define a subgroup of patients in whom this therapy will be of maximum benefit. We will prospectively treat a group of patients with the following characteristics: &lt; 60 years old low and low intermediate IPI risk BCL-6 negative B-cell NHL Treatment regimen: R-CHOP (standard dosis) for 8 cycles</detailed_description>
