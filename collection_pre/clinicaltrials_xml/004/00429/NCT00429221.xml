	<brief_title>Parent-Provider Intervention for Improving Medication Adherence in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood behavior disorder that causes impaired functioning in multiple settings, including home, school, and in relationships with peers. Symptoms of ADHD include impulsiveness, hyperactivity, and inattention. Both medications and behavior therapies have been shown to be effective in treating ADHD. It is essential, however, that children take their medication regularly for it to be effective. This three-phase study will develop and test a provider-administered intervention to improve medication adherence and persistence among children with ADHD and their caregivers. The first phase of this study will gather information about perspectives on ADHD and its treatment by using focus groups and interviews with participating children and their parents. Phase two of the study will gather information on medication adherence and persistence, as well as demographic information. Phase three of the study will involve developing and testing a three part intervention consisting of an ADHD education component, a short survey to help parents identify non-adherence warning signs, and tailored medication messages for parents. After conducting a pilot with five parent-child pairs to assess feasibility and accessibility, all interested doctors at the study site will receive a lecture on evidence-based treatments for ADHD and a supply of parent ADHD education toolkits. Half of the doctors will be randomly assigned to receive additional training on the experimental procedures and to administer the intervention as part of the study. Parent and child participants will be randomly assigned to receive either treatment with a doctor who has been trained on the experimental intervention or treatment as usual. Assessments will take place at the beginning of treatment and 1, 3, and 6 months after the start of treatment. During each assessment, a saliva sample will be collected from the child, and parents will complete several checklists and questionnaires about ADHD treatment and medication adherence.</detailed_description>
