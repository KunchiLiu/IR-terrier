	<brief_summary>This study will examine: 1) The impact of psycho education group therapy sessions relating to beliefs/myths associated with bipolar affective disorder (BAD) on the emotional wellbeing, clinical course and cognition of individuals diagnosed with BAD 2) Will examine the existence of those same beliefs among the various caregivers - psychiatrists, general practitioners, social workers, and psychiatric nurses. The investigators hypothesize that psychoeducation group therapy will be effective in refuting the myths and will lead to better treatment adherence, longer remissions, fewer hospitalizations, improved self esteem, increased optimism, and better control over the disease process. The investigators also believe that they will identify some beliefs/myths or preconceived notions that are common to both caregivers and individuals with BAD.</brief_summary>
