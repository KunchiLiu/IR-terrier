	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or locally recurrent sarcomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or Locally Recurrent Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or locally recurrent non-gastrointestinal stromal tumor sarcomas treated with sunitinib malate. Secondary - Determine the 16- and 24-week progression-free survival rate (complete response, partial response, and stable disease) in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate clinical response with changes in soluble angiogenesis mediator levels in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the tumor maximum standardized uptake values by fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET scan in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by neoplastic subtype (vascular connective tissue neoplasms, leiomyosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, chordoma, or desmoid tumors vs high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [i.e., malignant fibrous histiocytoma (including myxofibrosarcoma)], or other nongastrointestinal connective tissue tumors [including carcinosarcomas]). Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
