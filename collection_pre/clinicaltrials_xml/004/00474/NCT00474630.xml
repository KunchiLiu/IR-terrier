	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study Comparing Naltrexone SR/Bupropion SR and Placebo in Obese Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimal care of patients with diabetes mellitus includes vigorous and persistent efforts to achieve physiologic control of blood glucose as well as other often associated conditions including hypertension, dyslipidemia and excess weight. Pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of obesity in type 2 diabetes have shown significant reductions in HbA1c. Two Phase II clinical trials demonstrated that a combination of bupropion SR and naltrexone is associated with greater weight loss than bupropion SR alone, naltrexone alone, or placebo in subjects with uncomplicated obesity. The current study investigated the safety and efficacy of the combination of naltrexone SR and bupropion SR compared to placebo in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</detailed_description>
