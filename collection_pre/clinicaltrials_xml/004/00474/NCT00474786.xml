	<brief_summary>This is an international, randomized, open-label, outpatient, multicenter study. Subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms: temsirolimus 25 mg once weekly by intravenous (IV) infusion or sorafenib 400 mg by mouth (PO) twice daily (BID). These investigational drugs will be administered in 6-week cycles for the duration of the study, up to 24 months. Subjects will be stratified by nephrectomy status, duration of response to sunitinib therapy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic group, and RCC tumor histology.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of mRCC (regardless of histology or nephrectomy status) with welldocumented Radiological PD by RECIST criteria or clinical PD as judged by the investigator while receiving firstline sunitinib therapy. Subjects must have at least 1 cycle of sunitinib therapy (minimum of four weeks continuously). At time of randomization, at least 2 weeks since prior treatment with sunitinib, palliative radiation therapy, and/or surgery. At time of randomization, there must be at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST. Lesions that have been previously irradiated or embolized cannot be selected as target lesions. More criteria apply Metastatic CNS from RCC. Subjects who discontinued Sutent therapy due specifically to intolerance. Prior systemic therapy for mRCC other than sunitinib. Active ketonuria, secondary to poorly controlled diabetes mellitus More criteria apply</criteria>
