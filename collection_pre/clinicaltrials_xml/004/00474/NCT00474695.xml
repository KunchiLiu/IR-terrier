	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the efficacy of Lucentis treatment for exudative age-related macular degeneration is associated with VEGF and HTRA1 DNA polymorphisms</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Genotypes Using Lucentis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment naive exudative AMD patients will receive Lucentis treatment as standard of care, and followed monthly for 12 months. Standard ophthalmologic exams will be performed, along with ETDRS visual acuity and optical coherence tomography (OCT). A blood sample will be obtained for DNA analysis. The primary outcome measure is change in visual acuity at 4 months after initial Lucentis treatment. Secondary outcomes are change in visual acuity and retinal thickness at 12 months.</detailed_description>
