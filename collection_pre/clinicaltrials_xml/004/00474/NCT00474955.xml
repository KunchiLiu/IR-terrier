	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of PEGASYS in patients with chronic hepatitis C and end-stage renal disease, including patients on hemodialysis. Patients will receive PEGASYS at a dose of 180 micrograms weekly; those with a calculated glomerular filtration rate of &lt;15mL/min will receive a reduced dose of 135 micrograms weekly. Following 48 weeks of treatment there will be a 24 week period of treatment-free follow-up. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
