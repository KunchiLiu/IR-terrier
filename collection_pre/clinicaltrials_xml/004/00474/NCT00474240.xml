	<brief_title>AEGR-733 and Atorvastatin 20 mg vs. Monotherapy in Moderate Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies suggest more intensive cholesterol lowering treatment for people at very high risk of a heart attack, specifically for patients who have heart disease plus major risk factors. Available medications used alone at even the highest approved doses are not expected to reach these new target recommendations for cholesterol in a large number of subjects. Thus, the development of new medications that can provide additional cholesterol lowering may be beneficial. This study tests the effectiveness of different doses of the study drug, AEGR-733 alone and in combination with the approved cholesterol lowering drug, atorvastatin (Lipitor), on cholesterol. Volunteers will be randomized to one of 6 different study treatments and will take the assigned medication (3 capsules daily) for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
