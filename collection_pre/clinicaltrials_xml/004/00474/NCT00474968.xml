	<brief_title>Adequacy and Efficacy of the e2TM Cervical Cell Collector Compared to Standard Spatula/CytoBrush Technique.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The e2TM (SoftPAP) Collector collects only cells that have been exfoliated from the cervix whereas spatulas, brushes and broom-style collection devices collect cells by scraping or abrading the cervix. THis trial is to determine whether the purely exfoliated sample collected using the e2TM Collector is equivalent to samples obtained by scraping or abrading the cervix for purposes of cervical cancer screening and HPV detection.</detailed_description>
