	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the benefits of continuing celecoxib through six weeks of total knee arthroplasty recovery. This is a randomized, double blind study with a group of approximately 130 primary total knee patients. All patients will receive celecoxib throughout their hospitalization as per current minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty protocol. At the time of hospital discharge, participating patients will be randomly placed on either celecoxib 200mg twice a day or a placebo twice a day. This study will determine if the continued use of celecoxib for six weeks after total knee arthroplasty hospitalization will further decrease narcotic consumption, improve knee range of motion, improve ambulatory ability, and improve patient satisfaction over patients receiving celecoxib only during the acute hospitalization.</brief_summary>
