	<brief_summary>Women with newly diagnosed breast cancer anticipating breast-conserving surgery are enrolled into the study and will undergo both high-resolution positron emission mammographic (PEM) imaging and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast(s). The purpose of this study is to determine changes in surgical management resulting from PEM or MRI imaging as compared to conventional imaging and to determine if the changes were appropriate with histopathology as gold standard.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study the Role of Positron Emission Mammography in Pre-surgical Planning for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast compression and/or immobilization during positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging has been called positron emission mammography, or "PEM," and the device used to perform the scan has been called a PEM Scanner. This protocol is designed as a prospective multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the role of high resolution PEM, used in combination with the radiotracer 2-[F-18]- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), in pre-surgical planning in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who are considered candidates for breast conserving surgery (i.e. lumpectomy) after full workup with mammography, clinical breast exam, and additional US as would normally be performed. Participants will undergo both contrast enhanced MRI and PEM imaging. In order to control for potential bias in interpretation of the second examination (i.e. PEM or MRI), the order of interpretation of these examinations will be randomly assigned at study entry.The primary objective of the study is to determine changes in surgical management resulting from PEM or MRI or both, separately and in conjunction with conventional imaging and to determine whether these changes were appropriate (i.e. to excise malignancy) or inappropriate (e.g. wider excision or mastectomy for what proved to be benign disease).</detailed_description>
