	<brief_title>Genomic Search for Childhood Obesity Genes-A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of childhood obesity has been growing at an epidemic rate for the past several years, in part due to the lack of understanding of mechanisms at a molecular level. This study will screen a healthy general pediatric population age 2 to 8 for potential genes associated with childhood obesity using whole genomic gene arrays. Patients with BMI values equal to or greater than the 85th percentile will be compared to patients with a BMI below or equal to the 15th percentile. The INSIG2 gene will be specifically studied because of its identification in several populations of obese subjects. The differences in gene expression of the 2 groups will then be used to identify new genes for investigation in childhood obesity.</detailed_description>
