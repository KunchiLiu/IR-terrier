	<brief_title>Proof-of Concept Study of Topical 3%-Diclofenac-Nano-Emulsion Cream for Knee OA Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, parallel treatment study. A total of 126 subjects will be randomized to receive either 3%-Diclofenac-NE cream or a placebo cream respectively. Following screening and a washout period from previous treatments subjects will be enrolled and will self-apply the study medication. During the study, subjects will apply 3%-Diclofenac-NE or placebo cream three times daily for 28 days and complete a home-diary. Subjects will visit the clinic at mid-treatment for a follow up examination and again for a final examination at the end of treatment.</detailed_description>
