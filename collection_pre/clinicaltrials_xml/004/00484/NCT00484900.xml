	<brief_summary>The purpose of this open randomised multi-centre clinical trial is to test the hypothesis that three pills of the fixed dose combination artesunate/sulfamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine, administered over 24 hours is not inferior in efficacy to the same drug administered over 48 hours and that the fixed dose combination artesunate/sulfamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine As/SMP fdc, independently of the duration of its dose interval, is not inferior in efficacy to 6 - 24 pills (number of pills administered to respectively children and adults)of the 60 hours treatment of artemether/lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.</brief_summary>
