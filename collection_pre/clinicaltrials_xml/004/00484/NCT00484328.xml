	<detailed_description>The standard treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) is treatment with ribavirin. Actually, the compliance (2x daily) seems to be a problem. To increase patients' compliance, it is investigated if the total dose of ribavirin can be taken once daily. The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin at different dosage regimes is investigated.</detailed_description>
