	<brief_title>Transluminal Flexible Endoscopic Procedure in Foregut and Urologic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining peritoneal cavity access from natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) during combined laparoscopic-endoscopic foregut surgery. Post-operative course will be compared with a historical chart-review control group of patients undergoing standard laparoscopic foregut and urologic surgery. The study group will be compiled by open enrollment for male and female adult subjects scheduled for combined laparoscopic-endoscopic surgery of the stomach, abdominal esophagus, prostate, bladder, proximal small intestine or who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. The historical chart-review control group will be randomly chosen from patients from 2003-2006 having undergone combined laparoscopic-endoscopic surgery of the foregut, prostate, or bladder and as determined by CPT coding. The purpose of the study is to determine if NOTES access and abdominal exploration is feasible, safe, offers comparable visualization to laparoscopy in a controlled human setting.</detailed_description>
