	<brief_title>Alterations of Immunologic Mediators During Severe Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients at early stage of severe sepsis, we investigate the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion-molecules, toll-like receptors, insulin-receptors, markers of apoptosis und of t- and b-cell-activation on a mRNA level.</detailed_description>
