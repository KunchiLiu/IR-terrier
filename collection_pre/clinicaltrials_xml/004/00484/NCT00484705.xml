	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The overall hypothesis is that women with PCOS, both obese and non-obese, have larger adipocytes, altered metabolism and signs of inflammation in adipose tissue and that these changes are associated with high sympathetic nerve activity, hyperandrogenism hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance with progression to type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as psychological distress and reduced quality of life. Physical exercise and electro-acupuncture decrease high concentrations of androgens, induce regulare menstrual pattern, inhibits high sympathetic activity and restore the PCOS induced disturbances.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) - Effect Of Physical Exercise And Electroacupuncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary outcome: Changes in androgen concentrations and menstrual pattern Secondary outcome: changes in sympathetic nerve activity, uterus peristalsis, ovarian morphology, adipose tissue related variables, insulin sensitivity, coagulation factors and health related quality of life and symptoms of anxiety and depression.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To get the diagnosis polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), ultrasonography should reveal at least 1 ovary with PCO according to the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria as well as one of the following two symptoms: 1. Anovulation/oligoovulation defined as â‰¥ 35 days during the last year 2. Clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne) Cardiovascular disease Diabetes mellitus Other endocrine disease (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen producing tumour, Cushing's syndrome) Estrogen/gestagen treatment during the last 3 months Breastfeeding the last 6 months Antiandrogen treatment the last 3 months</criteria>
