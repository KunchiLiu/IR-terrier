	<brief_summary>This 2-arm study assessed the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with capecitabine (Xeloda), compared with capecitabine alone, in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were randomized to receive either bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle) in combination with capecitabine (1000 mg/m^2 orally twice a day on Days 1-14 of each 3-week cycle) or capecitabine (1000 mg/m^2 orally twice a day on Days 1-14 of each 3-week cycle) alone. No notable trends or interactions in laboratory values, electrocardiogram, or vital signs suggesting an effect in either direction for capecitabine/bevacizumab combination therapy or capecitabine monotherapy were observed during the study.</brief_summary>
