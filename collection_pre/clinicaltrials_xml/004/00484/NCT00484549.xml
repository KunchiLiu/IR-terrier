	<brief_summary>Fabry disease is a genetic disease due to an enzymatic deficit. A screening of this disease allows patients to benefit from an enzyme replacement therapy and prevent the occurrence of life threatening manifestations such as an ischemic stroke. The purpose of the study is to determinate the prevalence of Fabry disease in a population of male patients hospitalized for an ischemic stroke. This study, with a screening of Fabry disease, allows the patients to make a precise diagnosis of their ischemic stroke and to facilitate the screening of the other members at the facility.</brief_summary>
