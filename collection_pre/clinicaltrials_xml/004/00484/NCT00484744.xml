	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to compare pain control effectiveness of two medicines and a placebo (a dummy pill that does not contain any pain relieving medication) to see which one works better at preventing pain when taken both 1 hour before and 6 hours after orthodontic separators are placed. The research hypothesis is that there will be a significant difference in pain as measured by Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) over time and that this effect will differ for acetaminophen versus ibuprofen.</brief_summary>
