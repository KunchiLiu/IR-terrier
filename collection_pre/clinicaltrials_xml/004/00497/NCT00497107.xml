	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing UFT/LV and UFT/LV + PSK in patients with histological stage IIIa/IIIb colorectal cancer who have undergone curative surgery without residual cancer using 3-year disease free survival (DFS) as the primary endpoint, and also to analyze the 3-year overall survival (OS), compliance, adverse events, quality of life (QOL) and relationship with tumor factors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing chemotherapy using UFT/LV and immunochemotherapy using UFT/LV combined with PSK in patients with histological stage IIIa and IIIb colorectal cancer (adenocarcinoma) who have undergone curative surgery without residual cancer (R0) using 3-year disease-free survival rate as primary endpoint, and also to analyze the 3-year overall survival, compliance, adverse events, QOL and relationship with tumor factors.</detailed_description>
