	<brief_title>The Effect of Chiropractic Manipulation on Spine-related Pain and Balance in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain and risk factors for falls in older adults are significant public health issues. In order to evaluate an appropriate role for chiropractic in managing these problems in the population, this pilot cohort study will take multiple measurements, both self-reported and functional, on a sample of older adults with chronic spine-related pain who are recruited from the local community and receive chiropractic care in the Cleveland Chiropractic College health center over a four-week period.</detailed_description>
