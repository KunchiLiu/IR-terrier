	<detailed_description>Some studies valued the effectiveness of botulinum toxin. There is a great amount of controversy on the amount of botulinum toxin injected and the location of the injection. The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection with placebo at a new injection site at the forearm in the treatment of chronic tennis elbow unrelieved by corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy. It is a double blind randomized controlled trial.</detailed_description>
