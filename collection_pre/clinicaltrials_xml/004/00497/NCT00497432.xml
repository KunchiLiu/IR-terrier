	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether hyperbaric oxygen treatment improves neurological function in patients who exhibit white matter hyperintensities on MRI examination. The secondary goal of this study is to determine if it is possible using MRI to discern a difference in perfusion of central nervous system tissue in regions of white matter hyperintensities after hyperbaric oxygen administration as compared to hyperbaric air.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment in Patients With White Matter Hyperintensities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutively enrolled patients will be assigned to hyperbaric oxygen or hyperbaric air by random number. Physicians supervising the hyperbaric treatments and the treating technicians, the evaluating neurologist, and the interpreter of the MRIs will be blinded regarding patient treatment status. All patients who receive placebo will be offered treatment with hyperbaric oxygen.</detailed_description>
