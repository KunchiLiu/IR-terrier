	<brief_summary>An accelerometer with transmitting ability is worn on the wrist. Data of movements during seizures will be analyzed to upgrade algorithm that will identify seizures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Algorithm for Epilepsy Alert Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing Video-EEG telemetry will wear movement sensor on their wrist. The sensor will transmit continuous data to a laptop. Seizures' data (tonic or clonic) will be analyzed and transformed into an algorithm (up-graded existing preliminary algorithm). In the second phase the algorithm will need to identify seizure events within one minute of the onset. Both specificity ("false positive") and sensitivity ("false negative) will be than calculated.</detailed_description>
