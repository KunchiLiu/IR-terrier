	<detailed_description>Reperfusion delay in STEMI has been shown to be excessive in our community. Admission in emergency room and waiting for transfer to catheterization laboratory seems to be the principal source of delay. In order to improve delays a fast track (direct transfer in catheterization laboratory) has been implemented for patients being diagnosed with STEMI by emergency physician out of hospital. The present study aims at evaluating the benefits of this procedure.</detailed_description>
