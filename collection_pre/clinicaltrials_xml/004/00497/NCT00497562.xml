	<brief_summary>There are evidences of functional growth hormone (GH) deficiency, expressed by means of low serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), in a subset of fibromyalgia patients. The efficacy of low GH doses versus placebo has been demonstrated in this population. We assessed the efficacy and safety of GH added to standard therapy compared to standard therapy alone in the treatment of severe, prolonged and well-treated fibromialgya patients with low IGF-1 levels.</brief_summary>

All patients fulfilled the 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria (1) and had an IGF1 level &lt;250 ng/mL (or 1 standard deviation bellow the mean value corresponding to age and body surface according to laboratory reference value). Other inclusion criteria were duration of fibromyalgia of 1 year or greater, pain in at least 16 (8 bilateral) of the 18 tender points and a score in the FIQ &gt; 75.
