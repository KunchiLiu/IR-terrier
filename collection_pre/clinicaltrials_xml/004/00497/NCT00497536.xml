	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to compare SSPIAsp during CSII giving one bolus per hour compared with multiple boluses per hour. The secondary objective is to compare SSPIAsp during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) versus continuous intravenous insulin infusion (CIII).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rapid acting insulin, like insulin aspart, can be administered as CSII. The insulin can be administered as a basal rate with additional insulin administration from the pump related to mealtimes. Insulin is physiologically secreted in a pulsate manner from the pancreatic β-cells with a period of 5-10 minutes, and this is responsible for plasma insulin oscillations with similar frequency. The oscillatory pattern is believed to optimize control mechanisms of insulin to enhance its action on metabolism.</detailed_description>
