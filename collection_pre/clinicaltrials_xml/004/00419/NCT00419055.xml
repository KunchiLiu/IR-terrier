	<brief_summary>To determine the safety and feasibility of same day discharge after elective coronary percutaneous intervention in a selected stable patient population. The hypothesis to be tested is that in an appropriately selected stable coronary artery disease population post percutaneous coronary intervention, early discharge is safe and feasible.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outpatient Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A select stable population of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention are randomized to standard of care in-hospital stay for one night or early discharge to a nearby hotel. During PCI, patients receive bivalirudin as their anti-coagulant and also must be eligible for an angioseal closure device. Patients that stay overnight in the hotel must be accompanied by a family member. They return to the cath lab the next day for groin check and blood work. Satisfaction questionnaires are filled out by all patients.</detailed_description>
