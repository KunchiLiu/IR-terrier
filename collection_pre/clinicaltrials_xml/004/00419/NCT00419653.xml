	<brief_summary>The study aims to investigate the modulation of regional brain activation in schizophrenic patients by psychopharmacological treatment with either haloperidol, amisulpride or olanzapine. The study will be performed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modulation of Regional Brain Activation in Schizophrenic Patients by Pharmacological Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study aims to investigate the following issues: - Changes in cognitive activation patterns under therapy with the typical neuroleptic haloperidol as compared to the atypical antipsychotics amisulpride and olanzapine - Relationship of these changes in activity to psychopathological, neuropsychological and pharmacotherapeutic variables (e.g. drug plasma level) as well as to certain biological markers (HVA, prolactin) - Relationship between diffusion anisotropy as an indicator for structural connectivity and cognitive activation patterns under antipsychotic treatment</detailed_description>
