	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a very common disorder that is characterized by pruritic inflammatory skin lesions, with patients usually having an individual or family history of atopic diseases in their background. Phototherapy is among the first-line approaches in the management of AD. In this context, a variety of studies have shown a beneficial effect of natural or artificial UV radiation in atopic dermatitis (AD). The past ten years have seen the introduction of new phototherapeutic regimens for AD, including UVA1 and NB-UVB.UVA1 seems to be more effective than the above mentioned broadband spectra, in particular in acute severe AD. The aim of the present study is the comparison of UVA1 and NB-UVB phototherapy in the treatment of AD. Additionally, the course of several cytokines, human beta-defensins, and SMAD-proteins will be evaluated during the course of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medium-Dose UVA1 Versus Narrow-Band UVB in Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a very common disorder that is characterized by pruritic inflammatory skin lesions, with patients usually having an individual or family history of atopic diseases in their background (e.g., allergic asthma and rhinitis). Defective skin barrier, immunological dysfunctions (type I and IV allergy), genetic disorders, and psychological factors contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. However, among these factors, CD4+ Th cells are reported to play a particularly crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. Phototherapy is among the first-line approaches in the management of AD. In this context, a variety of studies have shown a beneficial effect of natural or artificial UV radiation in atopic dermatitis (AD). Different broadband UV spectra (BB-UVA, BB-UVB, BB-UVA/BB-UVB) and combined treatment modalities such as balneophototherapy and PUVA have previously been proven to be effective in AD. However the past ten years have seen the introduction of new phototherapeutic regimens for AD, including UVA1 and NB-UVB.UVA1 seems to be more effective than the above mentioned broadband spectra, in particular in acute severe AD. The aim of the present study is the comparison of UVA1 and NB-UVB phototherapy in the treatment of AD. Additionally, the course of several cytokines, human beta-defensins, and SMAD-proteins will be evaluated during the course of treatment.</detailed_description>
