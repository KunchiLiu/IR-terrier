	<brief_summary>SB-681323 is a p38 MAP-kinase inhibitor that has potential uses in inflammatory conditions such as RA. Previous p38 MAP-kinase inhibitors have been hindered in development by liver toxicity. Methotrexate (common treatment for RA patients) also has potential liver toxicity. This study was an enabling study to determine the safety of co-administration of the two compounds with respect to liver function</brief_summary>
