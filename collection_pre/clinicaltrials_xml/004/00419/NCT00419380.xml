	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate Pulmozyme® (dornase) as compared to a standard ear drop Floxin® (ofloxicin) to dissolve clogged tubes. This study will monitor the use of the new drug for any problems related to the medication. Patients are being asked to be in this study because they had tubes placed for the treatment of chronic ear infection and the tube(s) are now clogged. Clogged tubes are a common problem found in children with tubes. This problem occasionally is improved with ear drops like Floxin®. However, it is frequently not improved even after this standard ear drop treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Clogged Tympanostomy Tubes: An Off-Label Use of Dornase Alfa (Pulmozyme®)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The success in treating blocked tubes may relate to the ability to dissolve the material clogging the tube as well as dealing with the thick fluid in the middle-ear. The reasoning behind this study is that the use of Pulmozyme® may be able to treat both of these problems. Pulmozyme® was approved by the FDA in 1994 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. Infections present in airway (lung) secretions of cystic fibrosis patients and the material that plugs ear tubes are in some ways the same. "Off-label" use of a drug is the practice by physicians to use a FDA-approved drug in treating conditions other than what the original approval was intended for. Pulmozyme® has been used to treat other lung diseases not related to cystic fibrosis. There has been no published report on the use of Pulmozyme® to treat ear infections. This study is a clinical trial that compares two treatments and will last for 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>subjects from age 1 to 18 years who have undergone tube placement in the previous 9 months. subjects with middleear fluid on entry into the study will be required to have had a prior normal hearing test. subjects with symptoms of an acute otitis media (otalgia or otorrhea), sensorineural hearing loss,craniofacial syndromes, cystic fibrosis, prior ear surgery except tube placement, sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and presence of granulation tissue in the lumen of the tympanostomy tubes will be excluded.</criteria>
