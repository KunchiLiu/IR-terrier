	<brief_summary>Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, it has been reported that a hair from an individual with breast cancer exhibits a difference in its molecular structure compared to that of an individual without breast cancer. This difference is visible in the X-ray diffraction pattern as a ring superimposed on the pattern for normal hair. The hypothesis of this study is that synchrotron x-ray diffraction can be used to differentiate hairs from women with medically diagnosed breast cancer from women not known to have the disease. To test this hypothesis, hair from 2000 women attending radiology clinics for mammography will be collected, analysed by x-ray diffraction and then analysed using Fermiscan proprietary image analysis software. The mammogram status of the subjects will be blinded from the diffraction analysts. Results will then be compared with mammography results to allow a direct comparison between the Fermiscan test and mammography in terms of specificity and sensitivity.</brief_summary>
