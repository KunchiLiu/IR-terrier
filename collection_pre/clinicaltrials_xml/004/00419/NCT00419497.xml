	<brief_title>Paleolithic Diet in the Treatment of Glucose Intolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is uncertainty about the optimal diet in the prevention and treatment of glucose intolerance and diabetes type 2, disorders which are very common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Earlier studies have generally focused on intakes of fat, carbohydrate, fiber, fruit and vegetables. Another approach compares foods that were available during human evolution with more recently introduced ones. Twenty-nine CHD patients with glucose intolerance or diabetes have been randomized to 1) a Paleolithic ("Old Stone Age") diet (n=14) based on lean meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, root vegetables, eggs, and nuts, or 2) a Consensus (Mediterranean-like) diet (n=15) based on whole grains, low-fat dairy products, vegetables, fruit, fish, and oils and margarines generally assumed to be healthy. Primary outcome variables are changes during 12 weeks in weight, waist circumference, and area under the curve for glucose (AUC Glucose0-120) and insulin (AUC Insulin0-120) at the oral glucose tolerance test.</detailed_description>
