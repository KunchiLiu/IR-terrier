	<brief_summary>The proposed study is designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (as measured by serum cortisol) and safety of GW685698X in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and in healthy subjects following a single oral inhaled dose of GW685698X. From the study results it should be possible to assess if there is an altered Risk: Benefit in patients with moderate hepatic impairment</brief_summary>
