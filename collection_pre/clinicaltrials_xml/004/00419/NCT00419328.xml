	<brief_summary>The main objective of the trial is to explore the safety and biological activity of NGR-hTNF. The safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment. The biological activity will be evaluated by DCE-MRI with contrast media.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Modified Phase I Study of NGR-hTNF in Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a modified phase I Single arm, open, non randomized trial of NGR-hTNF in advanced solid tumors for the definition of an optimal biological</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients &gt;18 years old with proven advanced solid tumors not amenable to any clinical improvement by current standard treatments. Tumors recognized to be highly vascularized (e.g. renal, colon thyroid and head and neck cancers), will be included. ECOG Performance status 0 2 Patients may have had prior therapy providing the following conditions are met: Chemo, radio, hormonal or immunotherapy: washout period of 28 days Surgery: washout period of 14 days Adequate baseline bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, defined as follows: Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN AST and/or ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN in absence of liver metastases AST and/or ALT &lt; 5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN Absence of any conditions in which hypervolemia and its consequences (e.g. increased stroke volume, elevated blood pressure) or haemodilution could represent a risk for the patient (reference appendix "Technical data sheet human albumin") Normal cardiac function and absence of uncontrolled hypertension Patients must give written informed consent to participate in the study Concurrent anticancer therapy Patients may not receive any other investigational agents while on study Clinical signs of CNS involvement Patients with active or uncontrolled systemic disease/infections or with serious illness or medical conditions, which is incompatible with the protocol Known hypersensitivity/allergic reaction to human albumin preparations or to any of the excipients Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol Pregnancy or lactation. Patients both males and females with reproductive potential (i.e. menopausal for less than 1year and not surgically sterilized) must practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior to registration.</criteria>
