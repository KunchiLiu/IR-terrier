	<brief_summary>We previously demonstrated that postconditioning by coronary angioplasty can decrease infarct size (as measured by cardiac enzyme release) in patients with ongoing acute myocardial infarction. It is currently unknown whether postconditioning actually decreases or simply delays myocardial cell death during reperfusion. In addition, the long term effects of postconditioning on recovery of myocardial contraction remains elusive. The objective of the present study is to determine whether infarct size reduction by angioplasty postconditioning is maintained at 6 months and whether functional recovery is improved at one year post-infarction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes of Angioplasty Postconditioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial comparing postconditioning to control (no intervention). Postconditioning consists of four episodes of one minute inflation followed by one minute deflation of the angioplasty balloon, starting within one minute of reflow after direct stenting of the occluded coronary artery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female patients, aged more than 18, with suspected first acute myocardial infarction, within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain, with a need for emergency revascularization by angioplasty. Patients must display a fully occluded (TIMI zero flow) culprit coronary artery, absence of visible collaterals and exhibit TIMI flow &gt;2 after direct stenting by angioplasty. Cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery</criteria>
