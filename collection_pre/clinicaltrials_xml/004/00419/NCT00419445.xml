Regular use of nicotine products (including 90 days before Screening), including smoking, transdermal patch, chewing tobacco, etc. (verified via salivary cotinine levels at Screening). Current use of any prohibited medication or other medications, including herbal supplements, that have central nervous system (CNS) effects or affect cognitive performance, such as sedating antihistamines and decongestant sympathomimetics (bronchodilators were permitted).
