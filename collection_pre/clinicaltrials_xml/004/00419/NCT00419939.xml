	<brief_title>Intensive Rehabilitation of Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury - Development of a Didactic Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Annually, about 7500 people get a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Denmark. According to Danish and international experiences 250 of these get severe injuries. About 120 younger people often males need highly specialised neuro-rehabilitation at one of the two regional centres in Denmark. Due to the limited amount of research in this field it cannot be documented but assumed, that the patient's motivation and involvement in planning and implementation of rehabilitation improve subjective and objective outcome. Motivation, involvement and learning in patients with severe traumatic brain injury constitute a major challenge. The cases are individual, but often involve disturbances in language and perception, lack of realization, reduced initiative, tiredness and depression. The focus of this project is the intensive physical and psychosocial rehabilitation viewed as a process of relearning targeted daily life competences using the ICF levels of function, activity and participation.</detailed_description>
