	<brief_summary>In HIV infected patients, individuals exposed to the virus of Hepatitis B are more susceptible to develop a chronic and severe liver disease with a major risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. However, the existing protocol of vaccination against Hepatitis B is less efficient in HIV-infected patients than in non HIV-infected-patients, and, in case of response, its longevity has to be followed up carefully. This study compares the efficacy of the standard protocol vaccination with GenHevac-B and 2 other protocols, a double-dose of GenHevac-B and a set of intradermal injections of Genhevac-B, in HIV-infected patients with lymphocytes T CD4 level above 200 permm3.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Three Strategies of Vaccination Against the Virus of Hepatitis B in HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparison of 3 vaccination strategy against Hepatitis B in patients with HIV infection T CD4 above 200 per mm3 Intervention: 1. Arm A: GenHevac-B 20 microgramme Intramuscular use at M0, M1, M6 2. Arm B: GenHevac-B 40 microgramme Intramuscular use at M0, M1, M2, M6 3. Arm C: GenHevac-B 4 microgramme Intradermal use at M0, M1, M2, M6</detailed_description>
