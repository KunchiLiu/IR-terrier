	<brief_summary>This is a single dose, open-label, 2-panel (Parts A and B) PET study investigating the degree of occupancy of dopamine 2 receptors (D2_RO) in the human brain after single oral doses of BL-1020 or Perphenazine (Trilafon®, hereafter called Perphenazine) in healthy male subjects. In Part A the D2_RO is investigated for the study compound BL-1020 and in Part B the D2_RO of BL-1020 is compared to the D2_RO of Perphenazine, a reference compound.</brief_summary>

Any relevant history of chronic or recurrent metabolic (e.g., diabetes), renal, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, chronic gastritis or peptic ulcers), neurological (especially history of seizures disorders), endocrinological, immunological, psychiatric or cardiovascular disease, myopathies and bleeding tendency. 6. Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antiHepatitis C Virus (HCV) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). 7. CYP2D6 genotype poor metabolizer. 8. Relevant drug hypersensitivity, asthma, urticaria or other severe allergic diathesis as well as ongoing hay fever. 9. Febrile or infectious illness within 7 days prior to the dosing day. 10. Participation in an investigational drug study within 3 months prior to the dosing day. 11. Donation of blood within 3 months prior to the dosing day. 12. History of alcoholism or more than moderate alcohol consumption (&gt; 3 units of ethanol regularly per day or &gt; 21 units regularly per week). 13. Consumption of alcohol within 48 hours prior to dose administration and/or positive alcohol breath test. 14.
