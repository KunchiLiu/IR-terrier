	<brief_title>Effects of InFat™ Product on Stool Biochemistry and Stool Characteristics in Formula-fed Term Chinese Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In human breast milk, and in most infant formulas more than 98% of this milk fat is in the form of triglycerides, which contain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids esterified to glycerol. Fatty acids in human milk-fat have a highly specific positional distribution on the glycerol backbone and this specific configuration is known to have a major contribution to the efficacy of this nutrient absorption. Palmitic acid (C16:0), the major saturated fatty acid, is predominantly esterified to the sn-2 (β) position of the triglyceride in human milk. In contrast, palmitic acid in standard infant formulas is esterified to the sn-1 and sn-3 positions. Infants fed with high sn-2 palmitic acid formula had softer stools, less constipation and better calcium absorption as compared to standard infant formula. InFat™ is structured triglyceride fat ingredient with high levels of palmitic acid at sn-2 position. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that feeding Chinese term infants, with formula having proportion of palmitate in the sn-2 position comparable to human milk, reduces calcium-soaps formation.</detailed_description>
