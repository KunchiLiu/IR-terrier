	<brief_summary>This research study was designed to test the safety and effectiveness of autologous stem cell graft in the myocardium of patients with refractory Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) with ischemic etiology. Cellular implantation will take place during off-pump revascularization surgery or during an ad hoc procedure using a mini-thoracotomy access.</brief_summary>
