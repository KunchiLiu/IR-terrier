	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis: Patients with local renal cell carcinoma who are treated neoadjuvantly with Sutent may show a radiologic response to the study drug (Sutent). The study is looking at the neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) administration of Sutent in patients with localized kidney cancer. The purpose of this research is also to evaluate both the safety and effectiveness of Sutent in this patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Neoadjuvant Sutent for Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sutent will be given at 50 mg once daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 1 week rest period. The dosage may change during the cycle due to possible drug toxicities. The nephrectomy will then take place following a one-week washout period. After surgery, patients will have follow-up visits at 6 weeks and 3 months. Patients will be followed for 3 years after completions to assess late toxicities, time to progression and progression-free survival.</detailed_description>
