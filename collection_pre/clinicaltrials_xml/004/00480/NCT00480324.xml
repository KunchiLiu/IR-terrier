Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. Born between a gestation period of 36 and 42 weeks inclusive. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the HRV vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of HRV vaccine, or planned use during the study period. History of use of experimental rotavirus vaccine. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Uncorrected congenital malformation (such as Meckel's diverticulum) of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for intussusception. Any clinically significant history of chronic gastrointestinal disease including any uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract or other serious medical condition determined by the investigator. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Previous confirmed occurrence of RV GE. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing is required). A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Gastroenteritis within 7 days preceding the study vaccine administration. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period.</criteria>
