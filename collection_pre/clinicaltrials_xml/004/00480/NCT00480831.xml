	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, Phase II, placebo-controlled trial adding on to a background of effective treatment designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of PRO95780 combined with paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab therapy in patients with previously untreated Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 120 patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms.</brief_summary>
