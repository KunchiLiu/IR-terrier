	<brief_summary>Development of an active second-line treatment option for metastatic breast cancer patients previously pre-treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant, adjuvant or palliative settings. For each randomisation arm, 47 patients will be included. The trial was performed as a 2-stage phase II study according to the optimal design by Simon with overall response rate as the primary objective. Study Design: Arm A Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 d1, 8; Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 d1, 8 q 3 weeks Arm B Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 d1, 8; Cisplain 30 mg/m2 d1, 8 q 3 weeks Arm C Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 d1, 8; Capecitabine 1650 mg/m2 oral d1-14 q 3 weeks</brief_summary>
