	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Laparoscopic Nissen Against Anterior Partial Fundoplication in Treating Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Among Chinese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is rising among Asian population. A recent systematic review showed among Chinese population, the prevalence of GERD can be up to 5% (2). Currently, the standard treatment for GERD is acid suppression using proton pump inhibitors (PPI) which can achieve a symptomatic relief of more than 90%. However, more than 50% of patients with GERD will required long term PPI. As the usual occurrence of GERD is at the age of 40 to 50, the need of long term PPI among these young adults renders them playing a sick role for a long period of time. This imposed a major impact on these patients’ quality of life, and a significant medical expenditure to the society. Since Rudolf Nissen first reported the use of fundoplication as a treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease in 1956, there has been a development in variety of different fundoplication. It can be classified into a complete or partial wrapping at the lower esophageal sphincter around the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ). From the results of numerous randomized studies, Fundoplication is considered as an alternative to long term proton pump inhibitors. Recent controversies abound upon the use of partial or complete fundoplication. Several randomized studies reported that a partial fundoplication can reduce the incidence of post-operative dysphagia. However, this benefit is off-set by an increase in the incidence of recurrence. From our retrospective review on 28 patients treated by laparoscopic fundoplication, the recurrence of GERD is significantly higher in patients treated with partial compared to a complete fundoplication. The effectiveness of partial against complete Nissen fundoplication in control of reflux among Chinese patients is still unknown. Our study aimed to compare Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication against Anterior partial on the control of gastroesophageal reflux disease.</detailed_description>
