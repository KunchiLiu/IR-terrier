	<brief_title>Determining Optimal Halo Pin Management Practises to Decrease Pin Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Halo Thoracic Orthoses (Halos) are used to immobilise unstable cervical fractures. The halo grips the skull via 4 pins. Pin loosening is a major complication of halo wear. Pin loosening is painful and can result in loss of control of the fractures. Treatment is required urgently and involves re-siting the pin. Comparisons: This study will compare two pin management practises with the aim to determine which is optimal to reduce the incidence of complications including pin loosening. Patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups. The control group will receive treatment in accordance with current practise at The Alfred, the pins will not be re-tensioned throughout the treatment period. The alternative treatment group will have their pins re-tensioned fortnightly.</detailed_description>
