	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Early intensive treatment with anti-TNF agent plus methotrexate plus high dose prednisone may increase remission rate and may induce stable remission in Rheumatoid Arthritis Objective: to evaluate induction of remission using adalimumab, prednisone and methotrexate and maintenance of remission after discontinuation of adalimumab and prednisone</brief_summary>
