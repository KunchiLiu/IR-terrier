	<brief_summary>HIV infection is a growing problem in Israel with over 4000 known patients who are either infected with the virus or have developed AIDS. Patients are usually followed for years until they develop an increase in their viral load (HIV-1 RNA) or their CD4 + cells decline. At this point, patients are usually treated with Highly Active, Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART). The mainstay of response to such treatment is the lowering of viral load and increase in CD4+ cells. Food supplements for HIV patients have been given in several studies, with controversial results. A meta-analysis published recently [1] assessed whether micronutrient supplements are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in adults and children with HIV infection. They recommended supporting the current WHO recommendations to promote and support adequate dietary intake of micronutrients wherever possible. We expect to enroll 140 subjects in this randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Seventy subjects will be enrolled in the rice-supplement arm and 70 subjects in the control group, which will receive supplemental, flavored dextrose to their current medical treatment. The treatment duration is 24 weeks with follow-up at 36 weeks from enrollment. The target population is HIV-1 infected individuals who may be either on anti-retroviral therapy or not on therapy. Subjects must be with either CD4+ cells are &lt;500 cells/mm3, or HIV plasma RNA level is &gt; 5000 copies/ml. The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of food supplementation versus a flavored-dextrose supplement with respect to increment of patient CD4+ cell count from baseline at 24 weeks, or virological response defined as lowering of plasma HIV-1 RNA and immunologic response.</brief_summary>
