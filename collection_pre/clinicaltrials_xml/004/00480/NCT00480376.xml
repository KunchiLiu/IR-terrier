	<brief_summary>Prostate biopsy is usually conducted transrectal, ultrasonography guided. Since the area is not sterile, infection can be induced during the procedure. Prophylaxis antibiotic against gram-negative bacteria decreased significantly the amount of infections. Quinolones are considered preferred treatment but there is already an increase in resistance rates. TMP-SMX can not be used empirically due to a high percent of resistant uropathogens. One of the options is aminoglycosides, especially gentamicin. Advantages: very low resistance rate in the community, high concentration is urinary tract, slow clearance, no resistance developed under treatment, chip and with very few side effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate biopsy is usually conducted as an ambulatory transrectal needle aspiration, ultrasonography guided. The area is not sterile, with high concentration of gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens, infection can be induced during the procedure to the urinary tract, and even cause bacteremia. Prior studies concluded that prophylaxis antibiotic against gram-negative bacteria decreased significantly the amount of infections and hence it is accepted to give prophylaxis antibiotics which will cover especially gram-negative bacteria. Other studies show decrease in infections percent in patients that received prophylaxis opposed to those who did not, from 5-30% to less than 1%. Yet, there was no significant difference between those who received one dose and those who were treated for 3-5 days. Quinolones are considered preferred treatment since they can be given orally, but there is already an increase in resistance rates. TMP-SMX can not be used empirically due to a high percent of resistant uropathogens. One of the options is aminoglycosides, especially gentamicin. Advantages: very low resistance rate in the community, high concentration is urinary tract, slow clearance, no resistance developed under treatment, chip and with very few side effects.</detailed_description>
