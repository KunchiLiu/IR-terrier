	<brief_summary>Background: Cutaneous Leishmaniasis is a worldwide disease, endemic in over 88 countries, that has shown an increasing incidence over the last many decades. For the last 60 years antimony compounds are considered the treatment of choice. Though their use is expensive, cumbersome, has many adverse effects and not effective in all patients, the search for a better alternative is still going on. Low dose antimony compounds in combination with several agents have shown promise of reducing adverse effects of antimony compounds without compromising efficacy. Allopurinol is one such agent which though promising lacks randomized, controlled trials to prove efficacy. The main objective of this study is to evaluate low dose sodium stibogluconate in combination with allopurinol and to compare it with high dose sodium stibogluconate in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. Methods and design: A multi-center randomized, controlled trial including 620 patients from endemic areas for Leishmaniasis in Pakistan will be undertaken to assess the research question. Parasitologically confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis will be included in the study. After evaluating the inclusion/exclusion criteria patients will be randomized to receive either meglumine antimoniate (20 mg/kg/day/intramuscular, till clinical resolution or a maximum of 28 days) or combination of meglumine antimoniate (10 mg/kg/day intramuscular) and allopurinol (20 mg/kg/day/oral) till clinical resolution or a maximum of 28 days. During treatment patients will be admitted to hospital and monitored daily for the presence of adverse effects. Follow up period will last six months during which patients will visits the research centers for assessment of healing process at monthly intervals.</brief_summary>
