	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate when Revlimid and Dexamethasone treatment extend the time to progression to symptomatic MM in patients with smoldering MM. The second one is to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment in response rate terms. Otherwise this study wants to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>QUIREDEX: Revlimid (Lenalidomide) and Dexamethasone (ReDex) Treatment Versus Observation in Patients With Smoldering Multiple Myeloma With High Risk of Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of up to 120 patients diagnosed of smoldering Multiple Myeloma with high risk of progression to symptomatic MM will be included. Patients will be stratified according its diagnosis date and randomized 1 to 1 to receive Revlimid and Dexamethasone (Group A) in 9 treatment cycles and maintenance with lower doses until progression or No treatment and observation until progression (Group B). The patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to three study periods: Pre-treatment, Treatment and Follow up. The Pre-treatment includes Screening and baseline visits. After providing informed consent, patients will be evaluated for study eligibility and then Patients will be stratified and randomized (1:1) to Group A or Group B. During Treatment Period patients will be evaluated once a month. Once the treatment period has finished a maintenance treatment with low doses of Revlimid and Dexamethasone will be carry out in Group A. During this period we will evaluate response, progression-free survival and global survival every two months.</detailed_description>
