	<brief_summary>There has been a recent increase in incidence of obesity and its associated morbidities, including T2 DM, hypertension and hepatic steatosis. Hepatic steatosis is a precursor to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. The 1st reported case of pediatric hepatic steatosis was in 1980 and it is now affects 30-77% of overweight children. In addition to its association with obesity, hepatic steatosis has been associated with the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and post-prandial hyperglycemia. Current treatment of hepatic steatosis includes weight loss with a hypocaloric low fat diet. Given the association with insulin resistance and post-prandial hyperglycemia, adult patients with hepatic steatosis that does not respond to weight loss are placed on insulin sensitizing drugs. We hypothesize that weight loss with a diet designed to decrease insulin resistance and post-prandial hyperglycemia, a low glycemic load diet, will provide a safe and effective way to decrease hepatic fat content in the pediatric population. This hypothesis will be tested with a randomized control trial comparing the effect of a low fat diet with a low glycemic load diet.</brief_summary>
