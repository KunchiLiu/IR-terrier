	<brief_summary>The Pfizer developed Heat Wash-Out (HWO) system is a software controlled electromechanical system designed to measure vaginal wall blood flow. A small vaginal probe is attached to a control unit. Output data is collected on a PC. By measuring the clearance of heat from the heated probe, a direct measure of absolute blood flow can be obtained. The study will assess changes in vaginal blood flow across the menstrual cycle following visual sexual stimulation.</brief_summary>
