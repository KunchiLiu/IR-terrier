	<brief_summary>The Pfizer developed Heat Wash-Out (HWO) system is a software controlled electromechanical system designed to measure vaginal wall blood flow. A small vaginal probe is attached to a control unit. Output data are collected on a PC. By measuring the clearance of heat from the heated probe, a direct measure of absolute blood flow can be obtained. The study will assess the technique's ability to differentiate between pre- and post-menopausal women; with and without Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD).</brief_summary>
