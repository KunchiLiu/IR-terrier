	<brief_summary>Severe pre-amputation pain is associated with phantom pain development, and phantom pain models assign major importance to central and peripheral nervous system changes related to pre-amputation pain. Several interventions have been evaluated for phantom pain prevention, including continuous brachial plexus blockade5, intravenous6 or epidural ketamine administration, postoperative perineural ketamine/clonidine infusion8 and oral gabapentin9, but their true effect remains unclear.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimized Perioperative Analgesia Reduces the Prevalence and the Intensity of Phantom Pain in Lower Limb Amputation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 65 patients undergoing elective lower limb amputation were assigned to one of five analgesic regimens. Patients in groups 1-4 had lumbar epidural catheter placed 48 hours before amputation, and received epidural bupivacaine/fentanyl or saline infusion before and/or after amputation. Patients receiving epidural saline also had IV Fentanyl Patient-Control Analgesia, whereas patients receiving epidural analgesia also had IV saline. Group 5 (control) received IM meperidine and oral codeine/acetaminophen. VAS and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) scores (for ischemic, phantom and stump pain) were recorded starting 48 hours before, continuing until 48 hours after amputation, and at 4 days, 10 days, 1 and 6 months after amputation. Phantom and stump pain intensity and frequency were the main study endpoints.</detailed_description>
