	<brief_title>Newborn Ventilation in the Delivery Room: Could it be Improved With a T-piece Resuscitator?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: A multicenter cross-over cluster randomized controlled trial. Our hypothesis is based on the assumption that ventilating depressed newborns with a T-piece resuscitator will be more effective than SIB by increasing the proportion of resuscitated newborns with heart rate (HR) ≥ 100 beats per minute (bpm) at two minutes of life as a proxy for successful resuscitation. Population: Newborn infants ≥ 26 weeks gestational age requiring assisted ventilation (PPV) for resuscitation in the delivery room. (need for assisted ventilation at positive pressure: Heart Rate [HR] &lt; 100 beats per minute [bpm], apnea, gasping, cyanosis and/or hypotonia) Intervention: PPV will be performed with a T-piece resuscitator (Neopuff® group) with positive end expiratory pressure. Control: PPV will be performed with a self inflating bag (SIB group) with and without PEEP. Both devices will be used with face masks, and a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 25 cm H2O will be used to begin ventilation with PEEP of 0 cm H2O in the subgroup without PEEP valve, 5 cm H2O in the subgroup with PEEP valve in the SIB group, and 5 cm H2O in the Neopuff® group. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of both instruments in reaching a heart rate of ≥ 100 bpm in depressed newborns of ≥ 26 weeks' gestational age (GA) after the initiation of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with face mask. Primary Outcome: Proportion of newborns with HR ≥ 100 bpm at 2 minutes of life. Type of Comparison: Which of the two devices Neopuff TM or Self Inflating Bag (NP/SIB)will be more effective for ventilation of the newborn, by increasing the proportion of resuscitated newborns with heart rate (HR) ≥ 100 beats per minute (bpm) at two minutes of life as a proxy for successful resuscitation.</detailed_description>
