	<brief_summary>The protein polymorphism of the growth hormone receptor characterized by the genomic deletion of exon 3 has been linked to the magnitude of the first-year-growth response to growth hormone (GH) in girls with Turner syndrome. Objective: to study the long-term effect of GH therapy in Turner syndrome in correlation to this GHR polymorphism in a mainly retrospective design (chart-review).</brief_summary>
