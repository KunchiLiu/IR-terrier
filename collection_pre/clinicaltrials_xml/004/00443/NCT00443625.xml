	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study of SK3530 to Investigate of the Effect of Food</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PDE5 inhibitor, SK3530, is expected to be taken concomitantly with food. The food interaction studies of other PDE5 inhibitors (Viagra, Levitra and cialis) have already accomplished and the results have provided useful information to the patients. The objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of SK3530 and its metabolite (SK3541) under the fasted and fed (low-fat meal and high-fat meal) conditions.</detailed_description>
