	<brief_summary>In this study, two experimental malaria vaccines (with adjuvants) are tested to evaluate and characterise how the vaccine exactly works on the immune system by comparing it to a control (without adjuvant). The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 18 and 45 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Have clinically normal laboratory values for creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), complete blood count (CBC) and differential at screening. Be seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus1 and 2 (HIV 1/2) antibodies, HBsAg and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies. Have anti HBs titre â‰¥ 10mIU/ml at screening. If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose. Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days of the first dose of vaccine. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Any history of clinical malaria. Known exposure to malaria parasites within the previous 12 months. Planned travel to a malaria endemic region during the study period. History of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to previous immunizations. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Personal history of autoimmune disease or subjects who describe a firstdegree relative with clearly documented autoimmune disease. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness(es). Acute disease at the time of enrolment. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. History of previous exposure to experimental products containing any component of the vaccines used in this study. Pregnant or lactating female. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.</criteria>
