	<brief_summary>It involves delivering a train of magnetic pulses, 5 at each time, to the brain. In the present study, we are using the same method to treat severe pain due to nerve conditions. You will be given up to 1000 pulses in total over the spine in the lower back (Spinal Magnetic Stimulation or SMS). Each train will be given in 10-second intervals. You will have SMS on a single day. You will be given SMS pulses at 1 or 10 per second. No stimulation will be given over the head. You will be assessed before and after the study for up to 1 week. Your usual medical treatment will be continued</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>You must be aware of that this is a placebo-controlled trial. This means that you may either receive real SMS or sham SMS. The latter involves a harmless process of ineffective stimulation, designed for comparison with real SMS. Whether you receive either form of treatment will be assigned randomly, and there will be a 50% chance of being assigned to either.</detailed_description>
