	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, open-label study of a total of approximately 560 subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Enrollment in the study was conducted in two stages. In Stage I of the study, approximately 400 subjects receiving non-biological DMARDs (with the exception of methotrexate [MTX] monotherapy or MTX and leflunomide combination therapy) were enrolled. In Stage II of the study, approximately 160 subjects receiving a Federal Drug Administration-approved biological DMARD at the time of screening were enrolled.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (Stage I): Male or female subjects, between 18 and 80 years of age, who have a documented diagnosis of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for ≥ 6 months Receiving treatment for RA on an outpatient basis Have had an inadequate response to at least one nonbiological diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and have been receiving this DMARD(s) for ≥ 12 weeks prior to baseline, with stable dose greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to baseline Demonstrated tolerability to currently prescribed DMARDs If taking a background corticosteroid, use of the corticosteroid must be at a stable dose during the 4 weeks prior to the first day of treatment with rituximab (Day 1) Use of one nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is permitted if the dose is stable for ≥ 2 weeks prior to Day 1 Exclusion Criteria (Stage I): Rheumatic autoimmune disease other than RA or significant systemic involvement secondary to RA (including but not limited to vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or Felty's syndrome) Functional Class IV as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Classification of Functional Status in Rheumatoid Arthritis History of or current inflammatory joint disease other than RA or other systemic autoimmune disorder Diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or juvenile RA, and/or RA before age 16 years Any surgical procedure, including bone/joint surgery/synovectomy (including joint fusion or replacement) within 12 weeks prior to baseline or planned within 24 weeks of enrollment Lack of peripheral venous access Significant cardiac or pulmonary disease (including obstructive pulmonary disease) Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease such as, but not limited to, nervous system, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal disorders that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude subject participation Primary or secondary immunodeficiency (history of or currently active), including known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Known active infection of any kind (excluding fungal infections of nail beds), or any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 4 weeks of baseline or completion of oral antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to baseline History of medically significant opportunistic infection History of serious recurrent or chronic infection History of deep space/tissue infection within 52 weeks prior to baseline History of cancer, including solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and carcinoma in situ (except basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that have been excised and cured) History of significant cytopenias or other bone marrow disorders History of alcohol, drug, or chemical abuse within 24 weeks prior to baseline Pregnancy or lactation Neuropathies and neurovasculopathies that might interfere with pain evaluation Methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy at the time of screening Concurrent treatment with MTX and leflunomide in combination Concurrent treatment with any biologic agent Prior to Day 1, subjects will be discontinued from all DMARDs/combinations that are prohibited in the protocol History of a severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to a biologic agent, or known hypersensitivity to any component of rituximab or to murine proteins Previous treatment with an antiα4 integrin agent Previous treatment with any celldepleting therapies, including investigational agents Receipt of any vaccine within 28 days prior to baseline Intolerance or contraindications to IV corticosteroids Receipt of IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) or Prosorba&lt;TM&gt;
