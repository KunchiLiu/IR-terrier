	<brief_summary>STUDY TITLE A randomized double-blind controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of the POLYCAP速 versus its components in subjects aged 45 to 80 years of age with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. STUDY OBJECTIVES This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the POLYCAP速, a fixed dose combinationcontaining 5 drugs (an antiplatelet drug; 3 blood pressure lowering agents, a beta blocker, an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic and a statin. STUDY DESIGN Randomized controlled double-blind trial of the POLYCAP速 versus its components in eight formulations. STUDY POPULATION Subjects between 45 and 80 years of age, with at least one additional CVD risk factor. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS Composition POLYCAP速 and its comparators FOLLOW UP The total duration of follow up will be 4 months, from the start of study medication.. Subjects will take study medication for 3 months. There will be a final follow up visit 1 month after stopping the study medication. There will be five follow up visits, the first 7 - 10 days after starting study medication and thereafter monthly visits for 4 months. Subjects taking any of the study medications prior to enrolment will have one or more additional visits during a defined wash out and before enrolment. OUTCOME MEASURES Mean difference of change in BP, LDL and urinary thromboxane at the end of the three month period. STATISTICAL ISSUES Non-inferiority evaluation of the POLYCAP in modifying BP, lipids and platelet activity [as measured by urinary thromboxane] when compared with its different components in eight different formulations.</brief_summary>
