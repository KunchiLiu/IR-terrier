	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Measuring changes in glucose metabolism in patients with cancer may help doctors predict how patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying glucose metabolism in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with targeted therapy and chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glucose Metabolism in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Targeted Therapy and Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the prognostic significance of changes in glucose metabolism measured by fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with targeted drugs comprising gefitinib, erlotinib hydrochloride, or other ErbB inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, or estrogen receptor blockers in combination with conventional chemotherapy. OUTLINE: This is a prospective study. Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan and CT scan at baseline and at 2 weeks and 12 weeks after receiving targeted anticancer treatment. Metabolic changes detected by FDG-PET and size changes identified by CT scan are related to patient outcome and tumor response to treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
