	<brief_summary>PURPOSE: To assess the impact of duration of topical steroid treatment on the incidence of endothelial graft rejection following normal-risk penetrating keratoplasty (PK). DESIGN: Prospective, institutional, longitudinal, randomized interventional trial including 406 eyes (age: 52 &gt;= 19 years; follow-up: 42 &gt;= 18months). METHODS: Postoperative treatment started with prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops five times daily and was tapered over the first 6 months. Patients were then randomised into either short-term (stop topical steroid treatment) or long-term treatment (continue steroids once daily until 12 months).</brief_summary>
