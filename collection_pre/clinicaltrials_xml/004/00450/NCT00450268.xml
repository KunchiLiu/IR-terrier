	<brief_summary>We plan to investigate prospectively and simultaneously skin and blood DC subtypes, their donor/recipient origin and the correlation of DC reconstitution kinetics with treatment, clinical outcome and incidence of aGvHD in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood and skin DC reconstitution shall be investigated in patients affected by hematological diseases and receiving HLA-matched, mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from related or unrelated donors. We plan to simultaneously collect and process double biopsies, i.e. from graft versus host disease affected and non-lesional skin of patients at onset of acute graft versus host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Emigration assay, Chimerism analysis and immunohistochemistry will be performed.</detailed_description>
