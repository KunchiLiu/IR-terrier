	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: To evaluate the efficacy of a new high intensity chemotherapy regimen with thalidomide maintenance in patients with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving rituximab together with combination chemotherapy followed by thalidomide works in treating patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R-MACLO-IVAM and Thalidomide in Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the progression-free survival of patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma treated rituximab in combination with methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, leucovorin, vincristine, ifosfamide, etoposide, cytarabine and mesna (MACLO/IVAM) followed by thalidomide. Secondary - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: During cycle 1, patients will receive rituximab intravenous (IV), granisetron IV, decadron IV, doxorubicin IV bolus, vincristine intravenous pyelogram (IVP) on day 1; cyclophosphamide IV on day 1-5; vincristine IVP on day 8; methotrexate IV, methotrexate by continuous infusion, then leucovorin IV until methotrexate level is below 0.01 nanomolar (nM) on day 10. Patients will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 13 and continuing until blood counts recover. When absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches1,500/mm^3, patients will start cycle 2. Patients will receive rituximab IV on day 1; cytarabine IV on day 1 and 2; ifosfamide IV, mesna IV, etoposide IV on day 1-5; and G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until ANC is greater than 1,000 cells/mm^3. Approximately 2-3 weeks later, patients receive another course of therapy as above.After cycle 4, patients in complete remission will take oral thalidomide until progression of disease. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3-5 years, and then annually thereafter or at study termination. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
