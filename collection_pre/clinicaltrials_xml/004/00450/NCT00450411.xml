	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Implant radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well ultrasound-guided implant radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer previously treated with external-beam radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided Implant Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With External-Beam Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the late treatment-related gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) adverse events in patients with locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of the prostate previously treated with external-beam radiotherapy who are currently receiving transperineal ultrasound-guided iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103 brachytherapy. Secondary - Determine the acute treatment-related GI and GU adverse events in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the disease-specific survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine clinical patterns of tumor recurrence (time to local tumor progression or distant failure) in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the time to biochemical failure in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the post-brachytherapy dosimetric coverage in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter study. Patients undergo transperineal ultrasound-guided iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103 brachytherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
