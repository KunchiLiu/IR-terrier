	<brief_title>Aspiration of Subglottic Secretions Using Hi-Lo Evac Endotracheal Tube: Tube Size and Incidence of Suction Lumen Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In mechanically ventilated patients, aspiration of subglottic secretions is a widely used intervention for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Using Hi–Lo® Evac endotracheal tube (Hi-Lo Evac; Mallinckrodt; Athlone, Ireland), dysfunction of suction lumen and subsequent failure to aspirate the subglottic secretions is not uncommon. The objective of this prospective observational study is to determine the causes and the incidence of suction lumen dysfunction of Evac endotracheal tube.</detailed_description>
