	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of enteral iron supplementation for improving anemia, decreasing the risk of blood transfusion, and decreasing mortality in patients who are hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This study will also address any relationship between enteral iron supplamentation and risk of infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Enteral Iron Supplementation in Critical Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critical illness is characterized by the anemia of inflammation, which is partially caused by sequestration of iron from bone marrow sites of erythropoeisis into storage within the reticulendothelial system as ferritin. Also the majority of critically ill patients are hypoferremia, the efficacy of iron supplementation remains unknown. Furthermore, several retrospective studies have found an association between iron overload and infection. However, the relative risk/benefit profile of enteral iron supplementation with respect to infection has not been studied. The purose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of enteral iron supplamentation in critically ill patients. The hypothesis is that enteral iron supplamentation will result in both an improved hematocrit and a decreased need for blood transfusion, without increasing the risk of infection.</detailed_description>
