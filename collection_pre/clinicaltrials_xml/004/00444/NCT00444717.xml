	<brief_title>Impact of Pitavastatin in Hypercholesterolemic Patients With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome is defined as a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors including visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure and impaired glucose tolerance. Recently, it has been described that oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction, which are important in progression of atherosclerosis, increases in individuals with the metabolic syndrome. Statins might have beneficial effects such as anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory actions that are independent from their cholesterol-lowering effects. Pitavastatin, a chemically synthesized statin, has potent LDL-cholesterol lowering and also anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in animal studies. However, the effects of pitavastatin on oxidative stress and inflammatory action in patients with the metabolic syndrome have not been reported.</detailed_description>
