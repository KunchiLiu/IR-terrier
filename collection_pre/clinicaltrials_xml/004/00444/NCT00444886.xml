	<brief_title>Treatment of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) With Botox</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) is a symptom complex consisting of pain, paresthesias and often functional impairment caused by compression of the neurovascular supply to the upper limb. Impingement may occur at the interscalene triangle, and both anesthetic blockade and chemodenervation of the scalene muscles have been shown to temporarily improve symptoms of TOS in non-randomized controlled trials. Objective: To assess the effect of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BTX-A) injections into the scalene muscles on pain, paresthesias and function in subjects with TOS. Hypothesis: BTX-A injected into the anterior and middle scalene muscles will reduce the irritation on the neurovascular structures at the interscalene triangle in subjects with TOS. This will lead to reductions in pain and paresthesias, and improvements in function when compared with injection of placebo. Intervention: Each subject will receive an injection under EMG guidance into the anterior and middle scalene muscles of either 75 units of BTX-A (experimental group), or normal saline (control group). Both groups will be provided with a stretching and strengthening exercise program.</detailed_description>
