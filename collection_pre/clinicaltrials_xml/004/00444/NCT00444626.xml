	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of injection with DGE Injectable Gel (hyaluronic acid with lidocaine manufactured by Genzyme Biosurgery) as compared to injection with Restylane (a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved dermal filler) in patients undergoing cutaneous correction of the nasolabial folds (NLFs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Compare the Safety and Effectiveness of a Non-FDA Approved Device Dermal Gel Extra (DGE) and an FDA Approved Device for the Correction of Nasolabial Folds (NLFs)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study included an Initial and a Repeat Treatment period. The Initial Treatment period was a subject and evaluator-blinded, randomized split face study in which subjects received DGE in one nasolabial fold and Restylane in the other nasolabial fold. Both safety and efficacy were evaluated. In the Repeat Treatment Period, participants received DGE in both NLFs. Safety was evaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (abbreviated list): Bilateral nasolabial folds (NLF) with severity score of 3 or 4 on the 6 point scale. Exclusion Criteria (abbreviated list): Pregnant/lactating women. Subjects who have an allergy to lidocaine, prilocaine or other amidetype anesthetic. Had a chemical peel at the NLF area within 4 weeks prior to study entry. In addition, subjects were restricted from undergoing chemical peels at the NLF area for the duration of the study. Had any treatment with Botox® injections in the upper 1/3 of the face within 2 weeks prior to entry into the study, or in the lower 2/3 of the face within 24 weeks prior to entry. In addition, subjects were restricted from receiving Botox injections in the face for the duration of the study. Received prior therapy to the face and/or neck (e.g., dermabrasion, facelift, Thermage®,laser resurfacing, contour threads, nonablative laser treatments) within 24 weeks prior to study entry. In addition, subjects were restricted from undergoing such therapy for the duration of the study. Had previous tissue augmentation at the NLF area within 24 weeks prior to study entry. In addition, subjects were restricted from undergoing tissue augmentation at the NLF area for the duration of the study. Had previous treatment at the NLF area with permanent implants (e.g., silicone,Softform®) or longlasting fillers (e.g., RadiesseTM, Sculptra®, ArteFill® [Artecoll], or BioAlcamidTM). In addition, subjects were restricted from undergoing treatment with permanent implants or longlasting fillers at the NLF area for the duration of the study. Had evidence of scarrelated disease or delayed healing activity within one year prior to study enrollment. (Note: subjects with scars were eligible for study enrollment, although scars at the intended treatment sites were not treated.) Had a history of keloid formation. Had a history of hypo or hyperpigmentation of the skin. Had any infection, unhealed wound, or active inflammatory process (e.g., skin eruptions such as cysts, pimples, rashes, or hives) at the injection site(s). Immunocompromised/immunosuppressed (e.g., HIVpositive, transplant recipient, or presently receiving chemotherapy).</criteria>
