	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment Comparison for Recurrent Lumbar Disc Herniation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbar disc herniations are quite common and typically improve after surgical correction. However, some patients develop recurrent herniations at the same level. Controversy exists as to why reherniated discs occur. Moreover, existing research does not settle the issue of whether a second decompression/discectomy or a repeat decompression/discectomy with pedicle screw fusion is the more successful treatment. This study is designed to compare differences in patient-reported pain, physical function, and satisfaction between the two types of surgery patients.</detailed_description>
