	<brief_summary>The aim of our study was firstly to detect in cord bloods the polymorphism of genes related to atopy and allergic diseases and to examine their mutual interaction and their associations with cord blood IgE and cytokines. After that, in the prospective follow-up visits, we liked to investigate if the measurement of cord blood SNPs of genes related to atopy and allergic diseases was helpful in predicting the development of atopy and allergic diseases later in life.</brief_summary>
