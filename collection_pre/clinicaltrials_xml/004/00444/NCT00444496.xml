	<brief_title>SPHERE Hypertension Baseline Data Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are collecting baseline data on patients who have high blood pressure readings (160/100 or higher) at a 9-1-1 response by an EMT. We want to understand what these patients currently remember occurring during the 9-1-1 response around their high blood pressure measure; if the patients seek a second reading; if the patients seek follow-up care as a result of the high blood pressure measure. We are also interested if patients trust EMTs as a provider of preventive health care. This baseline data will also allow us to more accurately measure the success of a future intervention study aimed at motivating subjects to receive a follow-up hypertension assessment from a physician after receiving a high blood pressure reading from an EMT.</detailed_description>
