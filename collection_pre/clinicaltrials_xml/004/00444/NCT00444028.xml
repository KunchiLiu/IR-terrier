Subjects who are willing and able to be confined to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for approximately 2 days and comply with the study schedule and study requirements. 5. Subjects who are in good general health as determined by a complete medical history, physical examination, 12lead ECG, spirometry, blood chemistry profile, hematology, and urinalysis. 1. Subjects who regularly consume large amounts of xanthinecontaining substances (i.e., more than 5 cups of coffee or equivalent amounts of xanthinecontaining substances per day). 2. Subjects who have taken prescription or nonprescription medication (with the exception of vitamins and acetaminophen if medically necessary) within 5 days of Visit 2 (Baseline). 3.

Subjects who have a clinically significant ECG abnormality. 14. Subjects with a history of unstable angina, syncope, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a neurological disorder. 15. Subjects who have a history of pulmonary disease that precludes administration of Staccato Loxapine (asthma, bronchitis, bronchospasm, emphysema). 16.

Female subjects who are breastfeeding or have a positive pregnancy test at Visit 1 or Visit 2. 18. Female participants of childbearing potential or within 1 year of menopause, and sexually active are excluded unless they use a medically acceptable and effective birth control method throughout the study and for 1 week following the end of the study. Medically acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), condom with foam or spermicide, vaginal spermicidal suppository, surgical sterilization, and birth control pills. Unacceptable methods include: the rhythm method, withdrawal, condoms alone, or diaphragm alone. 19. Subjects who have any other disease or condition, by history, physical examination, or laboratory abnormalities that in the investigator’s opinion, would present undue risk to the subject, or may confound the interpretation of study results.</criteria>
