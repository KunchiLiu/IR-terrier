	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Fluorine F 18 FEQA may be an effective radioactive drug to use with positron emission tomography (PET) scans. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the use of fluorine F 18 FEQA in patients with stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorine F 18 FEQA in Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the biodistribution of fluorine F 18 FEQA in patients with stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in healthy participants. - Determine whether fluorine F 18 FEQA can be used as an imaging agent with positron emission tomography in patients with stage III or IV NSCLC. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients and healthy participants receive fluorine F 18 FEQA IV and then undergo whole-body dynamic scans comprising positron emission tomography. Blood is collected during and after imaging to measure radioactivity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
