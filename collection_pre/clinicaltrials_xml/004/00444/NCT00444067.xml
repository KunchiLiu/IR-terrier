	<detailed_description>Neurosurgical procedures in the spine often involve incision of the dura mater to access the spinal cord. If the dural incision is not properly repaired and watertight closure is not achieved cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can escape presenting a risk for significant morbidity. The most frequent complication of CSF leak is recurring headache complicated with symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Furthermore fluid collection under skin prevents proper wound healing and may lead to wound breakdown and infection of the incision or both. Persistent CSF leak has also been associated with the development of cerebellar hemorrhage and subdural hematoma. Primary repair and watertight closure are paramount to minimizing risk and sequelae associated with CSF leak.</detailed_description>
