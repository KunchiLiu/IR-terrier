	<brief_summary>A multicentre, prospective, open label study of acromegalic patients evaluating the efficacy and safety of different dose-intervals of Lanreotide Autogel 120mg according to international standards and compared to previous treatment with Octreotide LAR 10, 20 or 30 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of 120mg Somatuline Autogel at Different Dose Intervals (28, 42 or 56 Days) in Patients With Acromegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six repeated applications of Lanreotide Autogel 120mg administered every 28, 42 or 56 days.

	<criteria>The patient must give written (personally signed and dated) informed consent before completing any studyrelated procedure. The patient must have a documented diagnosis of active acromegaly and be adequately treated with a stable dose (10, 20 or 30 mg) of Octreotide LAR for at least 6 months immediately prior to study entry. A documented diagnosis of active acromegaly is defined as IGF1 more than 30% higher than two Standard Deviations ( +2 SD) above the normal age and sex adjusted value (see Appendix 6) or GH level after OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) &gt; 2ng/mL while not under drug treatment for acromegaly. For patients having undergone surgery or radiotherapy, this diagnosis must have been performed after the most recent surgical or radiation treatment The patient has had pituitary surgery (adenomectomy) within 6 months prior to study entry The patient has received stereotactic (LINAC, Gamma Knife) radiotherapy for acromegaly within three years or conventional radiotherapy for acromegaly within five years prior to study entry</criteria>
