	<brief_summary>This 8-week, crossover study will compare the quality of 24-hour IOP control with TTFC versus travoprost when both medications are dosed in the evening. Such a crossover comparison may determine the real efficacy of the new fixed combination versus travoprost monotherapy. The results should enhance the investigators understanding on the best dosing of TTFC and may influence its clinical use in Europe. Finally, the results would better delineate the future role of TTFC in glaucoma management after PG monotherapy, or instead of unfixed therapy with PG analogs and timolol. This study should assist the general ophthalmologist worldwide to plan optimal stepwise medical therapy.</brief_summary>
