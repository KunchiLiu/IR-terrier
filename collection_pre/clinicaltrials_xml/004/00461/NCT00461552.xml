	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy and safety of 4 therapeutic interventions on HAART-Induced lipodystrophy. The interventions are: 1) Dietary - the effect of a high carbohydrate vs.a high cis-monounsaturated fatty acid diet. 2) The effect of aerobic exercise with dietary advice. 3) The effect of Omega-3 Fish Oil Capsules. 4) The effect of leptin therapy. These interventions are aimed at improving the metabolic complications of HAART therapy such as elevated lipids, and insulin resistance or diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Approaches to HAART-Induced Lipodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with HAART-induced lipodystrophy report loss of subcutaneous (sc) fat from the extremities and face and excess fat accumulation in the neck and truncal region. They also are predisposed to metabolic complications of insulin resistance, such as, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of HAART-induced lipodystrophy is not fully understood although PIs have been strongly implicated as the cause. The metabolic complications pose an increased risk of atherosclerosis and acute pancreatitis whereas changes in body fat distribution cause physical discomfort and psychological distress. Management of these problems poses a therapeutic challenge. We propose potentially safe therapeutic lifestyle changes as well as novel therapies for management of HAART-induced lipodystrophy and its metabolic complications. The hypotheses to be tested and the aims are: Hypothesis 1: A diet rich in cis-monounsaturated fatty acids improves HAART-induced glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia in HIV-infected patients. Aim 1: To compare acceptability and effects of isocaloric diets rich in carbohydrates and cis-monounsaturated fats, each given for 6 wk, on glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with HAART-induced dyslipidemia in a randomized, cross-over study. Hypothesis 2: A regimen of aerobic exercise improves insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and body fat distribution in HIV-infected patients with HAART-induced lipodystrophy. Aim 2: To determine the effects of a supervised aerobic exercise regimen and dietary advice on glucose and lipid metabolism, and body fat distribution in HIV-infected patients with HAART-induced lipodystrophy. Hypothesis 3: The n-3 polyunsaturated fats improve HAART-induced dyslipidemia in HIV-infected patients. Aim 3: To determine the lipid-lowering effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fats in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in HIV-infected patients with HAART-induced dyslipidemia. Hypothesis 4: Leptin replacement improves insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and body fat distribution in patients with HAART-induced lipodystrophy and hypoleptinemia. Aim 4 To study efficacy and safety of recombinant methionyl leptin (r-metHuleptin) in improving insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia and body fat distribution in patients with HAART-induced lipodystrophy and hypoleptinemia using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design. Results from these studies may help in designing therapeutic approaches to HAART-induced lipodystrophy and its metabolic complications as well as for prevention of these problems in HIV-infected patients being placed on HAART.</detailed_description>
