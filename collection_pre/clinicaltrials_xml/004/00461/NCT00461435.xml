	<criteria>Patients with clearly hereditary RP (we performed to all of them genetic analysis for rhodopsin, and peripherin genes, only 4 patient with ADRP showed point mutation 3 on codon 135 and 1 on codon 347); best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≥ 0.50 logMAR; visual field ≥ 3 degree diameter circle; recordable ERG. Exclusion criteria were: patients with sporadic RP; BCVA ≤ 0.50 logMAR; visual field ≤ 3 degree diameter circle; not recordable ERG.</criteria>
