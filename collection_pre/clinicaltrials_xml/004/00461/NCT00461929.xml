	<brief_summary>In order to distinguish between clonal instability driven by imatinib in CML and actual changes with secondary clones induced by imatinib we would like to investigate the karyotype of non-CML patients treated with imatinib such as GIST patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chromosome Abnormalities in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) on Imatinib. GIST Patients on Imatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome - a t(9:22) translocation that results in the production of a BCR/ABL fusion protein with Abl kinase activity. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) specifically targets a limited set of protein tyrosine kinases - ABL, Arg (Abl-related gene), c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) - and their oncogenic forms, most notably BCR/ABL Imatinib is also a potent inhibitor of a receptor-type c-Kit tyrosine kinase. Therefore imatinib was examined for therapeutic efficacy against malignant gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) Recent articles have drawn attention to the development of new Ph-negative, cytogenetically unrelated clones after therapy of Ph-positive CML with imatinib. Trisomy 8 and monosomy 7 are the most frequent defects, but other aberrations have also been reported. Some of these cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with acute myeloid leukemia and MDS.</detailed_description>
