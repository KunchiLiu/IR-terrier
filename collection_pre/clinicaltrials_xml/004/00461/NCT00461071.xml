	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Study on the Use of Psychoeducation for Bulimia Nervosa in Young Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eating disorders and especially bulimia nervosa are psychiatric diseases, affecting 2-4% of women. An intervention such as guided self-help via manuals (bibliotherapy) is a well accepted approach and accepted. Development of new technologies in recent years allows delivery of psychotherapy via CD-ROMs and web-based interfaces. These new technologies have not yet been implemented in Austria in treating bulimia nervosa (BN) patients. In particular patients will be involved, who would not attend medical care regularly. The aim of our study is therefore to deliver guided self-help via an internet platform (supported by email contacts) for 100 patients with BN and to investigate the practicability and effectivity of this approach as well as compliance of patients in this group. Patients will be found and contacted via internet, get specialized medical investigations, medical care and support via emails. As control group 100 patients with bulimia are treated with bibliotherapy only. Beside effectivity, predictors of outcome (clinical, comorbidity, indication to change, personality) are investigated. The proposed study is a randomised controlled trial for effectivity and practicability of new technologies in psychiatric treatment research. This is not a psychotherapy study but a study on psychoeducation, an approach which offers new and helpful opportunities for this patient group.</detailed_description>
