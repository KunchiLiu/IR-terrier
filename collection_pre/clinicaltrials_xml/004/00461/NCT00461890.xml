	<brief_summary>The goal of the proposed project is to improve the primary care treatment of veterans with alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is a common behavioral health problem among veterans treated in VA primary care clinics. However, assessment and treatment of alcohol dependence in primary care remains problematic. Assessment of veterans with positive alcohol use screens may not always be completed and referrals to specialty care may not always be made. Moreover, the use of medications for alcohol dependence among veterans is rare, despite VA treatment guidelines that recommend such use. Finally, when medications are prescribed, patients may have difficulties with adherence. The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of long-acting injectable naltrexone provided through primary care (LAN/PC) versus long-acting injectable naltrexone in the specialized chemical dependence clinic (LAN/CDC). The secondary aim is to obtain preliminary assessments of the relative effectiveness of long-acting injectable naltrexone in primary care versus in the chemical dependence clinic.</brief_summary>
