	<detailed_description>GnRH antagonist offers many advantages when used in IVF-ET treatment, however, it is suspected to yield lower pregnancy rate when compared with the long GnRH agonist protocol. Our goal was to investigate whether early follicular supplementation of the GnRH antagonist to the flexible GnRH antagonist protocol, has a potential to improve IVF-ET clinical results. Consecutive patients are prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to the study and control groups. Patients with low ovarian reserve or with uterine distortion are excluded from the study. Both groups are treated with recombinant FSH and the flexible GnRH antagonist protocol. Women in the study group are also treated with additional GnRH antagonist 0.25 mg/day on day 1, 2 and 3 of the menstrual cycle.</detailed_description>
