	<brief_summary>The research hypothesis for the proposed study asks the question, can Asmanex® demonstrate comparable anti-inflammatory therapeutic efficacy to the combination product, Advair® in control of mild persistent asthma? The purpose is to demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory protection afforded by monotherapy with an inhaled steroid (Asmanex®) is comparable to combination therapy with Advair® 100/50, when measured by this standard methodology (methacholine bronchoprovocation) in subjects with mild persistent asthma.</brief_summary>
