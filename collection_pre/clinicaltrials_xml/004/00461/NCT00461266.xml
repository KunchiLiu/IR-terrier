	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will assess the immunological benefits of adding Fuzeon to an antiretroviral regimen in HIV-infected, Fuzeon-naive patients with a CD4 cell count &lt;250 cells/mm3 and an HIV RNA viral load &lt;400 copies/mL. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive Fuzeon 90mg bid sc in addition to their current antiretroviral therapy, or to continue their current antiretroviral therapy alone. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
