	<brief_title>Case-Control-Study on the Breast Cancer Risk of Mirena® Compared With Copper IUDs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a community-based case-control study in Germany and Finland. Cases will be identified from cancer registries, tumor centers and breast centers. Matched controls will be accrued from the same region as the case came from. Breast cancer cases and their controls are women under 50 years of age without known history of malignancies. Cases are women with a breast cancer who are younger than 50 years of age at cancer diagnosis. The breast cancer was diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2007. Only alive cases and cases in a sufficiently good health status to be interviewed are eligible for the study. Controls are women without a breast cancer diagnosis who are younger than 50 years of age at the time of the interview. About 3 controls matched by year of birth and region will be allocated to each case. A standardized questionnaire will be used for all breast cancer cases and controls. The questionnaire will be mailed to cases and controls. Study participants will be asked for their informed consent. Data confidentiality according to national laws will be ensured by the field organizations.</detailed_description>
