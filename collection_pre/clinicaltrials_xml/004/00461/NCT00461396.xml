	<brief_summary>- The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of titration, analgesics, and 12 month telephone follow-up period from the B.E.T.A nurse program upon adherence to treatment with Betaseron in patients with a first clinical demyelinating event suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and patients with onset of RRMS within the past 12 months - Secondary outcomes include analysis of the following parameters: progression of clinical severity by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS score), health related quality of life (HrQoL), and safety. - Exploratory outcomes include changes over time in cytokine and neurotrophic factor production by immune cells and visual function as assessed by visual examination, OCT measurements and a neuro-ophthalmologic Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) with 10-item supplement.</brief_summary>
