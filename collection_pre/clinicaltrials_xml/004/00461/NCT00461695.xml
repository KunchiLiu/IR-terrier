	<brief_summary>Recent studies indicate that persistent viral infections particularly with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) might have a negative impact on immune senescence (i.e. immunocompetence of elderly individuals). We will test this hypothesis by performing a vaccination trial in healthy elderly individuals subdivided in two groups of CMV-seropositive and CMV-seronegative individuals. All individuals will be vaccinated with the currently licensed vaccine for the prevention of TBE (FSME Immun CC) which is recommended for the general population in our area. Vaccination efficacy will be monitored longitudinally concerning the TBEV-specific antibody (TBEV-neutralization, TBEV-specific ELISA) and T cell response (ELISpot, cytokine production). Vaccination efficacy will be compared between CMV+ and CMV- individuals and correlated with the CMV-specific immune response in CMV+ individuals.</brief_summary>
