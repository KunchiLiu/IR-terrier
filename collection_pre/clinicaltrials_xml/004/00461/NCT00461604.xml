	<brief_summary>It has been reported that Baclofen is an appropriate tool in the therapeutic management of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. To objectify gastroesophageal reflux combined pH-metry/impedance monitoring was applied to patients with persistent reflux-associated symptoms despite PPI-therapy (40mg esomeprazole for 2 weeks). After provement of pathological findings in the test PPI-dosage was escalated to double standard-dosage for another for weeks. In case of persistent symptoms another ph-metry/impedance monitoring was performed. In case of pathological findings additional baclofen was administered to the therapeutic regime. After 3 months another ph-metry/impedance monitoring was performed. At the time point of the tests a questionnaire was completed. Aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of high dosage PPI-therapy and additional baclofen in patients with persistent symptoms and objectified gastroesophageal reflux.</brief_summary>
