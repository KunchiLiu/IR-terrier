	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare safety and efficacy of three induction treatments: VBMCP-VBAD / Velcade versus Thalidomide / Dexamethasone versus Velcade / Thalidomide / Dexamethasone. The second one is to evaluate the ability of stem cell mobilization after the treatments in order to do an autologous transplant. Otherwise this study wants to compare the safety and efficacy of the maintenance treatments: Interferón a-2b versus Thalidomide versus Thalidomide/Velcade.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GEM05 for Patients With Multiple Myeloma Under 65 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of up to 390 patients ≤ 65 years old diagnosed of Multiple Myeloma with symptomatic disease and that have not received previous chemotherapy for MM will be included. Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to three study periods: Pre-treatment, Treatment and Follow up. The Pre-treatment includes Screening and baseline visits. After providing informed consent, patients will be evaluated for study eligibility and then Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive VBMCP-VBAD+Velcade (Group A) or Thalidomide+Dexamethasone (Group B) or Thalidomide+Dexamethasone+Velcade (Group C). All of them will received the induction treatment up to 24 weeks. After 4 weeks, without progression or unacceptable toxicity, There will be stem cell mobilization to do an autologous transplant. Three months after transplant, patients will be again randomized (1:1:1) to receive maintenance treatment: Interferon-a (Group M1) or Thalidomide (Group M2) or Thalidomide+Velcade (Group M3) during three years. Once the treatment period has finished a follow up will be carry out. During this period we will evaluated response, progression-free survival and global survival every three months.</detailed_description>
