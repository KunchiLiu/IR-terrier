	<brief_summary>Endoscopic sphincterotomy and temporary stenting is a routine treatment for post cholecystectomy cystic duct leakage. The draw back is that the plastic stent need to be removed later in a second intervention. Our studies with animal models have demonstrated that biodegradable biliary stent is at least as good as conventional plastic stent to heal that kind of leakage. In this pilot study the biodegradable biliary stent is inserted endoscopically to patients with confirmed cystic duct leakage to demonstrate the efficacy in human setting.</brief_summary>
