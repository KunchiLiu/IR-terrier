	<brief_summary>clinically relevant in stent restenosis occurs in 5-10% of the non-diabetic patients treated with a coronary bare metal stent. Recent research has identified endothelial progenitor cells as well as dendritic cells as components of neointima. Numerical and functional evaluation of endothelial progenitor and dendritic cells at the time of coronary stent implantation is assessed and the relation with clinical and/or angiographic restenosis at 6 months post-stent implantation is evaluated.</brief_summary>
