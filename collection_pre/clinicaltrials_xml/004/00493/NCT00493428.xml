	<brief_summary>Recent studies indicate that liver cancer cells possess a receptor called the GABA-B receptor that when activated, inhibits the spread of cancer cells in test tubes. One of the drugs that activate these receptors is Baclofen, an agent that was originally developed to treat patients with various neurologic disorders. In this study, patients with recently identified liver cancer will be treated with Baclofen in an attempt to prevent or delay spread of the cancer beyond the liver. The time it takes for liver cancer to spread in the patients will be compared to the results obtained from patients enrolled in previous studies where Baclofen was not used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Non-Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Humans by Increasing Gabaergic Activity: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 47 consecutive patients with radiologic or histologic evidence of non metastatic liver cancer will be enrolled over a 2-4 year period. Subjects will receive oral Baclofen at the manufacturer's suggested maximal dose. Clinical, hematologic, biochemical, and radiologic features of liver function, tumor metastasis and recurrence will be monitored at regular time intervals over a 2 year treatment period. The primary study end point will be the event of interest (time to metastasis or recurrence). Secondary end points will include time to metastasis following recurrence, objective tumor responses (complete, partial and non response), response duration, survival and safety. It is hoped the results of this study will permit liver cancer patients to remain candidates for surgical resection and transplantation longer than would otherwise have been the case.</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Carcinoma, Hepatocellular</mesh_term>
	<criteria>A diagnosis of HCC and no evidence of extrahepatic metastases on CT/MRI scan of the abdomen, CT of the chest and brain and a negative bone scan. Patients undergoing local therapy (resection, ablation or chemoembolization) and those listed for liver transplantation will not be excluded from participating in the study. Patients with multiple space occupying lesions within the liver (but no evidence of extrahepatic metastases) will continue to be eligible (the distinction between regenerative nodules and multifocal HCC versus intrahepatic metastases can not be made with certainty by presently available techniques). Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) â‰¥ 60 %. Age 18 years or greater. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Concomitant Medications Patients should be on stable doses of other medications (no change in dose for two weeks prior to study initiation) when entered into the study. Patient consent must be obtained from all patients prior to entry into the trial. Patients must be accessible for treatment and followup i.e. residing within reasonable geographical limits of the study site. Any investigational agent within a minimum of 6 weeks prior to study treatment. Pregnant or lactating women; women or men of childbearing potential unless using effective contraception. Patients capable of reproduction must agree to use appropriate methods of contraception during the study and for six months afterwards. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 14 days of study enrollment. Patients whose partners are pregnant. Other serious illness or medical conditions which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol including: History of a psychiatric disorder which would impair the ability to obtain consent or followup tumor imaging. Active uncontrolled infection. Any known defect in GABA metabolism or hypersensitivity to Baclofen. Patients with previous organ allograft or taking immunomodulatory drugs. Renal failure not being managed by dialysis.</criteria>
