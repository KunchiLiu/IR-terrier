	<brief_summary>The first aim of this study is to determine how often unrecognized myocardial infarction occur in patients using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique (known as delayed enhancement MRI), as compared to the electrocardiogram. The second aim of this study is to determine the severity of coronary heart disease of the patients with unrecognized myocardial infarction. The final aim is to determine how the presence of unrecognized myocardial infarction detected by the MRI affects lifespan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination of the Prevalence and Prognostic Importance of Unrecognized Non-Q-wave Myocardial Infarction by MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unrecognized myocardial infarction (MI) is known to constitute a substantial portion of lethal coronary heart disease. However, since the diagnosis of unrecognized MI is based on the appearance of incidental Q-waves on 12-lead electrocardiography, the syndrome of unrecognized non-Q-wave MI has not been described. Delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DE-CMR) can accurately identify non-Q-wave MI. The aims of this study are three-fold: 1. to determine the prevalence of unrecognized non-Q-wave and Q-wave MI, 2. to define predictors of unrecognized non-Q-wave MI, 3. to determine the prognostic significance of unrecognized non-Q-wave MI.</detailed_description>
