	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are: - to establish the safety of subcutaneous administration of ceftriaxone at different concentrations, with and without HYLENEX recombinant, and to determine the maximum tolerated concentration; - and to establish the pharmacokinetic comparability of subcutaneous administration of ceftriaxone with HYLENEX recombinant to subcutaneous administration without HYLENEX recombinant and to IV administration.</brief_summary>
