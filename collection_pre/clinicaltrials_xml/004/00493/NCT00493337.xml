	<brief_title>A Community Pharmacist-led Intervention to Improve Adherence to Lipid-lowering Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medication non-adherence represents an important threat to the health of the Western people. A large number of pharmacy records based studies demonstrated that adherence to lipid lowering treatment in daily practice is substantially worse compared to adherence observed in the controlled setting of randomized controlled trials. In addition, the relationship between non-adherence with statin-treatment assessed with pharmacy records and cardiovascular outcomes has been convincingly demonstrated. This implies that pharmacy records can and should be used to identify non-adherent patients and thus patients at risk for major cardiovascular events. Using this data, community pharmacists can play a more substantive role in developing the concept of pharmaceutical care. The objective of the study is to test the effectiveness of a community pharmacist-led intervention to increase adherence to lipid lowering treatment.</detailed_description>
