	<brief_summary>Patients with large esophageal varices who have not yet experienced bleeding, are normally treated with propranolol, a beta blocking agent that reduces the portal pressure and thereby diminish the risk of bleeding. 20-40% of the patients do not respond to this treatment or have to discontinue the treatment because of side effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate if carvedilol (a combined alfa -beta blocker) has better efficacy and safety than propranolol in lowering the portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
