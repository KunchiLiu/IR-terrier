	<brief_title>"ADAPT" The Adaptation to High Fat Diets Extention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the past 3 years we have identified a "thrifty-phenotype" characterized in lean men by an inability to adapt rapidly to a high fat diet and associated with a low maximal VO2 and high fasting insulin. We hypothesize that the individuals with the "thrifty phenotype" are at higher risk for becoming obese, and that exercise may be effective in overcoming this problem. Several questions remain to be answered regarding the "thrifty" phenotype. First, given the large interindividual differences, how can we identify those at the highest risk? What are the distinguishing biochemical, endocrine and environmental characteristics of individuals that store fat when exposed to high fat diets? This is important because if these individuals can be easily identified, then dietary interventions can be targeted to this "at-risk" population. Second, what is different about the individual with the "thrifty phenotype"? Are there cellular pathways that are dysregulated in the skeletal muscle of these individuals when compared to controls? Is the defect intrinsic, i.e. a diminished ability to conserve glucose and oxidize fat in skeletal muscle or alternately, is the phenotype due to environmental, and dietary factors such as inactivity and energy excess? To answer these questions, we have planned a three-year project that aims to: - Characterize the biochemical, endocrine, anthropometric and environmental characteristics of individuals with the "thrifty" phenotype. - Identify the signaling pathways in skeletal muscle that are dysregulated in individuals with the "thrifty" phenotype through mRNA expression profiling in skeletal tissue. - Determine the role of environmental factors such as inactivity and caloric intake vs. intrinsic (genetic) factors in the "thrifty" phenotype.</detailed_description>
