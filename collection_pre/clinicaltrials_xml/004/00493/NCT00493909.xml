	<brief_title>Prospective, Randomised, Single-Blinded, Monocentric Clinical Study to Compare Postoperative Analgesia and Outcome After Combined Paravertebral and Intrathecal Versus Thoracic Epidural Analgesia for Thoracotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracotomy is an invasive surgical procedure, which is mainly performed in patients with pre-existing lung disease such as lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pain after thoracotomy is considered the most intense acute postoperative pain, adversely affecting the ability to cough, deep breathing, and lung function, resulting in respiratory complications and delayed recovery. The adverse effects can be further aggravated by occurrence of chronic post-thoracotomy pain. Thoracic epidural analgesia is often recommended as the gold standard for the relief of acute post-thoracotomy pain. Thoracic paravertebral blockade or intrathecal opioid analgesia has also been shown to be efficacious for pain relief. Since there is no ideal single regional technique for pain relief after thoracotomy an alternative method maybe the combination of low-dose intrathecal morphine and sufentanil plus continuous thoracic paravertebral analgesia with local anesthetics. We therefore hypothesized that combining intrathecal sufentanil and morphine with thoracic paravertebral applicated ropivacaine would provide equal analgesia compared to thoracic epidural analgesia with ropivacaine and sufentanil. We further speculate that this new regimen would have a lower incidence of typical side effects due to TEA, such as block failure, hypotension or urinary retention.</detailed_description>
