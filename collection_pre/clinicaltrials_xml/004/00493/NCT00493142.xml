	<brief_title>Pre-operative Rehabilitation Exercise Program for Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with lower levels of function prior to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) attain lower functional endpoints after surgery. Therapeutic exercise improves function in patients with arthritis of the knee, yet little evidence has examined the impact of pre-operative exercise for TKA. Single blinded randomized clinical trial comparing a pre-operative home exercise program to pre-operative usual care for patients who are waiting for TKA.Comparison group is usual care within the health region which does not include pre-operative rehabilitation program. Primary outcome: WOMAC function subscale. Secondary outcomes: 1) quality of life; 2) ambulation; 3) self-efficacy; 4) anxiety; 5) patient satisfaction; 6) cost-effectiveness of this intervention. Total Enrollment: 230 patients If the intervention improves function prior to surgery, results will be clinically applicable for patients waiting for surgery</detailed_description>
