	<brief_summary>The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate whether acupuncture is safe and acceptable to people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Twenty-four SLE patients were assigned randomly to receive either 10 sessions of acupuncture, 10 sessions of a minimal-needling control intervention, or their usual medical care alone. It was hypothesized that acupuncture would be safe for people with SLE, and that participants would be able to complete their assigned treatment within 5 to 6 weeks.</brief_summary>
