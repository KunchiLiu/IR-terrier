	<brief_title>Different Regimens of Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been recommended as first line non-curative therapy for non-surgical patients with large/multifocal HCC who do not have vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. There has not been any standardized protocol in the choice of chemotherapeutic agents, dosage, dilution, rate of injection, and time interval between treatments. Similarly, there is no agreement on the choice of embolizing agents, degree of embolization, and whether the chemotherapeutic agent should be given together, or before the embolizing agent. Comparison(s): In patients with HCC who underwent TACE therapy, stratified by whether they have vascular invasion and tumor size, we compare efficacy, safety, and patient reported outcomes (PRO) of different regimens of TACE. Regimen 1: lipiodol combined chemotherapy with embolization Regimen 2: lipiodol combined chemotherapy without embolization Regimen 3: lipiodol single agent chemotherapy with embolization</detailed_description>
