	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of nitro-glycerine on the microcirculation (smallest vessel type) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Nitro-glycerine is a well known medicine in cardiology and is used to improve circulation. In this ICU the investigators use nitro-glycerine to improve the organ perfusion; but it's no common therapy in the rest of the world. The investigators now compare nitro-glycerine and placebo by looking to the sublingual microcirculation by a small camera (SDF imaging).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Nitroglycerine on Microcirculatory Abnormalities During Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study starts at admission of the patient on the ICU. In the next 24 hours the patient receives nitro-glycerine or placebo (randomised). At time = 0, Â½, 2, 12 and 24 hour we evaluate the microcirculation by SDF imaging and monitoring of hemodynamic parameters. Informed consent is obtained of the relatives.</detailed_description>
