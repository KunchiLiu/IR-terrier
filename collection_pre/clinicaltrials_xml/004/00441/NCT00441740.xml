	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the gemcitabine/vinorelbine combination versus the gemcitabine/docetaxel combination as first line treatment, offers a survival advantage in patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial With Vinorelbine and Gemcitabine Versus Docetaxel and Gemcitabine in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cisplatin-based chemotherapy represented the backbone of treatment of advanced NSCLC. However, several trials comparing platinum versus non-platinum based chemotherapy regimens failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in terms of time to tumor progression or survival. Newer agents such as gemcitabine, docetaxel and vinorelbine have shown significant activity in the treatment of NSCLC. Gemcitabine/vinorelbine combination as first line treatment has demonstrated a response rate (RR) of 18-43% and a median overall survival (OS) of 9.8-13 months. Similarly, the gemcitabine/docetaxel combination has shown a RR 32-35% and a median OS of 9-12 months. Given their proven efficacy, the combination of these two doublets, would be interesting.</detailed_description>
