	<brief_title>Effect of Plant Sterols Esterified to Fish Oil Fatty Acids on Plasma Lipid Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phytosterols and omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) are natural food ingredients with potential cardiovascular (CVD) benefits. Phytosterols inhibit dietary cholesterol absorption and biliary cholesterol re-absorption, thereby reducing blood cholesterol levels, while consumption of n-3 is associated with a significant reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations. Furthermore, n-3 may also beneficially modify a number of other risk factors of CHD, like anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether plant sterols esterified to fish oil fatty acids in a fish oil matrix improve the lipid profile, predominantly LDL-cholesterol and TG concentrations in healthy hyperlipidemic subjects. In addition the supplement efficacy to lower other CVD-related risk factors of healthy will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
