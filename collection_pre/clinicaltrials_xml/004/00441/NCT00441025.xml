	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Alemtuzumab Combination With CHOP to Treat Patients Newly Diagnosed With PTCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are more common in Asia than in Europe and United States (17-40% vs. 5-10%). Most studies reported a poorer prognosis for PTCL compared to B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) is currently regarded as a standard chemotherapy regimen for patients with newly diagnosed NHL. Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD52, a cell surface protein present at high density on most normal and malignant B and T lymphocytes.Malignant T cells express particularly high numbers of CD52 cell surface markers (approximately 500,000 molecules/lymphocytes),T-cell malignancies may thus be particularly responsive to alemtuzumab. As the response rate tend to be higher in patients newly diagnosed with PTCL, this study evaluates the efficacy of alemtuzumab in combination with CHOP administered as up-front therapy in patients newly diagnosed with PTCL in terms of response rate and overall survival.</detailed_description>

Serologic evidence of HCV and HCV RNA of chronic hepatitis. Serologic evidence of HBV and HBV RNA of chronic hepatitis. Patients with history of impaired cardiac status or myocardial infarction. Patients with serum creatinine &gt;= 1.8 mg/dl,bilirubin &gt;= 1.5 times upper limit of normal range,SGOT or SGPT &gt;= 3 times upper limit of normal range, unless due to tumor involvement. Patients with active uncontrolled infection,active nonmalignant gastric or duodenal ulcer, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or other severe medical conditions which would preclude aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy.
