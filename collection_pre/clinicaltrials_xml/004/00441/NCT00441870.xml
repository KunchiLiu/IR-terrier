	<brief_title>Study of EC0225 for the Treatment of Refractory or Metastatic Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, dose escalation study of EC0225 administered by intravenous bolus (IV) during weeks 1 and 3 of a 4-week cycle to patients with refractory or metastatic cancer who have exhausted standard therapeutic options. EC0225 is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cells via a folate vitamin receptor. Experimental evidence shows that the target receptor is over-expressed in many human cancers. There are no previous human studies of EC0225; however, lab research (research in test tubes or animals) using EC0225 has shown activity against tumors in animals. This activity in animal models suggests that EC0225 may be useful as chemotherapy against human cancers. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of EC0225 given by intravenous bolus. The efficacy of treatment will also be measured.</detailed_description>
