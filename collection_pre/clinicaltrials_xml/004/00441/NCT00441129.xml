	<brief_summary>. PRIMARY ENDPOINT The primary endpoint will be the change from baseline (Visit 3) to 6 months (Visit 6) of centrally measured HbA1c SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 1. Change from baseline in mean blood glucose value calculated from CGMS recordings. 2. Change from baseline in occurrence of hyperglycemia above 190 mg/dl . 3. Change from baseline in occurrence of hypoglycemia below 70 mg/dl 4. Change from baseline of insulin doses. 5. Total daily use of insulin. 6. % of daily use of insulin as basal rate. 7. % of daily use of insulin as bolus. 8. Patient Satisfaction questionnaire. 9. Health economic questionnaire. 10. Quality of life questionnaire</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Obtain a Good Blood Glucose Control With the Paradigm Real Time System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term clinical benefit of tight glycemic control in people with diabetes is well known . HbA1c generally assesses the average/long term quality of glycemic control, it has been clearly demonstrated that a target of HbA1c at 7.0% or less has benefits for diabetic patients</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient has signed informed consent form prior to study entry. Patients have been diagnosed with Type 1 DM at least 12 months prior to inclusion. Patients should have been received diabetes care from the investigator of each center at least 3 months prior to inclusion. Patients have been treated with multiple daily injections and use rapid Insulin Analog for their meal prior to study entry. Have an HbA1c value ≥ 8 %. Pediatric patients must be aged between 2 and 18 years old and adult patients be aged between 19 and 65 years old. Patients must perform at least 3 selfmonitoring blood glucose fingersticks daily. Patients from PRT group must be willing to wear sensors and transmitter connected to the pump Paradigm® RealTime for up to 24 weeks and to change sensors, insulin infusion sets and reservoirs every 3 days (~60 times during the study period ). Patients from CSII group must be willing to wear an insulin pump, change insulin infusion sets, and reservoirs every 3 days (~60 times during the study period ). Patient is required to use the Paradigm® RealTime system at least 70% of the time during the study period. Patients in both groups are required to wear at the beginning and the end of the study a CGMS for 3 days. and to perform 6 selfmonitoring blood glucose fingersticks daily during the 3 days. Patients must be willing to undergo all study procedures, to receive a technical training to understand how to use the Paradigm® RealTime System or the Insulin Pump depending of the randomization. Patients must agree to receive a training on how to adapt their insulin doses to their meals, how to calculate and apply corrective treatment. Hearing or vision impairment so that alarms cannot be recognized. Alcohol or drug abuses other than nicotine. Allergy to sensor or components of the sensor. Allergy to insulin infusion set or components of the insulin infusion set. Patient is pregnant or of childbearing potential during the study. Patient does not have a reliable support person or the patient is unwilling to comply with the provisions of the protocol. Patients suffering from cancer, heart failure, kidney disease and other chronic debilitating conditions. Patients participating in other device or drug studies will be excluded. Patients may participate in this study only once.</criteria>
