	<brief_title>Treatment Resistant Depression and Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Effect of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: What is the effect on mood and anxiety symptoms of adding CPAP to the psychiatric treatment of patients with TRD and associated OSA? Secondary objectives: 1. How common is co-morbid OSA in patients with treatment resistant unipolar depression referred to a tertiary Mood Disorders Clinic? 2. Is there a difference in daytime functioning (severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, cognitive function, daytime sleepiness) and sleep quality between patients with TRD diagnosed with OSA compared with patients with TRD who have no OSA? 3. What is the association between sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia and the severity of depression in patients with TRD?</detailed_description>

Patients with uncontrolled medical illnesses will not be permitted to participate. Patients with a history of current or Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Panic Disorder, ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder or Anorexia Nervosa. Head injury patients resulting in loss of consciousness for more than 10 minutes. Patients with epilepsy or severe personality disorders who, at the judgment of the investigators, are not appropriate candidates for the study, will be excluded. Patients who do not have the mental or physical capacity to apply the CPAP interface and to plug in and switch on an auto CPAP unit at home will be excluded. Blind and/or deaf patients will be excluded. Patients who initially decline an offer of CPAP treatment for OSA, and those who prefer conservative treatment options (weight loss, avoidance of alcohol and sedatives) will be excluded. Patients with severe claustrophobia, who cannot tolerate any CPAP interface, will be excluded.</criteria>
