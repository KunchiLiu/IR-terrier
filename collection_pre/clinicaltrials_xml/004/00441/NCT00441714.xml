	<brief_summary>To adjust our forearm model for ischemia reperfusion injury, in order to used it for assessment of ischemia reperfusion damage in elderly and patients. To test the effect of ischemic postconditioning on ischemia reperfusion injury in healthy volunteers, using Annexin binding after repetitive handgripping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ischemic Postconditioning on Targeting of Annexin A5 After Forearm Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, ischemic postconditioning has been identified as a protective intervention against ischemia-reperfusion injury. In animal studies, the signalling pathway of this (impressive) protective phenomenon is very similar to ischemic preconditioning. It opens a new avenue of post-reperfusion interventions with drugs that have been shown to mimic ischemic preconditioning. Before we can study this phenomenon in our forearm ischemia-reperfusion model, we need additional validating experiments. The purpose of this study proposal is to provide these data.</detailed_description>
