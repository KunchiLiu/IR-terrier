A history of vaccination against, or infection with, JE or other flaviviruses (e.g. Kyanasur Forest Disease, West Nile virus, dengue fever). Previous JE vaccination was to be determined by history (interview of subject's parent or guardian) or by inspecting the child's official vaccination record. Demonstration of parasitemia on malaria blood smear at Screening. History of residence in or travel to a JEendemic region of India or elsewhere in Asia (for periods of 4 weeks or more). hypersensitivity to thimerosal or gelatin Have received a transfusion of blood, blood products or serum globulin in the preceding 6 months, Have an immunodeficiency or neurological disorder, or take drugs that suppress the immune system, Have a history of severe reaction to other vaccines, Have a chronic condition requiring medication, Intend to travel out of the area during the study period, Have spent at least 4 weeks in a JEendemic region, Plan to receive any other vaccination within the doubleblind treatment period, or who have received a vaccination in the month preceding Screening, Exhibit signs of secondary or tertiary malnutrition, Are seropositive to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or C, Have malaria infection, or who have a fever within 3 days before vaccination. Those with an acute fever, or with previously scheduled vaccinations, may be rescheduled. Consideration of the routine immunisation schedule should be made such that it is ensured that routine vaccinations due are either given before entry to the trial, or afterwards if delayed because of the trial.</criteria>
