	<brief_summary>Survivors of a cardiac arrest frequently develop severe postanoxic encephalopathy. Derangements in cerebral blood after return of spontaneous circulation play an important role in the pathogenesis of postanoxic encephalopathy. In the present study we examine the effect of mild therapeutic hypothermia on cerebral blood flow and carbondioxide reactivity in patients after cardiac arrest.</brief_summary>
