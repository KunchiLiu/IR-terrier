	<brief_title>Treatment With High Dose Methotrexate in Patients With Eosinophilic Fasciitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF)is a fibrosing skin disorder extensively involving the deep fascia. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of high dose MTX on skin induration in patients with EF. In addition, we study the effect of this treatment on joint mobility, peripheral blood eosinophilia, functional ability, and pulmonary function. By administering high dose MTX intravenously every four weeks with a Leukovorin rescue, we hope to induce a more pronounced and sustained effect on the involved skin with less (long-lasting) side effects.</detailed_description>
