	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well VEGF Trap works in treating patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic cancer of the urothelium. VEGF Trap may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VEGF Trap in Treating Patients With Recurrent, Locally Advanced, or Metastatic Cancer of the Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent, locoregionally advanced, or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with VEGF Trap. II. Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine overall survival of patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the tolerability and safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic correlative studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
