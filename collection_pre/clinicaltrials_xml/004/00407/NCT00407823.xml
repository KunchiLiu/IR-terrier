	<brief_title>Comparison of Pediatric Septic Shock Treatment With and Without Central Venous Oxygen Saturation Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: ACCM/PALS guidelines addresses early correction of pediatric septic shock using physical examination supplemented by indirect measures of cardiac output such as central venous or superior vena cava oxygen saturation (ScvO2&gt;70%) in a goal directed approach. However, these endpoints are based on unsupported evidence. The purpose of this study was to compare ACCM/PALS guidelines performed with and without ScvO2 on the morbidity and mortality rate of children with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods: Children and adolescents with severe sepsis or fluid-refractory septic shock were recruited at two university-affiliated hospitals and randomly assigned to ACCM/PALS without, or with an ScvO2 goal directed (goal ScvO2 &gt; 70%) resuscitation. Twenty-eight day mortality is the primary end point.</detailed_description>
