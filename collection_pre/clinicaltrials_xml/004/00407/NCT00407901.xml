	<brief_title>Functional Assessment Questionnaire for the Visually Challenged</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim of this research is to establish the scientific validity of an evaluation assessment tool that will measure the functional level of the visually challenged population. For this study a quantitative, self-evaluation tool has been designed to assess the functional skills at performing a variety of activities. It is called the Functional Assessment Questionnaire. The questionnaire is an innovative approach to measuring the level of these functional skills. It also includes critical benchmarks of real-world success that are not considered in assessing functional levels of the visually challenged, but are measures of evidence-based outcomes. It is a comprehensive measurement tool covering many areas of daily living, including: 1. Education Level 2. Employment Level 3. Income Level 4. Personal Living Skills 5. Kitchen Skills 6. Mobility Level 7. Reading/Writing Skills 8. Oral Communication Skills 9. Social Skills 10. Technology Level 11. Financial Management Skills 12. Recreation Skills 13. Organizational Skills 14. Independence Level Each of these categories include a progressive scale of 10 activities, 1 being the lowest level of functionality and 10 being the highest level of functionality. Most of the categories are easily self-evaluated, though some will require one-on-one discussion with the test administrator. At the completion of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, a functionality score, ranging between 14 and 140 is tabulated for each individual. In order to maintain scientific integrity of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, certain non-identifiable information will be collected on each human subject. This information includes: 1. Age 2. Sex 3. Visual Acuity (BCVA) 4. Peripheral Field 5. Diagnosed Eye Condition Comparative statistical analysis will be performed with the Functional Assessment Questionnaire results and the widely used SF-36 (36-Item Short Form Health Survey Instrument) and NEI-VFQ-25 with Appendix (National Eye Institute/Visual Function Questionnaire-25) questionnaires. The goal will be to check which questionnaire is more sensitive and accurate in measuring functional level outcomes both prior to (low-functioning individuals) and after (high functioning individuals) vision rehabilitation program participation.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Blindness</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Between ages of 18 and 80. Capacity to complete the informed consent process Legally blind (best corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or greater, and/or vision field of 20 degrees or less). Longterm or shortterm blindness with no or minimal vision rehabilitation. (These will be considered lowfunctioning subjects). or Legally blind with extensive vision rehabilitation, independent and selfsufficient. (These will be considered highfunctioning subjects). Patients who have incapacitating physical and mental challenges other than vision loss. Patients who are not legally blind. Patients who have had some vision rehabilitation, thus falling in between a highfunctioning and lowfunctioning category.</criteria>
