	<brief_summary>This post-marketing study is being conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of the Prolieve Thermodilatation® System (Prolieve®) in the treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). A secondary objective is to assess the safety and effectiveness of re-treatment with Prolieve® and determine the percent of subjects electing to be re-treated with Prolieve® rather than alternate therapy. This study will follow subjects treated with Prolieve® at 2 weeks, 3 months, and on a yearly basis for 5 years after treatment. Both efficacy and safety information will be collected at all follow-up visits. Procedural and safety information will be collected during treatment to further substantiate the findings of the pivotal trial.</brief_summary>
