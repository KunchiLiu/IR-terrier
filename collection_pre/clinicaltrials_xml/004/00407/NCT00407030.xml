	<criteria>Main Male or female outpatients between ages 18 and 75 years inclusive) A clinical diagnosis of cervical dystonia (i.e. spasmodic torticollis) with predominantly rotational form and a need for injection (determined by the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) Total score) TWSTRSTotal score &gt;= 20 TWSTRSSeverity score &gt;= 10 TWSTRSDisability score &gt;= 3 TWSTRSPain score &gt;= 1 On a stable dose of medications (if any) used for focal dystonia treatment (e.g. anticholinergics and benzodiazepines) for at least 3 months prior to and expected throughout the Main Period For pretreated patients only: Source documentation of the last two consecutive injection sessions with Botulinum Toxin and stable therapeutic response directly prior to trial entry For pretreated patients only: At least 10 weeks must have been passed between the last injection with Botulinum Toxin for cervical dystonia and baseline For pretreated patients only: The most recent injection with Botulinum Toxin must have been maximal 300 Units of type A or 12,000 Units of type B Main Traumatic torticollis or tardive torticollis TWSTRSSeverity score for anterocollis &gt;= 2 points (pure anterocollis) TWSTRSSeverity score for retrocollis &gt;= 2 points (pure retrocollis) Myotomy or denervation surgery in the affected muscles (e.g. peripheral denervation and/or spinal cord stimulation) Hypersensitivity to human serum albumin, sucrose, or Botulinum Toxin Type A Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, LambertEaton syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or any other significant neuromuscular disease which might interfere with the trial Current swallowing disorder of any origin (dysphagia scale &gt;= 3, i.e. severe, with swallowing difficulties and requiring a change in diet) Marked limitation on passive range of motion that suggests contractures or other structural abnormality, e.g. cervical contractures or cervical spine syndrome Treatment with Botulinum Toxins for any indication other than cervical dystonia within 4 months prior to baseline and during the trial</criteria>
