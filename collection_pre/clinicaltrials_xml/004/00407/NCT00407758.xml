	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Enzastaurin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well enzastaurin works in treating patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzastaurin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess the efficacy of enzastaurin hydrochloride, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival or objective tumor response, in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the effects of prognostic variables, including platinum sensitivity, initial performance status, and age, in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride 3 times on day 1 and then once daily on days 2-28 of course 1. For all subsequent courses, patients receive enzastaurin hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 68 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
