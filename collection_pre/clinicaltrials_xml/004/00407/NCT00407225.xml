	<brief_title>Study of Difluprednate Ophthalmic Emulsion in the Treatment of Postoperative Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of 0.002% and 0.05% difluprednate ophthalmic emulsions in patients with postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery (implantation of intraocular lens). In addition, the evaluation system for a future dose-finding phase III study of difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion will be established.</detailed_description>
