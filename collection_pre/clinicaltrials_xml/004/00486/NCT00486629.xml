	<brief_summary>The general goal of the present study is to assess the impact of a community-based exercise and dietary intervention in pregnant women living in urban areas during and after their pregnancy on the reduction of the risks of both diabetes and obesity in mothers and their offspring. We hypothesize that a community-based lifestyle intervention program during and after gestation may improve pregnancy outcomes in terms of reducing the risk of developing obesity or type 2 DM in mothers and their children.</brief_summary>
