	<detailed_description>Objective: The objective of this study is test the hypothesis that the shorter half-life of Pd-103 versus I-125, will increase the rate of tumor eradication. Research plan: A total of 660 patients with AJC clinical stage T1c-T2a prostatic carcinoma (Gleason grade 7 to 9 and/or PSA 10–20 ng/ml) will be randomized to implantation with I-125 (144 Gy) versus Pd-103 (124 Gy). Methodology: Randomization will be accomplished by the method of random permuted blocks. Cancer status will be monitored by yearly serial serum PSA. Treatment-related morbidity will be monitored by personal interview, using standard American Urologic Association and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Primary endpoint: Time to treatment failure. Patients with serum PSA above 0.5 ng/ml two years or more after treatment will be considered to have residual or recurrent cancer and to have failed therapy.</detailed_description>
