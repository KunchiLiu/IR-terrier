	<brief_title>The Registry to Study Safety and Performance of the CORDIS Vascular Reconstruction Device and Delivery System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The data will be collected in consecutive subjects treated with the commercially available product and following standard clinical practice. This registry will be limited to subjects who have received only the CORDIS ENTERPRISE™ VRD during the index procedure. While only limited inclusion or exclusion criteria are specified, uniform, complete and accurate data will be collected peri-procedurally, during the index hospitalization, and during follow-up up to 6 months. All subjects should be treated according to the Instruction For Use (IFU) including conduct of the VRD placement, coiling procedure, application of antiplatelet medication and any other medical therapy to be provided according to local usual practice.</detailed_description>
