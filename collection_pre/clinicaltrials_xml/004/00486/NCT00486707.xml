	<brief_title>Ovarian Cancer Patient Questionnaire on Genetic Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All eligible patients being seen in the Gynecology Center at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and at Gynecologic Oncology of Houston for follow-up or a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer will be asked to participate in this study by completing a questionnaire. This study will end when 400 completed questionnaires have been collected. We estimate that 40-60 ovarian cancer patients are seen in the Gynecology Center at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center each week and that 20- 40 ovarian cancer patients are seen at Gynecologic Oncology of Houston each week. The completion of 400 questionnaires will provide adequate data to address our question in an expeditious time frame. The initial phase of this study is exploratory and does not involve a comparison group.</detailed_description>
