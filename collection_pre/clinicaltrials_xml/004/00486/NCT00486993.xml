	<brief_summary>According to WHO estimations, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally. More people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. An estimated 17.5 million people died from CVDs in 2005, representing 30% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.6 million were due to coronary heart disease and 5.7 million were due to stroke. Over 80% of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries and occur almost equally in men and women. In Paraguay, prevalence of classic risk factors, as well as new ones, like the metabolic syndrome are not completely known. Government health policies in industrialized countries are focusing on programs to modify cardiovascular risk factors. In developing countries, prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke through modification of cardiovascular risk factors are not playing a large role at the moment. The aim of this study is to define the effects of changes in lifestyle on cardiovascular risk factors, when added to optimized standard pharmacological therapy for arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, in an ambulatory urban patient population.</brief_summary>
