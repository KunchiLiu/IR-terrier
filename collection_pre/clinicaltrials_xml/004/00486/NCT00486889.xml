	<brief_summary>Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their normal function. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term growth and development of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease with alglucosidase alfa before 1 year of age. Patients will be followed for 10-year period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient or patient's legal guardian must provide signed, informed consent prior to performing any studyrelated procedures; The patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease as determined by deficient endogenous acid alphaglucosidase (GAA) activity or GAA mutation analysis; and The patient must be &lt;1 year of age at time of study enrollment (and receive alglucosidase alfa treatment before 1 year of age), or the patient must be between 1 year and 24 months of age and must have initiated alglucosidase alfa treatment prior to turning 1 year of age. The patient is participating in another clinical study using alglucosidase alfa or any investigational therapy.</criteria>
