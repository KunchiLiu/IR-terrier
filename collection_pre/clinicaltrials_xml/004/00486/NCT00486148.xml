	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of an infant formula supplemented with a "prebiotic" component (GOS) in improving the gut microflora balance, mimicking that of breast-fed infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of an Infant Formula Supplemented With Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oligosaccharides are one of the major breast milk components. They are not digested and reach the colon where they're used by selected groups of microflora positive bacteria, specifically bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Therefore, oligosaccharides have prebiotic effects accountable for health benefits in infants. Over the last years the supplementation of infant formulae has been studied to mimic breast milk prebiotic functions enhancing gut microflora growth similar to that of breast fed infants. However further scientific data are necessary to support the efficacy of the supplementation of oligosaccharide in infant formulae.</detailed_description>
