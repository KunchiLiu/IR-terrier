	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to determine the optimal region of the lung for depositing Prolastin (alpha-1 antitrypsin; AAT) by inhalation in order to treat cystic fibrosis (CF). The AKITA® nebulizer has settings which can be varied to target the inhaled drug to either the deep lung or to the upper airways in a one to one randomization. The study will measure how much of the activity of the enzyme elastase is inhibited by AAT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deposition of Inhaled Prolastin in Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimum deposition site (bronchial or peripheral) in CF patients for AAT will be investigated by measuring several parameters in induced sputum. The study will start with a 2 week run-in period in which the planned 60 patients inhale isotonic saline once daily. This period is followed by a 4 week treatment period where 30 patients inhale AAT for peripheral deposition and 30 patients inhale AAT for bronchial deposition. Six patients in each group will be asked to collect spontaneous sputum at home. Twenty-five milligrams of AAT will be deposited at one of the two target sites using the AKITA® device. The inhalation should take place in the evening between 18.00 and 23.00 h. Patients will inhale saline once daily for 2 weeks (run-in period) followed by 4 weeks of once daily inhalation of AAT. Induced sputum will be collected at visits to the clinic at the start of the run-in, at the start of AAT treatment, and at 2 and 4 weeks after the start of AAT treatment.</detailed_description>
