	<brief_title>Anger Control Training for Youth With Tourette Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled study of a cognitive-behavioral, anger control training (ACT) in adolescents with Tourette Syndrome (TS) complicated by disruptive behavior. Disruptive behaviors in TS may take numerous forms including noncompliance, anger outbursts, and physical aggression. Anger outbursts in TS have been described as rage attacks or rage storms due to their high intensity and unpredictability in response to minimal provocation. Whether these behaviors are part of TS, related to comorbid conditions, or due to the burden of chronic illness is not clear. Nevertheless, these disruptive behaviors can result in significant functional impairment and often require clinical attention. The purpose of the ACT intervention is to improve the explosive and noncompliant behavior in adolescents with TS by enhancing affect regulation and social problem-solving skills. The treatment is based on anger control training which has been empirically supported for reducing aggressive behaviors and improving social functioning in aggressive youths. The primary outcome measures include the parent-rated Oppositional Defiant Scale and the Clinicians Global Improvement Score assessed by a clinician blind to treatment assignment.</detailed_description>
