	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subject has undergone previous nephrectomy. Subject has received at least 2 cycles (12 weeks) of treatment with sunitinib for RCC and stopped therapy due to progressive disease within 100 days prior to screening. Subject has measurable disease, defined as at least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion on a CT scan as defined by RECIST. ECOG Performance Score of 01. No history of another active cancer within the past 5 years.Life expectancy of at least 4 months. Willing to take adequate measures to prevent pregnancy. Exclusion Criteria Subject has received anticancer therapy within 21 days or within a period defined by 5 half lives, whichever is shorter, prior to study drug administration. Subject has untreated brain or meningeal metastases. Subject has received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) other than sunitinib or sorafenib. Prior use of Avastin is allowed. The subject is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. The subject has a history of/or currently exhibits clinically significant cancer related events of bleeding (e.g., hematuria, hemoptysis). The subject currently exhibits symptomatic or persistent, uncontrolled hypertension defined as diastolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 100 mmHg; or systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150 mmHg. The subject has a history of myocardial infarction within 6 months of Study Day 1. The subject has a documented left ventricular (LV) Ejection Fraction &lt; 50%. The subject has known autoimmune disease with renal involvement (eg, Lupus). Female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding. Subject is receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV. Subject has a clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including but not limited to: active uncontrolled infection, Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association functional classification system, unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, history of adrenal insufficiency, psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements; Active, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiadisease or any other conditions that interfere with absorption. Subject has a medical condition, which in the opinion of the study investigator places them at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.</criteria>
