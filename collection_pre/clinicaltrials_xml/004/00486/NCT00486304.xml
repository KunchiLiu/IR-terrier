	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Eating a diet that is low in antioxidants may control cachexia in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects of a low antioxidant diet in controlling cachexia in patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Antioxidant Diet in Controlling Cachexia in Patients With Oropharyngeal Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety of the antioxidant-deficient diet (ADD) in controlling cachexia in patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy. Secondary - Determine the safety of the ADD as measured by quality of life, peripheral DNA damage, and change in body weight. - Determine the effectiveness of the ADD on tumor growth and surrogate markers of tumor growth. - Determine whether the ADD is effective in improving the tumor cachexia syndrome in these patients. - Determine whether there is a serum metabolomic signature for the ADD. OUTLINE: This a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients consume a standard diet 3 times a day for 8 weeks. - Arm II: Patients consume an antioxidant-deficient diet (ADD) 3 times a day for 8 weeks. Patients receive replacement vitamins in week 9. All patients receive planned chemoradiotherapy in weeks 3-8. Quality of life, body composition (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), weight, and resting energy expenditure (by indirect calorimetry) are assessed at baseline and at week 8. Blood samples are collected at baseline and at 8 weeks. Samples are evaluated for cytokine levels; evidence of DNA damage from peripheral blood lymphocytes; and serum signature characteristic to ADD by multinuclear MRI spectroscopy. Patients undergo a tumor biopsy in week 4 for research studies. Samples are collected and evaluated for generation of reactive oxygen species by using antibodies against oxidatively modified DNA and lipids; apoptosis using TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay and classical morphological criteria; and levels of the tumor toxohormones lipid mobilizing factor and proteolysis inducing factor by real time-PCR, northern blotting, and western blotting methods. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed once during weeks 9-12.</detailed_description>
