	<brief_title>Hatha Yoga in Improving Physical Activity, Inflammation, Fatigue, and Distress in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine if the yoga intervention will decrease inflammation, fatigue, and depressive symptoms relative to the waiting-list controls in women who are stage 0-IIIa breast cancer survivors. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to stage of cancer (stage 0 vs stage I vs stage II and stage IIIA) and prior radiation therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. - Arm I (waiting-list control): Patients are encouraged to perform usual activities, but asked to refrain from any yoga practice or other related activities. After a six-month observation period, patients undergo yoga intervention as described in arm II . - Arm II (yoga intervention): Patients participate in a Hatha yoga intervention session comprising body postures and breath control techniques for 1.5 hours twice a week for 12 weeks. Patients are encouraged to practice Hatha yoga at home. Patients complete daily diaries on home Hatha yoga practices and submit them at each session.</detailed_description>
