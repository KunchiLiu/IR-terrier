	<brief_summary>Combined the chemoembolization and Radiofrequency ablation for the hepatocellular carcinoma greater than 3 cm,the ablation volume of coagulation necrosis can be significantly increased,which may be enable effective treatment of patients with HCC greater than 3 cm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemoembolization and Radiofrequency Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Greater Than 3 cm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess whether the effectiveness of a combination of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE) and radiofrequency ablation(RFA) is superior to TACE and RFA alone in treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)greater than 3 cm and to analyze the factors affecting the outcomes. The patients with HCC of 3 or fewer lesions, each 3cm greater in diameter entered this randomized controlled trial. The primary end point was survival, and the secondary end points were tumor response.</detailed_description>
