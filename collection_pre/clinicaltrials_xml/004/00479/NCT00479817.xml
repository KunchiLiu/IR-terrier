	<brief_summary>This study is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study to estimate the improvement in PFS (compared to control subjects) and evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 386 in combination with paclitaxel in the treatment of subjects with advanced recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Primary Outcome Measure: • Progression free survival (PFS) Secondary Outcome Measures: - Object Response Rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR). CA-125 response rate - Safety and Tolerability - Change and duration of change on blood levels of CA-125</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 AMG 386 in Comb. Paclitaxel for Subjects With Advanced Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To estimate the treatment effect as measured by progression free survival (PFS) of subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer receiving AMG 386 (either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV QW) in combination with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV QW; 3 on/1 off)compared to subjects receiving paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV QW; 3 on/1 off) plus placebo Secondary Objective(s): - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination regimen of AMG 386/paclitaxel - To estimate other measures of treatment effect (by parameters other than PFS) of subjects receiving AMG 386 in combination with paclitaxel compared to subjects receiving paclitaxel plus placebo - To evaluate the AMG 386 pharmacokinetics parameters (Cmax and Cmin ) when administered with paclitaxel in subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer - To estimate the incidence of occurrence of anti-AMG 386 antibody formation - To estimate the change and duration of change on blood levels of CA-125 - To evaluate the clinical benefit among subjects receiving AMG 386 10 mg/kg monotherapy after disease progression on paclitaxel - To estimate the impact of AMG 386 on patient reported ovarian cancer specific symptoms and HRQoL using the FACT-O, the FACT-O ovarian cancer subscale (OCS), and the FACT-O 3-item (O1, O2, O3) cancer symptom specific subscale (OCS 3-item subscale) Exploratory Objective(s): - To explore the associations between progression free survival, objective response, CA-125, and continuous measures of tumor burden (the percentage change from baseline in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions) - To explore the pharmacodynamic (PD) response as assessed by changes in blood levels of angiogenic cytokines, tumor apoptosis, CA-125 and other markers - To investigate the effects of genetic variation in drug metabolism, cancer genes and drug target genes on ovarian cancer and subject response to investigational product (separate informed consent) - To explore the impact of AMG 386 on patient reported overall health status as measured by the EuroQoL (EQ-5D) Hypothesis: This study will provide an estimate and corresponding 2-sided 80% confidence interval with an approximate maximum half-width of 0.22 of the efficacy, as measured by the PFS hazard ratio of AMG 386 in combination with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone for 2 pooled dose groups of AMG 386 (10 mg/kg QW and 3 mg/kg QW) in combination with paclitaxel versus the paclitaxel plus placebo group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In. Criteria Subjects must have histologically or cytologically documented epithelial ovarian (FIGO Stage IIIV), fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. (Subjects with pseudomyxoma or mesothelioma are excluded) Radiographically documented progression per RECIST criteria with modifications or progression of CA125 as defined by the Rustin during or subsequent to the last chemotherapy regimen. May include measurable or nonmeasurable disease All scans and xrays used to document measurable or nonmeasurable disease must be done within 3 weeks (21 days) of enrollment. No more than 3 previous regimens of anticancer therapy. Subjects must have received at least one platinum containing regimen Female 18 years of age or older at the time the written informed consent is obtained Subjects of childbearing potential who have not undergone a bilateral salpingooophorectomy and are sexually active must use an accepted and effective nonhormonal method of contraception (ie, double barrier method (eg, condom plus diaphragm)) from signing the informed consent through 6 months after last dose of study drug. Laboratory Adequate organ and hematological function as evidenced by the following laboratory studies within 2 weeks (14 days) of randomization: Hematological function, as follows: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L and ≤ 850 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL PTT or aPTT≤ 1.5 x ULN per institutional laboratory rand and INR ≤ 1.5 x 109/L per instiutiona laboratory range Renal function, as follows: Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 cc/min according to the CockcroftGault formula Hepatic function, as follows: Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present) Nutritional Albumin ≥ 2.8 mg/dL General GOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 Subject plans to begin protocol directed therapy within 7 days of randomization Ex Criteria Subjects believed to be a higher than average risk for bowel perforation.
