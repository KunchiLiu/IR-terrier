	<detailed_description>Research Design and Methods: Test meals rich in palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and containing 1,000 kcal each were administered in a randomized cross-over design every 3 to 4 days to 11 patients with T2DM. Serum insulin, glucose, and triglycerides concentrations were measured for 360 minutes. All subjects received an isoenergic diet of constant composition throughout the study.</detailed_description>
