	<brief_title>Safety And Efficacy Of Exubera Compared With Subcutaneous Human Insulin Therapy In Children And Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pfizer announced in October 2007 that it would stop marketing Exubera. At that time recruitment for the pediatric study, A2171083, was placed on hold. Two subjects completed the informed consent/assent process and entered the A2171083 study but none received treatment. The first subject withdrew consent during the Baseline Run-in period which was prior to Randomization. The second subject screen failed at Visit 1. After this time, Nektar, the company from which Pfizer licensed Exubera, announced on April 9, 2008 that it had stopped its search for a new marketing partner. Accordingly, there will be no commercial availability of Exubera. As a result, study A2171083 was terminated and no further recruitment took place.</detailed_description>
