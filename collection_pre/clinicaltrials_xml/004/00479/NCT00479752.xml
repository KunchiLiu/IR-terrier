	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Folfox4 + Weekly Cetuximab vs Folfox 4+Biweekly Cetuximab by Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter randomized phase II study will enroll approximately 150 patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer. Patients are randomized in Arm A(FOLFOX4 in combination with weekly Cetuximab) or Arm B (FOLFOX4 in combination with biweekly Cetuximab). Both efficacy and safety data will be collected. The investigator will assess response to treatment every 8 weeks based on the imaging. Following permanent treatment cessation, patients will be followed-up for survival.</detailed_description>
