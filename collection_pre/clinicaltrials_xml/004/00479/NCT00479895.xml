	<brief_summary>The test compound and subject of this clinical trial is the haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier, HBOC-201 (Hemopure). HBOC-201, initially developed as an alternative to red blood cells for surgical patients, has the ability to restore tissue oxygenation in persistently ischemic tissue. The development of this new class of compounds, referred to as oxygen therapeutics, provides an opportunity to test the safety and efficacy of a new approach to management of myocardial ischemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemoglobin Based Oxygen Therapeutics in Elective Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because of their ability to perfuse and deliver oxygen, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOC) may be considered in the treatment of several ischemic conditions, such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Elective percutaneous intervention (PCI) induces transient myocardial ischemia due to reduction of coronary flow during balloon inflation in the coronary artery, thus simulating in a control setting, the occurrence of an ACS.</detailed_description>
