	<brief_summary>Insoluble (1,3),(1,6)-beta-D-glucan from bakers yeast are indigestible polysaccharides. Previous studies indicate that the intake of insoluble dietary fiber is strongly associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms leading to this phenomenon are largely unknown. There are close relations between metabolic and inflammatory pathways, and a number of hormones, cytokines, signal proteins, bioactive lipids, and transcription factors have been shown to be involved in both systems. Beta-D-glucans have been suggested to play a role as so called biological response modifiers. Studies in animals indicate that even small doses of (1,3),(1,6)-beta-D-glucan may have beneficial effects on immune activity, i.e., by reducing the secretion of inflammatory factors. The investigators hypothesize that the intake of isolated (1,3), (1,6)-beta-D-glucan from bakers yeast improves inflammatory makers and insulin-sensitivity in overweight subjects with increased C-reactive protein concentrations at baseline.</brief_summary>
