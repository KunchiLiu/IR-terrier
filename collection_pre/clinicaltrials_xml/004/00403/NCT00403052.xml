	<brief_summary>The main objectives of this study are to establish a safe, tolerable and active dose of 1018 ISS administered in combination with irinotecan and cetuximab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Other objectives also include determining tumor response, time to disease progression, and overall survival in treated patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of 1018 Immunostimulatory Sequence (ISS) Administered With Irinotecan and Cetuximab to Treat Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label study of escalating dose levels of 1018 ISS in combination with irinotecan and cetuximab in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. Approximately 15 patients will be treated. The objectives of this study are to establish a safe, tolerable, and active dose of 1018 ISS, determine tumor response, time to disease progression, and overall survival in treated patients. The safety and tolerability of 1018 ISS will be evaluated by periodic laboratory assessments, physical examinations, and compilation of adverse events. Once study patients have been consented, screened, and assigned to one of the dose levels of 1018 ISS, patients will receive two 4 week cycles of 1018 ISS therapy plus irinotecan every other week and cetuximab weekly. Irinotecan and cetuximab will continue thereafter until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient refuses treatment.</detailed_description>
