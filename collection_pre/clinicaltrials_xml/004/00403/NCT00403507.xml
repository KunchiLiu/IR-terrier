	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if participation in an exercise program helps memory loss from getting worse, and if it improves daily functioning and attitudes of those with probable Alzheimer's disease. It will involve participation of both the person with memory loss and someone who knows their daily activities (e.g., husband, wife, adult child, or caregiver).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Treatment of Mild-Stage Probable Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there is no cure for the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease, though some medications can help it from getting worse. The research study will help to answer the question if participation in an exercise program helps memory loss from getting worse, and if it improves daily functioning and attitudes of those with probable Alzheimer's disease. It will involve participation of both the person with memory loss and someone who knows their daily activities. The research study is a randomized-control trial: some participants will be picked to participate in the exercise program, while others will not. Their memory, thinking abilities, activities, and attitudes will be measured at baseline and follow-up assessment 5-6 months later. Participants are in good health, and are treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor for memory loss (standard treatment).</detailed_description>
