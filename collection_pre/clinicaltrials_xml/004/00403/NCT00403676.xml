The Nor-Dmard study is a comparative, phase IV, longitudinal, observational study. All patients starting a DMARD regime are enrolled. Patients from two clinics (different parts of Norway) will be randomised to receive follow-up care from either a clinical nurse or a rheumatologist. The primary outcome measure is patient satisfaction measured by Leeds Satisfaction Questionnaire. The secondary outcome is effectiveness measured by Coping (CORS),Health related quality of life (SF-36) and Disease activity (MHAQ, DAS-28).</detailed_description>
