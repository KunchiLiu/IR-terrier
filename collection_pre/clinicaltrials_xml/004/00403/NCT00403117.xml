	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the subjective effects of marijuana will be decreased by low-doses (&lt; 25 mg) of naltrexone and increased by high-doses (&gt; 50 mg) of naltrexone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Range of Naltrexone Doses in Combination With Smoked Marijuana</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laboratory animal studies demonstrate that endogenous cannabinoids and opioids are closely inter-related. We have completed a series of studies in marijuana smokers showing that a clinically-utilized dose of naltrexone (50 mg) enhanced the reinforcing and subjective effects of orally-administered tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), while a low naltrexone dose (12 mg) blunted the effects of THC. A better understanding of the effects of a range of naltrexone doses in combination with smoked marijuana has important implications for the following reasons: (1) Alcohol- and opioid-dependent patients receive high doses of naltrexone (50-150 mg), which may increase the abuse liability of marijuana, (2) Low-dose naltrexone blunts THC's intoxicating effects, suggesting potential utility as a treatment medication for marijuana dependence. This study will determine if naltrexone (0, 12, 25, 50, 100 mg) administration 45 min prior to marijuana administration (0, 3.9% THC) alters marijuana's subjective, cognitive or physiological effects. Marijuana smokers will spend approximately 5h/day for a total of 10 days in the outpatient laboratory. Participants will visit the outpatient laboratory 2-3 times per week, with a minimum 48-hr interval between sessions to allow for naltrexone clearance. These data will provide important information regarding the clinical use of naltrexone.</detailed_description>
