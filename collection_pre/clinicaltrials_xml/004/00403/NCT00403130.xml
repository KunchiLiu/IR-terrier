	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the time-to-progression (TTP) in patients with metastatic breast cancer, receiving 1st line therapy with bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Secondary objectives will include response rates and overall survival (OS).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Previouslyuntreated metastatic breast cancer. May have had prior chest wall irradiation or palliative radiation to bony sites for control of pain or fracture. These sites of disease, however, will not be considered as sites of measurable disease. Use of bisphosphonates will be permitted. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Granulocyte count ≥ 1500/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL. Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) / serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) if alkaline phosphatase is ≤ ULN or alkaline phosphatase may be up to 4 x ULN if transaminases are ≤ ULN. Total bilirubin within institutional limits of normal. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min using the formula: Ccr(mL/min) = [(140age in years) X (wt in kg) X 0.85 (females)]/(72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL) ≥ 18 years of age. Prior anthracycline treatment in the adjuvant setting or prior chest wall radiation must have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within the institutional range of normal as assessed by pretreatment multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO). All patients must give signed written informed consent. May have received adjuvant therapy as long as therapy complete &gt; 12 months from study entry. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test taken ≤ 2 weeks prior to study enrollment, and must consent to the use of effective contraception during the study period and for 6months thereafter. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Receiving hormonal therapy Prior treatment for metastatic disease with cytotoxic agents or inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Her2NEUpositive breast cancers, by either immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 3+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Pregnant or lactating. Patients have had active malignancies other than breast cancer in the past 5 years with the exception of in situ carcinoma of the cervix or nonmelanomatous skin cancer. Active or unresolved infection. Preexisting peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 1. Prior history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel, gemcitabine, bevacizumab or drugs formulated with polysorbate 80. Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation in an experimental drug study. Blood pressure of &gt;150/100 mmHg Unstable angina New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure History of myocardial infarction within 6 months History of stroke within 6 months Clinicallysignificant peripheral vascular disease Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Presence of central nervous system or brain metastases Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 0, anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study Minor surgical procedures, fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days prior to Day 0 Urine protein:creatinine ratio ≥ 1.0 at screening History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to Day 0 Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures</criteria>
