	<detailed_description>Five to 10% of retinal detachments progressed to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), the common more cause of surgical failure of retina detachment. Despite the use of internal tamponades, the treatment of retinal detachments due to a progressed proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is still a problem. At present, conventional silicone oil, having a lower specific gravity than water, is an excellent tool in advanced PVR retinal detachment especially of the upper circumference. In the past, to diminish the re-detachments diverse heavier-than-water density endotamponades were investigated by to use in in cases of inferior PVR. However,heavier-than-water density endotamponades have demonstrated adverse short term effects. (Example: silicon dispersion: hypotension and inflammation) Recently, two new long-term heavier-than-water internal tamponades were introduced: Oxane HD [oil-RMN3-mixture] and Densiron [mixture of 30.5 vol% perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) with 69.5 vol% polydimethylsiloxane (silicone oil)], showing satisfying anatomical results and good intraocular tolerance. In the present study, we will compare the anatomical outcome, functional results and intraocular adverse effects of two types of heavier tamponades.</detailed_description>
