	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of kidney cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lenalidomide works in treating patients with advanced or unresectable kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Advanced or Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the best response in patients with advanced or unresectable renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with lenalidomide. - Evaluate the response duration, time to tumor progression, and survival of patients with advanced RCC treated with lenalidomide. - Evaluate the safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
