	<brief_title>Study to Examine the Efficacy and Safety of Movicol in the Treatment of Chronic Constipation in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a baseline period of 1 (one) week, subjects who had met the inclusion criteria were entered into the treatment phase of the study. Patients were randomised to receive either Movicol or matching Placebo for two (2) weeks. Following the treatment phase, patients underwent a two (2)-week placebo washout period prior to crossing over to receive the alternative treatment e.g. those patients who took Movicol were given the matching Placebo or vice versa on completion of the washout period for two (2) weeks. On completion of the double blind treatment phase, patients were given the option to participate in the eight (8) week open label post study follow-up. Patients who participated in the post study follow-up received Movicol.</detailed_description>
