	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: umbilical cord drainage of fetal blood after delivery of the infant would reduce the incidence of feto-maternal transfusion. Patients were randomized to placental drainage or no drainage at the time of cesarean section. The incidence of fetal to maternal transfusion was noted postoperatively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Placental Drainage of Fetal Blood at Cesarean Section on the Incidence of Feto-Maternal Transfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>86 patients were randomized to placental drainage vs. no drainage of fetal blood at the time of cesarean section. Kleihauer-Betke testing was performed within 12 hours postoperatively to assess the incidence of feto-maternal transfusion. A significant difference was found between the two groups.</detailed_description>
