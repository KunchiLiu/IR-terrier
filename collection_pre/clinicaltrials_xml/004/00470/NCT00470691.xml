	<brief_summary>At our hospital, all Colles' fractures deemed suitable for conservative treatment are reduced and immobilised with a plaster of Paris dorsal splint which is converted to a complete cast after 10 days. According to individual factors such as age, general health and radiological results after 10 days, some patients with severe redisplacement are readmitted to hospital for surgery. The main purpose of this study is to determine whether, during the first 10 days of immobilisation, a complete plaster cast or a dorsal plaster splint best retains the alignment of a reduced Colles' fracture. In addition, we aim to compare the complication rates of the two methods.</brief_summary>
