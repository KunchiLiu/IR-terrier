	<brief_summary>Falls are a major concern for the geriatric population and represent a significant public health problem. Various interventions are being explored to improve balance and decrease falls in the elderly. Success has been shown in some programs; various exercise interventions place emphasis on strength, balance, or endurance exercises. Results reported in the literature are still equivocal. Controversy exists as to optimal types of exercise, and the optimum frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise. It is believed that the SpineForce device, which places a unique combination of strength and balance demands upon the user, can result in rapid increases in balance as compared to other rehabilitation programs. Gains in balance have implications for geriatric populations as well as those seeking enhanced sports performance and injury prevention. The Purpose of this study is to assess the SpineForce device as a novel intervention in the treatment of balance disorders.</brief_summary>
