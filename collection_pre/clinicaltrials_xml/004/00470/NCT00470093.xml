	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Interleukin-6 may stimulate the white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Giving interferon alfa together with interleukin-6 may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well giving interferon alfa together with interleukin-6 works in treating patients with recurrent multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon Alfa and Interleukin-6 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent multiple myeloma treated with recombinant interferon alfa and recombinant interleukin-6. - Determine the safety and optimal dose of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the impact of this regimen on clonogenic growth of myeloma cells in serial in vitro assays. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive recombinant interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) once daily. Beginning 1 month later, patients also receive recombinant interleukin-6 SC once daily. Treatment continues for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
