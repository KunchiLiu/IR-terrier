	<brief_title>Randomised Trial of Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics Cream and Oral Sucrose Solution for Venepuncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venepuncture is a painful procedure commonly performed in premature infants. Nonpharmacological intervention (oral sucrose solution) can reduce neonatal pain. EMLA cream is an oil in water emulsion of an eutectic mixture of prilocaine and lignocaine; it is an local anesthetic cream. Very few reports have looked at the efficacy of EMLA in preterm infants. This randomized bicentric trial will investigate the efficacy of topical EMLA cream with oral sucrose solution compared to oral sucrose solution alone before venepuncture in preterm infants.</detailed_description>
