	<brief_summary>Allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the only causative treatment of IgE-mediated allergies. The disadvantages of SIT, however, are the requirement of numerous allergen administrations over three to five years, and that the treatment itself causes frequent allergic reactions. We aim at enhancing grass pollen SIT in hay fever patients by injecting the allergen directly into subcutaneous lymph nodes. In a monocentric randomized trial safety and efficacy of intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT) with 3 low dose grass pollen extract injections over 2 months are compared to subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) using 54 injections over 3 years. - Trial with immunodulatory product / biological</brief_summary>
