	<brief_summary>This is a study to assess the effectiveness and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for depressed 13-18 year olds. In rTMS high-intensity, fluctuating magnetic fields non-invasively stimulate the cortex of the brain depolarizing neurons. No anesthetic is required and the treatment in subconvulsive. Recent studies suggest that rTMS can be an effective treatment for depressive illness in adults (Loo and Mitchell, 2005) and appears to be quite safe. Minimal data of TMS use in adolescents psychiatric disorders. Data only existed in seven patients of the four that were depressed two showed improvement in their depression (Quintana, 2005). No sham-controlled studies have been conducted. The investigators wish to assess this in a sham-controlled study of 30 adolescents. The investigators hypothesize that rTMS will have an antidepressant effect and produce no neuropsychological impairment.</brief_summary>
