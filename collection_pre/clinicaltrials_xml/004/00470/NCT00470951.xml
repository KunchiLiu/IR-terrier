	<brief_title>Randomized Prospective Trial for Laparoscopic vs Open Resection for Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Title: A comparison for laparoscopically assisted and open surgery for advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation - randomized prospective trial 2. Principal investigator: Jae Hwan Oh Co-investigator: Seung Yong Jeong, Sung Bum Kang, Hyo Seong Choi, Seok-Byung Lim 3. Purpose of the study: To compare efficacy of laparoscopic and open resection for locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation 4. Specific aims 1. comparison of oncologic outcomes 2. comparison of quality of life 3. comparison of anorectal function 5. Materials Rectal cancer &lt;9cm from anal verge, measured by rigid sigmoidoscopy histologically proven adenocarcinoma locally advanced (T3), determined by CT, transrectal ultrasonography, MRI without any contraindication for general anesthesia,operation and chemoradiation Completion of preoperative chemoradiation 6. Statistics 1. Sample size calculation for non-inferiority trial: 340 2. Disease free survival: Log-rank test,Cox regression analysis 3. QOL and anorectal function: Repeated measured ANCOVA 7. Methods 1. operation time of operation : 6-8 weeks after end of preoperative chemoradiation surgical technique standard total mesorectal excision and high ligation of inferior mesenteric vessels 2. preoperative chemoradiation chemotherapy: 2 cycles of 5-FU (400 mg/m2/day) + LV (20 mg/m2/day) IV bolus, for 3 days in 1st &amp; 5th wks of RT or Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 p.o. bid during RT RT:45 Gy/ 25 fractions to the pelvis, 5.4 Gy/ 3 fractions boost to the primary tumor over 5.5 wks 3. postoperative chemotherapy 4 cycles of 5-FU (400 mg/m2/day) + LV (20 mg/m2/day) IV bolus, for 5 days, 4 wks interval 4. oncologic outcomes 1. Short-term outcomes Surgical length of incision op time blood loss intraoperative complications conversion rate Pathological resection margins (proximal, distal, circumferential) number of harvested lymph nodes length of resected bowel tumor regression grade (Dworak's grading) TNM staging Perioperative recovery duration of use of parenteral narcotics initiation of peristalsis initiation of oral intake duration of hospital stay 30-day postoperative mortality morbidity 2. Long-term outcomes Primary end point Disease free survival (3 years after surgery) Secondary end points Overall survival Local recurrence Distant metastasis Port-site and wound site recurrence 5. Quality of life Urinary function Duration of urinary catheterization Residual urine volume at discharge International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) Male sexual function International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Female sexual function Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) QOL assessment EORTC QLQ C30 EORTC QLQ CR38 6. Anorectal function Anorectal manometry Maximum Resting Pressure Maximum Squeezing Pressure High Pressure Zone Sphincter Length Sensory Threshold Rectal Capacity Rectal Compliance Rectoanal Inhibitory Reflex Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI)</detailed_description>
