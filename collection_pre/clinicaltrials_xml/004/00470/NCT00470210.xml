	<brief_summary>This trial will assess the sustained virologic response to treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a combined with high-dose ribavirin in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 or 4 coinfection and persistent transaminase elevations. These patients will have been nonresponders to previous regimens with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy at a dosage of 800-1200 mg/d.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peginterferon Alfa-2a, Ribavirin and Epoetin Î² in Coinfected Patients HCV/HIV Not Responding to Previous Treatment Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose in treating chronic HCV infection in HIV-coinfected individuals is to clear HCV-RNA antibodies and cure the infection. Studies have shown that high doses of ribavirin are associated with higher response rates than those achieved with ribavirin at dosages of 800-1200 mg/d. The main aim of this trial is to assess the sustained virologic response to treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus high-dose ribavirin in HIV-infected patients coinfected with HCV genotypes 1 or 4 who have had persistent transaminase elevations and lack of response to previous treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin at dosages of 800-1200 mg/d. The second aim will be to measure changes in serum HCV-RNA titers and the percentage of patients achieving serum viral loads of &lt; 50 IU/mL during treatment. Finally, we also intend to evaluate the safety of this treatment regimen.</detailed_description>
