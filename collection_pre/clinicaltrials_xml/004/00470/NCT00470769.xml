	<brief_summary>It is generally assumed that renal blood flow is symmetric in the absence of renal artery stenosis. The importance of studying the function of both kidneys separately is because it cannot be assumed that they are functionally equal.The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether this is really in patients with essential hypertension and/or moderate kidneys loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Color-Doppler Ultrasonography to Assess the Renal Blood Flow With the Estimation of GFR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To validate color Doppler ultrasonography of renal arteries for the assessment of renal blood flow (RBF), we comparing left and right RBF estimates and their sum (total RBF) by echo-Doppler with data obtained by 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy in 50 patients with hypertension and/or moderate renal failure, compared with 30 normal control subjects.</detailed_description>
