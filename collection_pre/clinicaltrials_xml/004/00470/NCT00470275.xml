	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cytarabine works in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory Ewing's sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytarabine in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Ewing's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in younger patients with recurrent or refractory Ewing's sarcoma treated with cytarabine. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 11 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
