	<criteria>Male or female Asian patients 50 years of age or greater. Patients with primary or recurrent subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD, including those with predominantly classic, minimally classic or active occult lesions with no classic component. Patients who have a BCVA score between 73 and 24 letters (approximately 20/40 to 20/320 Snellen equivalent), inclusively, in the study eye. Total area of CNV (including both classic and occult components) encompassed within the lesion must be &gt;= 50% of the total lesion area Total lesion area must be &lt;= 12 disc areas Patients who have in the fellow eye a Snellen equivalent below 20/200 Presence of angioid streaks, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, myopia (exceeding 8 diopters), or CNV secondary to causes other than AMD in the study eye Subfoveal fibrosis or atrophy in the study eye Total area of CNV (including both classic and occult components) encompassed within the lesion must be &gt;= 50% of the total lesion area Total lesion area must be &lt;= 12 disc areas Vitreous hemorrhage, retinal tear or history of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the study eye. Active, or history of, ocular inflammation or infection in the study eye within the last 30 days prior to screening. Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye Treatment in the study eye with verteporfin, externalbeam radiation therapy, subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy, submacular surgery, or transpupillary thermotherapy within 30 days prior to screening Previous treatment with antiangiogenic drugs (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, anecortave acetate, corticosteroids, protein kinase C inhibitors, squalamine, siRNA, VEGFTrap etc.) for neovascular AMD in the study eye. Treatment of the fellow eye is permitted if administered &gt; 30 days before screening. History of intraocular surgery in the study eye including pars plana vitrectomy, except for uncomplicated cataract surgery more than 60 days prior to screening History of YAG laser posterior capsulotomy in the study eye within 30 days prior to screening</criteria>
