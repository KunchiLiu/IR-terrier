	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain information on all patients being cared for by the ILD program in an effort to better understand the natural course of these diseases. Hopefully getting this information will lead to a better understanding of how these diseases behave with time. This in turn, will let physicians' better treat patients in the future. Another goal of the study is to be able to see if in the future a patients' genetics can be linked to the type of disease they have and the way it behaves. We do not yet know what that may be. Our goal is to study this in aggregate rather than in any individual patients. Which genes to study are also unclear. But the only hope of having a clearly defined group to match the genetics to in the future requires that we obtain samples now in conjunction with collecting the data on the disease progression.</brief_summary>
