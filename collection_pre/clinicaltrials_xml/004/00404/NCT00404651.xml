	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to clinically confirm that the manufacturing process of the final bulk products of the investigational DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine is consistent. The primary objective is to demonstrate the equivalence of three batches of DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine, in terms of seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the vaccine antigens after the three-dose primary series. The secondary objectives are: - To describe in each group, the immunogenicity parameters for all antigens one month after the third dose of the primary series - To assess the overall safety in each group one month after the third dose of the primary series.</brief_summary>
