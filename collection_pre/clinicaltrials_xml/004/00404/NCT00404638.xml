	<brief_title>Treatment of Enuresis Nocturna by Circular Muscle Exercise (Paula Method)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paula method is based on circular muscle exercises. The theory behind the Paula method is that all sphincters in the human body work simultaneosly, mutually affecting one another possibly mediated by "oscillation" of the spinal cord. According to this theory, exercising the ring muscles in a certain area of the body will result in strengthening the circular muscles in other areas. This method was found to to be efficacious for treatment of urinary stress incontinence in women.</detailed_description>
