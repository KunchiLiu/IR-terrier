	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the feasibility of using Avastin plus platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin-gemcitabine or carboplatin-paclitaxel) in patients with advanced or recurrent squamous non-small cell lung cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy. Patients will receive preventive radiation, followed by one cycle of chemotherapy alone and 5 cycles of chemotherapy in combination with Avastin (15mg/kg iv on day 1 of each 3 weekly cycle), followed by Avastin alone for a maximum total treatment period with Avastin of 12 months. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
