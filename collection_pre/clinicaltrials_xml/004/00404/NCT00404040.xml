The aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Movicol in the treatment of faecal impaction in children</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Movicol in Childhood Constipation (ProMotion Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two days following disimpaction (Part I of the clinical trial) patients were assigned (based on their randomisation number) to receive either Movicol or Lactulose as maintenance therapy for the remainder of the study. At discharge all patients received the appropriate supply of study medication. This includes 1 weekâ€™s overage should they miss their next visit to the ProMotion clinic. They did not know whether they have been randomised to receive Movicol or Lactulose Dry. Following discharge patients were contacted after 3-5 days by telephone or home visit (whichever was appropriate) to encourage treatment and to ensure compliance. Parents were instructed to contact the Pro-Motion team who would advise appropriately if patients had any difficulty i.e. none, irregular and/ or uncomfortable or very loose bowel movements. The daily use of Movicol or Lactulose Dry during Part II was recorded in the diary. If the dose of Movicol or Lactulose was changed by the Pro-Motion team at any time then it was documented appropriately in the patient notes and the case report form.</detailed_description>
