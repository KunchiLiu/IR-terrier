	<brief_summary>We will investigate the effect of peritendinous corticosteroid injections, eccentric training and heavy resistance training in male patellar tendinopathy patients. The purpose is to compare the clinical effect of these three treatments in a randomised controlled trial. Also we wish to investigate the treatment mechanisms responsible for the effectiveness of the three treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Peritendinous Corticosteroid Injections, Eccentric Training and Heavy Slow Resistance Training in Patellar Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3 interventions groups as described above (n=13 in each group) 12 weeks intervention period. Clinical assessments before and after intervention: VAS, VISA, Tendon thickness, Doppler us activity. Before and after intervention tendon biopsies will be taken and analyzed for crosslinks and fibril diameter. Also tendon mechanical properties will be measured. Tendon and muscle structural properties will be measured with MRI. Treatment satisfaction will be stated after intervention period.</detailed_description>
