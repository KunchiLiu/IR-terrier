	<brief_title>Effects of Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy on Adaptive, Aberrant and Stereotyped Behaviors in Children With Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Positive treatment effects of HBOT have been reported in a number of studies, while others have found no demonstrable effect. Studies to date have evaluated effects on a variety of conditions, and utilized diverse research methods and generally await replication. Despite its increasing usage in children with autism, and the preliminary anecdotal reports indicating positive outcome, there is a paucity of well-controlled studies of HBOT in this population, which precludes clinicians from recommending and/or implementing it as an evidence-based treatment. It is clearly important therefore, to evaluate carefully the treatment effects of HBOT using robust research designs in this population. Hypotheses - Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will be associated with a positive effect on symptoms of autism. - Treatment gains obtained from Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will be maintained at follow-up. Specific Aims - Evaluate the effects of Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy on behavioral and cognitive symptoms of autism before, during, and after treatment. - Determine the percentage of children with autism who respond positively to 80 HBOT treatment cycles and the extent to which they do so. - Determine the extent to which any observed treatment effects are maintained up to three months after HBOT. Study duration: Two weeks baseline, 10-15 week acute phase, with 1- and 3-month follow-ups. All participants will spend one hour per session in hyperbaric oxygen chambers, for a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 10 sessions per week. A total of 80 cycles of one hour compressions must be completed within 15 weeks for all participants Treatment Group: Pressure and Frequency - 1.3 atmosphere absolute (ATA) - 24% oxygen - One session = 1 hour - Total of 80 cycles of one hour compressions must be completed within 15 weeks. Placebo Group: Pressure and Frequency - Close to ambient air pressure, but the chamber needs enough pressure to inflate: 1.05 to 1.1 atmosphere absolute (ATA) - Room Air - One session = 1 hour - Total of 80 cycles of one hour compressions must be completed within 15 weeks.</detailed_description>
