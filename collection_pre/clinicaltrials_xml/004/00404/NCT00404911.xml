	<brief_title>Multi-Family Group Therapy for Reducing Behavioral Difficulties in Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) are two common childhood psychiatric disorders. Children with ODD frequently have temper tantrums, argue excessively with adults, deliberately attempt to annoy or upset people, and blame others for their mistakes or behavior. Children with CD may exhibit aggression toward people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness, and rule breaking. The symptoms of these disorders can negatively affect children's social, family, and academic lives. Research has shown that early, comprehensive treatment leads to better treatment outcomes. Both disorders are commonly treated using parent training techniques. A multiple family group therapy setting may prove to be more engaging and beneficial than standard care for both parents and children. This study will examine the effectiveness of a multiple family group (MFG) mental health service delivery strategy in improving mental health service use and treatment outcome for urban, low income children of color with ODD or CD. Participants in this 18-month, open-label study will be randomly assigned to either receive standard of care or participate in an MFG in addition to receiving standard of care. Participants assigned to standard of care will receive treatment that is traditionally offered to outpatients. Participants in an MFG will meet in their groups once a week for 16 weeks. Sessions will include adult caregivers and all children over age 6. Each session will follow the same procedures, and will proceed through the following stages: creating social networks; information exchange; group discussions; individual family practice; and homework assignment. Assessments of youth functioning will be held at Weeks 8 and 16 and Months 6 and 18 post-treatment.</detailed_description>
