	<brief_summary>Low back pain (LBP) is the most frequent cause of sick leave and disability pension, and degenerative and osteoarthritic (OA) changes is a significant cause of pain and disability. Some indications exist for symptomatic and possible cartilage-structurmodifying effect on knee- and hip-osteoarthritis with glucosamine sulphate (GS). The OA process in the lumbar spine is most likely to OA processes in knees and hips, hence GS could have comparable symptomatic and structural effect on lumbar OA. Study hypothesis: No difference in treatment effect exists between oral intake of GS- or placebo-capsules for patients` with chronic low back pain measured with Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire.</brief_summary>
