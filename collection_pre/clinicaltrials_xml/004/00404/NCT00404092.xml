	<brief_title>Caspofungin Maximum Tolerated Dose in Patients With Invasive Aspergillosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due to its efficacy and a broad antifungal spectrum against relevant fungal pathogens, lack of cross-resistance to azoles and amphotericin B, documented efficacy against human Aspergillus infections, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and excellent tolerability according to the current data, caspofungin is a highly promising candidate for improving the results of treatment of invasive fungal infections. Preclinical and clinical data indicate a dose dependent antifungal efficacy of caspofungin as well as of other echinocandins such as micafungin and anidulafungin. Thus it appears reasonable to investigate the impact of higher doses of caspofungin to improve the results already achieved with this component so far. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of caspofungin and the distribution of the drug in patients following administration of doses of 70 mg or more are not yet known. We therefore investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of caspofungin in rising doses in a dose escalation study in adult patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis.</detailed_description>

Evidence of proven or probable invasive aspergillosis, by modified EORTC criteria Concomitant other systemic antifungal agents are not permitted on study. Chronic invasive fungal infection, defined as signs/symptoms of invasive fungal infection present for &gt; 4 weeks preceding entry into study Prior systemic therapy of ≥ 4 days with any polyene antifungal agent within 14 days of study enrollment Prior systemic therapy of ≥ 4 days with nonpolyenes for the current, documented IFI.</criteria>
