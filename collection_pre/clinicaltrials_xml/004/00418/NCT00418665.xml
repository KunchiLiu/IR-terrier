	<brief_summary>This is a dose and schedule finding study of AMG 531 designed to assess the activity of AMG 531 to reduce the rate of clinically significant bleeding and blood transfusions in subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) receiving lenalidomide. Subjects with MDS that are planned to receive at least four cycles of lenalidomide for treatment of their disease are appropriate to screen for this study. All subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will receive lenalidomide 10 mg capsule by mouth daily every day of each 28-day cycle. Subjects will receive AMG 531 or placebo once a week by subcutaneous injection for 16 weeks.</brief_summary>
