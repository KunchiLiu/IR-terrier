	<brief_title>Combined CABG and Stem-Cell Transplantation for Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of symptomatic heart failure in general population is up to 2% and the prevalence increases rapidly with age. Half of the patients with symptomatic heart failure will die within 4 years of diagnosis.The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of bone marrow-derived stem cell transplantation in left ventricular ejection fraction. Consecutive patients with systolic heart failure (n=60), with ischemic coronary heart disease, scheduled to by-pass-operation (CABG) will be collected from cardiovascular laboratory and outpatient clinic of Helsinki University Central Hospital. Patients should have heart failure with ejection fraction between 15 to 45%. Randomly patients are selected to receive a stem cell transplantation with best possible heart failure medication, or without cell transplantation. In this study, 30 patients are receiving bone marrow transplantation, and 30 patients are serving as a control population. All patients will receive CABG.The study will be carried out with randomized, double blind techniques for one year. Randomization (in blocks) will be based on a table of random numbers.Bone marrow and patients own serum will be blinded by using colored syringe, so that the doctor transfusing the sample, will not be able to know the nature of the sample. From all patients, a right atrial biopsy will be collected for assessment of autologous cardiac stem cells. Also sample of pericardial fluid will be collected for measures of growth factors. Comparisons: Preoperatively, patients will be imagined by cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, cardiac PET and SPECT. Serum pro-BNB samples will be collected. Postoperatively at 3 months and 6 months pro-BNB and cardiac ultrasound will be evaluated. At one year cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, cardiac PET and SPECT will be reassessed. Heart failure and coronary artery disease treatments beside the transplantation will be optimized according to the judgment of the doctors of the outpatients clinic. Primary endpoint of the study is the change of ejection fraction in MRI images.</detailed_description>
