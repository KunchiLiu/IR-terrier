	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether an oral administration of Phosphatidylserine-Omega3 would significantly improve the clinical symptoms of children suffering from ADHD. Both the behavior and the academic achievements aspects will be evaluated. In addition, we intend to measure side-effects and adverse events and to examine the possible correlation between biochemical and behavioral alterations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of Phosphatidylserine-Omega3 in Children With Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 15-weeks duration trial to assess safety and efficacy of Phosphatidylserine-Omega3 in children diagnosed with ADHD, according to the DSM-IV. Following screening, the subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups:Phosphatidylserine-Omega3 or placebo, in a 2:1 manner. This will be followed by an open-label extension, in which Phosphatidylserine-Omega3 will be administered to all eligible participants. Primary measures of attention and behavior will be evaluated using Conners Rating Scale (CRS) teacher- rating scales. As a secondary endpoint, the attention and behavior will be measured by CRS and strength and difficulties questionnaires (SDQ) parental- and SDQ teacher-rating scales, assessment a continuous performance test (TOVA), and parental Child Health questionnaire (CHQ). Improvement in ADHD symptoms will be evaluated by Clinical Global of Impression - Improvement (CGI-I). Finally, tolerability will be monitored using Barkley Side Effects Rating Scale (SERS) and biochemical parameters, such as fatty acid profile and monoamines metabolites will be assessed as well.</detailed_description>
