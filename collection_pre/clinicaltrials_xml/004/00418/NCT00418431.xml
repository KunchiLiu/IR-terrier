	<brief_summary>Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) has been known since it was first described by Von Graefe and termed “idiopathic detachment of the macula” in 1866, is a well-characterized disorder leading to serous neurosensory elevation of the central macula. The acute form of the disease is associated with focal leakage at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) demonstrated with fluorescein angiography (FA). The disorder is self-limited in the majority of patients, who also regain excellent vision. Occasionally, the neurosensory detachment persists and leads to pigment epithelial and photoreceptor damage with visual impairment. The purpose of this clinical study is report the use of intravitreal bevacizumab is a new option in the treatment of the chronic or recurrent CSC.</brief_summary>
