Chronic inflammation on liver biopsy compatible with a diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis. Patients unable to take oral medications. Use of interferon alpha within 90 days or ribavirin within 30 days prior to enrollment. Females of child bearing age who are either pregnant, breastfeeding or not using birth control and are sexually active. Any investigational drug therapy within 30 days prior to enrollment. Patients with other causes of liver disease. Patients coinfected with hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis D virus based on enzyme immunoassay. Patients with history of alcoholism or with an alcohol consumption of &gt;40 grams per day. Patients who are clinically unstable. Patients with any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator would preclude evaluation of response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy and followup could be completed. History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to nitazoxanide or any of the excipients comprising the nitazoxanide tablets.</criteria>
