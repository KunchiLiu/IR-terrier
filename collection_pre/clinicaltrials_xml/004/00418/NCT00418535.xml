	<brief_summary>Nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma is a peculiar clinico-pathologic subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Although most patients present with stage I/II, only 30-60% of the patients remain disease-free. The efficacy of the conventional anthracycline-based chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone [CHOPP]) has been unsatisfactory. The optimal treatment of localized NK/T-cell lymphoma has not been defined yet. The optimal dose, sequence, and multi-modality treatment with involved field radiotherapy still need to be refined. This trial is to evaluate the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin followed by VIPD (etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin, dexamethasone) in localized NK/T-cell lymphoma patients.</brief_summary>
