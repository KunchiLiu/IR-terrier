Measurable or assessable disease. Life expectancy &gt;2 months. Patients with a therapeutic risk level of &lt;5 points (see section 6: "Treatment flowchart"). Age &gt;18 years; Performance status (WHO) &lt;2; One measurable target lesion in a non irradiated region; Prior radiotherapy authorized unless it targeted the only measurable lesion; Biological criteria: WBC &gt;2000/mm3, PMN &gt;1500/mm3, platelets &gt;100 000/mm3, creatinemia &lt;2 x ULN, bilirubinemia &lt;ULN, ALT and AST &lt;2.5 x ULN (&lt; 5 N if liver metastases) normal ECG written informed consent. Non smallcell lung cancer. No objective response to platinumbased therapy Complete response lasting more than three months after the last course of firstline treatment. Symptomatic brain metastases. Bone metastases, carcinomatous lymphangitis, ascites or pleurisy as sole assessable disease manifestations. Concurrent participation in another clinical trial.
