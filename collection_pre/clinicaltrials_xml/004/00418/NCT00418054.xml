	<criteria>Age â‰¥18 years. Chronic hepatitis C infection (at least 6 months) evidenced by a positive enzyme immunoassay for antiHCVantibodies and a positive quantitative RTPCR amplification of HCV RNA. Chronic inflammation on liver biopsy compatible with a diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis. HCV genotype 4. Patients that have not previously received peginterferon. Patients unable to take oral medications. Use of ribavirin within 30 days prior to enrollment. Females who are either pregnant, breastfeeding or not using birth control and are sexually active. Any investigational drug therapy within 30 days prior to enrollment other than through Romark study number RM013027. Patients with other causes of liver disease. Transplant recipients receiving immune suppression therapy. Patient coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis D virus based on enzyme immunoassay. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;80,000), neutropenia, history of variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or CTP scores &gt;6. Patients with history of alcoholism (unless abstinent for 2 years) or with an alcohol consumption of &gt;20 grams per day. Patients who are clinically unstable. Patients with any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator would preclude evaluation of response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy and followup could be completed. History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to any of the excipients comprising the nitazoxanide tablets or peginterferon alfa2b solution for injection.</criteria>
