	<brief_title>Safety Study of Tarceva in Children With Refractory and Relapsed Malignant Brain Tumors and Newly Diagnosed Brain Stem Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prognosis in relapsing malignant brain tumors is poor. Those in brain stem gliomas is dismal; median survival of these children does not exceed 9 months. Radiation therapy may result in early and transient amelioration of symptoms, but have not contributed to increase or prolong survival. Moreover, chemotherapy has not increased this outcome to date.Prados et al. reported encouraging results from a phase I study of TarcevaTM/OSI-774 alone or with temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with malignant gliomas. Of 25 evaluated patients, 6 experienced PR: 4 GBM (glioblastoma multiforme) and 1 grade 3 astrocytoma treated with TarcevaTM alone, 1 GBM treated with TarcevaTM/TMZ; 2 had minor responses, and 3 stable diseases. These results in malignant glioma and the lack of efficacy in brain stem glioma with current treatment suggests the evaluation of this new therapeutic agent in children with relapsed brain tumors and upfront at diagnosis in brain stem glioma in combination with radiation therapy.</detailed_description>
