	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a once-weekly dose of etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis. Currently, patients in Japan can only use 25 mg etanercept two times a week. If a once-a-week regimen of 50 mg is approved, this would be more convenient for most patients. This once-weekly regimen is used in countries outside of Japan.</brief_summary>
