	<brief_summary>The Archus Total Facet Arthroplasty System® (TFAS®) is a non-fusion spinal implant indicated for treatment of patients with moderate to severe spinal stenosis. TFAS® replaces the diseased facets following surgical removal. TFAS® offers the surgeon new options for treating spinal stenosis patients, enabling a more comprehensive decompression via complete removal of the facets. TFAS® also offers an alternative to rigid spinal fusion fixation enabling intervertebral motion. The clinical trial is intended to demonstrate restoration of stability and sagittal balance to the spine. TFAS® also eliminates the need for painful bone graft harvest from the patient's hip which may be required with fusion procedures.</brief_summary>
