	<brief_title>Interruption of Dorsal Visual Stream Using TMS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participants performed two tasks under three different TMS conditions: no TMS, 10Hz TMS for over the dorsal stream (PO3 EEG site) or over the vertex. First they performed a perceptual closure task which asked them to identify an object in a series of six progressively less degraded pictures. Then, they also performed a control task previously shown not to be mediated by the LOC and not to be impaired in schizophrenia: The perception of illusory contours.</detailed_description>
