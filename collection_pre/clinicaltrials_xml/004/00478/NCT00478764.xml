	<brief_title>Intraocular Steroid After Cataract Surgery Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized controlled trial included 80 eyes of 40 patients having routine phacoemulsification of cataract. Patients between 40 and 80 years of age who met enrollment criteria, required cataract surgery in both eyes, and agreed to participate, were enrolled in the study over a nine month period in 2006 at the office of one cataract surgeon. Eyes were randomly assigned to receive either the eye drop or injection protocol on the initial consultative visit. All surgery was preformed by one surgeon (JGS) using topical anesthesia, the Infiniti phacoemulsification system (Alcon) and an Acrysof SN60WF (Alcon) intraocular lens. The fellow eye was operated upon using the same technique and instrumentation two weeks later and was assigned to the group opposite the first eye. All eyes were examined by the operating surgeon at days 1, 8, 15, 30 and 90 postoperatively with uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, corneal edema, anterior chamber cell and flare recorded.</detailed_description>
