	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: In animal models, stem cells have been shown to home to the skin and repair the biochemical and structural abnormalities associated with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) (collagen 7 deficiency). PURPOSE: To determine the safety and effectiveness of stem cell infusion in the treatment of RDEB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant For Epidermolysis Bullosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Estimate the incidence of detectable donor-derived collagen type VII at day 100 in patients with epidermolysis bullosa by donor. Secondary - Determine the incidence of transplant-related mortality at day 180 - Determine the incidence of blood chimerism at days 21, 100, 180, 365, and 730 - Determine the incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 42 and platelet recovery at day 180 - Determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and grade III-IV at day 100 - Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year - Determine the probability of survival at 1 and 2 years - Determine the incidence of donor derived cells in the skin - Determine resistance to blister formation OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study. - Conditioning regimen: Busulfan intravenously (IV) over 2 hours every 6 hours on days -9 to -4, fludarabine phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -3, and high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2. - Stem cell transplantation on day 0. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30 patients</detailed_description>
