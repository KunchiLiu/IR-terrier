	<brief_summary>GSK961081 has previously been administered to healthy subjects in a nebulised formulation and the first part of this study which will be conducted in healthy subjects proposes to bridge the change from nebulised to DPI formulation of GSK961081 before administration to patients. The second part of the study will be conducted in COPD patients and aims to assess the safety and bronchodilator profile of GSK961081 over 24 hours, during 14 days dosing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 2 Part Study Examining Doses Of GSK961081 In Healthy Volunteers And Then In COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study to assess the pharmacokinetics of single escalating doses of inhaled GSK961081 DPI (a dual pharmacophore) in healthy subjects (Part 1) and a randomised, double-blind, double dummy, crossover (incomplete block) study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (pulmonary and systemic) and pharmacokinetics of 14 days dosing with inhaled GSK961081 DPI compared with placebo and tiotropium plus salmeterol in patients with COPD (Part 2).</detailed_description>
