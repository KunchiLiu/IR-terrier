	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a tumor antigen may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients who have received first-line therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients Who Have Received First-Line Therapy for Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine immunologic responses in patients who have completed first-line therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with Hodgkin's antigens-GM-CSF-expressing cell vaccine. - Determine the durability of these immunologic responses in these patients. - Determine the utility of an Epstein-Barr virus reporter system for monitoring cellular vaccine responses. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this vaccine in these patients. OUTLINE: Beginning 4-6 months after last chemotherapy, patients receive Hodgkin's antigens-GM-CSF-expressing cell vaccine on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses. Immunologic responses are serially monitored along with disease status. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
