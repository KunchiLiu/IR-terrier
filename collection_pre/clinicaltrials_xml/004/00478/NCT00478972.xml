	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Rimonabant (SR141716) compared to placebo on change in HbA1c and on relative change in body weight over 36 weeks in obese type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone. The secondary objectives are: - To evaluate the effect of Rimonabant compared to placebo on other parameters related to the glucose control, waist circumference, Body Mass Index and metabolic parameters; - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Rimonabant compared to placebo; - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Rimonabant.</brief_summary>
