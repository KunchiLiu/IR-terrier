	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the organization of memory and develop future methods for early detection of AD. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examine the responsiveness of the brain to memory tasks, specifically focusing on regions of the brain (the mesial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate) that are known to be involved in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Of interest are differences in brain activation between people with and without a family history of AD and other risk factors.</brief_summary>
