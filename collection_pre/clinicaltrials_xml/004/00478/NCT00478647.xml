	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCB). Due to the deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside accumulates within macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ system dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of every other week dosing of GA-GCB (velaglucerase alfa) in participants with type 1 Gaucher disease who were previously treated with imiglucerase.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of GA-GCB Enzyme Replacement Therapy in Type 1 Gaucher Disease Patients Previously Treated With Imiglucerase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common form, accounts for more than 90% of all cases and does not involve the CNS. Typical manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia, hypermetabolism, skeletal pathology, growth retardation, pulmonary disease, and decreased quality of life. Gene-Activated® human glucocerebrosidase (GA-GCB; velaglucerase alfa) is produced in a continuous human cell line using proprietary gene-activation technology and has an identical amino acid sequence to the naturally occurring human enzyme. GA-GCB contains terminal mannose residues that target the enzyme to the macrophages-the primary target cells in Gaucher disease. This study was designed to determine the safety of GA-GCB in men, women, and children with Type 1 Gaucher disease who were previously treated with imiglucerase. Each participant's duration of treatment will be 12 months.</detailed_description>
