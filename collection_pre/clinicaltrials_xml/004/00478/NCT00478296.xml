	<brief_summary>Evidence has shown poor outcome for adult patients with pre-operative pulmonary hypertension following closure of an atrial septal defect. Life-threatening pulmonary hypertensive crises may occur in these patients when they no longer have an atrial communication to decompress high right heart pressures. This concern has led some to advocate fenestrated patch closure of ASDs in patients with pulmonary hypertension with the prospect of a repeated procedure in order to close the fenestrations at a later date.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-operative resolution of pulmonary hypertension would clearly provide the best long-term outcome for these patients, allowing a definitive surgical procedure. There are no reported cases of resolution of pulmonary hypertension with the use of pulmonary vasodilators allowing successful ASD closure. We report the case of a patient with trisomy 21 and a primum atrial septum defect with associated cleft mitral valve who was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 8 days of life. Elevated pulmonary pressures were documented by cardiac catheterization during which the patient was found to have minimally responsive pulmonary vasculature to the administration of oxygen. He was started on pulmonary vasodilators which were continued for the following 5 months which resulted in gradual reduction in estimated PA pressure allowing successful closure of the primum ASD and repair of the cleft mitral valve. Following surgery, he was not restarted on pulmonary vasodilators and has continued to do well. The ability to reverse his pulmonary hypertension through the use of pulmonary vasodilators made him a candidate for his successful, definitive surgical repair. He currently has no residual cardiac problems and requires no cardiac medications. There will be no patient follow-up.</detailed_description>
