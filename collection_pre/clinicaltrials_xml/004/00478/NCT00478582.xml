	<brief_summary>The clinical evaluation of anemia is usually done by examination of the palpebral conjontivae coloration. This appreciation remains crude and largely observer dependent, as no reference scale was successfully proposed,. A Hb visual scale allowing the assessment of the degree of clinical anemia has been developed. Its use has been validated so far in small patient groups in the following settings: blood donation, cardiac surgery, oncology and consultation of general practitioners. The objective of the present investigation is to validate the use of a Hb visual scale for the clinical evaluation of anemia in patients with kidney disease patients</brief_summary>
