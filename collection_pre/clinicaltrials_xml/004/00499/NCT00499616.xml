	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Isotretinoin may help neuroblastoma cells become more like normal cells, and grow and spread more slowly. Giving combination chemotherapy with or without isotretinoin before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective in treating young patients with neuroblastoma. PURPOSE: This phase III trial is comparing different regimens of combination chemotherapy and surgery with or without isotretinoin to see how well they work in treating young patients with neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy and Surgery With or Without Isotretinoin in Treating Young Patients With Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Reduce therapy for patients with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma while maintaining a 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of ≥ 95% by using a response-based duration of therapy algorithm. - Maintain an overall 3-year OS rate of ≥ 90% for patients within each group. - Utilize loss of heterozygosity, prospectively, at 1p36 and 11q23 to refine risk-stratification and treatment assignment, allowing patients whose tumors lack these chromosomal abnormalities to receive a reduction in therapy, and compare the outcome with patients treated on COG-A3961. - Reduce intensity of therapy for patients 365 to &lt; 547 days (12-18 months) of age with stage 4 neuroblastoma and favorable biological features and maintain a 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate consistent with that for patients &lt; 1 year of age with stage 4 neuroblastoma treated on COG-A3961. - Reduce intensity of therapy for patients 365 to &lt; 547 days (12-18 months) of age with stage 3 MYCN-nonamplified but unfavorable histology neuroblastoma and maintain a 3-year EFS rate consistent with that for patients &lt; 1 year of age with stage 3, MYCN-nonamplified, unfavorable histology neuroblastoma treated on COG-A3961. - Reduce surgical morbidity for patients with stage 4S neuroblastoma by allowing for biopsy only, rather than complete surgical resection, of the primary tumor. - Systematically study the outcome of patients with stage 4S neuroblastoma who are unable to undergo biopsy for biology-based risk assignment. - Determine if the extent of surgical resection correlates with the maintenance of local control, EFS and/or OS rates, and surgical complication rate. Secondary - Determine the results of a standard retrieval approach for patients with residual disease after 8 courses of initial therapy. - Determine the results of a standard retrieval approach for patients with progressive, nonmetastatic disease. - Identify additional biological surrogate markers for disease relapse and/or metastatic progression. - Describe the neurologic outcome of patients with paraspinal neuroblastoma primary tumors. - Correlate surgical biopsy technique with adequacy of tissue acquisition for biologic studies and with complications associated with the biopsy procedure. - Prospectively validate the prognostic ability of the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group image-defined risk factor system, and compare the institutional assessment of image-defined risk factors with that of central review. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups by risk-stratification based on age, stage (INSS stage 2, 3, 4, or 4S), MYCN status (amplified vs not amplified), histopathologic classification, and tumor DNA index. - Initial chemotherapy: Courses of initial chemotherapy are administered every 21 days according to group assignment as outlined below: - Course 1: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. - Course 2: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1. - Course 3: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. - Course 4: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. - Course 5: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. - Course 6: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1. - Course 7: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. - Course 8: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1. - Group 1: Patients receive 2 courses of initial chemotherapy. Patients with a partial response (PR) (50-90% reduction in volume) to chemotherapy proceed to observation. Patients without a PR receive 2-6 additional courses of chemotherapy (beginning with course 3). Patients who do not achieve a PR after additional chemotherapy proceed to retrieval chemotherapy. - Group 2: Patients receive 4 courses of initial chemotherapy. Patients with a PR after chemotherapy proceed to observation. Patients without a PR receive 2-4 additional courses of chemotherapy (beginning with course 5). Patients who do not achieve a PR after additional chemotherapy proceed to retrieval chemotherapy. - Group 3: Patients receive 8 courses of initial chemotherapy. Patients under 12 months of age with stage 3, 4, or 4S (not including liver metastases) disease who achieve a very good PR (VGPR) (&gt; 90% reduction in the volume of the primary tumor and resolution of metastatic disease) to chemotherapy proceed to observation. Patients 12-18 months of age with stage 3 or 4 disease who achieve a VGPR proceed to isotretinoin therapy. Patients who do not achieve a VGPR proceed to retrieval chemotherapy. - Group 4: Patients receive 8 courses of initial chemotherapy. If a VGPR cannot be achieved following 8 courses of first-line chemotherapy +/- surgery, then retrieval chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide/topotecan for 2-6 courses is administered until a VGPR can be achieved with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. - Retrieval chemotherapy*: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses. - Groups 1 and 2: Patients with a PR after 2-6 courses of retrieval chemotherapy proceed to observation. Patients without a PR after 2-6 courses of retrieval chemotherapy are removed from protocol therapy. - Group 3: Patients under 12 months of age with stage 4 disease with a VGPR after retrieval chemotherapy proceed to observation. Patients 12-18 months of age with stage 3 or 4 disease who achieve a VGPR after retrieval chemotherapy proceed to isotretinoin therapy. Patients who do not achieve a VGPR after retrieval chemotherapy are removed from protocol therapy. - Group 4: Group 4 patients who fail to achieve a VGPR or who develop progressive, non-metastatic disease within 3 years of study enrollment proceed to isotretinoin therapy. Isotretinoin is also administered to the following Group 4 patients: - Age 365 to &lt; 547 days at diagnosis, INSS stage 3, MYCN-NA, unfavorable histology, any ploidy - Age 365 to &lt; 547 days at diagnosis, INSS stage 4, MYCN-NA, favorable histology, DI &gt; 1 NOTE: *Patients who have previously received cyclophosphamide and topotecan to achieve first PR/VGPR are not eligible for this Retrieval Therapy. - Surgery: With the exception of patients with INSS 4S disease, patients undergo surgery to remove as much of the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes as can safely be accomplished. Reassessment for definitive surgery (for patients who undergo biopsy only or partial resection at diagnosis) is made at the completion of scheduled chemotherapy (after course 2 for group 1, after course 4 for group 2, and after course 8 for groups 3 and 4). - Isotretinoin therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy or 2 weeks post-operatively (for patients who undergo surgical resection), patients receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for up to 10 years. Data from patients with low-risk disease who are observed following surgical resection only and are not enrolled on ANBL0531, are collected for study objectives.</detailed_description>
