	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or lymphoma and liver dysfunction. (closed for accrual as of 04/05/2010) Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Vorinostat may have different effects in patients who have changes in their liver function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors or Lymphoma and Liver Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pharmacokinetic disposition of vorinostat (SAHA) in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or lymphoma and varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction. II. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of vorinostat in groups of patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction (mild, moderate, or severe). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Document the non-DLTs associated with administration of vorinostat in patients with hepatic dysfunction. II. Determine the association of the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic dysfunction with the observed toxicities, plasma pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of vorinostat administration. III. Document any antitumor activity associated with vorinostat treatment in patients enrolled on this study. OUTLINE: This is a parallel-group, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to level of hepatic dysfunction (normal vs mild vs moderate vs severe). (closed for accrual as of 04/05/2010) PART I: Vorinostat (SAHA) will be administered as a single oral dose on day -6 for all patients. Blood samples are obtained periodically on day -6 for pharmacokinetic studies. PART II: One week later (day 1), the first course of oral vorinostat will be initiated on a continuous daily oral regimen. Each treatment course will consist of 21 days of therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose escalation will proceed within each hepatic dysfunction group (except in the normal group). Only dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occur during the first cycle of treatment will be used to guide dose escalation. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the highest dose at which no more than one instance of DLT is observed (among 6 patients treated). Once the MTD has been determined for a given hepatic dysfunction group, a maximum of 12 patients will be accrued to this dose level. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
