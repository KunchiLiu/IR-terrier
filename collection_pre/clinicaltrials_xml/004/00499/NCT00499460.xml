	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Garlic supplements may alter the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone, thereby affecting its effectiveness as an opioid analgesic for the relief of moderate or severe pain. PURPOSE: This randomized phase 4 trial is studying how garlic supplements may change the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and its analgesic and side effects in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine whether CYP3A (Cytochrome P450 3A) and/or P-glycoprotein mediated interactions exist between garlic supplements and oxycodone (a commonly used oral opioid analgesic) in healthy volunteers. OUTLINE: This is a single-blind, randomized, crossover study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. Each arm entails two 30-day treatment periods, with a washout of at least 4 weeks in between. - Arm I: In Period 1, participants receive oral garlic powder twice daily on days 1-28 and oral oxycodone on day 28. In Period 2, participants receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-28 and oral oxycodone on day 28. - Arm II: In Period 1, participants receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-28 and oral oxycodone on days 28. In Period 2, participants receive oral garlic powder twice daily on days 1-28 and oral oxycodone on day 28. In both periods of each arm, participants receive a combination of oral midazolam and oral digoxin for CYP3A and P-glycoprotein phenotyping on day 29. Blood samples are collected periodically and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Blood and urine samples are collected after receiving oxycodone for pharmacokinetic characterization. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its metabolites are measured by LC-MS. Response to experimentally induced pain by the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) is assessed at baseline and periodically after oxycodone treatment. Subjective ratings of opioid side effects are assessed by validated questionnaires for somatic side effects and cognitive function impairments.</detailed_description>
