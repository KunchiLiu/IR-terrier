	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Learning about physical ability and mental function over time in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia may help doctors learn about the long-term effects of treatment and plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is assessing physical and mental status in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical and Mental Assessment of Older Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Test the feasibility of pre-treatment, bedside assessment of functional and cognitive status in older adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Secondary - Obtain preliminary data regarding the predictive value of pre-treatment, bedside assessment of functional and cognitive status on overall survival, length of hospitalization and early death. OUTLINE: This is a prospective study. At baseline, patients complete questionnaires including the Vulnerable Elders Survey (functional status), the Mini-Mental Status Exam (cognition), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression. Patients also undergo physical function testing via the Short Physical Performance Battery and hand grip strength. Further information parameters are obtained by periodic medical chart reviews. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
