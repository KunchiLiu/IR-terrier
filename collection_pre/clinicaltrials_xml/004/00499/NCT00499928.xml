	<brief_summary>This study will examine the biological fate of radioactive SB-751689 administered to healthy males and healthy postmenopausal women. Subjects will receive a single oral dose of radioactive SB-751689. Excreta and blood samples will be taken over the course of 7 days. This study will help determine the major route of elimination of SB-751689 in humans. It will also provide samples (blood, plasma, urine, and stools) for analysis of metabolites, if any.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy adult males of age 35 to 65 years, inclusive, or healthy ambulatory postmenopausal women defined as being amenorrheic for at least 2 years and 40 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at screening with FSH levels consistent with menopause. Healthy postmenopausal women, who are between ages 40 to 50 years, inclusive, must also have a documented history of bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) and be at least 6 weeks postsurgery.) Nonsmokers Body weight &gt; or = 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 32 kg/m2 A history of regular bowel movements Capable of giving written informed consent Any clinically relevant biological or physical abnormality found or reported at screening which, in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically significant and would preclude safe participation in this study QTc interval of &gt; 450 msec at screening Positive urine drug screen at screening Positive urine test for alcohol at predose Positive for HIV at screening Chronic hepatitis B and C, as evidenced by positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking at screening History of smoking or use of nicotine containing products within one year of the study or &gt;10 packyear history of smoking overall History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 units/week for women and 14 units/week for men within 6 months of screening History of drug abuse within 6 months of the study Participation in a clinical study and received a drug or a new chemical entity with 30 days or 5 halflives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of any drug prior to the first dose of the current study medication Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day Subjects who have received a total body radiation dose of greater than 5.0 mSv or exposure to significant radiation in the 12 months prior to this study Radiation exposure from the previous 3 year period is over 10 mSv for subjects who have been exposed to ionizing radiation above background as a result of their work with radiation as category A workers or as a result of research studies they may have been involved in. Clinical exposure will not be included Condition that could interfere with the accurate assessment and recovery of radiocarbon [14C] Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs including antacids, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Consumption of red wine, grapefruit, grapefruit juice or grapefruitcontaining products within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 56 days prior to dosing. Evidence of renal, hepatic or biliary impairment History of serious gastrointestinal disease or history of a gastrointestinal surgical procedure that might affect the absorption of SB751689 History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the physician responsible, contraindicates their participation History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease History of pernicious anemia, pancreatitis, osteosarcoma or kidney stones. Conditions that might alter bone metabolism, including hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Paget's disease, myeloma, malabsorption, or Cushing's syndrome, and hypogonadism (for male subjects), hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypermagnesemia, osteopetrosis, osteomalacia, and recent history of fracture or prolonged bed rest Liver function tests, PTH, or CPK outside the reference range at screening Males unwilling to refrain from fathering a child during the study and for 14 days after</criteria>
