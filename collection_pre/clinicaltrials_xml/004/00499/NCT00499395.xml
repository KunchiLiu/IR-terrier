	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET imaging, may be effective in detecting residual disease after radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET imaging to see how well it works for early detection of residual disease in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases from colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET Imaging for Early Detection of Residual Disease in Patients Undergoing Radiofrequency Ablation of Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the sensitivity and specificity of fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET imaging in detecting residual disease within 48 hours after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. Secondary - Determine the findings on day 7 after RFA using FDG-PET imaging in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a prospective study. Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET imaging at baseline. They then undergo percutaneous laparoscopic or intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Patients then undergo further FDG-PET scans within 48 hours and 7 days after RFA. FDG-PET images are evaluated for residual disease, including focal FDG uptake at the site of ablation. Beginning 1 month after RFA, patients undergo contrast-enhanced MRI for routine post-ablation follow-up. MRI scans are performed at 1, 4, 7, 12, 18, and 24 months after completion of RFA.</detailed_description>
