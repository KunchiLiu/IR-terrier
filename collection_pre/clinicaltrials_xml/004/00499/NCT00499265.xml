	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. WX-671 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving gemcitabine together with WX-671 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well gemcitabine works when given together with WX-671 or when given alone in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With or Without WX-671 in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess the antitumor activity of two different doses of anti-uPA serine protease inhibitor WX-671 when given in combination with gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. - Compare the efficacy, in terms of response rate, progression-free survival, time to first metastasis, overall survival, and tumor and uPA system-related markers, of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the safety, in terms of vital signs, ECG, biochemistry, hematology (including coagulation), and adverse events, of these regimens. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive of oral anti-uPA serine protease inhibitor WX-671 once daily in weeks 1-8 (weeks 1-4 of each subsequent course) and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-7 (weeks 1-3 of each subsequent course) of course 1. All subsequent courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive oral anti-uPA serine protease inhibitor WX-671 (at a lower dose than in arm I) once daily in weeks 1-8 (weeks 1-4 of each subsequent course) and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-7 (weeks 1-3 of each subsequent course) of course 1. All subsequent courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm III: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-7 (weeks 1-3 of each subsequent course) of course 1. All subsequent courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
