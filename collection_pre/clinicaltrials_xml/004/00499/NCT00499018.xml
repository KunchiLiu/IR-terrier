	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to define an improvement in patients randomized in four different arms: Arm 1: R-MegaCHOP14x4 + R-MAD + MAD + BEAM + ASCT; Arm 1BIS: R-CHOP14x4 + R-MAD + MAD + BEAM + ASCT; Arm 2: R-MegaCHOP14x4 + R-MegaCHOP14x2; Arm 2BIS: R-CHOP14x4 + R-CHOP14x4; Which are different in dose dense chemotherapy + Rituximab with or without intensified high dose chemoimmunotherapy and support of peripheral autologous stem cells.</brief_summary>

Age &gt; 60 3. Stage I disease 4. Ageadjusted IPI 01 5. ECOGPS&gt;3, if not related to Lymphoma 6. Renal impairment (creatinine&gt;1,2 mg/dl or creatinine clearance &lt; 60ml/min) 7. Hepatic impairment (AST/ALT or bilirubin &gt; 2,5 times normal limit, unless due to Lymphoma) 8. HIV positive patients and/or with HBV or HCV active infection(documented by HBVDNA and HCVRNA positive tests) 9. Clinically significant secondary cardiovascular disease e.g. uncontrolled hypertension (resting diastolic blood pressure &gt; 115 mmHG), uncontrolled multifocal cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic angina pectoris or congestive cardiac failure NYHA class IIIIV 10. LFEV&lt;45% 11. Severe diabetes mellitus difficult to control with adequate insulin therapy 12. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with hypoxemia 13.
