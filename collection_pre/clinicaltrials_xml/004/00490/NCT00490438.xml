	<brief_title>Measurement of Vaginal Squeeze Pressure in Incontinent Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several techniques had been proposed for pelvic floor muscles assessment, however none of them were able to measure the two main functions of these muscles: rising and force of compression. Vaginal palpation is frequently used in clinical evaluation routine and especially the modified Oxford score, but some articles question the Oxford scale sensitivity and its correlation with objective force contraction measurements. Methods: 45 patients with urinary incontinence treated at the Uroginecology Ambulatory Service of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre were included. The patients had been submitted to vaginal palpation using the Oxford score, assessed by a skilled physical therapist, and to the compression force measurement by means of an air filled ballonet connected to a pressure transducer. The two evaluations had been carried in the same day.</detailed_description>
