	<brief_summary>This study tested whether a dose regimen of growth hormone based on body weight is equivalent or better than starting with a low dose and gradually increasing the dose according to individual patient needs. Efficacy of the two regimens were assessed from changes in body fat measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning, performed at the beginning of the study and at the completion of the study eight months later.</brief_summary>

Dose regimen of growth hormone based on individual patient needs: Starting dose was 200 micrograms/day, then increased by 200 micrograms/day every two months for an additional six months (eight months in total) as needed for optimal treatment results.</detailed_description>
