	<brief_summary>Background: In haemodialysis patients, chronic heart failure (CHF) is responsible for a high mortality rate but, presently, very little data is available regarding this population. Aim of the study: Aim of this study was to determine whether telmisartan decreases all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in haemodialysis patients with CHF and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) when added to standard therapies with ACE inhibitors. Methods: A 3-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial was performed involving 30 Italian clinics. Haemodialysis patients with CHF (NYHA class II and III; LVEF 40%) were randomized to telmisartan or placebo in addition to ACE inhibitor therapy. 332 patients were enrolled (165 telmisartan, 167 placebo), and drug dosage was titrated to a target dose of telmisartan of 80 mg or placebo. Mean follow-up period was 35Â±5 months. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and CHF hospitalization.</brief_summary>
