	<brief_title>Safety Study to Evaluate Daptomycin in Non-Infected Adults Who Are Either on Hemodialysis or Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency (CLcr &lt;50 mL/min) are not only at increased risk of infection, but also have worse outcomes from a given infection. In fact, infection accounts for the second leading cause of mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Many of these infections are due to sepsis, primarily rising from the vascular access and peritoneal catheter sites. This is an open label, non-randomized, non-comparative Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the PK profile, safety and tolerability of i.v. daptomycin. Non-infected subjects with end stage renal disease undergoing HD or CAPD will be enrolled in this in-patient study.</detailed_description>
