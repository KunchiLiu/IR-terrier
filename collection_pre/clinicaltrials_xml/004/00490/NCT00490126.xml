	<brief_title>Data Collection of Demographics and Perioperative Care of Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, race, medical and surgical history, and type of cancer) will be collected. Information about the type of surgical procedure performed on you, your care during and after your surgery, any problems related to your surgery, and details about your follow-up care will be entered into a research database. This information will be collected from patients seen at M. D. Anderson since January 1, 1990. It will be used for future research studies. The research database will be updated, after about 1 year, to include information on your disease outcome, treatment, and/or follow-up care. This information will be collected from your medical record, if possible. If it is not in your medical record, you may again be contacted so that researchers can learn this information. Your participation in this study will continue up to 5 years after your laparoscopic procedure. This is an investigational study. Up to 1,000 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
