	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the response rate of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or transformed low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to Iodine-131 (I-131) tositumomab (Bexxar) therapy plus local palliative radiation therapy (XRT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Bexxar &lt;Tositumomab&gt; Combined With External Beam Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Response will be assessed on the basis of the presence or absence of measurable lesion ≥ 1.4 x 1.4 cm (operationally defined as ≥ 2.0 cm2) by radiographic evaluation OR ≥ 1.0 cm in greatest diameter detected by palpation on physical exam</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Histologically confirmed low grade CD20+ B cell nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients who have relapsed after chemotherapy or are chemotherapy resistant and have one or more sites of disease measuring more than 5 cm. The patients must have failed at least one chemotherapy regimen No anticancer treatment for three weeks prior to study initiation (six weeks if Rituximab, nitrosourea or Mitomycin C) Fully recovered from all toxicities associated with prior surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or immunotherapy An institutional review board (IRB)approved signed informed consent Age 19 years or older Expected survival of at least 6 months Prestudy Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 1,500/mm³ Platelet count at least 100,000/mm³ Hct &gt; 30% Hgb &gt; 9.0 gm Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 Creatinine ≤ 2.0 Bone marrow involvement with lymphoma less than 25% (bilateral bone marrow) within 6 weeks of enrollment Acceptable birth control method for men and women EXCLUSION CRITERIA Disease progression within 3 months of last chemotherapy Prior myeloablative therapies with bone marrow transplantation or peripheral stem cell rescue Platelet count less than 100,000/mm³ Hypocellular bone marrow (≤ 15% cellularity) Marked reduction in bone marrow precursors of one or more cell lines History of failed stem cell collection Prior treatment with fludarabine Prior radioimmunotherapy Presence of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma HIV or AIDSrelated lymphoma Evidence of myelodysplasia on bone marrow biopsy Abnormal bone marrow cytogenetics Patients who have received prior external beam radiation therapy to more than 25% of active bone marrow Patients who have received filgrastim Sargramostim therapy within 3 weeks prior to treatment Presence of human antimouse antibody (HAMA) reactivity in patients with prior exposure to murine antibodies or proteins Serious nonmalignant disease or infection, which, in the opinion of the investigator and/or sponsor, would compromise other protocol objectives Another primary malignancy (other than squamous cell and basal cell cancer of the skin, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or treated prostate cancer with stable prostatespecific antigen, PSA) for which the patients has not been disease free for at least 3 years Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery within 4 weeks Pleural effusion Pregnant Lactating</criteria>
