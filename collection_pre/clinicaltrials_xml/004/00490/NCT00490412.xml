	<brief_title>Vitamin D Reabsorption in Adolescents and Young Adults With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ATN 063 tests the hypothesis that in a population of adolescents and young adults with HIV infection who are being treated with tenofovir as part of an antiretroviral (ARV) combination regimen, vitamin D supplementation will decrease renal phosphate loss, increase plasma phosphate, decrease plasma PTH, and improve markers of bone turnover, including a decrease in plasma N-telopeptide and BAP.</detailed_description>
