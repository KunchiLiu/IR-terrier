	<brief_summary>This is a randomised, open label multi-centre phase III study comparing the activity of lapatinib alone versus trastuzumab alone versus trastuzumab followed by lapatinib versus lapatinib concomitantly with trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of patients with ErbB2 overexpressing and/or amplified breast cancer. Patients will be enrolled according to one of two design schemas, with Design 2 having two chemotherapy options (Design 2 and 2B), and will be randomised to one of four treatment regimens within each design schema. The primary objective of this study is to compare disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with HER2 overexpressing and/or amplified breast cancer randomised to trastuzumab for one year versus lapatinib for one year versus trastuzumab (12 or 18 weeks, according to assigned design) followed by a six-week treatment-free interval followed by lapatinib (28 or 34 weeks, according to assigned design) versus trastuzumab in combination with lapatinib for one year (52 weeks). Secondary objectives include treatment comparisons with respect to overall survival, time to recurrence, time to distant recurrence, safety and tolerability, incidence of brain metastasis, and analyses conducted separately for cohorts of patients defined by presence or absence of cMyc oncogene amplification, expression level of PTEN and presence or absence of the p95HER2 receptor. On August 18, 2011, the ALTTO Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) met to review the first planned interim analysis. The IDMC reported that the comparison of lapatinib alone versus trastuzumab alone crossed the futility boundary, indicating that the lapatinib alone arm was unlikely to meet the pre-specified criteria to demonstrate non-inferiority to trastuzumab alone with respect to disease-free survival (DFS). The IDMC also stated that the other three arms (trastuzumab alone, sequential trastuzumab/lapatinib arm and the combination arm) should continue as planned with no changes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1; Nonmetastatic operable primary invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast fulfilling the following: 1. Histologically confirmed 2. Adequately excised (exceptions: patients who have 'nonresectable' deep margin invasion are eligible provided they have had or will receive radiotherapy encompassing the region concerned; patients with histologically documented infiltration of the skin (pT4) are eligible provided they have undergone or will receive radiotherapy encompassing the tumour bed); 3. Axilla dissected; sentinel node sampling is allowed provided that axillary dissection follows confirmation of a positive sentinel node; sentinel node sampling alone is NOT acceptable after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy lymph node status will be considered unknown, regardless of the results of postchemotherapy axillary dissection); 4. Axillary node positive patient OR node negative patient with a tumour greater than or equal to 1.0 cm in greatest diameter. For clarification, isolated tumour cells (ITC) are considered pN0 and micrometastases are considered pN1 Known hormone receptor status (ER/PgR or ER alone) For Designs 1 and 2: Patients must have received at least four cycles of an approved anthracyclinebased (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy regimen or listed as an exception in Table 5 of the protocol. For Design 1: Randomization must be performed no longer than 12 weeks from day 1 of the last chemotherapy cycle after obtaining a postchemotherapy LVEF ≥ 50. Study treatment must start no more than 14 days after randomization For Design 2: Randomization must be performed no longer than 6 weeks from day 1 of the last anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy cycle after obtaining a postanthracycline chemotherapy LVEF ≥ 50. Study treatment must start no more than 14 days after randomization and must be concurrent with taxanes. For Design 2B: Randomisation must be performed no longer than 8 weeks from definitive surgery. Nonanthracycline platinum containing regimen (docetaxel and carboplatin) and study treatment must start concomitantly and no more than 14 days after randomisation. Baseline LVEF ≥50% measured by echocardiography or MUGA scan. For Design 1 and Design 2 after completion of all anthracyclinebased (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and prior to the targeted therapy(ies); for Design 2B prior to targeted therapy(ies) and chemotherapy (docetaxel and carboplatin) Over expression and/or amplification of HER2 in the invasive component of the primary tumour (in case of neoadjuvant treatment, tissue sample used for HER2 testing should be collected before neoadjuvant treatment starts), according to one of the following definitions [Wolff et al 2007] and confirmed by central laboratory prior to randomization: 3+ over expression by IHC (&gt; 30% of invasive tumour cells); 2+ or 3+ (in 30% or less neoplastic cells) over expression by IHC AND in situ hybridization (FISH/CISH) test demonstrating HER2 gene amplification; HER2 gene amplification by FISH/CISH ( &gt; 6 HER2 gene copies per nucleus, or a FISH ratio [HER2 gene copies to chromosome 17 signals] of &gt; than 2.2.) Patients with a negative or equivocal overall result (FISH test ratio of ≤ 2.2, ≤ 6.0 HER2 gene copies per nucleus) and staining scores of 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+ (in 30% or less neoplastic cells) by IHC are not eligible for participation in the trial. Equivocal local results may be submitted for a final determination by the central laboratory. Completion of all necessary baseline laboratory and radiological investigations Signed written informed consent (approved by an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and obtained prior to any study specific screening procedures). History of any prior (ipsi and/or contralateral) invasive breast carcinoma; Past (less than 10 years) or current history of malignant neoplasms, except for curatively treated 1) basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or 2) carcinoma in situ of the cervix. NOTE: Patients with a prior malignancy diagnosed greater than 10 years in the past who have been curatively treated with surgery ONLY, WITHOUT radiation therapy or systemic therapy (chemotherapy or endocrine) are eligible for the study. Patients with any prior diagnosis of breast cancer or melanoma, at any time, are excluded from this study.

NOTE: multifocal/multicentric tumours are permitted: If the patient is nodenegative: one of the lesions must be equal or greater than 1.0 cm (sum of the lesion diameters is not acceptable) AND must have positive HER2 status centrallyconfirmed; If patient is nodepositive: lesion size does not matter BUT one of the lesions must have HER2 positivity centrallyconfirmed. If several lesions are found to be HER2 positive locally, the largest lesion should be considered for central review.
