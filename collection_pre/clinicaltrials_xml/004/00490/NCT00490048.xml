	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis is a systemic disease we assume that extra intestinal involvement as we describein our study( Fireman Z, Osipov A, Kivity S, Kopelman Y, Sternberg A Fireman E: Assessment of pulmonary involvement in Crohnâ€™s disease by induced sputum.

	<brief_title>Assessment of Pulmonary Involvement inUlcerative Colitis by Induced Sputum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty Ulcerative colitis patients and 20 control subjects (all nonsmokers) without respiratory symptoms will be tested. The induce sputum by 20' inhalation of 3.5% saline using ultrasonic nebulizer. Samples will studied by differential counts of 200 cells on cytopreps stained by Giemsa. T-lymphocyte subset analyses were done by FACS using three monoclonal antibodies: CD3 = total T cells, CD4 = T helper cells, and CD8 = T suppressor-cytotoxic cells. CD4/CD8 &gt;2.5 was considered abnormal.</detailed_description>
