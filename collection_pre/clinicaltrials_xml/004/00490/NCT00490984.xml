	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of tongue stabilization using Aspire Medical Advance™ System for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Success is defined as a statistically significant reduction in AHI measured by polysomnography (PSG) from baseline to 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tongue Advancement for Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major health problem in the United States and can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular problems. The primary treatment for OSA today is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Many patients however are unable to tolerate sleeping with a CPAP machine. Surgery is one of the main treatment options available today to these CPAP-intolerant patients. However, current methods of sleep surgery are painful, morbid, and/or lack decent effectiveness. This trial will measure the effectiveness of the Advance System, an implantable medical device to treat OSA. In the trial, patients who meet the study entry criteria receive a baseline sleep study (PSG). The Advance System is then implanted and 6 months after implantation, another PSG is performed. The trial will compare the baseline and the 6 month apnea-hypopnea indices</detailed_description>
