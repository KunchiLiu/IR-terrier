	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically proven urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder in stage T2bT3, N0/Nx, M0. Patients must have measurable disease. Response assessment will be evaluated according to RECIST criteria. Measurable lesions with clearly defined margins will be evaluated by XRay, Transvesical Ultrasound, CTScan or MRI, cystoscopy. Lesions serving as measurable disease must have the longest diameter of greater than or equal to 20 mm as measured with conventional techniques or greater than or equal 10 mm with spiral CT scan. Lesions measured by physical examination must have a longest diameter of greater than or equal 20 mm. Patients with prior or concomitant malignant diseases (other than appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma of the cervix) PSA greater than 5.0 ng/mL Concurrent administration of any other tumor therapy, including radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, molecular target therapy.</criteria>
