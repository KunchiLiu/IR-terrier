	<brief_title>Study of Combivir for Patients With Primary Biliary Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A novel human retrovirus has been cloned from a cDNA library derived from biliary epithelia cells extracted from patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis. Although there is no formal proof that this virus is etiologically related to the disease, we have found evidence for viral infection in the majority of patients with PBC using standard serologic and hybridization assays. In order to address the hypotheses that PBC is etiologically related to a retrovirus infection and that anti-retroviral therapy may be beneficial for patients with PBC, we have conducted 2 pilot studies using lamivudine and Combivir (lamivudine 150mg and Zidovudine 300mg). On the whole, little clinical improvement was observed in patients on lamivudine therapy alone, whereas those on Combivir had significant reductions of hepatic biochemistry studies and histologic improvement. Moreover, 4 of 10 Combivir patients completely normalized their liver function tests and the anti-viral therapy was well tolerated. We now propose a larger randomized trial to assess the short term (6 months) safety and efficacy of Combivir for patients with PBC. Efficacy in this study will be defined using both liver biochemistries and virologic endpoints.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 years old of either sex will be recruited for this study. Persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase or serum aminotransferases of at least 1.5 times normal after a minimum of 6 months UDCA therapy. Positive serum AMA (titer &gt; 1:20). Liver biopsy histology compatible with PBC obtained at any time prior to study. Maintained on UDCA at a dose of 1315 mg/kg for 6 or more months. Patients must read and sign informed consent form. Patients treated with immunosuppressive or antiinflammatory agents such as colchicine, methotrexate, Dpenicillamine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroid therapy will be excluded but may enter the study after a 3 month period off immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory therapy. Advanced liver disease: Childs Pugh class B or C cirrhosis, recurrent variceal hemorrhage, spontaneous encephalopathy, diuretic resistant ascites, need for liver transplantation within the year. Patients with a secondary hepatic diagnosis such as viral hepatitis, drug induced liver injury, extrahepatic biliary obstruction, primary sclerosing cholangitis, metabolic liver diseases or alcoholic liver disease. Regular use of more than 30 g of alcohol per day in the last year. Patients with a predicted survival of less than 3 years from malignant or other potentially life threatening disease. Creatinine clearance less than &lt; 70 mL/min using the Cockcroft Gault equation: Clinically apparent pancreatitis. Serum amylase &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (patients with sicca syndrome and salivary gland disease may have elevated amylase levels) Pregnancy or breastfeeding a child. Sexually active patients of child bearing age and not using effective contraception. Allergic reaction to Combivir like drugs Clinical evidence of myositis Weight of &lt; 50 Kg</criteria>
