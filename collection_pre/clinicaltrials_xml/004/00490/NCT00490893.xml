	<brief_summary>Hypoglycemia and unawareness of hypoglycemia are major problems of insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. The long acting insulin analogue Detemir has structural and physicochemical properties which differ from human insulin. The aim of the present study is to test whether this leads to altered hormone and symptom response during hypoglycemia.</brief_summary>
