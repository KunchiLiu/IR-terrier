	<brief_summary>Randomized controlled trial of CORFIS Programme. The study objectives are as follows: 1. To determine the efficacy of a community based multiple risk factors interventional strategy (CORFIS) for a treatment period of 6 months in patients on treatment for HT, DM or HL. 2. The intervention shall consist of a purpose design and systematically organized disease management program that employ multi-faceted interventions incorporating various specific measures to maximize both clinician (as investigator) adherence with treatment guideline and patient adherence with treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It should be obvious to all that we urgently need to improve the management of the various risk factors for cardiovascular (CVD) and chronic kidney diseases (CKD); the 3 most important of which are Hypertension (HT), Diabetes mellitus (DM), Hyperlipidaemias (HL). It is not just that these are highly prevalent in our community, they are also poorly managed and controlled, with resulting highly costly and adverse health impact on our population. It should also be equally obvious that we need a better approach to manage these risk factors in our community. There have been considerable advances in our understanding of these risk factors and in our knowledge of the variety of approaches to achieving control of these risk factors including the role of self-monitoring and self-management education, medical nutrition therapy, physical activity, psychological counseling, and various drug therapy options. This study is a multi-center, open label, parallel group randomized trial designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a community based multiple risk factors interventional strategy (CORFIS). 750 patients on treatment for HT, DM or HL from 75 general practices (GPs) who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial. Among the 75 selected GPs, 50 of them will be randomly allocated to CORFIS and 25 to routine care. After initial screening, patients will attend clinic for baseline examination. Study prescribed visits for efficacy and safety assessments will occur monthly for 6 months. Hence there will be a total of 7 visits.</detailed_description>
