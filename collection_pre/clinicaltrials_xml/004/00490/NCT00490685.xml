	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate, after radiological progression, efficacy in patients treated with Sorafenib at a dose of 600 mg bid compared to that in patients treated with best supportive care. Primary efficacy objective is progression free survival from randomization.</brief_summary>
