	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the effect upon immune system of two regimens of preventive HIV vaccination in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be vaccinated by DNA-C and NYVAC-C vaccines, and the immune changes will be assessed, as well as safety of the vaccines. Volunteers will be followed during 72 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Compare the Immunogenicity and Safety of Two HIV Preventive Vaccinations in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: randomised phase I/II international trial with a parallel group design, open to participants and investigators but blind to laboratory personnel, in healthy volunteers. Vaccines strategies: 70 volunteers will receive 3 DNA-C vaccinations and 1 NYVAC-C vaccination; 70 volunteers will receive 2 DNA-C vaccinations and 2 NYVAC-C vaccination. DNA-C: 2x2ml intra muscular in right and left vastus lateralis; NYVAC-C: 1 ml intramuscular in non-dominant deltoid. Main outcome: 1. the presence of CD8/CD4+ T cell responses defined according to internationally agreed criteria for evaluation of IFNgamma ELISPOT assays: - in response to env plus at least one of the gag, pol, nef peptide pools, - at weeks 26 or 28; 2. the safety parameters. Secondary outcomes: - cellular responses, - antibody responses, - all grade 1 and 2 adverse events, - all events including those considered unrelated. Sample size: 140 volunteers Enrollment period: 9 months Patient's participation duration: 78 weeks Study duration: 27 months</detailed_description>
