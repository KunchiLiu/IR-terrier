	<brief_title>Helicobacter Pylori and Acute Alcohol Induced Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent pilot study unexpectedly discovered, that Helicobacter pylori infection was rare in patients having their first acute alcohol induced pancreatitis (AAIP) when compared to subjects with similar alcohol use but no history of pancreatitis. This subject has not been studied in humans until now. Therefore we seek to study, with a larger material, wether AAIP is associated with lower prevalence of Helicobacter pylori, by measuring the antibodies against Helicobacter pylori from the sera of AAIP patients and from a control group of alcoholics with no history of AAIP.</detailed_description>
