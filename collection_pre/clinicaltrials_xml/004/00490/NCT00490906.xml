	<brief_title>Comparison of Bone Effects With Copaxone and Interferon in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There will be 60 female patients with MS at University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). They will be split into two groups: a Copaxone group and an Interferon (Avonex, Rebif, or Betaseron) group. Each group will be composed of 30 women matched for menopausal status. Each subject will be given a questionnaire assessing risk factors for low bone density. All patients will have a determination of an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), height and weight, medical history, and fracture history. All patients will undergo hip and spine dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and will have labs drawn to determine serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium, estradiol, bone-specific acetyl phosphatase, osteocalcin, and C-peptides.</detailed_description>
