Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential; or, if of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series. Administration of any licensed vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrolment in this study. Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the following periods: from Day 0 up to Day 51, 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to Month 6; from Month 6 up to Month 6 + 30 days (or Month 6 + 51 days for the control groups). Previous vaccination with a pandemic candidate vaccine or a vaccine containing the same adjuvant as the study vaccine. Previous proven contact with H5N1 wild type virus (i.e. contact with an individual with laboratoryconfirmed H5N1 infection, or contact with an animal (e.g. poultry) which died as a result of H5N1 infection). Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first administration of the candidate vaccines. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, or autoimmune diseases such as Guillain Barre Syndrome, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). History of hypersensitivity to vaccines. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Serious chronic disease including any medically significant chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, neurological, psychiatric or metabolic disorder, as determined by medical history and physical examination. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first administration of the candidate vaccine or during the study. Lactating women. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days prior to the first vaccination, or planned use during the study period. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study.</criteria>
