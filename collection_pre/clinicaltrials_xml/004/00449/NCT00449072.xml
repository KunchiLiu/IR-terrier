	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study was to characterize the difference in prepubescent growth velocity in children 3 to 9 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) treated with triamcinolone acetonide (TAA) nasal spray (NASACORT® AQ 110 μg treatment group) or placebo (NASACORT® AQ placebo group) for 12-months. The secondary objectives were to compare the following in prepubertal participants treated with TAA nasal spray versus placebo: - the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels and the cortisol/creatinine ratio (to measure the Hypothalamic-Pituitary Adrenal [HPA] axis function) - the rate of treatment-emergent-adverse-events (TEAE) - global efficacy rated by the investigator and the participant separately - the rate of use of rescue medication during the study</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants meeting the following eligibility criteria were enrolled. Inclusion criteria: 1. Male participants [3 years to &lt;= 9 years + 0 days old] at Visit 1 and no older than [9 years + 120 days] at Visit 3; and, female participants [3 years to &lt;= 8 years + 0 days old] at Visit 1 and no older than [8 years + 120 days] at Visit 3: all sexually prepubertal (ie, Stage 1 of Tanner Classification of sexual maturity) at Visit 1 and Visit 3. A 5day extension to the age upper bound was permitted under certain circumstances to enable scheduling of Visits 1 and 3 2. At least a one year history of PAR as assessed and documented by the investigator (with or without seasonal allergic rhinitis [SAR]) 3. Positive skin test (prick or intradermal) to a perennial allergen that was present in the participant's environment. A skin test was considered positive if the wheal produced by the allergen was equal to or greater than that caused by positive control (histamine) or was at least 3 mm (prick test) or 7 mm (intradermal test) greater than the wheal of negative control (saline). If a skin test could not be performed, the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) would be used as an alternative. Documented historical skin testing or RAST performed during the past year were acceptable 4. Height within the 3rd and 97th percentiles at screening (Visit 1), Visit 2, and at randomization (Visit 3) 5. Symptomatic (daily AM instantaneous total nasal symptom score was &gt;= 4 out of 12) on any 4 out of the last 7 consecutive days immediately prior to and including the morning of Visit 3. Symptom ratings were to be completed with the help of a parent/guardian/caregiver 6. Written informed consent and ability of parent or legal guardian of the participant to give a written informed consent before any study related procedures. Participants 7 years of age and older must have provided a signed assent form 7. Participants had to be toilettrained Exclusion criteria: 1. Gross nasal anatomical deformities including large polyposis and marked deviated septum 2. History of or current cataract or glaucoma 3. History of hypersensitivity to the corticosteroids or to any excipient of the investigational product 4. Participant was the investigator or any subinvestigator, research assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the protocol 5. Height, weight, or body mass index (BMI)forage below the 3rd or above the 97th percentile at Visits 1, 2, or 3 6. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or intraarticular) within 3 months prior to Visit 1 7. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids for &gt;2 courses received up to 1 year before Visit 1 was exclusionary. Up to 2 courses of systemic corticosteroids each course not exceeding 14 days up to 1 year before Visit 1 was allowed. 8. Treatment with inhaled, intranasal, or high potency topical corticosteroid exposure within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1. Mild asthma that was wellcontrolled and without the use of inhaled corticosteroids within 6 weeks before screening (Visit 1). 9. Immunotherapy, except stable (&gt;=1 month) maintenance schedule before Visit 1. 10. Treatment with any substance before Visit 1 that might have affected growth velocity and/or linear growth, such as, but not be limited to methylphenidate hydrochloride, thyroid hormone, growth hormone, anabolic steroids, calcitonin, estrogens, progestins, bisphosphonates, anticonvulsants, or phosphatebinding antacids 11. Treatment with any investigational product or device in the 30 days before Visit 1 or at any time throughout the duration of this trial (Visit 1 through Visit 11). 12. Bone age as assessed by Xray of the left hand and wrist that was outside +/ 1.5 years of participants chronological age at Visit 2. Right hand and wrist were to be radiographed in the event of bone injury to the left hand or wrist. 13. Unresolved upper respiratory tract infection, sinus infection or nasal candidiasis (i.e., symptomatic or under treatment) within the last 2 weeks before Visit 3. 14. Participants or parent/guardian/caregiver unable to demonstrate correct administration of the investigational product at Visit 1. 15. Concomitant disease other than PAR which could have interfered with the study procedures or outcomes as determined by the investigator. 16. History of hospitalization due to asthma within 1 year before screening (Visit 1). 17. Abnormal 24hour urinary free cortisol level assessed at screening (Visit 2).
