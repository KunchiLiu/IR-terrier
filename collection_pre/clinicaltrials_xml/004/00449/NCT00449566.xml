	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate brain development in autism by longitudinally assessing children with autism, as well as typically developing controls, using advanced MR techniques. We will use longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures to investigate the protracted development of long-range white matter fibers in autism. In addition, we will investigate the effect of autism risk genes on brain development.</brief_summary>
