	<brief_summary>Assess safety and efficacy of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of migraine with aura The hypothesis is that TMS treatments delivered to the occipital cortex of the brain can stop or interrupt the spreading cortical brain activity that causes or contributes to the migraine headache. Two TMS treatments at an intensity of &lt;1 Tesla for ~500 microseconds, approximately 30 seconds apart, may stop the aura and prevent the subsequent headache.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the Lead-in Phase participants will use a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to keep an electronic diary of their migraine episodes. During a migraine episode, as well as the time in between headaches, the PDA prompts the participant to answer questions. Each evening, the participant will place the PDA into an electronic telephone cradle, and the information will be transmitted electronically from the PDA to the data management team to assess the frequency of migraine episodes and participant proficiency with the PDA. During this one month period, the participant must experience at least one migraine with aura episode to enter the Treatment Phase. After one month, the participant will return to the clinic with their PDA and will enter the Treatment Phase to be randomized to either the TMS only group or the Sham stimulation only group. Participant will enter information into the PDA for three migraine auras treated or three months, which ever comes first.</detailed_description>
