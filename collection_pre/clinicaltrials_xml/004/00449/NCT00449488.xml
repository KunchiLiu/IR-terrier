	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Examine the Effects of Erythropoietin on Left Ventricular Function After Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erythropoetin (EPO) is commonly known as an effective treatment for anemia. However, several important extra-hematopoeitic effects of EPO are suggested which might be beneficial in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction, such as a reduction of apoptosis and stimulation of neovascularisation. Recent animal studies provided very consistent evidence for a reduced infarct size and improved left ventricular function caused by EPO administration. However, clinical studies with EPO in non-anemic patients are scarce. We performed a safety study in our department on the effects of a single bolus of EPO in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. Serum EPO levels increased a 200-fold and EPO administration was not associated with hypertension, nor with an increase in thrombocytes or thrombotic events. In conclusion, experimental data clearly showed that a single bolus of EPO after the onset of an acute myocardial infarction reduced myocardial infarct size, and improved left ventricular function. In our safety study, EPO administration in patients with an acute myocardial infarction was safe and well tolerated. This will be a PROBE (Prospective, Randomised, Open label study with Blinded Endpoint) designed study, in wich one group will receive one bolus of EPO 60.000 IU) intravenously within 3 hours after the primary PCI procedure and the other group will receive standard therapy. After 6 weeks left ventricular ejection fraction will be evaluated by planar radionuclide ventriculography.</detailed_description>
