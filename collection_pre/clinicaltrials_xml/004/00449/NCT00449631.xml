	<brief_title>Multidrug Resistance After Trabeculectomy With Mitomycin C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the adjuvant use of mitomycin C during trabeculectomy, short-term and long-term failures still occur. We investigate whether mitomycin C treatment during previous trabeculectomy induces P-glycoprotein expression. Expression of P-glycoprotein is analysed in surgically removed Tenon tissue using immunohistochemistry.</detailed_description>
