	<brief_title>Metabolic Modulation as Treatment in Acute Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute heart failure is a serious disease that despite modern therapies carries a high mortality. Inotropic drugs improve patient status but yield a higher risk of death. Previous studies have shown that myocardial contractility improves when glucose fermentation is up regulated and decreases when Free Fatty Acids are high. In a placebo-controlled design we wish to shift myocardial substrate metabolism towards increased glucose uptake and utilization and measure hemodynamics and biochemical markers of metabolism and prognosis.</detailed_description>
