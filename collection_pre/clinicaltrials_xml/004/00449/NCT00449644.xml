	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the antibacterial activity of TMC207 is better than placebo when added to a standardized Background Regimen (BR) for treatment of multi-drug resistant TB. Also safety and tolerability will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMC207-TiDP13-C208: Anti-bacterial Activity, Safety, and Tolerability of TMC207 in Participants With Multi-drug Resistant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MDR-TB).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will be conducted in 2 consecutive stages, an exploratory (investigative) stage (Stage 1) and a proof of effectiveness stage (Stage 2). During Stage 1, a panel of 50 participants will be randomized (participants are assigned different treatments based on chance) to receive either TMC207 or placebo for 8 weeks on top of a BR. In Stage 2, another panel of 150 participants will be randomized to receive either TMC207 or placebo for 24 weeks on top of a BR. TMC207 will be dosed as 400 mg every day for the first 2 weeks, and as 200 mg 3 times/week for the following 6 or 22 weeks during Stages 1 and 2, respectively. When the participants in Stage 1 have completed 8 weeks double-blind (neither theparticipant nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage) treatment with TMC207 or placebo (or have discontinued earlier), the primary Stage 1 analysis will be performed on all data of the first 8 weeks of treatment. Following this Stage 1 analysis, Stage 2 will be initiated and a panel of 150 new participants will be enrolled. After the double-blind treatment phase in both Stage 1 and Stage 2, participants will continue to receive MDR-TB treatment as per national treatment guidelines. They will be followed for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and microbiological efficacy for 96 weeks after receiving their last dose of TMC207 or placebo. The Data Safety Monitoring Board Committee will review these data on a regular basis. The DSMB/DSMC is a group of experts in tuberculosis and clinical trial conduct who have no commercial interests in the development of TMC207 and the company (Tibotec, BVBA) that is developing the new TB drug.</detailed_description>
