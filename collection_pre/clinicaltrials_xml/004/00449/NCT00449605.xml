	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to demonstrate, after 52 weeks of treatment, the non-inferiority of rimonabant 20 mg once daily (od) versus glimepiride od in reducing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled with metformin at a stable dose (â‰¥ 1500 mg/day) for at least 3 months. The main secondary objectives are to assess the effect of rimonabant in comparison with glimepiride on body weight and HDL-Cholesterol and the long-term safety and tolerability of rimonabant in comparison with glimepiride.</brief_summary>
