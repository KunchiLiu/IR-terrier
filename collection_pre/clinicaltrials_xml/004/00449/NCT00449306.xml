	<brief_summary>Lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques, or "vulnerable plaques" are prone to rupture, causing local intravascular thrombosis, with subsequent grave clinical consequences. Atherosclerotic plaques normally removed during surgery, and peripheral blood samples will be studied to achieve the following objectives: "1" Define histological features of the vulnerable plaque, analyze its physical characteristics, and investigate selected gene expression. "2" Study biomarkers of inflammation in conjunction with the presence of vulnerable plaques. "3" Explore the potential role of infection in atherogenesis.</brief_summary>
