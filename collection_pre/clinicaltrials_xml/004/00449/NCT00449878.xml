	<brief_title>Liprotamase Efficacy Trial in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis-Related Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is divided into four distinct periods: 1. Baseline Period during which each patient is taken off pancreatic enzyme medications. 2. An Open-Label Treatment Period during which all patients will receive ALTU-135 (liprotamase). 3.

	<criteria>Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use birth control Diagnosis of CF based upon the following criteria: two clinical features consistent with CF; and either genotype with two identifiable mutations consistent with CF, OR sweat chloride &gt;60 mEq/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis Clinically stable with no evidence of acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection PI determined by fecal elastase &lt;100 Âµg/g stool measured at screening Able to take pancreatic enzyme supplementation in the form of capsules Able to perform the testing (e.g., stool collections) and inpatient stays required for this study, as judged by the Investigator Baseline coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) less than or equal to 80% CFA &gt;80% at Baseline Pregnancy, breastfeeding or of childbearing potential and not willing to use birth control during the study History of fibrosing colonopathy History of liver transplant, lung transplant or significant surgical resection of the bowel Any acute or chronic diarrheal illness unrelated to PI Unable to discontinue enteral tube feedings during the study Known hypersensitivity to food additives Inability to consume the diet required by the study, in the judgment of the Investigator Participation in an investigational study of a drug, biologic, or device not currently approved for marketing within 30 days prior to screening Abnormal liver function (except for patients with Gilbert Syndrome) Signs and/or symptoms of liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension or documented liver disease unrelated to CF Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in the last six months prior to screening Unable to discontinue the use of pancreatic enzymes Any condition that the Investigator believes would interfere with the intent of this study or would make participation not in the best interest of the patient Patient is unlikely to complete the study, as determined by the Investigator</criteria>
