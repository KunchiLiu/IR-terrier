	<brief_summary>A pharmacokinetic study of insulin pump treatment using Insulin Aspart. The study consist of three different periods A, B and C where a constant the insulin infusion rate is given during the periods. In period B and C will the infusion start with a bolus. It will be investigated if a steady state of insulin will be obtained faster in period B and C then A.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A pharmacokinetic study of insulin pump treatment using Insulin Aspart. The study consist of three different periods A, B and C where a constant the insulin infusion rate is given during the periods. Each period will last 12 hours and blood will be drawn to measure absorbed Insulin Aspart. During period A will a constant the infusion rate of insulin be given. In period B and C will there at the start of the constant infusion rate be given a bolus. The bolus in period C is calculated on the basis of the results in period B, therefore will all participants experience period C last where as period A and B is randomized cross-over. Period C is written in the protocol as optional and it is evaluated after period A and B if period C will be performed. The hypothesis is that steady state of insulin will be obtained faster in period B and C than A.</detailed_description>
