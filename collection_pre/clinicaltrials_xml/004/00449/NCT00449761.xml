	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years old Diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome positive accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia defined as: Accelerated phase the presence of at least one of the following: ≥15% but &lt;30% blasts in blood or bone marrow ≥30% blasts plus promyelocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow (providing that &lt;30% blasts present in bone marrow) ≥ 20% basophiles in the peripheral blood Thrombocytopenia &lt;100 X 109 /L unrelated to therapy Blast phase (blast crisis) the presence of one of the following: ≥ 30% blasts in the blood, marrow or both Extramedullary infiltrates of leukemic cells Prior treatment with at least two BCRABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (i.e., imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib) and demonstrated resistance to the most recent kinase inhibitor therapy. Patients with a history of intolerance to one BCRABL kinase inhibitors (defined as discontinuation of treatment due grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to treatment) will be considered eligible to enter the study if they demonstrate resistance to their most recent BCRABL kinase inhibitor. Patients must have adequate laboratory values: Baseline measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction [assessment of the hearts ability to pump effectively] Assessment of patients ability to perform every day activities. Assessment by the ECOG [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group] Performance Status Exclusion criteria: A candidate for hematopoitic stem cell transplantation Prior therapy with certain medications Patients who are in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases Concomitant use of drugs with a risk of possible risk of causing QTc prolongation or torsades de pointes Concomitant use of certain medications Impairment of GI function or GI disease Patients with unresolved diarrhea Patients who have received chemotherapy, any investigational drugs (other than BCRABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors) or undergone major surgery &lt; 4 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy Patients who have received a BCRABL tyrosinekinase inhibitor within 1 week of first treatment with LBH589 Women who are pregnant or breast feeding or women of childbearing potential not using an effective method of birth control Male patients whose sexual partners are women of child bearing potential not using effective birth control Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
