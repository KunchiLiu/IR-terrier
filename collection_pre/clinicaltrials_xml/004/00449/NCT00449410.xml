	<brief_summary>In elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) the presence of silent brain infarcts and neurocognitive deficit is high despite adequate treatment with oral anticoagulation. Atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory disease and thrombosis and inflammation are strongly correlated. Atrial fibrillation is linked with increased levels of inflammatory markers and intensive cholesterol lowering has proven to reduce inflammation. In a prospective double-blind randomized pilot-study we want to test the hypothesis, that addition of intensive cholesterol lowering treatment besides adequate oral anticoagulation will reduce cerebrovascular lesions and will be beneficial for neurocognitive status in elderly AF patients.</brief_summary>
