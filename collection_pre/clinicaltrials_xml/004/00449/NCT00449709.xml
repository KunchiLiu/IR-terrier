	<brief_summary>PreTerm Labor (prior to 37 weeks gestation) is the largest single cause of infant morbidity and mortality and is frequently associated with long-term disability. Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the body during labor. GSK221149 is an experimental drug that will be used to block the effects of oxytocin, and therefore pause or prevent contractions. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of various modified release formulations of GSK221149 will be investigated in healthy non-pregnant adult subjects.</brief_summary>
