	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, floxuridine, and leucovorin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab works in treating patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether irinotecan hydrochloride, floxuridine, leucovorin calcium, and bevacizumab improves overall survival of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. Secondary - Estimate response rate (complete response and partial response), time to response, and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Estimate the resectability rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Evaluate the safety and toxicity of this regimen. - Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 22 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 24 hours, and high-dose floxuridine IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are evaluated after completion of every 2 courses of therapy. Patients whose disease is deemed operable at evaluation are referred to surgery. Patients complete a quality of life assessment at baseline, every 6 weeks during study treatment, and periodically at follow-up. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
