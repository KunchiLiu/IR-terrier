	<brief_summary>Buprenorphine (BPN) is an approved treatment for opioid dependence, however, in taking oral tablets, patients experience withdrawal and cravings when the variable BPN levels in the blood are low. Probuphine is an implant placed just beneath the skin that contains BPN. It is designed to provide 6 months of stable BPN blood levels. This study will test the safety and efficacy of Probuphine in the treatment of patients with opioid dependence.</brief_summary>
