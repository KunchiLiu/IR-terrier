	<brief_summary>The aim is to demonstrate equivalent efficacy and safety in the treatment of the two most frequent forms of cervical dystonia (predominantly rotational torticollis and predominantly laterocollis) with the standard initial dose of 500 units Dysport®. The patients will be assigned to one of the two basic types of cervical dystonia, either predominantly rotational torticollis or predominantly laterocollis on the basis of clinical examination. This will determine which therapy is to be administered, using the clearly defined, structured injection protocols.</brief_summary>
