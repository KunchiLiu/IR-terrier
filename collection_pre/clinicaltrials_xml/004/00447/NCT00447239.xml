	<brief_summary>Aim. To determine whether the maintenance of normoglycemia decreases the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), reduces its treatment period and the length of stay in the intensive care unit. Methods. Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. We enrolled 117 mechanically ventilated trauma (71) and abdominal (46) surgical patients, older than 18, of both sex. In 57 patients (strict glucose control group) we aimed to maintain the blood glucose level between 4.4 and 6. 1 mmol/L, while in 60 patients (standard glucose control group) it was maintained between 7.8 and 10.0 mmol/L, with the use of continues insulin infusion. Insulin dose adjustments were based on measurements of glucose in capillary blood sample.
