	<criteria>Male or female βthalassemia outpatients on chronic transfusion therapy (defined as &gt; 8 transfusions per year) Lifetime minimum of 100 previous packed red blood cell transfusions Patients currently on chelation therapy will require a one day wash out prior to the first dose of study drug Age ≥ 10 years Sexually active females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test and use an effective method of contraception, or must have undergone clinically documented total hysterectomy. Ejection Fraction &lt; 56 % measured using steadystate free precession imaging by MRI Contraindication to MRI, including cardiac pacemaker, brain aneurysm clip, implanted neurostimulator, insulin pump, cochlear implant, metal slivers in the eyes, intrauterine device or any other MRI incompatible metal implants or intractable claustrophobia Abnormal laboratory values as defined by the protocol Clinical or laboratory evidence of active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C History of HIV positive test result (ELISA or Western blot) Uncontrolled systemic hypertension Second or third degree AV block Lifethreatening arrhythmias, including sustained ventricular tachycardia and aborted sudden death, within the last year History of cardiac conditions or unstable cardiac disease not controlled by standard medical therapy History of clinically relevant ocular toxicity related to iron chelation Systemic diseases (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) which would prevent study treatment Pregnancy or breast feeding (documented negative pregnancy test required for study entry) Patients enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of deferasirox (ICL670) cannot be withdrawn in order to participate in this study Treatment with systemic investigational drug within the past 4 weeks or topical investigational drug within the past 7 days Other surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of any drug History of noncompliance to medical regimens or patients who are considered potentially unreliable and/or not cooperative Other inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
