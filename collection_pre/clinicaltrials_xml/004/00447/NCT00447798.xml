	<brief_summary>The proposed study uses a two-arm randomized experimental design to evaluate the efficacy of a brief, theoretically-guided, "Prevention Care Advocate" intervention with HIV-positive crack users. Study participants will be recruited from the HIV inpatient hospital wards of two inner-city hospitals that serve a similar population of HIV-positive patients: Jackson Memorial Hospital (JMH) in Miami, Florida and Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study uses a two-arm randomized experimental design to evaluate the efficacy of a brief, theoretically-guided, "Prevention Care Advocate" intervention with HIV-positive crack users. Study participants will be recruited from the HIV inpatient hospital wards of two inner-city hospitals that serve a similar population of HIV-positive patients: Jackson Memorial Hospital (JMH) in Miami, Florida and Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This 8-session, multi-component, skills-building intervention adapted from strategies used in prior studies encourages participants to advocate prevention and receipt of primary care services for themselves and their peers. We will employ a randomized experimental design to compare the intervention's efficacy with an attention-control group. SPECIFIC AIMS Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a brief, theoretically-based intervention in reducing unprotected sexual intercourse by HIV-positive crack users recruited from the inpatient/hospital setting. The impact of the intervention on secondary outcomes including the increased use of HIV primary outpatient care and readiness for and entry to drug treatment, will also be evaluated. Aim 2: To examine whether knowledge, motivation and perceived self-efficacy are impacted by the intervention, and if changes in these variables explain change in the behavioral outcomes of interest. Aim 3: To determine the extent to which behavioral outcomes are maintained over time.</detailed_description>
