	<brief_summary>In recurrent miscarriage, the male factor has been poorly evaluated. In fact, in the vast majority of clinical protocols of recurrent miscarriage, the sperm is not considered or assessed. Recently, some studies have suggested the presence of genetic and metabolic sperm anomalies in couples suffering from repeated miscarriages. Specifically, DNA fragmentation and altered oxidative stress in the sperm and Y microdeletions from blood samples have been related to an increased risk of miscarriage.The aim of the present study is to compare these three parameters in: couples with recurrent miscarriage; oligozoospermic men with or without recurrent miscarriages; and healthy sperm donors, in order to determine their actual impact on this reproductive problem.</brief_summary>
