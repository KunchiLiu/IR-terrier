	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if a combination of resistance exercises and amino acid capsules can reduce muscle loss and maintain muscle function during bedrest. This experiment will imitate many of the physical conditions experienced by astronauts during space flight by examining the effects of resistance exercise or nutrition on muscle during 2 days of bedrest. The diet of astronauts will also be imitated by providing diets in the General Clinic Research Center.</brief_summary>
