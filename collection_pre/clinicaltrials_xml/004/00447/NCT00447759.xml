	<brief_summary>The Standard Care versus Celecoxib Outcome Trial (SCOT) is a large streamline safety study designed to compare the cardiovascular safety of celecoxib versus traditional non-selective Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) therapy.Traditional NSAID's are associated with significant morbidity and mortality from gastrointestinal toxicity. Cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2)selective agents are associated with reduced upper gastrointestinal toxicity.Traditional NSAID's and Cox-2 inhibitors may also be associated with cardiovascular and renal disorders. Data from both randomised and observational studies suggest that celecoxib has similar or reduced cardiovascular toxicity when compared to traditional NSAID's. However, the overall safety balance of a strategy of celecoxib therapy versus a strategy of NSAID therapy is unknown. The European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) has requested that studies of the cardiovascular safety of celecoxib be carried out within the indicated population of Europe. This study addresses these issues by comparing the cardiovascular safety of celecoxib therapy with traditional NSAID therapy in the setting of the EU healthcare system. As of May 2013, 7300 patients had been randomised, and had accrued an average 4.2 years of follow up by the end of May 2014.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Standard Care Versus Celecoxib Outcome Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims The present proposal seeks to compare the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety and effectiveness of a strategy of initial randomisation to treatment with the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib or to 'usual-care' with their current non-selective NSAID therapy (with or without cyto-protection with ulcer healing drug use in either celecoxib or 'usual-care' limbs). Trial Design This trial utilises the Prospective Randomised Open Blinded End point (PROBE) design . Patients with clinically diagnosed osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 60 years of age or more who are free from established cardiovascular disease and who require chronic NSAID therapy will be identified in the setting of primary care. Patients will be randomised to receive either celecoxib or to continue their previous standard NSAID therapy. They will then be followed up for an average of 4.2 years in the setting of the local National Healthcare system. The study will terminate when 277 adjudicated cardiovascular events have accrued. A summary is shown in the diagram below.</detailed_description>
