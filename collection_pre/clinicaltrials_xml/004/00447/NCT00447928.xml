	<brief_title>Phase II Dose-Ranging Study of OrthoDerm Patch for Patients With Tennis Elbow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic tendonitis remains difficult to treat. Nitric oxide has been demonstrated to stimulate tenocytes to proliferate, differentiate and produce matrix components including collagen. Studies have demonstrated that nitroglycerin transdermal patches, which release nitric oxide, reduce pain and increase function in patients with chronic tendonitis. The purpose of the present study is to examine the efficacy of three dose levels of nitroglycerin, compared to placebo, in reducing pain and increasing function in patients with chronic (greater than three months' duration) lateral epicondylitis.</detailed_description>
