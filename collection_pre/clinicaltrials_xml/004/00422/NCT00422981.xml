	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Study to Evaluate Subjects With Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-Clinical experiments indicate the AL-108 compound has neuroprotective, cognitive protective and neurotrophic properties; therefore, the compound could be tested in a variety of human diseases. Human diseases include Cognitive impairment associated with aging or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. This clinical trial aims at providing the dose rationale as well as safety and tolerability information for AL-108 as evaluated after 12 weeks of intranasal administration in subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of MCI nor accepted treatment or standard treatment approach.</detailed_description>
