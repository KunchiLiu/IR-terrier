	<brief_summary>Retinal dystrophies are responsible for numerous cases of blindness, and there are no therapeutic possibilities today. Gene therapy is efficient in a dog model concerning dystrophy linked to a mutation of the rpe65 gene. If such a therapy is to be considered for humans, it is urgent to select, at a national level, patients suffering from dystrophy linked to a mutation of the rpe65 gene. The systematic correlation of phenotype/genotype is an anatomical-functional approach, but it also identifies patients who may be potentially included in a future gene therapy study. Indeed, identification of people with a mutation of rpe65 is still insufficient in France (compared to other European countries) because of a lack of systemic genotyping of retinal dystrophy.</brief_summary>
