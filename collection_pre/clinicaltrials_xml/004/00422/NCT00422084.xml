	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the fixed combination of pyronaridine artesunate (180:60 mg) with that of Coartem® (artemether lumefantrine) in children and adults with acute uncomplicated P falciparum malaria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pyronaridine Artesunate (3:1) Versus Coartem® in P Falciparum Malaria Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are considered today by WHO to be the best anti-malarials in terms of efficacy and lower propensity to resistance. Pyronaridine artesunate is a new ACT in development to treat acute uncomplicated malaria. Pyronaridine and artesunate are antimalarial agents with a history of clinical use both separately and in combination with other drugs. Each drug has powerful anti-schizonticidal actions. The aim of a fixed dose combination of pyronaridine and artesunate in the treatment of uncomplicated acute malaria is to provide rapid reduction in parasitemia with a once-daily three-day regimen, thereby improving compliance and reducing the risk of recrudescence through the slower elimination of pyronaridine.</detailed_description>
