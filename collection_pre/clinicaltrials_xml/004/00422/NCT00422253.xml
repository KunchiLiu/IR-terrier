	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that reduction in dietary advance glycation endproducts (AGE) intake will increase insulin sensitivity and normalise insulin secretion in overweight and obese individuals through reduction of chronic low grade inflammation. We propose to test this hypothesis by performing euglycemic hypeinsulinemic glucose clamp and intravenous glucose tolerance test before and after low AGE diet and normal Australian diet in a cross-over design. This study will provide information relevant to the development and prevention of type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
