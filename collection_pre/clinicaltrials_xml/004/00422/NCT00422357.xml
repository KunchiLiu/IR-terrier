	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disorder worldwide. Some herbs are traditionally used in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Urtica Dioica (UD) or stinging nettle is traditionally used in Morocco, Turkey, Brasil, Jordan and with much frequency in northern Iran. Studies on animal models along with in vitro studies has shown hypoglycemic effect for aqueous extract of UD. This study aimed to investigate hypoglycemic effects of UD tea bags in patients with T2DM on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, along with its effects on lipid profile (LP), blood pressure (BP), liver, and kidney function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Urtica Dioica on Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be performed under randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, and case-control design. The object of this study is patients with T2DM. Patients are randomly assigned to start with placebo tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed in boiling water for 20 minutes: mixture of bran powder which is already boiled in water twice plus spinach powder) in control groups and UD tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed in boiling water for 20 minutes) in patients with T2DM for two months. Every two weeks, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose after a standard breakfast, serum insulin, lipids, alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), creatinine (to calculate GFR), along with blood pressure will be measured. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Randomized Clinical Trial.</detailed_description>
