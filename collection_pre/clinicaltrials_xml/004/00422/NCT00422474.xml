	<brief_summary>After acute stroke, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is impaired. This impaired acute stage BRS has been reported to be predictive of worsen outcome years after stroke in general. However, it is not very clear if the impaired acute stroke BRS would actually persist months after the acute stage. It is also not clear that such change, if any, would correlate with the functional outcome or prognosis after stroke. The trial is to investigate the longitudinal time course of BRS after ischemic stroke up to the 6th month post stroke and to see if there is any correlation of the changes in BRS with the functional outcome parameters using NIHSS and mRS scores throughout this period.</brief_summary>
