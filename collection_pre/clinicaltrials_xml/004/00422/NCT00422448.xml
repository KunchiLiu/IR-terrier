	<brief_summary>This project is a multicenter study in which we will investigate a dual concept of nevogenesis. Study location is the Department of Dermatology at the Medical University of Graz in collaboration with centers in Austria (Vienna), Italy (Naples, Benevento, Modena), Spain (Barcelona) and the United States (New York). The hypothesis is that small congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN), "early" acquired melanocytic nevi in childhood (AMN) and dermal nevi, all dermatoscopically characterized by globular pattern, belong to the same spectrum of genetically determined melanocytic proliferations that develop due to endogenous pathways, in contrast to "true" acquired melanocytic nevi, dermatoscopically showing reticular pattern, that develop due to exogeneous factors such as UV-exposure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Test Genetic Alterations Among Different Dermoscopic Types of Melanocytic Nevi.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigations to this study will verify whether small CMN, "early" AMN and dermal nevi, characterized by globular pattern differ in their genetic alterations compared to reticular typed nevi. It will be expected that globular typed nevi and eventually dermal nevi lack B-RAF mutations whereas reticular nevi show alterations in the B-RAF gene. Study location: Graz</detailed_description>
