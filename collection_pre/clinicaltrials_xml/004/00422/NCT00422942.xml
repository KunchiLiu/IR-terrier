	<brief_summary>This single arm study will investigate the pattern of B cell depletion in synovial tissue and peripheral blood of patients with active RA, after MabThera (1000mg iv x 2 on days 1 and 15) + methotrexate (10-25mg/week po) treatment. The clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of MabThera after treatment and retreatment will also be investigated. The anticipated time on study treatment is 2+ years, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
