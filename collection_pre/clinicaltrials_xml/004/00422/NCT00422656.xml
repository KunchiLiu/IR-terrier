	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to assess the response rate of perifosine in patients with relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Perifosine is a newly discovered compound that kills Waldenstrom cells in laboratory experiments. Perifosine has been used in research for the treatment of other types of cancer such as multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants will be given study medication-dosing diaries for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days. Participants will receive 6 cycles of the study treatment with perifosine and those 6 cycles will be given one after another. - Medication will be taken orally once a day with food before going to bed and the dose may be reduced or the schedule changed in the event that the participant experiences side effects. - On Day one of each cycle, routine blood tests and exams will be performed. - At the end of cycle 2 the following procedures will be performed; history and physical exam, routine blood tests, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and CT scan. - At the end of cycle 6 (end of study) the following procedures will be performed; routine blood tests, history and physical exam, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, research bone marrow and blood samples and CT scan. - Participants will be in this study for about 6 months and be followed every three years for 2 more years. They may continue the study treatment indefinitely if there is no disease progression at the discretion of the treating investigator.</detailed_description>
