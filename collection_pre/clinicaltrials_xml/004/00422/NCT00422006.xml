	<brief_summary>Experimental results are strongly suggesting that PCSK9 and FXR could occur in the physiopathology of human joined dyslipidemia. But no data in the literature can validate the potential role of these two genes in the lipidic and glucidic metabolism control in physiopathological situations. This protocol is based on the hypothesis that the expression levels of PCSK 9 and FXR are modified for some patients suffering from insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.</brief_summary>
