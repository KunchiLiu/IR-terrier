	<brief_title>Assessment of Low Level Laser Therapy for Late Postoperative Pain After Lumbar Fusion Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbar fusion surgery patients typically experience significant post-operative pain for several weeks and their rehabilitation does not start until 8 - 12 weeks postoperatively. We hypothesize that LLLT beginning 4 weeks postoperatively will provide significant reduction in postoperative pain.</detailed_description>
