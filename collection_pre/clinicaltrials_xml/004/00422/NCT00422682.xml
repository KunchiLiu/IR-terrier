	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of BSI-201 with chemotherapeutic regimens in adult subjects with histologically or cytologically documented advanced solid tumors. Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.</brief_summary>
