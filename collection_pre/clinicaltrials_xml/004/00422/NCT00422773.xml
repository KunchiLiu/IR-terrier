	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess a maximal tolerable dose and to assess the safety of a chemotherapy-combination of cetuximab, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid (FA) as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of Cetuximab and Oxaliplatin/5-FU/FA/Irinotecan in First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose escalation: The first three patients will receive chemotherapy at the dose level 1 for 6 weeks (first three cycles). The dose will be escalated for the next patients by one dose level if none of the three patients at a dose level experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first six weeks. If one of the three patients has a DLT, an additional three patients will be enrolled at this dose level and the dose will be escalated if no additional patients experience a DLT. Otherwise, the dose escalation will be stopped, and the last dose will be regarded as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An intra-individual dose escalation is not planned. Expanded cohort: The MTD cohort will be expanded to a total of 16 patients.</detailed_description>
