	<brief_title>Progesterone for Prevention of Preterm Birth in Women With Short Cervix: Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The results of randomized studies have shown that the prophylactic use of progesterone in women who previously delivered prematurely reduces the risk of recurrence. Asymptomatic women found to have a short cervix (&lt; 15 mm) at mid-gestation are at greatly increased risk for spontaneous early preterm delivery and it is uncertain whether in such women the risk is reduced by progesterone. METHODS Cervical length was measured by transvaginal sonography at 22 (range 20-25) weeks in 24,620 pregnant women attending for routine antenatal care. The cervix was 15 mm or less in 413 (1.7%), and 250 (60.5%) of these women participated in a randomized study of vaginal progesterone (200 mg per night) vs identical-looking placebo, between 24 and 34 weeks. Primary outcome was the frequency of spontaneous delivery before 34 weeks (238 days) of pregnancy. Analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.</detailed_description>
