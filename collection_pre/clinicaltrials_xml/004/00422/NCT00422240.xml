	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study with 12 weeks of treatment of acne vulgaris. Efficacy and safety evaluations will be performed at Screening (safety only), Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12. All Investigator's Global Assessment evaluators and lesion counters must be trained and approved by Galderma. The evaluator of a subject should remain the same during the study. The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority in efficacy and assess safety of adapalene/benzoyl peroxide topical gel (adapalene/benzoyl peroxide gel) versus adapalene topical gel, 0.1% (adapalene monad); benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 2.5% (benzoyl peroxide monad) and topical gel vehicle (gel vehicle) in the treatment of acne vulgaris for up to 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
