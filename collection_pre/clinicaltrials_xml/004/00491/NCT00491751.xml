	<brief_summary>This study will seek to determine whether non-invasive measures of endothelial function have utility as surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with peripheral arterial disease undergoing vascular surgery. Measurements of endothelial function will be made before and after initiation of atorvastatin, ascorbic acid, or placebo therapy during the pre-operative period. We will then examine cardiovascular events following surgery. We hypothesize that patients who have no improvement in endothelial function will have increased cardiovascular risk compared to patients with improvement in endothelial function.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male and female subjects age 2199 years old. 2. Peripheral Arterial Disease. PAD is defined clinically and by angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, vascular ultrasound, or ankle brachial index less than 0.9. 3. Able to provide informed consent and complete the study procedure. 4. Patients undergoing nonemergent vascular surgery (peripheral arterial bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, carotid endarterectomy, or limb amputation) or other noncardiac surgery. 1. Emergent or urgent surgery that must be performed sooner than one week after enrollment 2. Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or decompensated heart failure within 1 month of enrollment. Patients who require cardiac catheterization and surgical or percutaneous coronary revascularization prior to vascular surgery will be excluded. 3. Clinically evident major illness of other organ systems, including cancer, endstage renal disease, hepatic failure, or other conditions that make participation inappropriate. 4. Women who are lactating, pregnant, or of childbearing potential and not using a reliable contraceptive method. Pregnancy will be excluded by a urine pregnancy test. 5. Patients with liver function tests or serum creatine kinase &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal. 6. Patients who have received an investigational drug within 30 days of enrollment. 7. Patients or subjects with a history of a psychological illness or condition such as to interfere with the subject's ability to understand the requirements of the study. 8. Known occlusive atherosclerosis of the subclavian artery or upper extremity, because such disease will interfere with induction of reactive hyperemia during the brachial artery ultrasound studies. 9. Patients will be excluded if they are taking vitamin C in a dose greater than 2 times the Recommended Daily Allowance (&gt;120 mg/day) within 1 month of enrollment.</criteria>
