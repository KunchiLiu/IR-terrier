	<brief_summary>Patients in cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are referred to a tertiary care center for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the infarct related artery in this multicenter, ran-domized clinical trial. After checking in- and exclusion criteria computerized randomization is performed to either PCI plus intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) insertion and medical treatment or PCI plus medical treatment only. Intensive care treatment is performed according to standard care including hemodynamic monitoring using a pulmonary artery catheter for optimal volume status adaptation and inotropic drug administration. The IABP will be weaned after hemodynamic stabilization. Primary outcome measure will be 30-day mortality. The secondary outcome measures such as hemody-namic, laboratory and clinical parameters will serve as surrogate for prognosis of the patients.</brief_summary>
