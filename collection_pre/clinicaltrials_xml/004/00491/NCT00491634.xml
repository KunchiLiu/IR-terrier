	<brief_summary>The study hypotheses is that the introduction of dose escalated treosulfan, in substitution to busulfan, will reduce toxicity after allogeneic transplantation while improving myeloablation and and disease control in patients with AML and MDS not eligible for standard transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age less than physiologic 68 years. 2. Patients with AML and MDS not eligible for standard TBI or Busulfanbased myeloablative conditioning due to age, concurrent medical condition, or extensive prior therapy (e.g. age &gt; 55 years for HLAmatched sibling transplants or &gt; 50 for matched unrelated donor transplants, prior / concomitant pulmonary, liver, or other organ complications). 3. This study will only include patients with chemorefractory disease or previously untreated active disease. A. acute myeloid leukemias (AML) according to WHO classification (&gt; 20% myeloblasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow at diagnosis) in induction failure, PR, untreated or chemorefractory relapse. Patients must have &gt; 10% marrow blasts at the time of transplantation. B. myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to WHO classification (&lt; 20% myeloblasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow at diagnosis), indicated for allogeneic transplantation: refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB1 and RAEB2) with no prior therapy 4. Patients must have an HLA matched related or unrelated donor willing to donate either peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow. Matching is based on highresolution class I (HLAA, B, C) and class II (HLADRB1, DQB1) typing. The goal is to transplant &gt; 3 x 106 CD34+ cells per kg body weight of the recipient 1. Bilirubin &gt; 3.0 mg/dl, transaminases &gt; 3 times upper normal limit 2. Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl 3. ECOGPerformance status &gt; 2 4. Uncontrolled infection 5. Pregnancy or lactation 6. Abnormal lung diffusion capacity (DLCO &lt; 40% predicted) 7. Severe cardiovascular disease 8. CNS disease involvement 9. Pleural effusion or ascites &gt; 1 liter 10. Known hypersensitivity to fludarabine or treosulfan 11. Psychiatric conditions/disease that impair the ability to give informed consent or to adequately cooperate</criteria>
