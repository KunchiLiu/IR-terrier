	<brief_summary>ALT-2074 (BXT-51072) belongs to a class of drugs called "glutathione peroxidase mimics." ALT-2074 works by imitating a substance produced in various tissues in the body, which prevents damage of the heart and blood vessels. Diabetic patients with a haptoglobin 2-2 genotype have poor cardiovascular clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, the pharmacokinetic profile and characterize the effect on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress of repeat doses of ALT 2074. Subjects must be diabetic, with evidence of coronary artery disease and a haptoglobin 2-2 genotype</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of ALT-2074 in Subjects With Type-2 Diabetes, Haptoglobin Type 2-2 Genotype and Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be male and female, 18 to 75 years old, with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, a documented or suspected history of coronary artery disease, and a Haptoglobin type 2-2 (Hp 2-2) genotype. Subjects on prescribed anti-diabetic and coronary artery disease medications may continue to take their medications throughout the study. Subjects who qualify will receive active drug (ALT-2074 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg) or placebo every 8 hours for 28 days. There will be three sequential cohorts of increasing doses of active drug. There will be 2 follow-up visits (Days 35 and 42). Blood and urine tests for safety (chemistry and hematology), pharmacokinetics and relevant biomarkers to measure inflammation and oxidative stress will be performed throughout the study. Electrocardiograms and 24-hour Holter monitoring will also be performed at various time points during the study.</detailed_description>
