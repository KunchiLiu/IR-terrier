	<brief_summary>Mitral valve repair for ischemic mitral regurgitation is performed primarily by annuloplasty. There is some degree of late failure, which may be due in part to the type of ring employed. We want to compare late results with mitral valve annuloplasty using flexible vs rigid annuloplasty rings.</brief_summary>
