	<brief_summary>Both GlyT-1 inhibitors and NMDA-glycine site agonists have been demonstrated to be beneficial for chronic schizophrenia patients. The purpose of this study is to compare efficacy and safety of add-on treatment of sarcosine, a GlyT-1 inhibitor, and D-serine, an NMDA-glycine site agonist, in chronically stable schizophrenia patients who have been stabilized with antipsychotics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sarcosine or D-Serine Add-on Treatment for Chronic Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear. Schizophrenia patients reveal positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairments. In addition to dopamine system hyperactivity, hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor plays a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Consequently, enhancing NMDA receptor neurotransmission has been regarded as a novel treatment approach. To date, there have been several reported trials on NMDA enhancers. Both sarcosine (N-methylglycine, a glycine transporter I inhibitor) and D-serine (a potent NMDA-glycine site agonist) showed therapeutic effects in chronically stable patients. Interestingly, sarcosine appeared more efficacious than D-serine in acutely exacerbated ones when added-on to antipsychotics. Both sarcosine and D-serine yielded excellent safety profiles. It remains unclear whether sarcosine can be also more efficacious than D-serine in the treatment for chronically stable schizophrenia. The aim of this project is to examine the efficacy and safety of add-on treatment of sarcosine vs. D-serine in chronically stable schizophrenia patients who have been stabilized with antipsychotics. In the study, 60-75 schizophrenic patients are recruited into the 6-week trial and randomly assigned into the three groups (2 gm/d sarcosine, 2 gm/d D-serine, or placebo) with a double-blind manner. Clinical manifestation (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS], side effects and quality of life (QOL) are evaluated every two weeks during the trial.. The efficacies of three groups are compared.</detailed_description>
