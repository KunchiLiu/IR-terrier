	<brief_summary>This study aims at investigating the effect of growth hormone on lipid-content of muscle and liver as well as visceral fat mass in relation to insulin sensitivity. In addition, hormonal regulation and free fatty availability is assessed during a physical exercise at 50-60% VO2max. Finally, the value of physical exercise in diagnosing growth hormone deficiency is investigated. Hypothesis: 1) Lipid content of muscle and liver change with physical exercise and exercise capacity and free fatty availability will influence these changes. 2)Growth hormone replacement therapy will predominantly reduce visceral fat mass and increase free fatty availability. 3)Free fatty availability during exercise will be reduced in growth hormone deficient patients 4)Physical exercise may be an alternative way to diagnose growth hormone deficiency</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Growth Hormone (GH) on Lipid Depots</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using the two-step hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity is assessed. Lipid depots (skeletal muscle and liver) are measured by MR-spectroscopy, visceral fat mass by MR-imaging. Exercise capacity ist measured on a treadmill. Counterregulatory hormones, glucose and free fatty acids are measured during a 2h physical exercise at 50-60 VO2max Identical investigations are performed in adult growth hormone (GH) deficient patients before and after six months GH replacement therapy, in sedentary matched control subjects and in endurance trained athletes.</detailed_description>
