	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to determine if treating vitamin D deficiency decreases insulin resistance and improves insulin secretion in healthy volunteers. Additionally, this project will investigate if treating vitamin D deficiency affects a new phosphate-regulating hormone called FGF-23.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Deficiency, Insulin Resistance and FGF-23</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency or hypovitaminosis D, defined as serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D &lt; or = 20 ng/mL, is prevalent in several populations in the United States, specifically minorities and the elderly. Causes of vitamin D deficiency include lack of exposure to sunlight, malnutrition, and drugs that alter vitamin D metabolism and absorption. Vitamin D is an essential factor for many organ systems. Data suggest that vitamin D is required for normal insulin secretion by the pancreas. Specifically, animal studies demonstrate that treatment of vitamin D deficiency improves insulin secretion. In humans, there is less consensus about the impact of vitamin D deficiency on insulin resistance. In one study of middle-aged patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, no association was seen between serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels and a measure of insulin resistance. However, in a larger study of younger glucose tolerant subjects, serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels were associated with both insulin secretion and insulin resistance. These data suggest that treatment of vitamin D deficiency may delay or prevent the development of insulin resistance, and thus diabetes mellitus type 2. Repletion of this common vitamin deficiency could therefore have major public health implications for the prevention of diabetes mellitus. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is a newly discovered phosphaturic hormone that is regulated by both dietary and serum phosphate. Hormonal regulation of FGF-23, however, is largely unknown. Recent data suggest that vitamin D plays an important role in the regulation of FGF-23. Some groups have shown that inactivation of the vitamin D receptor gene decreases serum FGF-23 levels in mice; administration of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D stimulates the transcription of the FGF-23 gene in vitro. Little is known, however, about the regulation of FGF-23 by vitamin D in humans. Phosphate is critical for bone mineralization, muscle function, signal transduction, and the creation and utilization of energy. Vitamin D deficiency can result in phosphate malabsorption, osteomalacia and increased risk of fractures. Enhanced understanding of the regulation of this new phosphate-regulating hormone, FGF-23, will advance the field of phosphate metabolism.</detailed_description>
