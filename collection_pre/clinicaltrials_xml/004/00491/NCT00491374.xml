	<brief_summary>This study will hope to show that the treatment of the patient's perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) using Nasonex® (mometasone furoate nasal spray) will result in improvement of the nasal symptoms of PAR and of nighttime sleep-disordered breathing, thereby resulting in improved sleep quality, less daytime sleepiness, improved daytime functioning, and improved quality of life.</brief_summary>
