	<brief_summary>PURPOSE: We determined whether Synergo therapy- intravesical chemotherapy instillation combined with hyperthermia instillation is associated with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We will treat 25 consecutive patients with bladder cancer with a 6-week course of Synergo therapy, followed by cystoscopy at 6 weeks. Blood samples for PSA determination will obtain before each synergo therapy application and at cystoscopy with each patient also serving as a control. Evaluating changes in PSA level in patients undergoing treatment with Synergo delivered local hyperthermia combined with intravesical instillation of Mitomycin C for adjuvant treatment or pt. with recurrent tu of bladder post TURT with BCGtreatment.</brief_summary>
