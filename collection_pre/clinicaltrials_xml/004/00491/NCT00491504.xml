	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) works to relieve SAR symptoms compared to Placebo when symptoms are induced in a chamber setting. Evaluation will be based on subjects self-assessed nose symptoms. Other areas the study will evaluate are: 1) changes in eye symptoms (ocular symptom severity score) after dosing 2) how long MFNS works in relieving the nose (nasal) and eye (ocular) symptoms after 7 daily doses, 3) measurements of nose (nasal) blockage (obstruction), and 4) measurements of the subject's opinion of the study drugs by asking different questions. This study is could last up to 53 days for some subjects.</brief_summary>
