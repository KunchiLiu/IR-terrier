	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety Study of Topical Recombinant Thrombin in Surgical Hemostasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3b, open-label, single-group, multisite safety and immunogenicity study of recombinant thrombin (rThrombin) in participants who are at least 18 years of age and undergoing spinal or vascular surgery. Eligible participants will receive topical rThrombin during surgery and complete a 1-month follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
