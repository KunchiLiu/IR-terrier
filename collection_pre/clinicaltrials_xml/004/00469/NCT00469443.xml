	<brief_title>Randomized Phase III Study of Folfiri+Avastin Versus Xeliri+Avastin as 1st Line Treatment of CRC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no data of comparison for Folfiri and Xeliri regimens. The reported data demonstrated that the addition of Avastin in the combination of irinotecan/bolus 5-FU/LV has significant improvement of overall survival. Further analysis of these results showed that patients receiving irinotecan in combination with Avastin, as 1st line treatment and oxaliplatin with Avastin, as second line treatment, have median overall survival 25, 1 months, which is the longest survival that has been reported.</detailed_description>
