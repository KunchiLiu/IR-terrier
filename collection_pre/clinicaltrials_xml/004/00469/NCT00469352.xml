	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand whether genes or certain factors in the environment determine how eyes will respond to Lucentis (ranibizumab) treatment. For example, whether having variants within specific genes means that a patient is likely to get better vision from treatment than another patient with different genes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Genetic and Environmental Factors and Their Effect on Response to Treatment With Lucentis (Ranibizumab) for Wet AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. The advanced stages of the disease are characterized by the development of geographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization, both of which result in significant loss of vision. Development of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents such as ranibizumab has significantly improved outcomes for the neovascular for of the disease. However, it is not possible to predict which individuals will respond to the treatment. The objective of this study is to establish the association between genetic factors and treatment response to intravitreal Lucentis. This will be accomplished by SNP-genotyping participants for AMD-susceptibility and candidate angiogenesis-pathway genes, collecting environmental risk factor variables and evaluating clinical outcomes. The aim of this pharmacogenetics study will be to identify patients at the outset of their treatment that require more intensive therapy.</detailed_description>
