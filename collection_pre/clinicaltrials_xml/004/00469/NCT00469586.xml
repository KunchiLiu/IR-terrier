	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe, Asia, North America and South America. The aim of this research trial is to compare the efficacy of inhaled insulin to glimepiride and metformin combination therapy in treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes and to verify the safety of use (hypoglycaemia, pulmonary function, body weight, insulin antibodies and side effects).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Inhaled Insulin Compared to Metformin and Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The decision to discontinue the development of AERxÂ® is not due to any safety concerns. An analysis concluded that fast-acting inhaled insulin in the form it is known today, is unlikely to offer significant clinical or convenience benefits over injections of modern insulin with pen devices.</detailed_description>
