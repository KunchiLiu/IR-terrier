	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized internal radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well internal radiation therapy works in treating patients with primary liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internal Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine tumor response to selective internal radiation therapy comprising yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) in patients with unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the health-related quality of life of patients receiving this regimen. - Determine the survival of patients receiving this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients undergo selective internal radiation therapy comprising yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) via catheter directly into the hepatic artery on day 1. Health-related quality of life is assessed prior to initial treatment and then periodically thereafter. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 12-24 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
