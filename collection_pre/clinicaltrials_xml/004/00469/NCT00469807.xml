	<brief_summary>In this study, we have assessed the potential prognostic value for gestational outcome of maternal ghrelin levels at very early stages of IVF pregnancies. In addition, ghrelin responses to meal intake were explored at early gestation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ghrelin Levels in Early IVF Pregnancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ghrelin is a pleiotropic hormone recently involved in the control of growthand metabolism, whose circulating levels fluctuate in relation to food intake and body mass index. Ghrelin has been detected in the decidualized endometrium, as well as in human and rat placenta, with a distinctive temporal pattern of expression along pregnancy. Comparison(s): A total of 106 patients undergoing IVF procedures were prospectively recruited. On d-16 and 23 after oocyte retrieval, the patients were subjected to blood sampling after overnight fasting, for determination of serum ghrelin, hCGÔÅ¢ and progesterone levels. In addition, ghrelin levels were assayed in these groups, 2-h after ingestion of a fixed-calorie meal.</detailed_description>
