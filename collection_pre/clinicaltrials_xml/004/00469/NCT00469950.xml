	<brief_summary>The Efector study is an open, randomized and controlled trial assessing the effect of regular exercise training on endothelial function, inflammatory markers, progression of disease, heart rate variability and mental health in patients who have been successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention and stent implantation for angina pectoris.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Training on Endothelial Function, Progression of Disease,Inflammation, Heart Rate Variability and Mental Health After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pas er randomized to a 6 months training group or none training. At baseline and at 6 months patients are examined with blood tests to measure serum concentrations of inflammatory markers, a test for endothelial function, heart rate variability and a coronary angiogram. Further patients are asked to answer questionnaires concerning mental health (SF36, HADS).</detailed_description>
