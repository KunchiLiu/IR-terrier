	<brief_summary>This study investigates potential protective effect of atorvastatin pre-treatment in patient with stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patient are randomized to two groups: atorvastatin pre-treatment group (80mg atorvastatin two days before PCI) and control group (PCI without atorvastatin pretreatment). Endpoint is myocardial infarction measured by troponin I and creatine kinase myocardial band.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomized studies have shown that pre-treatment with atorvastatin may reduced periprocedural myocardial in patient with stable angina during elective PCI. These data provide evidence-based support for using atorvastatin 7 days before PCI (dosage 40mg/d), alternatively three or more days (unknown dosage). We want to confirm this results for shorter pre-treatment period (two days) with dosage 80mg per day.</detailed_description>
