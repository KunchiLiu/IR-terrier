	<brief_title>The Significance of Arrhythmias in Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Athletes with complex ventricular arrhythmias are potentially at risk of sudden death. The risk is increased when the athletes are engaged in competitive activities. Ventricular premature beats (VPB’s) are a common finding in the athletic heart. In the majority of cases these arrhythmias are part of the “athlete’s heart syndrome” and do not increase the risk of sudden death in the athletes with an apparently normal heart. The data available in the literature deal with ventricular arrhythmias assessed only by 24-h ambulatory electrocardiograms. To date, there are no guidelines concerning athletes who develop ventricular arrhythmias during a stress test. It is unclear whether they should be allowed to continue with their competitive activity or they should be denied to do so. A study looking at the long term follow-up of these athletes will help us determine whether the development of ventricular arrhythmia during a stress test imposes any risk on the athletes.</detailed_description>
