	<brief_summary>This study will document efficacy and safety of the Axiom Worldwide DRX9000™ for treatment of low back pain (LBP) in a prospective, randomized, crossover, multicenter trial utilizing a standardized clinical research multimodal protocol. During the first two weeks subjects are randomized to receive either conservative care or DRX treatment first and then cross over to receive either conservative care or DRX treatment the next 6 weeks. This study will test the hypothesis that standardized 6-week treatment regimen of spinal decompression using DRX9000™ will reduce chronic lower back pain more than conservative therapy (current baseline therapy).</brief_summary>
