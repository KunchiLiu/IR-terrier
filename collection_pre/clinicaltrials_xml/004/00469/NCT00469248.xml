	<brief_summary>The role of intra aortic balloon counterpulsation in patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction with shock is not established. We hypothesised that use of such a device would lead to improved outcomes in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aortic Balloon Counterpulastion in Myocardial Infarction Related Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with cardiogenic shock (CS) are often treated with Intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation (IABP) although the evidence to support this is limited. We conducted a prospective, randomised clinical trial, of IABP as an addition to PCI centred therapy, in patients with AMI complicated by CS. 45 patients with AMI and CS undergoing PCI were randomised to care with or without IABP. Over 4 days, APACHE II scores, haemodynamic parameters, inflammatory markers and BNP levels were collected to assess the impact of IABP treatment on CS triggered multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).</detailed_description>
