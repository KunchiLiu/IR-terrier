	<brief_summary>This study aims at considering clinical heterogeneity of patients based on a "geriatric assessment" without taking into account the real age of the subject. This will allow physicians to adapt therapy according to three different groups of patients: frail, fit and intermediate and to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a therapy adapted to the different categories of patients.</brief_summary>
