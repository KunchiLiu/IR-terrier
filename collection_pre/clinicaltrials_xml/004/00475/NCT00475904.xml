	<brief_title>A Comparison of EpiCept™ NP-1 Topical Cream vs. Oral Gabapentin in Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of NP-1 and oral gabapentin in approximately 500 patients with PHN. Adult patients with pain resulting from PHN and meeting all other eligibility requirements will be screened for 7 days to determine their average daily pain intensity.
