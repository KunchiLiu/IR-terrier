	<brief_summary>Diabetic foot ulcers are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all non-traumatic amputations performed in the United States. The cost of foot ulcers in diabetic patients averages almost $28,000 for the two years after diagnosis of the ulcer. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) serves as primary or adjunctive therapy for a diverse range of medical conditions. HBO also has been used as an adjunct to antibiotics, debridement, and revascularization in the therapy of chronic, nonhealing wounds associated with diabetes or non-diabetic vascular insufficiency. The aim of the study is to assess whether hyperoxia induced angiogenesis in diabetic patients with foot ulcers.</brief_summary>
