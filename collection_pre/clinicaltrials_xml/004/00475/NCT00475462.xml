	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Metoprolol in the Prevention of Syncope Recurrence in Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Syncope is often a frustrating clinical problem seen in pediatric patients. Most pediatric syncope is benign, and vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most common type of syncope seen in children . The diagnosis of VVS is established by history, often confirmed by tilt tests. A wide range of drugs has been proposed for VVS , with β-adrenergic blocking agents being first-line therapy. However, clinical studies have shown conflicting results in terms of therapy effectiveness. β-blockers have been claimed to be effective for 60% to 100% of young patients in many uncontrolled studies but not in most short- and long-term controlled studies . Sheldon et al., in a recent multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized study of adult patients, reported that metoprolol was not effective in preventing VVS. To our knowledge, no pediatric randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up have demonstrated the efficacy of β-blockers for the prevention of syncope.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children with a history of syncope were included if they had had at least three syncopal episodes per year and had a positive headup tilt test result. Patients were excluded if they had: Other causes of syncope; Cardiovascular and/or systemic disease; Systolic blood pressure &gt;130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mm Hg； or History of asthma, impaired liver function, Ⅱ to Ⅲ degrees of atrioventricular block, sinus bradycardia &lt; 40 beats/min, or other contraindications for βblockers.</criteria>
