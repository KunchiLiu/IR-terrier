	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants given with routine pediatric vaccinations in Canada. Immune responses induced by the infant series (NeisVac-C® and Pentacel®)and toddler dose(NeisVac-C®)of routine pediatric vaccines when administered with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will be studied for noninferiority to the immune responses when administered with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Safety profile and immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
