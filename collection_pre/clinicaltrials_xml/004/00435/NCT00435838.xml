	<brief_summary>This is a retrospective observational study which follows on from CNA106030 (a study evaluating whether prospective genetic screening for HLA-B*5701 can reduce the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir). This study aims to collect data on approximately 35 subjects who withdrew from CNA106030 when found to be HLA-B*5701 positive. HIV disease management and adverse event data in these subjects, where the risk/benefit ratio of treatment with abacavir may alter subsequent prescribing, will be collected</brief_summary>
