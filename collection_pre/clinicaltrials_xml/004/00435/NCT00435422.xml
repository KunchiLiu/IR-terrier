	<brief_summary>The effect of individualized fluid optimization during neuroaxial blockade has not been evaluated. The investigators evaluated if if Stroke decrease 15 min after activation of neuroaxial blockade and whether SV could be optimized to pre activation values.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate SV maximization with aid of the LiDCO system which is a minimal invasive technique only requiring a venous and arterial line. We thereby attempt to cover the specific individual fluid deficit induced by neuroaxial blockade.</detailed_description>
