	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Omacor (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) combined with atorvastatin for lowering non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in hypertriglyceridemic subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Omacor, Co-Administered With Atorvastatin, in Subjects With Hypertriglyceridemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study design with eleven clinic visits (one screening visit, three lead-in/baseline visits, and seven treatment visits) After a 4-week diet only lead-in period, subjects with a triglyceride (TG) level in the high to very high range and with non-HDL-C level above NCEP ATPIII goals will be randomized to receive either open-label atorvastatin 10 mg per day plus double-blinded Lovaza 4g (4 x 1g capsules) per day OR open-label atorvastatin 10 mg per day plus a double-blinded matching placebo (4 corn oil capsules per day) for 8 weeks After the initial 8-week treatment period, the dose of open-label atorvastatin will be titrated to 20 mg per day (with the Lovaza or matching placebo corn oil doses remaining at 4 capsules per day) for an additional 4 weeks At Week 12, a second open-label titration to 40 mg of open-label atorvastatin per day will be maintained for an additional 4 weeks (again with the Lovaza or matching placebo corn oil doses remaining at 4 capsules per day)</detailed_description>
