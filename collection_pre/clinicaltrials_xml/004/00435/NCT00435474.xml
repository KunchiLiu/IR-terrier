	<detailed_description>Objective: To investigate whether treatment for cancer patients with malignant wounds can improve (wound healing/wound size, odor, infection, seepage, pain) through comparing the effects of two multidimensional interventions: 1. wound treatment (silver product, alginate and foam dressing &gt;&lt; honey product, alginate and foam dressing) in combination with, 2. psycho-social support (based on the structure in cognitive therapy) and 3. relaxation therapy. Furthermore to investigate coping strategies, body image, stigma and quality of life in cancer patients with malignant wounds. Design: A hypothesis testing prospective randomized clinical intervention study (n=70) and an explorative qualitative interview study Method: Digital photographing, measurement of wound size with Quantify-Image-One, wound morphology registration (the extent of malodour, infection, seepage, bleeding, pain, the healing process), grafting, VAS-score, quality of life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30, DLQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC), interview. Patients will fill out a diary focusing on wound related problems. Perspectives: The results will determine whether the honey treatment is an improvement, and whether the silver treatment has statistical and clinical significance. The qualitative study will contribute new knowledge about conditions of life for cancer patients with cancer wounds, their feelings and impositions. In spite of proving positive effect, the project will contribute with new required knowledge on treatment and support for cancer patients suffering from malignant wounds.</detailed_description>
