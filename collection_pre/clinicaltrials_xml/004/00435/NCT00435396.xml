	<brief_summary>This will be the first time in humans (FTIH) study with the GSK Bio recombinant gB antigen to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of this CMV candidate vaccine with a proprietary GSK adjuvant system. The vaccine will be administered to young male healthy subjects at 0, 1 and 6 months. The trial will assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate CMV vaccine. An additional secondary objective of this trial is to identify and validate a test which will be able to differentiate between previous CMV infection and CMV vaccination. Subjects will be followed for a total of 2 years.</brief_summary>
