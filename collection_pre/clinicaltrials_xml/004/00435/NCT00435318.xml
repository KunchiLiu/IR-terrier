	<brief_title>Lateral Epicondylitis Iontophoresis Randomized Control Trial (LERCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intent of this double-blinded study is to investigate the short (2 months) and long-term (over 2 months) therapeutic capabilities of Iontophoresis. We anticipate that patients treated with Iontophoresis will have improved scores on the VAS and DASH assessments, and will recover more quickly than those patients receiving the Sham treatment. A Sham treatment is a method used in medical trials to help researchers determine the effectiveness of a drug/treatment which in this case will be Iontophoretic Administration using Dexamethasone. Placebos are inactive substances (Saline) used in this study to compare results with an active substance (Dexamethasone). Furthermore, it is the hope of this research team that through careful analysis and comparison of these two treatment arms a clear conclusion is met regarding the efficacy of Iontophoresis as a powerful treatment paradigm for patients suffering from this disorder.</detailed_description>
