	<brief_title>Provider and Peer Delivered Youth Smoking Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of adolescent smokers are interested in quitting and have attempted to stop with limited success. A recent review of cessation trials for adolescents has concluded that there are no proven programs to help teens stop smoking, but suggested interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy and sensitive to stages of change appear promising. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that pediatricians are well-positioned to intervene with adolescent smokers, as well as with nonsmokers to prevent initiation. A comprehensive, practice-based smoking prevention and cessation intervention for adolescents delivered by pediatric providers and peer counselors in the context of routine care has the potential for assisting nonsmoking adolescents in remaining smoke-free and smoking adolescents to quit.</detailed_description>
