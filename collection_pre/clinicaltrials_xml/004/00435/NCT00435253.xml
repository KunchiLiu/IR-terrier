	<brief_title>US 10 mL Biologic Lung Volume Reduction (BLVR) Phase 2 Emphysema Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, open-label, non-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 Study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the 10 mL BLVR System in patients with advanced upper lobe predominant emphysema. Twenty patients will be divided into 2 groups of 10 patients each and treated under conscious sedation at a total of 8 subsegments. Group 1 will be treated in 4 subsegments in 1 lung and have a second treatment of 4 subsegments in the other lung 6 to 12 weeks later. Group 2 will receive treatment at 8 subsegments (4 in each lung) during a single treatment session if possible; if not completed in 1 session the remaining subsegments will be treated 6 to 12 weeks later. Patients will be followed 96 weeks after completion of the final BLVR treatment. All patients will receive standard medical therapy in addition to BLVR treatment.</detailed_description>
