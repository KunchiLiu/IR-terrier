	<brief_summary>- The purpose of this study is to describe the effect of a single (IM) dose of motavizumab in the upper respiratory tract in children who present with RSV illness but who do not require hospitalization at the time of presentation and - Describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab in decreasing the need for hospitalization due to worsening RSV illness in children who receive outpatient treatment - Describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab on subsequent respiratory status as measured by the Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS) and change in oxygen saturation - For children who require hospitalization, describe the effect of motavizumab on severity of RSV illness during hospitalization [i.e., RACS, oxygen saturation, heart rate, use of supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay] - Describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab on duration of symptoms of RSV illness (fever, coryza, cough, and parental opinion of return to normal health and activity) - Describe the nasal concentration of motavizumab following a single 30mg/kg dose - Describe the serum pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab - Describe the effect of motavizumab on markers of inflammation as measured by gene microarray and cytokine levels - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab in the outpatient treatment of children with RSV - Describe the progression and severity of lower respiratory infection (LRI)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate a Single IM Dose of Motavizumab Treatment of Children With RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to determine the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab on viral load and motavizumab levels in the upper respiratory tract of children who present with RSV illness but who do not require hospitalization. Using 1:1 randomization, 30 mg/kg motavizumab or placebo will be administered as soon as possible after a child's diagnosis of RSV and his/her eligibility for the study has been confirmed.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Previously healthy Age ≤12 months at the time of randomization Weight ≤10 kg at the time of randomization Gestational age ≥36 weeks RSV illness (must have coryza) documented by a positive RSV test at the time of evaluation Documented stable clinical condition that does not require hospitalization (oxygen saturation ≥ 95%; respiratory rate &lt; 60 breaths/min in children &lt; 2 months and &lt; 50 breaths/min in children 212 months) Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) score of ≤ 6 (there can be no more than 1 point assigned for each of the 6 assessment categories) at baseline evaluation Randomization within 4 hours of being evaluated with a positive Binax® RSV test Written informed consent obtained from the patient's parent(s) or legal guardian Prior receipt of or receiving treatment with steroids (except topical steroids) prior to randomization Prior medically diagnosed RSV infection Prior receipt of or receiving antiviral treatment for the current episode of RSV infection prior to randomization Any medically significant underlying ongoing chronic illness or organ system dysfunction or other known acute illness, other than the acute RSV infection Known renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, hematologic abnormalities, seizure or other neurologic disorder or immunodeficiency Requirement for supplemental oxygen (brief use of oxygen in the immediate postnatal period to treat a transient condition is allowed) Mechanical ventilation at any time prior to the onset of the current RSV infection Congenital heart disease [children with medically or surgically closed patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), small atrial septal defect (ASD) or small ventricular septal defect (VSD) will be allowed] Previous reaction to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), blood products, or other foreign proteins Prior use of IVIG, RSVIGIV (RespiGam®), motavizumab or other immunoglobulin products within the past 2 months Prior use of palivizumab (Synagis®) within the past 2 months Currently receiving other investigational agents or have received any other investigational agents within the last 3 months Prior or current participation in any investigational study with a therapeutic agent or vaccine for RSV</criteria>
