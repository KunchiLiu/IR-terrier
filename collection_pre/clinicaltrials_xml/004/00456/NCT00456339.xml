	<brief_title>Systemic Steroids Plus Antibiotics in Sleep Apnea Syndrome in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will enroll children between 18 months and 12 years of age with mild sleep apnea and treat them with 5 days of prednisolone and 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate. We will obtain a questionnaire pre and post treatment and ask the parents to tell us if they think the child has improved enough after treatment to forego surgery. If not, they will undergo an adenotonsillectomy to relieve their sleep apnea and if yes, we will repeat the sleep study to make sure that the apnea has resolved.</detailed_description>
