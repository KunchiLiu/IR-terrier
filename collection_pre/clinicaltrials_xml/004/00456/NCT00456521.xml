	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination of naltrexone SR and bupropion SR is safe and effective in treating obesity and leads to greater weight loss when given with a group lifestyle modification program than with group lifestyle modification alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of Naltrexone SR/Bupropion SR and Placebo in Overweight and Obese Subjects Participating in an Intensive Behavior Modification Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of group lifestyle modification counseling and pharmacotherapy has recently been shown to result in nearly twice the average weight loss at one year (12.1 kg) as pharmacotherapy alone (sibutramine, 5.0 kg) or lifestyle modification counseling alone (6.7 kg). Combining pharmacotherapy with a comprehensive program of diet, exercise and group lifestyle modification counseling may provide the best weight loss regimen. This study evaluated weight loss in subjects participating in such a comprehensive program who received a combination of naltrexone SR and bupropion SR, or placebo.</detailed_description>
