	<brief_title>Effect of Peppermint Water on Breast Crack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred and ninety-six primipara participants, who are breastfeeding after delivery at 38 or more week gestation, were assigned randomly to 2 groups, with one of 2 regimens (peppermint water, an old household remedy, and no treatment only using breast milk) to right and left sides. Each group was followed for a maximum of 3 visits within 14 days and until the 6 weeks postpartum by telephone call. The aerial parts of Mentha piperita were purchased from Hakim Momen Tabrizi Company, and the identity was confirmed by morphological characterization in comparison with the herbarium specimen retained in the School of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Also, a voucher specimen has been generated in that herbarium.</detailed_description>
