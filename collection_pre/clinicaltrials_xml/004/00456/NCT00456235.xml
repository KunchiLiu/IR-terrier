	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to determine whether, in liver transplant patients with side effects due to ICN, the use of MMF in monotherapy can be optimised by dose adjustment based on the area under the curve (AUC) of mycophenolic acid (MPA). It involves a multicentre phase IV trial with direct individual benefit. A population of 130 liver transplant patients at 2 to 10 years post-transplant, showing significant clinical ICN side effects and being given bitherapy by ICN +MMF will be included and randomised 1:1 in two arms: - Arm 1: progressive interruption of ICN after obtaining an AUC of MPA of 50 mg.h/l, followed by MMF monotherapy with dose adjustment based on the AUC of MPA, - Arm 2: continuation of the ICN+MMF bitherapy without MMF therapeutic drug monitoring. The main judgement criterion will be the incidence of acute rejection in the 2 groups at 6 months. The secondary judgment criterion will be the evaluation of the benefit of stopping ICN on the side effects caused by these drugs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient with first liver transplantion or retransplantation since more than 6 months: with a posttransplant lapse of time of 2 to 10 years and showing one of the following adverse effects of ICN: Renal insufficiency defined by a creatinine clearance &lt;50ml/mn (calculated or estimated according to the Cockcroft formula) Arterial hypertension not controlled by an antihypertensive bitherapy Diabetes mellitus (fasting glycaemia &gt;7.0mmol/l), whether treated or not Neuromuscular toxicity Immunosuppression by cyclosporine or tacrolimus and MMF Hepatic biopsy performed within the 6 months preceding the inclusion for the patients with a posttransplant period of &lt;5 years and in the 12 months preceding the inclusion for patients with a post transplant period of &gt;5 years. Acute rejection within the 6 months preceding the screening Previous history of corticoresistant rejection Chronic rejection Significant ductopenia (absence of interlobule biliary canals in more than 30% of the portal tracts) on the prescreening biopsy. Existence of a pretransplantation diabetes mellitus. Liver transplantation for autoimmune hepatitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis Patients transplanted for viral C cirrhosis with reinfection lesions of the transplanted organ, rendering treatment by ribarivine + interferon conceivable in the year following inclusion. Counterindications to MMF (anaemia, leucopenia) Immunosuppression by sirolimus, everolimus, azathioprine or corticoids</criteria>
