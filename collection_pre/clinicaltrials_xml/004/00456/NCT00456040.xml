	<brief_title>Characteristics of Patients With Amyloidosis &amp; Heart Failure Being Evaluated for a Heart Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic amyloidosis is a progressive disease leading to organ failure and death. Treatment has improved survival with stem-cell transplantation. Unfortunately, patients with amyloidosis and severe heart failure are not eligible for stem-cell transplantation. The average rate of survival for patients with amyloidosis who receive a heart transplant is decreased. Previous trials have raised the possibility that survival may be increased in patients with amyloidosis, if chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation is performed after a heart transplant. We plan to review data of patients with amyloidosis and heart failure who were being evaluated for a heart transplant.</detailed_description>
