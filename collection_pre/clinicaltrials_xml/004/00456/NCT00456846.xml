	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, phase II study to determine the toxicity and antitumor activity of ABI-007 100 mg/m2 administered weekly for 3 weeks followed by a rest week (4-week cycle) as first line therapy to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the following 2 cohorts: Patients who have received a taxane as part of their adjuvant therapy, and patients who did not receive a taxane as part of their adjuvant therapy. Patients will be assessed for antitumor response every 8 weeks. The last subject received study treatment 11DEC2012. The study was terminated on 31 May 2013 via a notification letter to all investigators on 14 May 2013.</detailed_description>
