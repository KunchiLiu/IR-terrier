	<brief_summary>Distal embolization can occur during coronary angioplasty performed in the acute phase of myocardial infarction and is associated with poor long-term outcome. We hypothesize that the use of a system allowing thrombus aspiration before angioplasty and stent implantation will limit infarct size and its severity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coronary Thromboaspiration and Infarct Size</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for emergency angioplasty in the acute phase of a first ST-elevation myocardial infarction will be treated either by thromboaspiration followed by angioplasty or by angioplasty alone. The infarct size and severity will be assessed by ce-MRI and rest Tc99m-mibi gated SPECT performed during initial hospital stay (5th-8th day). A control MRI will be performed at 6-month follow-up to analyse the evolution of left ventricular volumes.</detailed_description>
