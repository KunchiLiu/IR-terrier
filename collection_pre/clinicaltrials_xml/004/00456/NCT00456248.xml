	<criteria>Male or female, at least 18 years of age and no older than 65 years with compensated chronic HCV infection based on a history of positive serum antiHCV antibody and/or HCV RNA Diagnosed with HCV Genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 as determined during the screening visit The starting doses in the initial treatment must have been 1.5 μg/kg/week PEGIntron or 180 μg/week Pegasys, and 1000/1200 mg/day ribavirin based on body weight. Patients must have been at least 80% compliant during the initial peginterferon/ribavirin therapy, per patient account. Liver biopsy indicating F0F4 must be performed within 3 years prior to screening. Documentation of the results of the biopsy must be available. If documentation is not available, a liver biopsy must be performed during the screening period. (A maximum of 10 patients in each of the three treatment groups will be patients with a fibrosis score of F4) Documented partial response after 12 weeks of treatment as a therapynaive patient with one course of peginterferon alfa2a (PEGASYS) and Ribavirin or peginterferon alfa2b (PegINTRON) and Ribavirin Detectable HCV RNA after 12 weeks if initial peginterferon alfa/ribavirin therapy and &lt;2 log decrease in HCV RNA at Week 12 from baseline. HCV Genotype 2 or 3 Severe neuropsychiatric disorder. History or clinical manifestations of significant metabolic, hematological, pulmonary, ischemic heart disease, significant or unstable heart disease, gastrointestinal, neurological, renal, urological, endocrine, ophthalmologic disorders including severe retinopathy, or immunemediated disease. Known HIV infection or positive HIV at screening. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients. Underlying autoimmune disease</criteria>
