	<brief_summary>Patients diagnosed as having hemoglobinopathies are exposed to serious bacterial infections, principally those patients that underwent splenectomy. Since the introduction of anti pneumococcal vaccine the incidence decreased significantly but other bacteria besides encapsulated bacteria takes place as principal cause of invasive infections. The purpose of this study is to analyse in a retrospective study the incidence of those infections in a group of patients suffering from thalassemia and sickle cell anemia treated in our clinic.</brief_summary>
