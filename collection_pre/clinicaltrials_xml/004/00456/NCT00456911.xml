	<brief_title>Family Dietary Coaching to Improve Nutritional Intakes and Body Weight Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insufficient evidence supports the feasibility and the efficacy of current nutritional recommendations to prevent obesity. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that family dietary coaching would improve nutritional intakes and health indicators in free-living children and adults. Intervention: the 1013 participating families (1013 children and 1013 parents) are randomly assigned to Group A (advice to reduce fat and to increase complex carbohydrates), Group B (advice to reduce both fat and sugars and to increase complex carbohydrates) or a control group (no advice). GA and GB receive monthly phone counseling and Internet-based monitoring. Main outcome measures are changes in nutritional intakes and body mass index throughout the intervention in both children and adults. Secondary outcomes included changes in fat mass, physical activity, fasting blood indicators and food-related quality of life.</detailed_description>
