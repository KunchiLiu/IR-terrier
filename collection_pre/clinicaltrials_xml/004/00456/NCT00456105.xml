	<brief_summary>Diabetes is a very common illness. Approximately 4% of British Columbians have diabetes. However, at least 20% of people admitted to acute care hospitals have diabetes. People with diabetes are at a higher risk for developing complications after surgery including infection and prolonged hospital stay, especially if blood sugars are high. The researchers are testing a Diabetes Action Team to see if their involvement in patient care after surgery improves blood glucose control, duration of stay in hospital, and infection rates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of a Diabetes Action Team in Patients Post Infrainguinal Bypass Surgery With and Without Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will randomize subjects with diabetes who plan to undergo elective infrainguinal bypass surgery to receive either standard diabetes care by their admitting physician, or diabetes care under the direction of the Diabetes Action Team post operatively until hospital discharge and post discharge in the community. Subjects without diabetes will have their blood glucose levels monitored while in the hospital. The Diabetes Action team will consist of a nurse coordinator who is a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) and a team of physicians specialized in the management of diabetes. The study will not increase the length of the hospital stay.</detailed_description>
