	<criteria>Histologically, cytologically or clinically diagnosed (in patient with cirrhosis, AlphaFetoprotein(AFP)≥400μg/L and morphological evidence [contrast Computed Tomography(CT)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)] of hypervascular liver tumor, elevated AFP level due to other reasons [germ cell carcinoma, progressive chronic hepatitis, pregnancy, etc] can be excluded) unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, ineligible or if the patient does not consent to receive local invasive treatment (chemoembolism, ablation, etc.). At least one measurable lesion (on CT: ≥2cm, on spiral CT or MRI ≥1cm) Have not received previous palliative systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. If the patient received previous systemic chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment, he must have been completed at least 12 months previously. Patients progress after previous local treatment and at the time of randomization is at least 4 weeks after the last interventional therapy (Hepatic Artery Infusion, TransArtery Embolization or TransArtery ChemoEmbolization) or at least 8 weeks after the last radiotherapy/ablation/ Percutaneous Ethanol Injection to the target lesion. Karnofsky Performance Score≥70, Barcelona of Cancer Liver Category stage B/C Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function: Neutrophilus≥1.5X10^9/L Platelets≥75X10^9/L Asparagine AminoTransferase,Alanine AminoTransferase&lt;2.5 Upper Normal Limit(UNL) Total Bilirubin&lt;1.5 UNL International Normalized Ratio&lt;1.5 Child stage A or B Normal base line Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF result must be above or equal to the lower limit of normal for the institution) Documented allergy to platinum compound or to other study drugs. Any previous oxaliplatin or doxorubicin treatment, except adjuvant treatment more than 12 months before the randomization. Previous liver transplantation. Patients concomitantly receiving any other anticancer therapy, including interferonα and herbal medicine which was approved by local authority to be used as "anticancer" medicine, except radiotherapy to nontarget lesion (bone metastasis, etc) Patients who are receiving any other study treatments.
