	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, multi-centre, controlled study comparing the safety and tolerability on wound healing following an application of I-020502 in a concentration of 1μg/mL TG-PDGF.AB versus staples applied in the same patient to burn areas requiring autologous meshed skin grafting.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Written informed consent by the patient or his/her legal representative. 2. Male or female, aged ≥ 18 years. 3. Female with childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test within 3 day prior to surgery (screening). 4. Patients with burn wound(s) between ≥ 5 % and ≤ 50 % TBSA. 5. Patients with a contiguous deep partial thickness/full thickness wound(s) of two comparable sites either contiguous or separate in the same location (e.g. leg) each sized between 1% and 2% TBSA but not more than 400 cm2. 6. Patients who are willing to comply with treatment applications and instructions by the protocol. 1. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 2. Patients with known or suspected allergies to any of the components of the wound healing gel I020502 (e.g. hypersensitivity to bovine proteins). 3. Digits, head, genitalia, palms of hands, soles of feet, and face are excluded as test sites. 4. Electrical and/or chemical burns. 5. Patients that are judged to have significant pulmonary compromise. 6. Transcutaneous tissue oxygenation &lt; 90%. 7. Clinically significant infections at wound sites. 8. Clinically significant systemic infections. 9. Suspicion or presence of active systemic or local cancer or tumor of any kind. 10. Patients with known immunodeficiency disorders, either congenital or acquired. 11. Patients with vascular or skin disorders that directly affect the designated wound site. 12. Patients with Diabetes mellitus. 13. Patients with chronic malnourishment. 14. Chronic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or systemic corticosteroids within the last 2 months prior to surgery. 15. Any other acute or chronic concurrent medical conditions that in the Investigator's opinion are a contraindication to skin mesh grafting and study participation. 16. Participation in another investigational study within 30 days prior to surgery, for investigational devices, or within the last three months for investigational drugs related to wound healing.</criteria>
