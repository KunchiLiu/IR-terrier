	<brief_summary>The proposed study aims to provide current information, etiology and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), risk factors for for CAP in isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influencae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella. Risk factors, including patient demographics, comorbid illnesses, setting of presentation, causative organisms, antibiotic history, and resistance profiles will be assessed and outcome will be recorded.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etiology of Community Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following information will be collected: age, sex, occupation, hospital location at the time of positive culture (ER, medical ward, ICU etc), date of positive culture, prior hospitalization, receipt of outpatient dialysis, home care or other regular medical care (eg, outpatient chemotherapy), presence of invasive devices, receipt of antibiotics, including their type and whether they were adequate for the resistance profile of the organism, prior positive microbiologic cultures, time and location of positive cultures, underlying diseases and severity of illness, co-morbid illnesses, presence of urinary or intravascular devices, recent immunomodulative therapies or radiation therapy, physical exam findings, laboratory and radiographical data, antimicrobial usage within 30 days of onset of the infection, microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once organism identified, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information, medications, clinical outcome,gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and past medical history. We will collect information retrospectively.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influencae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella species infections during the time period the study will be reviewed. A communityassociated pneumonia isolate will be defined as one which was recovered from a clinical culture from a patient at UPMC who had no established risk factors for infection with an antibiotic resistant organism. Established risk factors are defined as: Isolation of the organism two or more days after admission for hospitalization OR history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, or residence in a longterm care facility within one year before the culture date OR The presence of an indwelling catheter or percutaneous medical device (eg, tracheostomy tube, gastrostomy tube, or Foley catheter) at the time of the culture OR Previous isolation of an antibiotic resistant organism. Does not meet entry criteria</criteria>
