	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Ethanol-lock treatment may help prevent central venous catheter infections in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of ethanol-lock treatment in preventing central venous catheter infections in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ethanol-Lock Treatment in Preventing Central Venous Catheter Infections in Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety and tolerability of the ethanol-lock strategy (ETL) in preventing central venous catheter infections in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma being treated on clinical trial MSKCC-03077. Secondary - Determine whether this strategy increases the likelihood of remaining infection-free for 6 months. - Determine the cumulative incidence of a single positive centrally-drawn blood culture in these patients and compare to previously obtained historical controls. - Determine the median time-to-infection of the central line, where infection is defined as any positive centrally-drawn (from the treated line) blood culture. - Determine the cumulative incidence of central line removals in these patients and compare to historical controls. - Collate the types of organisms among these patients who develop a positive centrally-drawn blood culture and compare to historical controls. OUTLINE: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, historical control study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody 3F8 on clinical trial MSKCC-03077. In each course of monoclonal antibody 3F8 treatment, patients receive ethanol-lock treatment on days 0-3 (after each monoclonal antibody 3F8 infusion) for up to 6 months for central venous catheter management. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
