	<brief_summary>Previously we have demonstrated in animal experiments,that pancreas is extremely vulnerable to handling, reacting with the development of pancreatitis. In human pancreatic surgery, post-operative pancreatitis mediates many other post-operative complications. A new anastomosis was developed to diminish the injury, as being without any stitches going through the pancreas. The aims were to study up to 30 patients as phase one study, with an interim analysis in this open uncontrolled trial after the first few patients.</brief_summary>
