	<brief_summary>Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy with verteporfin for the treatment of patients with corneal neovascularization. Design: Prospective, non-comparative case series. Participants: Eighteen eyes of 18 patients with stable corneal neovascularization who were refractory to conventional treatment. Methods: The patients were treated with photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (6 mg/m2). Five patients were treated following penetrating keratoplasty, and 2 patients were treated before penetrating keratoplasty. Best corrected visual acuity and anterior segment photography were performed before and after treatment. The length of cumulative blood vessels and area of corneal neovascularization were measured. Main outcome measures: Vascular occlusion, best corrected visual acuity, cumulative blood vessel length, and corneal neovascularization area.</brief_summary>
