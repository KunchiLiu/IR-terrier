	<brief_summary>There is supposed that patients with functional esophageal disorders such as functional heartburns and functional chest pain have common underlying mechanisms of symptom generation. These include esophageal dysmotility, non-acidic gastro-esophageal reflux, duodeno-gastro-esophageal reflux, esophageal hypersensitivity, and psychological comorbidity. The treatment of these patients is the growing challenge in the primary care medicine and in the gastroenterological practice. It was postulated that functional disorders of the esophagus are the main reason for PPI failure in patients with heartburn. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of biofeedback in the treatment of patients with functional chest pain and functional heartburns.</brief_summary>
