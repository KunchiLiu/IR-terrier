	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Topical cream containing amitriptyline and ketamine may help relieve pain, numbness, tingling, and other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. It is not yet known whether topical amitriptyline and ketamine cream is more effective than a placebo in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the side effects and how well topical amitriptyline and ketamine cream work compared with a placebo in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy in patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Amitriptyline and Ketamine Cream in Treating Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by Chemotherapy in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the analgesic properties and safety of topical amitriptyline and ketamine hydrochloride cream vs placebo in cancer patients with chemotherapy peripheral neuropathy (CPN) who have received taxanes or other cancer chemotherapy agents. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) site. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients apply amitriptyline and ketamine hydrochloride topical analgesic cream twice daily to areas of pain, numbness, or tingling in the hands and/or feet. - Arm II: Patients apply a placebo cream twice daily to areas of pain, numbness, or tingling in the hands and/or feet. In both arms, treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue treatment for up to a total of 12 weeks. Patients complete a peripheral neuropathy intensity and quality of sleep diary daily. Patients also complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (EORTC-CIPN20) to assess change in sensory score and the Brief Pain Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess health-related quality of life in week 3 and 6. The Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) is administered at baseline to assess level of physical activity and the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) symptom inventory is administered to track other potentially important symptoms. The Patient Global Impression of Change Questionnaire is administered in week 6 to assess the patient's overall assessment of change since beginning treatment, including changes in pain, side effects, functional status, and overall satisfaction with treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 462 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: History of cancer Pain, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet beginning in association with a cancer chemotherapy agent (taxane or other chemotherapeutic agent) and persisting for at least 28 days following the conclusion of chemotherapy Pain, numbness, or tingling can be assessed 28 days or more after the conclusion of chemotherapy An average score of ≥ 4 for the 7 daily ratings of the baseline week on the 11point rating scale of peripheral neuropathy associated with chemotherapy, with a minimum of 5 daily diary ratings completed during the baseline week No preexisting or history of peripheral neuropathy due to any cause other than chemotherapy (e.g., hereditary, alcohol, or diabetes) Patients with stable systemic metastases and/or bone involvement AND has not received chemotherapy within 3 months of screening assessment are eligible Patients receiving ongoing treatment with nonchemotherapy agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies or hormonal treatment) allowed No concurrent active chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting or for progressive systemic disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Karnofsky performance status 60100% Creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception Able to adequately understand English No allergy or hypersensitivity to ketamine hydrochloride or amitriptyline or any of the components of study drug No clinically significant illness (e.g., endocrine, cardiac, hepatic, renal, neurologic, hematologic, or skeletal illness) that, in the investigator's clinical judgment, could interfere with the efficacy or safety assessments in this study No glaucoma or recurrent urinary retention No clinically significant depression or dementia that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with a patient's adherence to the study protocol and/or the accurate and consistent reporting of CPN No open skin lesions in the area where the cream is to be applied No HIV positivity PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics At least 30 days since prior unapproved experimental drugs or biological agents No prior topical treatment, nerve blocks, implantable therapy, peripheral nerve or spinal cord stimulation, or neurosurgical procedure for chemotherapyrelated peripheral neuropathy (CPN) No prior exposure to a peripheral neurotoxin other than chemotherapy No concurrent medications (e.g., phenytoin) known to be associated with sensory neuropathy No concurrent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline), which inhibit CP450 2D6, unless the patient is being treated for depression or another psychiatric disorder and, in the investigator's judgment, the patient's participation in the study can be permitted given the minimal systemic levels of amitriptyline found within the cream No concurrent monoamine oxidase inhibitors, barbiturates, anticholinergic agents, or sympathomimetic drugs, including epinephrine combined with local anesthetics Oral inhalers that include any of the drugs listed above are allowed Concurrent opioid analgesics, tricyclic or dual reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, or gabapentin or pregabalin for CPN, or benzodiazepines for sleep allowed, provided dose has been stable for ≥ 2 weeks and the following are true: Gabapentin dose ≤ 1,800 mg per day Pregabalin dose ≤ 300 mg per day Opioid analgesic dose ≤ 60 mg oxycodone hydrochloride equivalent per day Tricyclic antidepressant dose ≤ 75 mg amitriptyline equivalent per day Duloxetine dose ≤ 60 mg per day Venlafaxine dose ≤ 150 mg per day Tramadol dose ≤ 200 mg per day Concurrent adjunctive analgesic therapy, such as acupuncture, biofeedback, or herbal preparations, allowed provided dose has been stable for ≥ 2 weeks</criteria>
