	<brief_title>Feasibility Study: Accuracy of Biomarker in Detection of Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study aims at developing an accurate, simple and cost-effective method for screening and early detection of uterine cancers in women using novel inventions and biotechnology methods for collection and assay of uterine cells. Results of P2X7 assays using tissues obtained from women with known uterine cancer and from women with histologically normal endometrium will be compared. These data will also serve as basis for future studies to test the predictive value of the method in population-based studies.</detailed_description>
