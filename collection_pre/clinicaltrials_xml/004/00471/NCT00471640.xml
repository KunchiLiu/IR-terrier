	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Infusion in Community-acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common and approximately 20 percent of all episodes of pneumonia result in hospitalization. It is the leading cause of community-acquired infection requiring ICU admission.1 Especially elderly patients may have a severe illness with a high morbidity and mortality rate. In pulmonary infections, the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators from alveolar macrophages serves as a useful mechanism in the elimination of invading pathogens. However, this natural reaction can be potentially harmful when excessive release of circulating inflammatory cytokines causes damage to the patient, particularly the lung. Interest in the role of corticosteroids in the pathophysiology of critical illness has existed since the early part of the 20th century. On ICU, early treatment with corticosteroids to attenuate systemic inflammation is widespread. At the same time, outside the ICU little evidence is available on the effect of treatment with corticosteroids in patients diagnosed with CAP. Hypothetically, early initiated administration of corticosteroids in the course of a CAP can lower systemic and pulmonary inflammation. This may lead to earlier resolution of pneumonia and a reduction of complications (sepsis, mortality).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients aged 18 to 100 years with a communityacquired pneumonia. Criteria to determine a communityacquired pneumonia: Chest radiograph showing new opacities In combination with two of the following findings: Cough Production of sputum Temp &gt;38,0 °C or &lt;36,0 °C Audible abnormalities by chest examination compatible with pneumonia Leukocytosis (&gt;10.000 cells/mm3), leftward shift (&gt;10%) or leukopenia (&lt;4000 cells/mm3) CRP &gt; 15 mg/dl (three times upper limit of normal) o The following groups are excluded: Immunocompromised patients: Patients with a known congenital or achieved immunodeficiency. Patients who received chemotherapy less than 6 weeks ago. Patients who received corticosteroids in the last 6 weeks. Patients who received immunosuppressive medication in the last 6 weeks. (like cyclosporine, cyclofosfamide, azathioprine) Patients with COPD who are on systemic corticosteroids for COPD. Patients who require ICU treatment.</criteria>
