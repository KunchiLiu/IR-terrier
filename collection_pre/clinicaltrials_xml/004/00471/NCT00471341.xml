	<brief_summary>This study involves a drug called celecoxib, which is commonly prescribed for people with arthritis. Arthritis is caused by inflammation of the joints or tissues. Inflammation also occurs in the blood vessels that lead to your heart, and the purpose of this study is to see if celecoxib can reduce the blood vessel inflammation associated with high cholesterol and heart disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Celecoxib on Markers of Vascular Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammation of the blood vessel wall is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), as well as blood pressure are known to be proinflammatory. Recent information suggests that acute ischemic events are associated with exacerbations in inflammation. Some data suggest that aspirin use is associated with suppression of markers of inflammation, and this response has been linked with improved outcome. Similarly, HMG Co-A Reductase inhibitors clearly reduce adverse outcomes in patients with atherosclerosis and recently, HMG Co-A Reductase inhibitor use has also been linked to reduction in inflammation. Due to the strong association of atherogenesis and plaque stability with inflammation, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, has been evaluated as a potential tool for clinicians to assess cardiovascular risk, and has been found to be highly correlated. There is also evidence to suggest that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme is expressed in plaque at regions which are vulnerable to rupture. Accordingly, this study is designed to investigate the potential reduction in vascular inflammation from a specific COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, as measured by a reduction from baseline of CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-alpha). This is a double blind, placebo controlled pilot study in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease and dyslipidemia, to evaluate the effect of celecoxib versus placebo on inflammatory markers. Patients will receive study drug for three months.</detailed_description>
