	<brief_title>Effect of Nicotine on Chronic Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential subjects are female non-smokers presenting to their physicians for treatment of chronic pelvic pain. When consented, the subjects fill out a questionnaire on demographic information and pain experience. The trial is conducted at home over three days. Each subject uses three different levels of nicotine (0mg, 5mg, and 10mg) administered in a random order; the study is double-blinded and patients act as their own controls. Subjects apply the placebo or nicotine patches in the morning and remove them in the evening when they fill out a pain diary for the day. During the study, patients will continue their typical course of pain medication and report pain medication use in the pain diary.</detailed_description>
