	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that once weekly and once every-2-weeks treatment with epoetin alfa, in patients with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease, is not less effective than the approved treatment with epoetin alfa that is given 3 times weekly with respect to changes in hemoglobin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Epoetin Alfa for Initiation and Maintenance Treatment of Patients With Anemia Associated With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), multicenter study designed to show that 2 alternative dosing regimens, once weekly and once every-2-weeks (given at doses equivalent to 50 IU/kg 3 times a week) are not inferior to the 3-times-weekly dosing regimen. Approximately 375 patients with anemia will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive epoetin alfa by subcutaneous (SC) injection according to one of the following 3 regimens: 3 times weekly (Group 1), once weekly (Group 2), or once every 2 weeks (Group 3) for 22 weeks. Thereafter, patients in Group 1 will be switched to the once-weekly dosing regimen for an additional 22 weeks, and patients in Groups 2 and 3 will continue their current treatment for an additional 22 weeks. The total duration of the open-label treatment phase is 44 weeks which will include initiation and maintenance treatment periods (with the goal of increasing, then maintaining, the hemoglobin level between 11.0 and 11.9 g/dL inclusive) and a safety period (to assess longer exposure to epoetin alfa treatment and any period of hemoglobin instability during the transition from 3-times-weekly to once-weekly dosing). Starting doses of epoetin alfa in the 3-times-weekly, once-weekly, and every-2-weeks groups will be 50 IU/kg, 10,000 IU, and 20,000 IU, respectively; thereafter adjusted according to weekly hemoglobin concentrations. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs.</detailed_description>
