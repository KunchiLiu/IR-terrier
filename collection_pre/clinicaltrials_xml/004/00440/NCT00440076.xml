	<brief_title>Velcade in Myelodysplastic Syndrome - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are an heterogeneous group of clonal disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenias, and variable risk of progression to more advanced disease and/or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The disease affects predominantly elderly individuals (median age 69 years); the overall incidence is about 4 per 100,000 individuals but this rises to &gt; 30 per 100,000 in the over 70 year age population. Therapy for MDS has included hematopoietic growth factors (in primis EPO, in combination or not with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor- G-CSF or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-GM-CSF), differentiating agents, immunotherapy, low dose chemotherapy strategies, AML-like induction regimens, traditional cytotoxic agents, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) strategies. With the exception of HSCT, which can result in long-term survival in 23% to 50% of patients (Ref. 10) therapy for MDS has not consistently shown a survival advantage, and also modest results have been obtained in an attempt to improve anemia and/or the other cytopenias, and to decrease the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Furthermore, MDS is primarily a disease of older patients who cannot tolerate aggressive therapy and therefore cannot receive HSCT. No therapy has thus been considered standard for MDS, and supportive therapy, including RBC transfusions, platelet transfusions and antibiotic therapy has often been focus of care, especially in the older patient population. VELCADE™ (bortezomib) for injection is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (MPI) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies. VELCADE is currently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least 2 prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. VELCADE is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid derived from leucine and phenylalanine; its chemical name is N pyrazinecarbonyl L phenylalanine L leucine boronic acid and has a molecular weight of 384.25 daltons. Data from non clinical and clinical studies conducted to date support the development of Velcade for the treatment of human malignancies.</detailed_description>
