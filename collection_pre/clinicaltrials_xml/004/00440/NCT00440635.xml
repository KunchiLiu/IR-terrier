	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide bortezomib to patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 2 previous lines of therapy and are refractory or have relapse after their last treatment. Additional objectives of this study are assess the safety and tolerability of bortezomib and follow the levels of paraprotein in patients receiving bortezomib as a way to followup disease burden</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) to Provide Bortezomib to Patients With Multiple Myeloma Who Have Received at Least 2 Previous Lines of Therapy and Are Refractory to or Have Relapsed After Their Last Therapy for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma is uniformly fatal. Responses achieved after multiple lines of therapy are normally of short duration. Therefore, all patients with multiple myeloma will eventually relapse, having become refractory to therapy and subsequently will die of their cancer. The rationale of this study is that bortezomib as a novel agent may allow additional periods of response due to its different mechanisms of action. This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, non-comparative study to provide expanded access to bortezomib to patients with multiple myeloma that have received at least two previous lines of therapy and are refractory to or have relapsed after their last treatment. Patients will receive treatment with bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on day 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 3-week cycle. No treatment will be administered on the last 10 days of each cycle. Treatment may be repeated for up to 8 cycles with possible extension if patient is still responding at the end of the 8 cycle period. Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 will be administered as an IV bolus</detailed_description>
