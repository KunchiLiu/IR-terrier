	<brief_summary>Transforming Growth Factor-b1 (TGF-b1) is involved in the development of acute lung injury and in the fibroproliferation during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Procollagen III Peptide (PIIINP) is a validated marker of fibroproliferation. PIIINP is associated with death in ARDS patients. The simultaneous changes of TGF-b1 and PIIINP were never studied in patients with ARDS. The relationships between TGF-b1 and the outcome of ARDS are unknown. The aim of the study is to analyse the changes of TGF-b1 and PIIINP during ARDS and to show the relationships between TGF-b1 - PIIINP and the outcomes of ARDS.</brief_summary>
