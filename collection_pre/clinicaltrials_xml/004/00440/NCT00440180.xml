	<brief_summary>Obesity is associated with an increase in blood levels of estrogen. Estrogen or "female hormone" is believed to have a negative effect on sperm production. Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole work to decrease the production of estrogen and increase testosterone in the body. By decreasing the level of estrogen, sperm production should improve. In this study, the investigators will try to determine the benefit of anastrozole in obese men and follow pregnancy outcomes.</brief_summary>
