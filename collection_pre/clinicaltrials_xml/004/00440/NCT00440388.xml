	<brief_summary>This is a phase II clinical trial in patients who have not received systemic treatment for follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study combines rituximab, an approved drug for this disease, with AT-101, an experimental drug. The hypothesis is that by adding AT-101 to the rituximab regimen, improvement to patients' response to the treatment will be observed verses rituximab alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed, previously untreated Grade III follicular Bcell nonHodgkin's lymphoma (stage I, II, III and IV). Patients may have received radiation therapy to one lymph node region; Stage I or II patients must have relapsed after prior radiation therapy to be eligible; Patients with any FLIPI score may participate. Patients with FLIPI scores 35 may be enrolled with asymptomatic disease, or without worsening disease or disease relatedsymptoms; however patients with FLIPI scores of 02 must have evidence of worsening disease; ECOG performance status 01; Measurable disease; Adequate hematological function as indicated by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,000/µL; +Hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dL (It is acceptable to transfuse PRBC to achieve this criterion); Platelet count &gt;50 x 109/L. Adequate hepatic and renal function as indicated by: Serum creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL; Serum albumin ≥2.5 g/dL; Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); Serum AST and ALT ≤1.5 x ULN. Able to swallow and retain oral medication Patients who have severe lymphomarelated symptoms requiring a rapid response to therapy (e.g., requirement for cytoreduction due to advanced disease or organ compromise, respiratory compromise because of large effusions or airway obstruction, bowel obstruction, ureteral obstruction, and chylous ascites); Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial and/or viral infection including, but not limited to active HIV or viral hepatitis (A, B or C); History of hepatitis B infection; Any Bcell, Tcell or transformed lymphoma other than histologically confirmed follicular nonHodgkin's lymphoma; Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, CNS or leptomeningeal involvement by lymphoma (treated or in remission), HIVrelated lymphoma, or patients with symptoms suggesting HIV infection;</criteria>
