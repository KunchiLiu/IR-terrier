Does the subject participate in a clinical trial concomitantly with the present trial? 3. Is the subject undergoing an emergency operation? 4. Has the subject a history of allergic reactions after application of human fibrinogen, human thrombin and/or collagen of any origin? 5. Is the subject suffering from known coagulopathy? 6. Is the subject currently participating or has the subject previously participated in the TC023IM trial? 7. Is the female subject pregnant or breast feeding?
