	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of long term dosing of AMG 531 in thrombocytopenic Japanese subjects with ITP. It is anticipated that AMG 531 will be a safe and well tolerated in long term treatment and that AMG 531 will effectively raise and maintain platelet counts to a desired therapeutic range, when individual dose adjustments based on platelet counts are permitted. This study is available to subjects who have completed any previous AMG 531 ITP study in Japan and meet the eligibility criteria of this study.</brief_summary>
