	<brief_title>Etoricoxib With Flavoxate for Reducing Morphine Requirement After Transurethral Prostatectomy (TURP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain is still a significant problem for surgical patients. Conventional use of narcotics for postoperative pain relief is not without serious side effects such as respiratory depression and sedation.There are other alternatives for postoperative analgesia as NSAIDs especially COX2-inhibitors. For some specific operation such as TURP which Foley's catheter needed to be retained for a few days,urinary anti spasmodics may help the patients to be more comfortable. Comparison(s): There is a difference in postoperative morphine consumption in the first 24 hours after transurethral prostatectomy between patients who received etoricoxib or flavoxate or both and placebo.</detailed_description>
