	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a subunit tuberculosis vaccine given as two nasal immunizations composed of a hybrid protein antigen from M. tuberculosis virus mixed with a toxoid adjuvant, causes untoward adverse reactions when administered to healthy adult volunteers. Both subjects who have not received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and subjects who have already received BCG will be enrolled. An initial evaluation of immune responses to the vaccine will also be undertaken.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a subunit tuberculosis vaccine given as two nasal immunizations composed of a hybrid protein antigen from M. tuberculosis virus mixed with a toxoid adjuvant, causes untoward adverse reactions when administered to healthy adult volunteers. Both subjects who have not received BCG and subjects who have already received BCG will be enrolled. An initial evaluation of immune responses to the vaccine will also be undertaken using flow cytometry to enumerate antigen specific IFNg containing T cells; ELISPOT to determine IFNg secreting antigen specific T cells; serology and nasal wash antibody.</detailed_description>
