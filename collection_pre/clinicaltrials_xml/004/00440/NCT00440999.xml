	<brief_title>Pyronaridine Artesunate (3:1) in Children and Adults With Acute Plasmodium Vivax Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are considered today by WHO to be the best anti-malarials in terms of efficacy and lower propensity to resistance. Pyronaridine artesunate is a new ACT in development to treat acute uncomplicated malaria. Pyronaridine and artesunate are antimalarial agents with a history of clinical use both separately and in combination with other drugs. Each drug has powerful blood schizonticidal actions. The aim of a fixed dose combination of pyronaridine and artesunate in the treatment of uncomplicated acute malaria is to provide rapid reduction in parasitemia with once-daily three-day regimen, thereby improving compliance and reducing the risk of recrudescence through the slower elimination of pyronaridine.Importantly, there is a need for new drugs that are efficacious against both P. falciparum and P. vivax, because in areas where both species exist and health systems are undersourced, it is often not possible to distinguish between the two species at the initial diagnosis.</detailed_description>
