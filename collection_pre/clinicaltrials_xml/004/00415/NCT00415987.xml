	<brief_summary>The treatment assignment is based on the presence or absence of an HLA-identical sibling donor (Genetic Randomisation, NOT formal Randomisation). Patients with suitable HLA-identical sibling donors are offered a tandem transplant approach consisting of standard autografting nonmyeloablative radiotherapy and allografting. Patients without HLA-identical siblings are treated with standard double autologous transplantation as per Institutional guidelines or enrolled in other treatment programs approved by local IRBs.This is a multi-center study. The Division of Hematology of University of Torino at the S.G.B. Hospital, Torino, Italy, is the co-ordinating Center.</brief_summary>
