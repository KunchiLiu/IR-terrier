	<brief_title>ZANTE: Zometa and Taxotere in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel has been used alone and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in the treatment of hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Zoledronic acid has been used in the treatment of bone metastasis from prostate cancer. This is a study of the combination of these two agents. The Zante study will test a dose escalation of docetaxel in association with a predetermined dose of zoledronic acid (2 mg), given every 14 days for a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 cycles. Sequence A: Docetaxel on day 1 and zoledronic acid on day 2 Sequence B: Zoledronic acid on day 1 and docetaxel on day 2 Patients are enrolled sequentially in cohorts of 3 for each dose level, and a maximum of 36 patients will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
