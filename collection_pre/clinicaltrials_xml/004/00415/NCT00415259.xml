	<brief_summary>It is hypothesised that laterally wedged insoles will result in reduced knee pain and cartilage volume loss after 12 months of wear, compared to control insoles. People with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis will be recruited from the community and randomised to wear either laterally wedged insoles or control insoles for 12 months. Patients will be assessed at baseline and at 12 months.</brief_summary>
