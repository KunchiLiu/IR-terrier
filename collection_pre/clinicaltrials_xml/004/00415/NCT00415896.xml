	<brief_title>Impact of Respiratory Muscle Unloading on Respiratory Muscle Endurance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liberation from mechanical ventilation in difficult to wean patients is best accomplished by intermittent spontaneous breathing trials (1). Optimal respiratory muscle rest in-between breathing trials however has never been investigated. Using a crossover design, patients are to be ventilated with complete and partial respiratory muscle unloading for a period of ten hours respectively. Respiratory muscle activity is being monitored by oesophageal balloon technique using a commercially available System (Avea, Viasys, Conshohocken, PA, USA). Time of spontaneous breathing, respiratory- and ABG parameters are being determined to characterize the course of each spontaneous breathing trial. References 1. Esteban, A., F. Frutos, M. J.
