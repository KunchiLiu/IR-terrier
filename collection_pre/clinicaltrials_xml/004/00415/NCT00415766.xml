	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (rHCG) and urinary HCG (uHCG) in patients undergoing IVF cycles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Recombinant Versus Urinary hCG for Ovulation Induction in High Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (u-hCG) has been widely used to induce final oocyte maturation and to trigger ovulation in assisted conception. Recombinant technology has allowed the production of r-hCG inj which all urinary contaminants are absent. Hence, this would allow the safe subcutaneous administration of a compound with less batch-to-batch variation. This study will investigate the effectiveness of the recombinant hCG compared to the currently used urinary hCG.</detailed_description>
