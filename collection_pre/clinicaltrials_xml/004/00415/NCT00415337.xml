	<brief_summary>1. Endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) is useful in localizing peripheral lung lesions. The EBUS, further combined with the guide sheath (GS) technique, has been reported to increase the yield of transbronchial biopsy. However, there are no reports comparing the GS technique and the traditional EBUS technique in diagnosing the peripheral lung tumor. 2. Previous reports have revealed that several characteristic echoic patterns correlate well with the histopathological findings of benign and malignant lesions. Therefore, EBUS may also be useful in the differential diagnosis of malignant lesions of the lung.</brief_summary>
