	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy of Rostafuroxin in the treatment of essential hypertension and to determine the best effective dose to be administered in the general hypertensive population and in a subset of this population in which genetic patterns could be involved in the etiology of essential hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Rostafuroxin in the Treatment of Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated arterial pressure is probably the most important public health problem. about 30% of the world adult population are affected by hypertension in industrialised countries. Development of a pharmacogenomic approach to the therapy of primary hypertension give new opportunities for the treatment of hypertension. This approach consists in the identification of the genetic-molecular mechanisms responsible for hypertension in a given subset of patients, and in the development of drugs able to interfere with such mechanisms, thus leading to very selective therapeutic interventions with enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects.</detailed_description>
