	<brief_title>Factors Associated With Coronary Heart Disease in African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CHD is a disease that is characterized by narrowing of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart. As a result, insufficient amounts of oxygen and nutrients reach the heart, which can cause chest pain or heart attack. Studies have shown that people's socioeconomic status is associated with their health, and that African Americans experience the highest rates of heart disease in the U.S. The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is currently being conducted in Jackson, Mississippi, and is studying the factors that influence the development of cardiovascular disease in African American men and women. This study will examine data from the JHS to determine the effect of socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors on CHD risk in African Americans in Mississippi. This study will recruit participants from the JHS only. Participants will report to the study site at least once for 4.5 hours for baseline measurements. Visits will include measurements of body size and blood pressure, an electrocardiogram, an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the carotid artery, blood and urine collection, a lung function test, and interviews regarding health status and sociocultural aspects of life. Follow-up evaluations will occur 5 and 10 years after starting the study. Outcomes will include self-report and electrocardiogram-defined CHD, as well as measures of various social and psychological factors.</detailed_description>
