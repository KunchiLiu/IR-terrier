	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single dose of etomidate for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on post-CPB adrenocortical responsiveness, on requirements of hemodynamic support, and on use of intensive care resources.</brief_summary>
