	<brief_summary>Our study aims to investigate the benefits of an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program in a population of subjects with fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Our hypothesis is that pulmonary rehabilitation will lead to improvements in quality of life, breathlessness, exercise capacity and pulmonary function in this patient population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Restriction on pulmonary function testing (TLC &lt;80%, FEV1/FVC ratio &gt; predicted or DLCO &lt; 80%) 2. Evidence of fibrosis on high resolution computed tomography of the chest. 3. Fibrosis on surgical lung biopsy if performed 4. Referral for pulmonary rehabilitation 1. Participation in pulmonary rehabilitation in the past 24 months 2. Inability to complete 6 minute walk test or study questionnaires 3. Limitations other than dyspnea (e.g. arthritis) that affect ability to participate in pulmonary rehabilitation 4. Baseline 6 minute walk distance &gt; 400 meters 5. Planned change in medication treatment for lung disease during the course of pulmonary rehabilitation 6. Ejection fraction known to be &lt; 25% 7. Contraindications to pulmonary rehabilitation (clinically unstable, uncontrolled arrhythmia or hypertension, symptomatic or uncontrolled hypotension with systolic blood pressure of &lt; 95, active angina, unexplained syncope or worsening dizziness, limiting orthopedic or neurological disorders, psychiatric impairment that inhibits cooperation in the program) 8. FEV1/FVC &lt; 65% 9. Unable to provide informed consent</criteria>
