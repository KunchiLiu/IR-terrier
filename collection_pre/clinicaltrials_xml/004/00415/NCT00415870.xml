	<brief_summary>This is a NCI funded study which will develop and evaluate a cell phone application (mDIET) that can be used as an assessment and intervention tool to improve dietary behaviors and thus reduce weight in overweight and moderately obese (BMI 25-34.9) men and women ages 25-55.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>mDiet - Ecological Momentary Intervention of Diet Via Mobile Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research will develop a technologically advanced system for monitoring and intervening on diet behaviors (e.g., food intake, weight). Interventions aimed at dietary change are missing a comparable, portable tool. Mobile technologies can help fill this gap by providing portable connectivity to expert systems that create specific tailored diet goals based on participant profiles. The expert system can 'push' intervention messages throughout the day during critical point-of-decision moments to aid in decision making among users. The portable device can 'pull' information through prompts and easy-to-use recording. This ecological momentary assessment + ecological momentary intervention format may further encourage healthy behaviors by prompting at critical decision points to improve dietary behaviors.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants will be included if they: Are age 2555 Are overweight or moderately obese Are with a BMI between 25.034.9 (as defined by the NIH report on Obesity (NIH 1998) Are able to read (completion of at least the 6th grade) and speak English Provide consent Do not intend to become pregnant or move out of the county for the duration of the intervention (16 weeks). Participants will also be required to have a cell phone that is capable of supporting the mDIET application. Participants may be otherwise healthy or have one or more risk factors for CVD, including uncomplicated Type 2 diabetes but will not be enrolled if they have diagnosed CVD. Participants will be excluded from the study if they have any of the following conditions: An eating disorder Are currently pregnant Have a strict dietary regimen prescribed by their doctor that will not allow them to comply with intervention guidelines related to dietary changes.</criteria>
