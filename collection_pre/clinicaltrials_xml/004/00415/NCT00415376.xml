	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Anticonvulsant drugs, such as levetiracetam, may help control seizures caused by brain metastases. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well levetiracetam works in treating patients with seizures caused by brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Levetiracetam in Treating Patients With Seizures Caused by Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the optimal dose of levetiracetam required to control seizures from brain metastases in patients with solid tumors. - Determine the frequency of side effects and tolerability of this drug when used to control seizures in these patients. - Determine any improvement in antiepileptic drug-associated symptoms in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to baseline seizures (yes vs no) and/or baseline antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (yes vs no). Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. - Group I (patients with no active baseline seizures): Patients receive oral levetiracetam twice daily beginning on day 1. - Group II (patients requiring IV AEDs for baseline seizure control): Patients receive oral levetiracetam (instead of their current anticonvulsant therapy) twice daily beginning on day 1, after their presenting condition has stabilized. - Group III (patients with active seizures controlled by other concurrent anticonvulsant monotherapy): Patients receive oral levetiracetam (instead of their current anticonvulsant therapy) twice daily beginning on day 1. Treatment with the other anticonvulsant drug is tapered beginning on day 3 as directed by the treating physician. In all groups, treatment continues for up to 6 months in the absence of uncontrolled seizures or unacceptable toxicities. During study therapy, patients maintain a seizure log that tracks frequency and type of seizures. Any patient who experiences a breakthrough seizure or multiple auras receives increasing doses of oral levetiracetam until the maximum dose is reached. Patients who continue to have seizures at the maximum dose level receive a second antiseizure medication at the discretion of the treating physician. Quality of life is assessed by the Fundamental Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Brain questionnaire at baseline and at 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
