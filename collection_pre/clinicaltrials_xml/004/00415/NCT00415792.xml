	<brief_summary>hCG and GnRH agonist can be used to induce final oocyte maturation and ovulation in IVF cycles. These two approaches will be compared in this study in terms of pregnancy rates and embryological data using patients with hyper-response to IVF drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between hCG and GnRH Agonist for Ovulation Induction in Patients With High Response to IVF Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>hCG is commonly used for the substitution of the endogenous LH surge to induce oocyte maturation and ovulation induction in ovarian hyperstimulation protocols for in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, hCG is related to the occurrence of the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially life-threatening complication and hyper-responding patients are particularly in high risk. An alternative to exogenous hCG is the administration of a GnRH agonist inducing an endogenous rise in both LH and FSH levels due to the initial flare effect. Comparisons: Pregnancy rates and embryological data will be compared from hyper-responding patients receiving either GnRH agonist (Arvekap) or hCG (Pregnyl) for ovulatrion induction following a GnRH antagonist treatment cycle.</detailed_description>
