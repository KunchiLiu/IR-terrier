	<brief_title>Comparison of Video Consent Versus Routine Consent for Participation in Research Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will test a new method of delivering informed consent procedures to people with schizophrenia. The study has two aims. First, it will examine the impact of a multimedia DVD-based informed consent process on the ability of participants to make decisions regarding participation in research, both after the initial presentation of information and after 1 month. Second, it will examine the association between participant personal characteristics and the benefit derived from the DVD-based informed consent process. Participants with schizophrenia and a normal comparison group will participate in either a routinely used informed consent procedure or an enhanced, DVD-based informed consent procedure. The outcome measure, comprehension of the consent materials, including understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in the study, will be assessed in each group. It is expected that the normal control group will reach the requisite level of comprehension faster than the schizophrenia group.</detailed_description>
