	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the relative efficacy of a novel treatment (CBT-IC) versus a standard individual drug-counseling treatment. The novel treatment emphasizes exposure to emotional cues for drug use as part of a comprehensive, yet brief, treatment strategy. These treatments are delivered to opiate-dependent, often poly-substance dependent, individuals in a comprehensive methadone maintenance program who have failed to respond adequately to current treatments.</brief_summary>
