	<brief_summary>To determine whether addition of Carvedilol CR to diabetic patients with hypertension who are receiving the ACEi,Lisinopril,will provide added benefits to blood vessels when compared to treatment with Lisinopril alone.It is believed that carvedilol provides added benefits by suppressing free radicals(charged substances that cause damage to the body ) and inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vascular Benefits of Adding CarvedilolCR to Type2 Diabetic Patients on ACEI.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes is an atherosclerotic, pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative stress.Both vascular oxidative stress and inflammation are CVD risk factors and impact endothelial function. Carvedilol has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies (although limited in size) to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties: (1) reduce the inflammation markers such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); (2) reduce oxidative stress via dually eliminating existing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppressing the generation of ROS; (3) prevent lipid peroxidation in myocardial cell membrane; (4) protect endothelial and vascular muscle cells from oxygen radical-mediated injury. This project is about studying the effect of carvedilol CR on blood vessels of diabetic hypertensive patients as compared to Lisinopril alone. This study involves weaning patient off their current antihypertensive medications and starting them on Lisinopril and Carvedilol CR or placebo for 6 months and studying the effects of the drugs during this period and thereafter.</detailed_description>

Has Congestive Heart Failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) class IIIV Has type 1 diabetes mellitus Has newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (within 4 months of screening visit) Has HbA1c &gt; 8.5% Has the following, as it relates to subject's antidiabetic therapy:Initiated or changed dosage or formulation of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) within 6 months of screening visit. A history of acute or chronic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis Has current clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, e.g., chronic bronchitis) or asthma Has a history of bronchospastic disease not undergoing active therapy in whom, in the investigator's opinion, treatment with study medication could provoke bronchospasm Has evidence of any of the following clinically significant diseases that could impair the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of orallyadministered medication: renal disease defined as estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;60mL/min per 1.73 m2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula below: GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 186 x [Serum Creatinine (umol/L) x 0.0113]1.154 x Age(years)0.203 (x 0.742 if female) hepatic disease (i.e., ALT or AST levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal range, history of hepatic impairment, or by clinical assessment) Chronic biliary disorders Has endocrine disorders (e.g., pheochromocytoma, active and untreated hypo or hyperthyroidism) Has any known contraindication to ACE inhibitors, alpha or betablocker treatment Has systemic disease, including cancer, with reduced (&lt;12 months) life expectancy Has used an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) preceding the first dose of study medication Has a history of a psychological illness or any condition that would interfere with the subject's ability to understand or complete the requirements of the study</criteria>
