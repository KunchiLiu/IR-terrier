	<criteria>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) as defined by meeting at least 4 of the 11 classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for the classification of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, either sequentially or coincident. The 4 criteria need not be present at study entry Renal biopsy within 12 months prior to screening visit indicating active proliferative lupus glomerulonephritis (met ISN/RPS Class III or IV classification criteria [2003], excluding Class III [C], IVS [C] and IVG [C], or the World Health Organization Class III or IV classification criteria [1982], excluding Class IIIc, IVd). If the renal biopsy was performed &gt;3 months but ≤12 months prior to screening visit, at least 1 of the following 3 serologies (performed locally) must have been abnormal prior to screening visit: complement (C3 or C4) level below normal range OR antidsDNA &gt;upper limit of normal range. A stable serum creatinine ≤3 mg/dL Subjects with a rise in serum creatinine of ≥1 mg/dL within 1 month prior to the screening visit Subjects with druginduced SLE, as opposed to idiopathic SLE Subjects with severe, unstable and/or progressive Central nervous system (CNS) lupus Subjects with autoimmune disease other than SLE as their main diagnosis (e.g.; Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Multiple Sclerosis [MS]) Subjects who have received treatment with cyclophosphamide within 3 months of randomization (Day 1). Subjects who have received treatment with rituximab &lt; 6 months prior to the screening visit</criteria>
