	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma over time may help doctors learn more about the disease. PURPOSE: This natural history study is collecting disease-related health information over time from patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluations and Laboratory Studies to Study the Disease Course in Patients With Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Follow the disease course of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. - Provide a patient population for study by proteomic and molecular analysis. - Develop a mechanism for screening by a Tumor Board for enrollment of patients in therapeutic clinical trials. Secondary - Develop a tissue bank for future disease study using specimens from these patients. - Provide community outreach by offering a second opinion regarding treatment of this disease in these patients and, in limited cases, provide standard-of-care treatment to these patients. - Develop an algorithm for screening and evaluating this disease in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo disease assessment by physical examination, full-body photographic documentation of skin disease, biopsy, and blood sampling at baseline and then at least annually thereafter. Proteomic and molecular methods are used to analyze samples. Biopsies may be examined using histologic and immunohistochemical methods. Blood may be analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for clonal T-cell gene rearrangements or by flow cytometry. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.</detailed_description>
