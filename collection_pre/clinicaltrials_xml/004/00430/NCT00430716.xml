	<criteria>Subjects with PAH (i.e. IPAH or secondary to connective tissue disease or with surgical repair of ASD, VSD, PDA, aortopulmonary window) whose baseline six minute walk test distance is &gt;/= 100 m and &lt;/= 450 m. Subjects with a mean pulmonary artery pressure of &gt;/= 25 mmHg and a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of &lt;/= 15 mmHg at rest via right heart catheterization performed within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects whose 6 Minute Walk Distance may be limited by conditions other than PAH related dyspnoea or fatigue, e.g. claudication from vascular insufficiency or significant arthritis. Subjects who are currently receiving any forms of chronic treatment for PAH such as prostacyclin, PDE5 inhibitors, endothelinreceptor antagonists, nitrates or nitric oxide donors (e.g. arginine supplement, nicorandil) in any form, protease inhibitors such as ritonavir and saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and alpha blockers. Subjects previously receiving any of these drugs must have stopped use for a period of at least 1 month prior to screening, except in the case of bosentan or prostacyclin (3 months).</criteria>
