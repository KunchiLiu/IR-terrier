	<brief_summary>The purpose of the PACE-MI (OBTAIN) registry is: - Analyze beta-blocker dose response effect on outcome over two years - Explore gender and minority differences in beta-blocker utilization and outcomes. In patients with Myocardial Infarction (MI) discharged from the hospital, beta-blocker dose will be predictive of survival. Exploratory analyses: Gender and racial effectsâ€”gender and race are, similarly, hypothesized to be predictive of post-MI survival. The existence of interactions between gender and beta-blocker effect as well as race and beta-blocker effect will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The PACE-MI Registry Study - Outcomes of Beta-blocker Therapy After Myocardial Infarction (OBTAIN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods All patients admitted to the coronary care areas with an acute myocardial infarction will be entered into the registry. At the time of discharge from the coronary care unit, clinical data will be entered. The registry will include approximately 6800 patients. As there is no intervention in the registry, the data to be collected are standard for quality assurance purposes and cannot practicably be carried out without waivers of consent and HIPAA authorization, there will be no consent specifically for registry patients at baseline. Systems have been implemented to ensure the registry data will remain confidential. Sites have received IRB approval of waiver of consent and HIPAA for the baseline registry data. Data to be collected will include demographic (including ethnic and race classifications according to NIH guidelines) data and information regarding the index myocardial infarction. Use of beta-blockers at discharge from the coronary care unit will be documented. In addition, beta-blocker use at hospital discharge will be noted. Data for the registry will be obtained from ER notes, admission notes, cardiac catheterization lab reports, medication lists, lab reports, and discharge summaries. Follow-Up Follow-up for registry patients will be conducted at year 1 and year 2 post-myocardial infarction. Data may be obtained via medical chart review, phone contact, and Social Security Death Index (SSDI). For follow-up information obtained via chart review or the SSDI, a detailed justification for waiver of HIPAA and consent requirements is attached to this protocol (see appendix 7). If phone contact is required with the patient, we are suggesting the following process: - A letter should be sent out to the patient approximately one week prior to the contact in which the rationale for the study will be provided, as well as a delineation of the patient's right to participate or not to participate (by either providing or not providing the requested information). - At telephone contact with the patient, the coordinator will document whether the patient consents to provide the information. If the patient consents, the coordinator will proceed to obtain the requested information. - In the event that the participating institution's IRB requires a written, signed consent for this verbal contact, a written consent form template (see appendix 3) is provided. Data collected at follow-up interview will include vital status, beta-blocker use, other cardiac medications and any cardiovascular hospitalizations.</detailed_description>
