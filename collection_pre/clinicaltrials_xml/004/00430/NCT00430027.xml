	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine whether neoadjuvant capecitabine/oxaliplatin/cetuximab and external beam radiation therapy followed by surgical resection [and then followed by post operative adjuvant capecitabine, oxaliplatin and cetuximab] is feasible and tolerable.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, Cetuximab, and Radiation Therapy for Locally Advanced Esophageal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is clear that new approaches are needed to improve the therapeutic ratio in esophageal cancer. This study proposes to evaluate the novel combination of preoperative capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and cetuximab concurrently with radiation therapy. This will be followed by esophagectomy 6-9 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. Followed by further adjuvant chemotherapy. It is hypothesized that our novel combination of neoadjuvant capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and cetuximab combined with thoracoabdominal radiation therapy will be feasible and result in acceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
