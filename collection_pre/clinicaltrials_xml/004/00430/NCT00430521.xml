Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first administration of the candidate vaccines Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination History of hypersensitivity to vaccines. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Serious chronic disease including any medically significant chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, neurological, psychiatric or metabolic disorder, as determined by medical history and physical examination. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first administration of the candidate vaccine or during the study. Lactating women. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days prior to the first vaccination, or planned use during the study period. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study.</criteria>
