	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Oral Febuxostat in Participants With Gout</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal impairment is common in subjects with gout, with the prevalence ranging from 50% to 70%. This population represents an unmet medical need as uricosuric drugs are contraindicated in these patients, and the only available treatment, allopurinol, may have to be dose reduced to avoid overt side effects. Febuxostat (TMX-67) is a non-purine selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor being developed as an orally administered agent for management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Treatment duration will be 6 months.</detailed_description>
