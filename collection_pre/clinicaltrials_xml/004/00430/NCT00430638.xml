	<brief_summary>This 16 week study will examine the ability of olmesartan medoxomil to lower the blood pressure of patients with moderate to severe high blood pressure in comparison to placebo. The medication being tested has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of high blood pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Blood Pressure Lowering Ability and Safety of Olmesartan Medoxomil in Stage I and Stage II Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was to randomize an equal number of participants to either an olmesartan medoxomil based treatment or to placebo. The titration scheme was as follows: - First 3 weeks (wks), all participants - olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg or placebo - Next 3 wks, participants whose blood pressure was not controlled - olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg or placebo - Next 3 wks, participants whose blood pressure was not controlled - olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCT 12.5 mg or placebo - Final 3 wks, participants whose blood pressure was not controlled - olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCT 25 mg or placebo - Subjects with a mean BP of &lt;120/80 mmHg at any visit were considered responders and were not titrated up to the next dose level. However, they remained in the study at their currently assigned dose of study medication. - Subjects with a mean office SBP ≥120 mmHg or a mean office DBP ≥80 mmHg at any subsequent visit(s) were considered 'uncontrolled' and were titrated to the next dose level according to the titration scheme above. - Subjects who reach the highest dose (ie, olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCT 25 mg) remained on that dose until study exit at Visit 8, unless safety concerns caused discontinuation of treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Patients with a mean seated systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) greater than or equal to 140 mmHg but less than or equal to 179 mmHg and a mean seated diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) less than or equal to 109 mmHg following a 3 to 4week singleblind placebo runin period. The difference in MSSBP between Visits 3 and 4 or between Visits 4 and 4X must be less than or equal to 10 mmHg. Patients with a mean daytime (8AM4PM) systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 135 mmHg and less than or equal to 179 mmHg and a mean daytime diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than or equal to 109 mmHg as measured by an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device (ABPM) following placebo runin period. If female, must have negative serum pregnancy test at screening and be either postmenopausal (greater than or equal to 1 year), had a hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 months before consent or if of childbearing potential, must practice approved measures of birth control throughout study. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the last one year. History of myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, or heart failure within the past 6 months. Patients with secondary hypertension of any etiology, such as renal disease, pheochromocytoma, or Cushing's syndrome. Type I diabetes. Patients with Type II diabetes on stable treatment, with fasting glucose &lt;160 mg/dl may enroll. Patients with hemodynamically significant cardiac valvular disease. Patients with clinically significant cardiac conduction defects, including first, second or third degree AV block, left bundle branch block, sick sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, an accessory bypass tract, or any arrhythmia requiring medication.</criteria>
