	<brief_summary>Aim: To investigate the quality of history taking by physician and computer-based system. Patients: 100 inpatients presenting at the RBK for the first time and treated in the departments of nephrology and cardiology. Methods: The information obtained by the computer based system is compared with the information acquired by conventional history taking. Study endpoint is the comparison of historical data organized according to the elements in a standard medical history on a patient-by-patient basis. Study procedure History taking is performed by physicians according to the guidelines of the RBK. Within 2 days thereafter the patient is interviewed with help of the CLEOS system with the support of a study nurse.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim: To compare the completeness of history taking by physicians and by a computerized system interacting directly with the patients. Historical data recorded in the patient record, including the discharge letter, were compared with the history acquired by computer-based interview of each patient. Patients: 100 inpatients presenting at the RBK for the first time and treated in the departments of nephrology and cardiology. Methods: The information obtained by the computer based system is compared with the information acquired by conventional history taking. Study endpoint is the comparison of historical data organized according to the elements in a standard medical history on a patient-by-patient basis. Study procedure After informed consent of the patients the procedure of history taking is performed by the physician according to the guidelines of the RBK. Within 2 days thereafter the patient is interviewed with help of the CLEOS system [a computer-based, history-taking program] with the support of a study nurse. The physician will be informed about the results immediately after completion of the questionnaire. Data of medical significance were extracted from the official hospital chart and the computerized history by clinically experienced physicians and tabulated on a patient-by-patient basis. data elements were compared across each category of the history for each patient interviewed. The relevance of the differences of the information obtained by the two systems was rated by an independent reviewer.</detailed_description>
