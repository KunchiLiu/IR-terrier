	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is threefold: 1) to develop a home-based emotional disclosure intervention inducing core elements of change (emotional engagement, cognitive restructuring, and positive future directedness); 2) to examine in a randomized controlled trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis the induction of the core elements and the feasibility of the intervention for home application; and, 3) to examine the psychological, clinical, and physiological effects of the adapted emotional disclosure intervention and the modulating role of cognitive-emotional change and individual differences in emotion regulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Home-Based Emotional Disclosure in Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emotional disclosure has been suggested to alleviate psychological and physical stress in chronically ill people. Emotional engagement, cognitive restructuring, and positive future directedness are considered core elements to induce change in emotional disclosure interventions. The aim of our randomized controlled trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is to examine the psychological, clinical, and physiological effects of an emotional disclosure intervention adapted for home application and the modulating role of cognitive-emotional change and individual differences in emotion regulation.</detailed_description>
