	<brief_summary>It has been demonstrated that panresistant strains of Acinetobacter species may be selected by antibiotic use [4], may be transmitted from person to person [5], and may be passed via environmental contamination [6]. Surveillance for panresistant Acinetobacter species should be a priority, given the lack of antibiotic options for the treatment of these infections. There are currently no data on the antibiotic susceptibility of Acinetobacter species or on the rates of panresistant organisms. The elucidation of potential risk factors for resistant strains of Acinetobacter is therefore an important task, and the use of alternative antibiotics should be considered in ICUs where these strains are endemic.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The elucidation of potential risk factors for resistant strains of Acinetobacter is therefore an important task, and the use of alternative antibiotics should be considered in ICUs where these strains are endemic.he following information will be collected: age, sex, occupation, hospital location at the time of positive culture (ER, medical ward, ICU etc), date of positive culture, prior hospitalization, receipt of outpatient dialysis, home care or other regular medical care (eg, outpatient chemotherapy), presence of invasive devices, receipt of antibiotics, including their type and whether they were adequate for the resistance profile of the organism, prior positive microbiologic cultures, time and location of positive cultures, underlying diseases and severity of illness, presence of urinary or intravascular devices, recent immunomodulative therapies or radiation therapy, physical exam findings, laboratory and radiographical data, antimicrobial usage within 30 days of onset of the infection, microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once organism identified, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information, medications, clinical outcome,gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and past medical history. We will collect information retrospectively.</detailed_description>
