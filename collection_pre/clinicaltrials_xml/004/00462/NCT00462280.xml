	<brief_summary>The use of lovastatin may slow disease progression in patients at high risk of melanoma. It is not yet known whether lovastatin is more effective than a placebo in treating patients at high risk of melanoma. This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving lovastatin or placebo works in treating patients at high risk of melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lovastatin in Treating Patients At High Risk of Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the primary endpoint of the trial, by analysis of histopathologic regression of atypical nevi in response to a 6-month trial of oral (PO) lovastatin vs. placebo in subjects with atypical nevi. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate clinical regression of atypical nevi in the lovastatin vs. placebo group. II. To evaluate the secondary endpoint of changes in nevi numbers on subjects' backs in the lovastatin vs. placebo groups. III. To evaluate a number of molecular biomarkers as secondary endpoints in the lovastatin vs. placebo groups. IV. To evaluate the correlation of serum markers known to be affected by lovastatin with the endpoints chosen above. V. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the dosing regimen, and the dose escalation. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms per group. ARM I: Patients (with two matched nevi OR one large nevi) receive lovastatin PO once daily (QD) for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients (with two matched nevi OR one large nevi) receive placebo PO QD for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.</detailed_description>
