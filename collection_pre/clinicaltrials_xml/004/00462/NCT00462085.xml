	<brief_title>Muscle Activity With the Use of Ankle Foot Orthoses in Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A small group of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy is investigated by 3D instrumented gait analysis. Muscle activity is measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) of selected lower limb muscle groups. Kinematic, Kinetic, and sEMG data are compared between both lower limbs walking with and without an ankle foot orthosis. Data are also compared with those of an healthy control group.</detailed_description>
