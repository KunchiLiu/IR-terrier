	<brief_summary>Berberine has showed effective in lowering blood sugar levels in db/db mice and anti-dyslipidemia in human. These findings have not been tested in a clinical trial. This randomized, double blind, placebo controlled and multi-center study has demonstrated that berberine is effective in lowering plasma glucose concentrations, reducing serum HbA1c and anti-dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Berberine in the Treatment of Diabetes With Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Berberine, a natural plant alkaloid, has not been well investigated for clinical application in the treatment of diabetes. The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of berberine in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia. 116 patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia were assigned in a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled 4-clinical center study to receive berberine (1.0g daily) or placebo for 3 months. The primary efficacy outcomes were changes in plasma glucose and serum lipid levels. The glucose disposal rate (GDR) was measured using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp to assess insulin resistance in a randomly selected subjects of 54 patients. The baseline characteristics were similar in berberine and placebo groups. After 3 months, fasting and post load plasma glucose levels, HbA1C, triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL-C levels were all significantly reduced in the berberine group compared with the placebo group (p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.0001, p=0.002, p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.0001 respectively). The GDR was significantly increased after 3 months of berberine (p=0.037), while no change was found in the placebo group (p=0.86). BMI, systolic blood pressure and serum IL-6 levels were all significantly reduced after treatment in berberine group as compared with the placebo group (p=0.016, p=0.041 and p=0.014, respectively). Our results show berberine to be effective and safe in the treatment of persons with diabetes and dislipidemia. This agent may be useful in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, and could play a role in treatment of metabolic syndrome.</detailed_description>
