	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Mircera for correction of anemia in participants with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis and are not treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). Eligible participants will receive Mircera by monthly subcutaneous injections, dependent on body weight (with a starting dose of 1.2 micrograms/kilogram [mcg/kg]). The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
