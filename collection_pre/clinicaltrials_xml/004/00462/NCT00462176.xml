	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Segmental Bowel Resection for Deep Infiltrating Colorectal Endometriosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients All women (n=45) who had undergone fertility sparing CO2 laser laparoscopic radical excision of deep infiltrating endometriosis with bowel resection were selected retrospectively from the list of all patients (n=more than 500, of whom slightly more than 50% with endometriosis) operated at the Leuven University Fertility Centre (LUFc) between September 2004 and September 2006. Questionnaires All 45 patients were asked to complete the Oxford Endometriosis Quality of Life questionnaire (27), a sexual activity questionnaire (28), visual analogue scales (VAS) for dysmenorroe, chronic pelvic pain and deep dyspareunia, and to answer questions about medication and fertility, to compare their status before surgery and at the moment of the evaluation (December 2008).</detailed_description>
