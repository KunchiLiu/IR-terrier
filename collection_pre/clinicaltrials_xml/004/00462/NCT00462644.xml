	<brief_summary>Trauma patients are at increased risk for adrenal function insufficiency. A commonly used agent for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is known to decrease adrenal function. We want to determine the incidence of adrenocortical insufficiency and its significance during the first 24 hours of resuscitation following RSI in trauma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Etomidate on Adrenal Function in Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will have two arms. Patients on one arm will be assigned to receive etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) and succinylcholine (1mg/kg) for RSI. Patients on the other arm will receive standard therapy at this institution which consists of Versed (generic name midazolam) (5 mg) plus fentanyl (100 mcgs) as well as succinylcholine for RSI. Both drug regimens have a rapid onset, short duration and short half-life. Patients will be randomly assigned to one arm of the study. The trauma nurse emergency room responders, intensive care unit staff, or helicopter crew will pull a study envelope which will contain a randomization to either the etomidate arm or standard therapy arm. The numbers will correspond to a log, delineating which medication is given. The nurse will document the medication as RSI Study Drug - etomidate or RSI Study Drug - standard and the randomization packet number (ie, RSI Study Drug, etomidate, #1, RSI Study Drug, standard, #2, etc.) and will document the patient's name and medical record number on the study log in either the helicopter or the ER Resuscitation Bay. Baseline cortisol level will be drawn prior to RSI. An additional cortisol level will be drawn 4-6 hours later. Following this level, a cortrosyn stimulation test will be performed by giving 0.25 mg cortrosyn IV and rechecking a cortisol level in 60 minutes. Adrenal insufficiency will be defined as a baseline cortisol level of &lt;15 or an increase in cortisol of &lt;9 after cortrosyn administration. Patients will be monitored for 24 hours for hemodynamics, IV fluid administration , and use of vasopressors. Patient will be resuscitated to adequate mean arterial blood pressure and urine output. Any patient found to be adrenal insufficient will be treated with hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours.</detailed_description>
