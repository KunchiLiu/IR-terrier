	<brief_title>Study of Vicinium for Treating Patients With Non-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma In Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase II study was performed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of intravesical Vicinium in patients with urothelial carcinoma in situ of the bladder. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment had previously failed in all patients. A total of 46 patients were treated with Vicinium with half being administered 30mg/dose once per week for 6 weeks (cohort 1) and the other half (cohort 2) the same dose but administered once per week for 12 consecutive weeks. Vicinium was well tolerated in both cohorts as all patients completed treatment on schedule. A complete response to Vicinium was seen in 9 of 22 patients (41%) in cohort 1 and 9 of 23 (39%) in cohort 2 at the 3-month evaluation. A total of 20 patients (44%) achieved a complete response. Two other patients without carcinoma in situ who achieved a complete response were not included in the study due to the development of non-invasive papillary (Ta) disease. Median time to recurrence in patients who achieved a complete response was 274 and 408 days in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Overall 7 patients (16%) remained disease free. Post-study assessment demonstrated that these patients were still disease free at last follow-up (18 to 25 months). The most common adverse events were mild to moderate reversible bladder symptoms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Disease Characteristics The patient must be male or female 18 years of age or older. The patient must have histologicallyconfirmed Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder. The patient must have histologicallyconfirmed carcinoma in situ (CIS), with or without noninvasive papillary disease The patient must have immunohistochemicallyconfirmed EpCAM positive disease. The patient must have a life expectancy of at least 12 months. Prior/Concurrent Therapy The patient must have, within the last 24 months, failed to respond to at least 1 cycle of treatment with BCG (with or without interferon) or be intolerant to BCG treatment. The patient must have had a transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT) mapping the location of tumour and quantifying the area of bladder affected. The patient must have documented residual CIS (i.e. unresectable disease) prior to study drug administration. Patient Characteristics The patient must have adequate organ function, as defined by the clinical trial protocol Other The patient must have the ability to understand and sign an Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) approved informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrollment and is willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. The patient has evidence of urethral or upper tract transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) by biopsy or upper tract radiological imaging (i.e. intravenous pyelogram, computed tomography (CT) urogram, or retrograde pyelogram) within the past 2 years The patient has hydronephrosis The patient has had prior intravesical chemotherapy or investigational or anticancer treatments within the last 2 months, inclusive of singledose adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy immediately postTURBT The patient has existing severe urinary tract infection or recurrent severe bacterial cystitis The patient has active, uncontrolled impairment of the renal, hepatobiliary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, neurologic or hematopoietic systems which, in the opinion of the investigator, would predispose the patient to the development of complications from the administration of intravesical therapy and/or general anesthesia Any patient who, in the opinion of the investigator, cannot tolerate intravesical administration or intravesical surgical manipulation (cystoscopy, biopsy) due to the presence of concomitant serious illness (i.e. uncontrolled cardiac or respiratory disorders) The patient is pregnant or breast feeding Women of reproductive age (who are not either medically or surgically incapable or bearing children) and all men may not participate unless agreeing to use double barrier contraception, or commit to abstinence during the period of therapy</criteria>
