	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced solid tumors will receive investigational study drug ARRY-520. This study has two parts. In the first part, patients with advanced solid tumors will receive increasing doses of study drug, with or without granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support, in order to achieve the highest dose possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Approximately 15 patients (per schedule) from the US will be enrolled in Part 1 (Completed). In the second part of the study, patients will receive the best dose of study drug determined from the first part of the study and will be followed to evaluate what side effects the study drug causes and what effectiveness it has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 15 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2 (Completed).</brief_summary>
