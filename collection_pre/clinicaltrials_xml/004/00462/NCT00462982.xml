	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with brain metastases caused by kidney cancer or melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases Caused by Kidney Cancer or Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of sunitinib malate, in terms of objective radiographic response of brain lesions, in patients with brain metastases secondary to renal cell carcinoma or melanoma. Secondary - Determine overall and progression-free survival. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 6 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
