	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a protein called BPI that is naturally made by the body's white blood cells to fight infection. This study will initially evaluate an FDA approved investigational dosage and will measure the blood levels over time while BPI is being infused through a vein to see if the dose is potentially enough to obtain the desired effect. The drug will be started within 8 hours of burn injury and continued for 48 hours. Patients will be followed on admission and through infusion in the Burn ICU where they will be monitored by ICU standards. They will be seen regularly thereafter on post-burn days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days while in the hospital. If the patient is discharged prior to the 28 day evaluation, they will be evaluated on or around the 28th day in the burn clinic. A blood sample will be obtained to look for potential genetic markers that may increase a burn patients' risk to develop infection in the post burn period.</brief_summary>
