	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of KRX-101 in treating persistent microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients who are also being treated with stable, maximum tolerated doses of either ACE inhibitors or A2 receptor blockers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes is one of the most common causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the U.S. and in many other developed nations. Despite advances in clinical care, including improvements in glycemic and blood pressure control, the number of new cases of diabetes-related ESRD continues to rise, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes. The current standard of care for the prevention and treatment of diabetic renal disease includes screening all diabetic patients for microalbuminuria. Patients who test positive for microalbuminuria are then treated with either ACE inhibitors or A2 receptor blockers. Both of these classes of medication have been shown to reduce levels of microalbuminuria in some patient populations. This improvement in microalbuminuria has also shown a delay of progression to a number of other renal function problems, as well as a minimal delay in certain clinical events including ESRD. Unfortunately, some patients achieve the majority of their therapeutic effect of ACE inhibitors or A2 receptor blockers within the first 6 months of therapy, and many of these patients continue to show persistent microalbuminuria. Therefore, these patients are at an increased risk of progressing to ESRD due to the lack of adequate benefit from their current medication. Microalbuminuria has a straight-line relationship with adverse renal outcomes; therefore any level of reduction may have clinical benefit. It is reasonable to believe that patients who can reduce or have a complete remission of their microalbuminuria may also lessen the risk of progressing to ESRD. Thus, if KRX-101 is able to cause a reduction or complete remission of microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria, patients may receive a significant clinical benefit.</detailed_description>
