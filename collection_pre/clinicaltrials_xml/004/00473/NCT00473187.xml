	<brief_summary>X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is characterized by rickets, disproportionate short stature, impaired renal phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D metabolism. Despite oral phosphate and vitamin D treatment, most children with XLH demonstrate reduced adult height. The main objective of the study is to determine the beneficial effects of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy on body proportions after 36 month in these patients. Secondary objective is to monitor side effects of the therapy.</brief_summary>
