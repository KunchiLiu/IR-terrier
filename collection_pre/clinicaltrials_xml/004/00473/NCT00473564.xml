	<detailed_description>This trial is a single institution non-randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the da VinciÂ® Robotic Surgical System. This study will evaluate the use of the daVinci Robotic System for better visibility and access of head and neck lesions and decreased amount of surgery time. This is a robotic system used by surgeons to perform surgery in a less invasive manner.</detailed_description>
