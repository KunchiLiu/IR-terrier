	<brief_summary>Ovarian cancer may be caused by a build-up of genetic defects, or damaged genes within the body's cells. When genes are damaged, the body may be unable to produce a group of proteins, called cytokines, used by the immune system to fight cancer and some infections. The investigational gene transfer agent EGEN-001 contains the human gene for the cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) in a special carrier system designed to enter the cells and help the body to produce cytokines. Therefore, the purpose of the EGEN-001 therapy is to attempt to enhance the body's natural ability to recognize and fight cancer cells. Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of EGEN-001 Combined With Carboplatin and Docetaxel in Recurrent, Platinum-Sensitive, Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has two purposes: - To determine what different strengths and number of doses of EGEN-001, administered directly into the peritoneal cavity, can be given safely in combination with standard intravenous chemotherapy for ovarian cancer - To evaluate the anti-cancer activity of EGEN-001 when combined with standard chemotherapy; biological markers of EGEN-001 activity will be collected and ovarian cancer burden will be evaluated per standard practice.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be female and at least 18 years of age (or minimum legal age and competency to provide voluntary written informed consent for study participation); Histologically/cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer that meets one of the following criteria: measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) scan or malignant ascites, or Serum CA125 levels; or Clinically evaluable recurrent disease by other criteria. Relapsed, platinumsensitive, ovarian cancer after induction chemotherapy (at least 6 months since last exposure to platinum based therapy). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score of 0, 1 or 2; Recovered from prior chemotherapy, having adequate bone marrow function: Adequate renal function; Adequate liver function; If of childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test and agree to follow an acceptable method of birth control; Agree to be compliant with the study's requirements; Understand and sign a written Informed Consent prior to the performance of any studyrelated procedures. Ovarian cancer other than documented epithelial cancer; Intraabdominal disease &gt; 5 cm in diameter; Any serious, uncontrolled, intercurrent medical illness or disorder including, but not limited to: Autoimmune disorders Cardiac Disorders Diabetes Intrahepatic disease/cancer as documented by CTscan An active infection within 4 weeks of study entry; Any condition/anomaly that would interfere with the appropriate placement of the IP catheter for study drug administration Prior treatment with whole abdominal irradiation; Currently receiving or have received any investigational agents within 28 days of study entry; Received prior chemotherapy for ovarian cancer administered by the IP route; Received any chemotherapy between completion of primary chemotherapy for ovarian cancer and study entry (e.g. consolidation therapy); Receipt of immunotherapy and/or any medications with the potential to affect the activity of EGEN 001; Known history of HIV infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of carboplatin or docetaxel; Life expectancy of less than 3 months; Known, current, recreational drug or alcohol abuse; Breast feeding an infant; Psychiatric illness/social situations which would limit compliance with study requirements; Any other known condition which in the Investigator's opinion would make the patient a poor candidate for the study.</criteria>
