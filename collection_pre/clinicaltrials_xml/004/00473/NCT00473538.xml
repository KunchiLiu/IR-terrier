	<brief_summary>Lifestyle modifications are successfully employed in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) improving menstrual cycles and fertility. Unfortunately, the compliance over the time is very low. Recently, we have showed a high adherence to structured exercise training (SET) program in women with PCOS. The current study will be aimed to compare the efficacy of the SET program with a diet program on the reproductive function in obese anovulatory infertile PCOS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Structured Exercise Training Program Versus Hypocaloric Hyperproteic Diet in Obese Anovulatory Infertile Patients With PCOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty obese anovulatory infertile PCOS patients who wish to conceive will be allocated in two study-groups according to their desire: structured exercise training (SET) group (n. 20) will undergo a SET program, whereas diet group (n. 20) will undertake a hypocaloric hyperproteic diet. The duration of the study will be of 24 weeks. At baseline, after 12 and 24 weeks clinical, endocrine and metabolic evaluations will be performed in each patient and all reproductive events obtained throughout the study will be recorded.</detailed_description>
