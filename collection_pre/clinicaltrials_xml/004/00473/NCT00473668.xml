	<brief_summary>The purpose of this observer-blind study is to generate immunogenicity data with one formulation of GSK Biologicals' DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine after the primary vaccination course and to demonstrate non-inferiority of this vaccine as compared to two formulations of GSK Biologicals' DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine with respect to the anti-PRP antibody response. Additionally to assess the reactogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. A male or female between, and including, 6 and 8 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Born after a gestation period of 36 to 42 weeks inclusive. Administration of one dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period with the exception of OPV. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting 30 days before the administration of the first vaccine dose, (with the exception of OPV). Bacille CalmetteGu√©rin (BCG) vaccine received after the first 2 weeks of life. Hepatitis B vaccine received after the first week of life. Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae or hepatitis B (except hepatitis B at birth). History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae or hepatitis B diseases. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Other conditions which in the opinion of the investigator may potentially interfere with interpretation of study outcomes.
