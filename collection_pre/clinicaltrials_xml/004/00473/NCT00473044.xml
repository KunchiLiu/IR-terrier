	<brief_title>An Intervention to Increase Physical Activity Among African American Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sedentary lifestyles are common among older adults in the United States, especially among minority women. Regular physical activity in older adults has been shown to prevent falls, maintain functional status, prevent both dementia and osteoporosis, and decrease mortality. A review of the literature has shown that current research approaches using exercise classes as the only means of behavior change are ineffective and do not produce long-term sustainable improvement. This study is testing a culturally appropriate behavior modification intervention using 1) group prayer, 2) the development of social support and mutual responsibility for exercise, and 3) group problem solving activities to increase aerobic and strength-related activities among older African American women. Participants randomized into the intervention arm receive a 45-minute curriculum session and a 45 minute exercise class, while those randomized into the control arm receive a 45 minute session of interactive lectures on unrelated health topics along with the 45 minute exercise class. The exercise class includes both aerobic exercise and strength training using hand-held weights. Data is collected from pedometers worn by participants, as well as from questionnaires before and after the intervention. Blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol are measured before and after the intervention.</detailed_description>
