	<brief_title>Effect of Free Fatty Acids (FFA) on Androgen Precursors in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Free fatty acids (FFA) are known to play an important role by inducing insulin resistance and metabolic disturbances in obesity and type 2 diabetes. In addition, FFAs seems to have a stimulatory effect on adrenal androgen precursors in men. However, the effect of FFAs on androgen precursors and androgens in women is yet unknown. Therefore the effect of increased FFAs on adrenal androgens and androgen precursors should be investigated in a randomized controlled cross-over trial.</detailed_description>
