	<brief_summary>Fungal infections in immunocompromised patients occuring during construction activities in hospitals have repeatedly been reported. However, the question of a causal relation between construction activities and infections has never been addressed systematically and prospectively. To answer this question, we will monitor our immunosuppressed patients' health status, as well as fine dust and aspergillus spore contents in the air during a three year construction activity period in our hospital.</brief_summary>
