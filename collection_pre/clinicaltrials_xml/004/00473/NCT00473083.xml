	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine if rash caused by erlotinib can be successfully treated and if so to determine the optimal treatment approach. Hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: If the incidence of rash is 50% while on erlotinib, prophylactic monotherapy with minocycline can prevent occurrence in 50% of these patients. Hypothesis 2: Treatment of rash is successful in improving rash by at least one Grade in 80% of patients. Hypothesis 3: In patients with untreated rash, the rash will be self-limiting in 25% of patients, and 65% will be grade 1, 2A, and 2b. Ten percent will be grade 3 requiring treatment with monotherapy intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systemic and Topical Treatments for Rash Secondary to Erlotinib in Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib has been shown to prolong survival in NSCLC patients who are no longer candidates for further chemotherapy. In July 2005, erlotinib was approved in Canada for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, following failure of first or second-line chemotherapy. Erlotinib's side effect profile includes rash. The incidence of rash in clinical trials has been reported to be approximately 50 - 75%, and has been hypothesised to parallel tumour response (20). The treatment of rash is controversial and many oncologists believe it is untreatable and self-limiting. The cause of the rash is not well understood but is felt to be a systemic event. Clinical experience of the investigators has suggested that minocycline 100 mg orally given twice-daily for 4 weeks and clindamycin 2% and hydrocortisone 1% topical cream for moderate to severe rash is a successful treatment. The objectives of this trial are to better delineate the rash and its features and to describe an optimal treatment. Since the rash is often facial in distribution and can therefore lead to physical and psychological distress to the patient, a dermatology life quality index will also be completed throughout the study.</detailed_description>
