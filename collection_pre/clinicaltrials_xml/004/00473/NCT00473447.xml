	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a modified protocol of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIT) is effective in rehabilitation treatment of arm paresis in children with cerebral palsy. In these children one main problem the non-use of the affected arm. Many studies showed that the non-use phenomenon can by reversed by the CIT, a rehabilitation program consisting of 15 days of restraining the unaffected arm plus a daily intensive (6 hours/day) physiotherapy training of the paretic arm. The present study aims at evaluating if a shortened CIT protocol (restraining device plus only 2 weekly hours of physiotherapy) is effective in improving use and function of children paretic arm</brief_summary>
