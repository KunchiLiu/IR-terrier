	<brief_title>The Effect of Weight Loss and Dietary Protein Intake on Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is unclear whether protein intake during dieting influences bone density. This information is important for determining optimal nutrient requirements during weight loss. This study will compare the effects of weight loss with a lower-carbohydrate, high-protein (HP) diet to a high-carbohydrate, moderate protein (HC) diet on bone mass and quality in postmenopausal women (ages 50-70 years) with the hypothesis that bone turnover and loss of bone will be reduced on the HP compared to the HC weight loss diet. Bone loss will be partially explained by changes in fat mass and estrogen levels. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: A) weight loss with recommended level of protein intake, and B) weight loss with higher protein intake. All participants will attend regular counseling sessions (about 50 minutes per session) with a dietitian for approximately 1 year, and will be asked to take a daily vitamin/mineral supplement. Also, depending on their usual food intake, they may be asked to take a calcium tablet to meet the recommended intake throughout the study period. Bone, mineral, protein and lipid markers, and hormones that influence bones will be measured. These measurements will provide information about body composition (fat, muscle mass, and bone mineral density). Participants will be asked to attend 8 diet counseling sessions, with the opportunity to attend a total of approximately 28 diet counseling sessions during the year.</detailed_description>
