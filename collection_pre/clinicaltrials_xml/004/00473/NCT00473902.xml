	<brief_summary>We examined whether creatine monohydrate (CrM) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) could enhance strength gains and improve body composition (i.e., increase fat-free mass (FFM); decrease body fat) following resistance exercise training in older adults (&gt; 65 y). Our study hypothesized that administering CrM and CLA would yield greater strength and body composition benefits than the placebo group over the six months of resistance exercise</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Older Adult Training Study With Creatine and CLA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Men (N=19) and women (N=20) completed six months of resistance exercise training with Creatine Monohydrate (5g/d) + Conjugated Linoleic Acid (6g/d) or placebo with randomized, double-blind, allocation.Outcomes included; strength and muscular endurance, functional tasks, body composition (DEXA scan), blood tests (lipids, liver function, CK, glucose, systemic inflammation markers (IL-6, C-reactive protein)), urinary markers of compliance (creatine/creatinine), oxidative stress (8-OH-2dG, 8-isoP) and bone resorption (Œù-telopeptides).</detailed_description>
