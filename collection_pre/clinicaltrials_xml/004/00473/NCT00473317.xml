	<brief_summary>When people eat a meal, some, but not all of the calcium in that meal is absorbed, that is, moved into the bloodstream. When the skin is exposed to sunlight during summer months, Vitamin D is made there and then modified into more active forms by the liver and kidneys. These more active forms of Vitamin D improve calcium absorption. Many adults living in the U.S. have little or no sun exposure and are low in Vitamin D. We know that specific wavelengths of sunlight called Ultraviolet-B cause Vitamin D to be made in the skin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunlight Exposures Effect on Serum Vitamin D Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the beginning of the study we will measure your height, weight, skin color, and draw blood to measure your blood levels of Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Each subject will wear a swimming suit and be exposed to sunlight for 30 minutes total (15 minutes lying on back, 15 minutes lying on stomach).We will draw blood for Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D on days 1,2,3,5, and 7 after sunlight exposure. There will be six blood draws for a total of 102 cc of blood drawn (about 3 Â½ teaspoons drawn each time).</detailed_description>
