	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a natural substance available as a nutritional supplement, can influence blood levels of homocysteine (Hcy). More specifically, we will determine if chronic oral SAMe administration affects homocysteine metabolism in patients with vascular disease who have mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a natural substance available as a nutritional supplement, can influence blood levels of homocysteine (Hcy). More specifically, we will determine if chronic oral SAMe administration effects homocysteine metabolism in patients with vascular disease who have mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 - To determine the effect of oral SAMe (1200 mg/day) on plasma total homocysteine levels in subjects with mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia. Specific Aim 2 - To determine the effect of oral SAMe (1200 mg/day) with and without supplementation of folate, vitamin B12 and B6, on plasma homocysteine levels in patients with mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia. Specific Aim 3 - To determine the effect of oral SAMe (1200 mg/day) on plasma levels pf asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in subjects with mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia.</detailed_description>
