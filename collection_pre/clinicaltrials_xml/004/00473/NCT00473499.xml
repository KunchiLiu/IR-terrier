	<brief_summary>The aim of the PEPCAD III substudy is to assess the efficacy of the Paclitaxel-eluting DEBlue stent system in the treatment of stenoses in native coronary arteries compared to the Sirolimus-eluting Cypher stent by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and to study the influence of both devices on endothelial function, coronary flow reserve, and stem cell mobilization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEPCAD III Substudy: Stem Cell Mobilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the PEPCAD III substudy is to assess the efficacy of the DEBlue® Paclitaxel-eluting stent system in the treatment of stenoses in native coronary arteries compared to the Sirolimus-eluting Cypher stent by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and to study the influence of both devices on endothelial function, coronary flow reserve, and stem cell mobilization. This study is a prospective, randomized, single-center, two-armed phase-II study. During the PEPCAD III trial, 40 patients of the Homburg / Saar center will be randomly assigned to ei-ther one of the treatment groups (20 patients treated with DEBlue, 20 patients with Cypher®). Patients with stable or selected forms of unstable angina or documented ischemia due to a significant lesion in a native coronary artery will be included. Vessels may not supply an en-tirely infarcted myocardial area. Additional 20 patients receiving uncoated stents (Coroflex® Blue, B.Braun) will undergo the same diagnostic procedures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with stable or unstable angina or documented ischemia due to a significant lesion in a native coronary artery Patients eligible for coronary revascularization by means of PCI Intention to treat one lesion with one stent Patients suitable for coronary revascularization of any sort (balloon angioplasty, deviceassisted balloonangioplasty, or coronary artery bypass grafting) Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age Women of childbearing potential may not be pregnant nor have the desire to becoming pregnant during the first year following the study procedure. Hence, patients will be advised to use an adequate birth control method up to and including 9 months followup Patients who are mentally and linguistically able to understand the aim of the study and to show sufficient compliance in following the study protocol Patients must agree to undergo the 9 months angiographic followup Patients must agree to undergo the 1 and 3 year clinical followup Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks, benefits, and treatment alternatives to therapeutic options of this trial, e.g. balloon angioplasty by means of the Paclitaxeleluting PTCAballoon catheter in combination with the Coroflex BlueTM stent or the Sirolimuseluting CypherTM stent. The patients, by providing informed consent, agree to these risks and benefits as stated in the patient informed consent document.
