	<brief_title>Intervention Study to Control High Blood Pressure for Korean American</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CVD is the leading cause of mortality among KA. Recent statistics underscoring the high prevalence and impact of uncontrolled HBP upon this population warrant the development and implementation of effective intervention. KA experiences a great deal of social isolation, which makes it more difficult for them to make behavioral changes for health improvement. individual, family, and community behaviors are part of the HBP problem and also constitute major part of the solution. The proposed research is designed to investigate these issues in a KA population and to lay the groundwork for community-based self-help health education interventions to enhance appropriate care and BP control. Comparison(s):This community-based self-help intervention approach offers a more culturally appropriate approach to closing the health status gap for KA. Incorporating a partnership with community leaders and health and human service care providers, this approach will utilize state-of-the-art health education strategies and a well-trained bilingual nurse from the community.</detailed_description>
