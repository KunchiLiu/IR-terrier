	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C viral infection is common among opioid addicts in Zurich, Switzerland. The majority undergoes a maintenance treatment with methadone, heroin or buprenorphine. While stabilized by an opioid maintenance treatment (OMT)chronic hepatitis C can be treated with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. As not sufficiently known, the results are comparable to the results of the treatment of nonaddicts. Our crossectional study investigates how many patients undergoing OMT are adequately investigated concerning hepatitis C. If not, why are they not adequately investigated and treated? Representative data are collected in the local clinics and medical practices involved in OMT in the Kanton of Zurich. The patients files are revised and the involved doctors are asked through a structured interview.</brief_summary>
