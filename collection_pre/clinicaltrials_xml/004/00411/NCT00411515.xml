	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospectively randomized multicentre study was to prove the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to preventing graft rejection and improvement of clear graft survival following high-risk keratoplasty. The patients of the MMF group receive MMF orally 2x1 g daily for 6 months. Endpoints were immune reaction free and clear graft survival and the occurence of side-effects.</brief_summary>
