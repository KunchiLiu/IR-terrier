For patients who have been declared mentally incompetent, a legal representative will need to provide informed consent on their behalf. previously participated in an AD vaccine study and received active treatment history or presence of an active autoimmune and/or cerebrovascular disease history or presence of seizures, with an acute or chronic inflammation clinically relevant atopic condition, who suffer from an other neurodegenerative disease and/or psychiatric disorders (with the exception of successfully treated depression) immunosuppressive treatment including systemic steroids obtained a vaccination (e.g. against influenza) within 4 weeks before the first study drug injection advanced, severe, progressive or unstable disease that might interfere with the safety of the patient started treatment with psychotropic medication within 3 months (4 weeks for SSRIs and other newer antidepressants without anticholinergic properties) prior to randomization with the exception of mild hypnotic drugs (e.g. zolpidem, zopiclone, oxazepam) and low doses of neuroleptic drugs (e.g. up to 2 mg risperidone). Patients, who are on stable treatment with cholinesteraseinhibitors (ChEIs) and/or memantine for at least 3 months, and/or with SSRIs and/or other newer antidepressants (without anticholinergic properties) for at least 4 weeks before randomization, can be included into the study.</criteria>
