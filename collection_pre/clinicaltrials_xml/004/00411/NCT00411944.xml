	<brief_summary>An evaluation of the effects of genetically determined variant metabolizing and transporting proteins involved in the disposition of the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients. In a five year follow-up study tacrolimus dose-corrected exposure changes significantly and the effect(s) of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the CYP3A4/CYP3A5 and MDR1 genes on the latter is assessed in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus in Renal Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 5-year pharmacokinetic follow-up study in 95 renal allograft recipients assessing tacrolimus exposure using repeated abbreviated Area-Under-the-Concentration-time (AUC) curve measurements at regular time points after grafting. The effects of the CYP3A5*1, CYP3A4*1B, MDR1 G2677T/A and C3435T single nucleotide polymorphisms on the evolution of tacrolimus disposition are studied over 5 years in order to clarify the interrelationship between CYP3A5, CYP3A4 and MDR1 genotypes, time-dependent exposure and tacrolimus-related toxicity.</detailed_description>
