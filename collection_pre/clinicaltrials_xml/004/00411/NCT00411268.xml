	<brief_title>Safety, Effectiveness, and Impact on Quality of Life on Long-Term Administration of OROS Hydromorphone Slow-Release in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label, extension study characterized the safety, effectiveness, and impact on quality of life of OROS hydromorphone slow release with long-term repeated dosing among patients with chronic low back pain, who previously completed short-term Study DO-127 with OROS hydromorphone slow release. Up to 150 patients were to be enrolled and evaluated. Patients were enrolled in this study immediately following Study DO-127. Patients continued their therapy with OROS hydromorphone slow release at the stable dose previously identified in the short-term study. The patient's initial prescribed dose of OROS hydromorphone slow release in Study DO-127X was the same as the last dose of OROS hydromorphone slow release in Study DO-127. Patients returned monthly for evaluations during this extension interval. Adjustments to dose were performed as needed, at the Investigator's discretion. The duration of this study was six months. Safety assessments included vital signs and physical examination at start, during and end of study. 8, 16, 32 and 64 mg tablets of OROS hydromorphone (dose will be at Investigators' discretion) slow release tablets were taken orally daily for the duration of the six month study</detailed_description>
