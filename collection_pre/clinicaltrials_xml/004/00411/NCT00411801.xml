	<brief_summary>Prior to the use of plasma products, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was usually a fatal condition. During plasma exchange therapy, patients need transfusion plasma that is blood group specific. Transfusing a patient with an incorrect blood group may have fatal consequences. Uniplas is a universally applicable human plasma, which can be administered irrespective of the patient's blood group. This study will test the safety and efficacy of Uniplas in comparison to cryosupernatant plasma in treatment of patients with TTP.</brief_summary>
