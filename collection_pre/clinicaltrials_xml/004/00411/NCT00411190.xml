	<brief_summary>Relacatib is being developed for the treatment of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and possibly other bone disorders. Recent results suggest that relacatib interacts with the way our bodies metabolise drugs and so some drugs which are commonly prescribed to the intended target patient population could be affected by giving relacatib at the same time. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeat dose administration of relacatib on the way subjects bodies metabolise three commonly prescribed medications in the osteoarthritis population: ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and atorvastatin.</brief_summary>
