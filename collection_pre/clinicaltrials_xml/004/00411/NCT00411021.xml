	<brief_summary>A prospective cross-over randomized study aimed to test the hypothesis that local injury of the endometrium increases the implantation rate in the successive cycle. Seventy IVF patients will be randomly selected to undergo either endometrial biopsies or minimal cervical scratch on days 8-10 and 21-23 of their cycle, preceding the IVF treatment. If not pregnant, the women will continue for another IVF cycle, preceded by endometrial or cervical scratch complimentary to their procedure in the first cycle. The main major outcomes will include pregnancy rate, implantation rate, endometrial thickness, abortion rate, live births and embryo quality.</brief_summary>
