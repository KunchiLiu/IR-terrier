	<brief_summary>This trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sunitinib (sunitinib-malate) as a second-line palliative therapy in metastatic gastric cancer. Despite the efforts in front-line therapy, second-line protocols have not yet been established in randomized clinical trials for those patients. Although many patients are still in good performance status and present with low tumor burden after failure of first-line chemotherapy, they may clearly benefit from second-line treatment. Increasingly more metachronic metastatic patients are urging for new platinum-free therapeutic options due to the fast-growing use of (neo-) adjuvant platin-based protocols. So far, only sparse data on chemotherapy are available after failure of platin-based protocols. Nearly only irinotecan-containing combinations have properly been analyzed, and produced excellent response rates and survival times of up to 30% and 7.6 months, respectively. However, irinotecan has not been approved yet for this indication. In addition, as irinotecan-containing regimens have been submitted for approval for first-line therapy, second-line regimens in irinotecan-refractory patients have not been evaluated in any trial. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish new second-line treatment options for both, cisplatinum- or irinotecan-combination refractory patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. Sunitinib inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) involved in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, specifically the VEGFR, PDGFR, KIT, FLT-3, and RET. The VEGF pathway has been shown to be a significant factor in metastatic gastric cancer. In gastric carcinoma cells, VEGF ligands and its receptors are definitely involved in the process of tumor progression. KDR and FLT-1 are expressed widely and VEGF stimulated KDR-positive tumor cell growth directly. The ligand VEGF-C has also been shown to be involved in progression of human gastric carcinoma, particularly via lymphangiogenesis. In addition, peritoneal metastases of some cancers such as gastric cancers were largely dependent on VEGF. Therefore, patients with chemo-refractory metastatic gastric cancer might benefit from VEGFR inhibitory therapy with sunitinib.</brief_summary>

All women included in the trial must be surgically sterile or postmenopausal or agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the trial and six months postdosing. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the trial and six months postdosing. Tumor type other than adenocarcinoma (e.g., leiomyosarcoma, lymphoma) or a second cancer except in patients with squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix which has been effectively treated. Patients curatively treated and disease free for at least 5 years will be discussed with the sponsor before inclusion. Patients with known brain or leptomeningeal metastasis Intake of nonpermitted concomitant drugs. (The coordinating investigator should be contacted to discuss the individual case.) Concomitant treatment with antiarrhythmics and drugs with dysrhythmic potential (i.e., terfenadine, quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, sotalol, probucol, bepridil, haloperidol, risperidone, and indapamide) Administration of potent CYP34A inhibitors during or within 7 days before start of sunitinibtreatment (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, delavirdine, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, atazanavir, nelfinavir, grapefruit juice) Administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers during or within 12 days before start of sunitinibtreatment (e.g. dexamethasone, rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John´s wort, efavirenz, tipranavir) Ongoing treatment with therapeutic doses of anticoagulants such as Coumadin or heparins.
