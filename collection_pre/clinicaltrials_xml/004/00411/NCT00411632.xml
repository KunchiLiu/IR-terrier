	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Tarceva® (OSI-774, erlotinib hydrochloride) in combination with Targretin® (bexarotene) in treating NSCLC. The safety of this treatment will also be studied, as well as the treatment's effect on different cells in the body and the participants' overall response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BATTLE Program: Tarceva and Targretin in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib hydrochloride is designed to help block the activity of an enzyme that is believed to play an important role in cell growth. Researchers want to find out if blocking these enzymes will slow tumor growth. Bexarotene is designed to control cancer cell growth and division. In order to enroll in this study, you must also be enrolled in Protocol 2005-0823: A Biomarker-integrated study in Chemorefractory Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Protocol 2005-0823 is the screening study in a group of studies called the BATTLE program. Participants in Protocol 2005-0823 are assigned to one of the research studies. The results of your tumor analysis helped the study doctor determine to assign you to this particular research study. While on study, you will take erlotinib hydrochloride and bexarotene by mouth once a day. Erlotinib hydrochloride tablets should be taken preferably in the morning 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with no more than 7 ounces of water. If you forget to take a dose, the last missed dose should be taken as soon as you remember, as long as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose is due to be taken. The next day, you should take the scheduled dose at the usual time. Bexarotene capsules should be taken with or immediately after a meal. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible, with food. However, if it is nearly time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your dose schedule as before. Every attempt should be made to keep from vomiting the medication for at least 30 minutes after taking it. For example, if you feel nauseated before or after taking the medication, anti-nausea medications should be used. The erlotinib hydrochloride tablets and bexarotene capsules should be stored at room temperature. Bexarotene capsules should not be stored near heating devices, high temperatures or humidity, or where children or pets have access to them. Bexarotene capsules should be protected from sunlight. Every 4 weeks (1 cycle) your medical history will be recorded and you will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate) and weight. You will have routine blood tests (about 2 teaspoons) and a performance status evaluation (questions about your ability to perform everyday activities). You will have blood drawn (about 1-2 teaspoons) to check you thyroid function. You will also have blood drawn (about 1-2 teaspoons) to check your lipid profile weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every cycle after that. Your study doctor will also ask you about any medications you are taking and your smoking history. Every 2 cycles, your tumor will be evaluated by chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the status of the disease. If you are taking Coumadin® (warfarin), you will have blood drawn (about 1-2 teaspoons) to check your blood clotting function weekly for the first 5 weeks of treatment and then every cycle after that. You may continue receiving erlotinib hydrochloride and bexarotene for as long as the cancer responds to study treatment. Your doctor may decide to take you off this study if you experience intolerable side effects, your medical condition gets worse, or you are unable to comply with study requirements. If you stop study treatment, you may be able to enroll in 1 of the remaining 3 protocols of the BATTLE program. After you have stopped taking the study treatment, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will also have blood drawn (about 1-2 teaspoons) to check your blood clotting function. You will have a performance status evaluation, a chest x-ray, and a CT or MRI scan. Following this evaluation, you will be contacted by telephone every 3 months for up to 3 years, to see how you are doing. This is an investigational study. Erlotinib hydrochloride is approved by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC in patients who have relapsed. Bexarotene is approved by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Their use together in this study is investigational. Up to 72 patients will take part in this multicenter study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The patient has a diagnosis of pathologically confirmed NSCLC by tumor biopsy and/or fineneedle aspiration. 2. The patient has a diagnosis of either stage IIIB, stage IV, or advanced, incurable NSCLC, and failed at least one frontline metastatic NSCLC chemotherapy regimen. (Patients who have failed adjuvant or locally advanced therapy within 6 months are also eligible to participate in study). 3. The patient has unidimensionally measurable NSCLC. 4. Karnofsky performance status &gt;/= 60 or ECOG performance status 02 5. The patient has biopsy accessible tumor. 6. The patient has adequate hematologic function as defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1,500/mm^3, platelet count &gt;/= 100,000/mm^3, WBC &gt;/= 3,000/ mm^3, and hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dL. 7. The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin level &lt;/= 1.5 X the upper limit of normal, and alkaline phosphatase, AST or ALT &lt;/= 2.5 X the upper limit of normal. 8. The patient has adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine level &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dL or a calculated creatinine clearance of &gt;/= 60cc/minute. 9. The patient has PT &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal 10. If patient has brain metastasis, they must have been stable (treated or asymptomatic) for at least 4 weeks after radiation if treated with radiation and not have used steroids for at least 1 week. 11. The patient is &gt;/= 18 years of age. 12. The patient has signed informed consent. 13.
