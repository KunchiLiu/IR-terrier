	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether a homeopathic remedy (Cocculine®) is effective in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea in non metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2-arms: Cocculine® or placebo. The number of patients required to demonstrate a 0.5-point reduction in nausea on a visual analogue scale, assuming an alpha risk of 5% in a two-sided test and 85% power, is 396 (198 per arm). It has been estimated that the enrollment period should be 18 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Placebo-controlled Evaluation of Cocculine® Efficacy in the Management of Nausea After Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proportion of women with breast cancer treated by chemotherapy (CT) is increasing. CT-induced nausea and vomiting negatively impact patient quality of life. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate against a placebo the efficacy of Cocculine® administered as an adjunct to conventional treatments (corticosteroids and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists) for the management of nausea induced by a 1st course of adjuvant CT with FAC50, FEC100 or TAC in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer. Secondary objectives are to test: - the persistence of Cocculine® efficacy over the 2nd and 3rd CT courses - the contribution of Cocculine® to the global management of nausea and vomiting during adjuvant CT - patient compliance with Cocculine® dose. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 arms: Cocculine® or placebo.</detailed_description>
