	<brief_summary>Torasemide is a loop diuretic (pyridine-sulfonylurea)with a wide experience in the treatment of oedema associated to heart failure, kidney or liver disease and either in the treatment of arterial hypertension (alone or combined with other anti-hypertensive drugs). It has been developed a new formulation of Torasemide (Torasemide prolonged release). The aim of this trial is to study the effects of Torasemide prolonged released in comparison with furosemide, in the reduction of myocardial fibrosis in patients with chronic heart failure (Class II-IV of the New York Heart Association Classification.</brief_summary>
