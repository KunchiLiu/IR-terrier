	<brief_summary>Subjects between the ages of 20-45 with mild to moderate asthma will be recruited. Following consent, subjects will undergo an evaluation to assure no underlying metabolic bone disease. Individuals will be treated with inhaled fluticasone low or high dose, daily for 3 months. Serum and urine biochemical markers of bone metabolism will be collected at baseline and monthly for three months. Adherence to study medication and adverse events will be collected at monthly intervals. Differences between fluticasone low and high dose treated individuals will be analyzed between groups and compared with baseline values.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhaled Fluticasone Propionate: Effect on Parameters of Bone Metabolism in Patients With Mild to Moderate Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a prospective randomized trial. Thirty subjects with mild to moderate asthma will receive inhaled fluticasone propionate. Fifteen patients will receive low dose inhaled fluticasone 88 mcg twice daily. Fifteen patients will receive inhaled fluticasone 440 mcg twice daily. The primary outcome will be biochemical markers of bone turnover. These will include 1) serum biochemical markers of bone formation [osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and procollagen I C-terminal propeptide (PICP)] and 2) markers of bone resorption, serum collagen type 1 C-Telopeptide (CTx) urinary N-telopeptide (NTx) and immunoreactive free deoxypyridinoline (iFDpd)]. Secondary endpoints will include, parathyroid hormone (PTH), Urinary Calcium/creatinine, and adverse events.</detailed_description>
