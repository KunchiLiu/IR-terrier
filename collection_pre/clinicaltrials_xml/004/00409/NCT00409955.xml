	<brief_summary>- The goals of this study are to develop a lyophilization method for anterior lamellar transplants in Brasil and to make a comparative analysis among patients transplanted with lyophilized and optisol corneas</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lamellar Transplant With Lyophilized Corneas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- After the development of a techinique to lyophilize corneas, we randomly assingned 20 patients with keratoconus and visual acuity of &lt; 20/60, who signed the consent term and divided them into 2 groups. One group was transplanted with lyophilized corneas and the other group with optisol corneas. - Patients are being followed for 6 months with visual acuity, refraction, topography, orbscan, pachmetry, ultrasound biomicroscopy and confocal microscopy. - Results are going to be statistically analysed by SPSS program.</detailed_description>
