	<brief_title>A Dose-response Study With Strontium Malonate in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>275 post menopausal women are treated with either 750 mg strontium malonate, 1000 mg strontium malonate, 2000 mg strontium malonate, 2 g ProtelosÂ® or placebo. Patients are treated for 12 weeks. A follow up period of 4 weeks is planned for the main study and a follow up period of 8 weeks is planned for approximately 20% of the patients to follow post treatment CTX-1 activity. Apart from S-CTS-1 also response on other bio markers are evaluated as well as BMD.</detailed_description>
