	<brief_title>Safety Study of Rapamycin Administered Before and During Radiotherapy to Treat Rectum Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment regimen Phase I A daily dose of Rapamycin will be taken during 13 days. At step 1 a dose of 2 mg will be given once a day; at step 2 a dose of 4 mg will be given once a day; at step 3 a dose of 6 mg will be given once a day. Preoperative radiotherapy (5x 5 Gy) will be administered at day 8-12, followed by TME-surgery at day 15. Phase II A daily dose of 6 mg Rapamycin will be taken for 14 days (unless the optimal dose found in the phase I study is lower). Preoperative radiotherapy (5x 5 Gy) will be administered at day 9-15, followed by TME-surgery 7-8 weeks post RT. Sample size Phase I dose-escalation study Minimum 3 eligible patients per step, maximum 6 eligible patients per step. Phase II A total of 47 patients will be entered in this part of the study.</detailed_description>
