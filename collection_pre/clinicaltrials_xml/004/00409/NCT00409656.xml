	<brief_summary>Most high risk keratoplasties are currently performed under systemic immunosuppression. Immunosuppressants are currently either Cyclosporine A or mycophenolate mofetile, administered for around 6 months. Due to potentially severe adverse effects, new immunosuppressive exerting less side effects would be desirable. Basiliximab is a monoclonal, chimeric antibody, targeted specifically against the Interleukin-2-Rezeptor from activated T-cells. This agent is known to specifically inhibit T-cell proliferation upon intravenous application only twice following transplantation. Basiliximab has already been demonstrated effective in kidney transplantation. This investigation is a prospective, randomized clinical trial on orthotopic, high-risk penetrating keratoplasty. Basiliximab is evaluated against systemic Cyclosporine A. Primary endpoint is graft rejection. Secondary endpoint is clear graft survival.</brief_summary>
