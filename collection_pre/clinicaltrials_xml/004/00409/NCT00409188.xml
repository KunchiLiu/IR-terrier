	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the cancer vaccine tecemotide (L-BLP25) in addition to best supportive care is effective in prolonging the lives of subjects with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer, compared to best supportive care alone. A local ancillary (sub) study in European centers will evaluate the immune response in peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ancillary Trial: An exploratory investigation of immune response in peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination. The ancillary study is a sub-study within START. This is an exploratory investigation of the immune response in peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination. The main objective is to evaluate whether administration of single-shot, low-dose cyclophosphamide followed by tecemotide (L-BLP25) vaccinations induces specific immune response in peripheral blood to BLP25 (the mucinous glycoprotein 1 [MUC1] antigen) as well as a modulation of cellular and soluble components of the immune response in subjects with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Twenty-five of the European START sites will participate in the ancillary study. Sample size: up to 60 to 80 subjects All inclusion criteria specified in the START clinical trial protocol except for hemoglobin &gt;= 100 gram/Liter (g/L) All exclusion criteria are the same as specified in the START clinical trial protocol Schedule of events: Blood samples will be taken at baseline, visit week 4, 8 13 and 25 (80 milliliter (mL) whole blood each)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented unresectable stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Documented stable disease or objective response, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), after primary chemoradiotherapy (either sequential or concomitant) for unresectable stage III disease, within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to randomization Receipt of concomitant or sequential chemoradiotherapy, consisting of a minimum of two cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy and a minimum radiation dose of &gt;=50 Gray (Gy). Subjects must have completed the primary thoracic chemoradiotherapy at least four weeks (28 days) and no later than 12 weeks (84 days) prior to randomization. Subjects who received prophylactic brain irradiation as part of primary chemoradiotherapy are eligible Geographically accessible for ongoing followup, and committed to comply with the designated visits An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 A platelet count &gt; 140 x 10^9/Liter; white blood cells (WBC) &gt; 2.5 x 10^9/Liter and hemoglobin &gt; 90 gram per liter (g/L) PreTherapies: Undergone lung cancer specific therapy (including surgery) other than primary chemoradiotherapy Receipt of immunotherapy (e.g. interferons, tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukins, or biological response modifiers [granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor {GMCSF}, granulocyte colony stimulating factor {GCSF}, macrophagecolony stimulating factor {MCSF}], monoclonal antibodies) within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to randomization Receipt of investigational systemic drugs (including offlabel use of approved products) within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to randomization Disease Status: Metastatic disease Malignant pleural effusion at initial diagnosis and/or at study entry Past or current history of neoplasm other than lung carcinoma, except for curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix or other cancer curatively treated and with no evidence of disease for at least 5 years Autoimmune disease A recognized immunodeficiency disease including cellular immunodeficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia or dysgammaglobulinemia; subjects who have hereditary or congenital immunodeficiencies Any preexisting medical condition requiring chronic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy (steroids for the treatment of radiation pneumonitis are allowed) Known Hepatitis B and/or C Physiological Functions: Clinically significant hepatic dysfunction Clinically significant renal dysfunction Clinically significant cardiac disease Splenectomy Infectious process that in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the subject's ability to mount an immune response Standard Safety: Pregnant or breastfeeding women, women of childbearing potential, unless using effective contraception as determined by the investigator Known drug abuse/alcohol abuse Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity</criteria>
