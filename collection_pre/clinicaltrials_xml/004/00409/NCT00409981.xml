	<brief_title>Treatment of in-Stent Restenosis by Paclitaxel Coated PTCA Balloons (PACCOCATH – ISR II)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Drug-eluting stents have shown promising anti-restenotic effects in clinical trials. It may be preferable, however, to avoid the stent-in-stent approach in treating in-stent restenosis (ISR). In prior animal trials, we demonstrated a highly significant reduction of neointimal formation by drug-eluting balloon catheters (DEB). The aim of the PACCOCATH ISR study is to investigate the novel DEB in the treatment of ISR. Methods and results: The PACCOCATH ISR study is a randomized, double-blind German multicenter trial on the efficacy and tolerance of the DEB in coronary ISR. Patients are randomized to rePTCA of ISR either using the coated PTCA balloon (3 µg paclitaxel/mm² balloon surface) or a non-coated balloon of the same type (n=56 patients). Balloon inflation time is 60 seconds in both cases. Major inclusion criteria are an ISR in a coronary artery with a diameter stenosis of at least 70%, &lt; 30 mm length, and a vessel diameter of 2.5 to 3.5 mm. The primary endpoint is late lumen loss after 6 months (independent angiographic core lab). Secondary endpoints are binary restenosis rate and major adverse cardiac events.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years Clinical evidence of stable or unstable angina or a positive functional study Single, restenotic lesion in a stented coronary artery (allowed are multiple lesions but only the target lesion is amenable for percutaneous intervention, i.e. no ‘staged’ procedures involving nontarget lesions) Diameter stenosis &gt; 70% (visual estimate) Stented segment length &lt; 30 mm Vessel diameter =&gt; 2.5 mm Female patients can enter this study if they are postmenopausal for at least two years or have undergone hysterectomy or sterilization Signed patient informed consent form Patients and treating physicians agree that the patient will return for all required post procedure followup assessments as defined in the clinical protocol Left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt; 30% Target lesion/vessel with any of the following characteristics: Clear angiographic calcification in the target lesion or greater than mild calcification in the proximal vessel (minimally radiopaque densities that are discrete and nonlinear). Visible thrombus proximal to the lesion. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, abciximab, paclitaxel, or a sensitivity to contrast media which cannot be adequately premedicated. Other medical illness (i.e. cancer, liver disease or congestive heart failure) that may require cytostatic or radiation therapy causing the subject to be noncompliant with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with limited lifeexpectancy (i.e., less than two years). Severe chronic renal insufficiency. Significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed within the past six months. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions. Extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion and/or requires additional antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation treatment. Participating in another device or drug study within the last 6 months</criteria>
