	<brief_summary>This study intends to investigate the relationship between choroidal blood flow and ocular pulse amplitude (OPA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ocular Pulse Amplitude And Choroidal Laser Doppler Flowmetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One eye is randomly selected in 18 healthy subjects. OPA is assessed with Dynamic Contour Tonometry. Submacular choroidal blood flow is measured with Laser Doppler Flowmetry. During both examinations the systemic blood pressure is continuously recorded with Finometer. An average systolic and diastolic LDF parameter flow during 30 seconds are determined and the pulsatility index is calculated according to the formula (LDFsys-LDFdia)/LDFdia. An association of OPA with the LDF pulsatility index, systemic blood pressure values and mean intraocular pressure will be analysed.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy subjects should present no history of ocular diseases, of current topical medication, or of drug or alcohol abuse. Furthermore, a best corrected visual acuity above 20/25 in both eyes, lack of pathological findings upon a slitlamp examination and dilated direct fundoscopy, and an IOP &lt; 21 mmHg in both eyes will be required. History of chronic or recurrent severe inflammatory eye disease such as scleritis or uveitis. History of ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. History of infection or inflammation within the past 3 months. History and clinical evidence for other retinal disease such as agerelated degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy.</criteria>
