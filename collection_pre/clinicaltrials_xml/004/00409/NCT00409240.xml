	<detailed_description>Our project intends to study the 6-month efficacy of a pharmacist-led group intervention program that simultaneously target diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. We hypothesize that pharmacist-led group interventions on a weekly basis for 4-weeks then on a monthly basis for 5 additional months may achieve concomitant reductions in hemoglobin A1c, lipids and blood pressure. We are proposing a pilot randomized controlled study to test the efficacy and feasibility of this approach.</detailed_description>
