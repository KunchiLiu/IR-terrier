	<brief_summary>For certain tibial plateau fractures the bone is compressed due to the force acting on the tibia during the accident. The void provoked by the compression of the bone is filled with an appropriate filling material and the fracture is fixated. I 0401 is a new bone graft substitute that has shown capacities to promote bone-healing. This study will test the safety and efficacy of I 0401 in the treatment of patients with tibial plateau fractures requiring grafting.</brief_summary>
