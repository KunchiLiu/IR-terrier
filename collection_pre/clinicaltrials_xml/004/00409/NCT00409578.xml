	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan or the renin antagonist aliskiren will improve ventricular hemodynamics, as reflected by a greater reduction in levels of N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) compared to placebo in subjects stabilized following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are determined to be at high risk due to an elevated concentration of natriuretic peptides.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female outpatients 18 years old or older Subjects who are hospitalized for ischemic chest discomfort at rest lasting at least 10 minutes and consistent with cardiac ischemia Final diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome Elevated concentrations of natriuretic peptide 310 days after admission for their qualifying acute coronary syndrome event Known or suspected contraindications, including history of allergy or hypersensitivity to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), renin antagonists, or to drugs with similar chemical structures. Presence of clinically overt heart failure Known evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) less than 24 hours before randomization. Patients on chronic ACEI or ARB therapy for whom therapy with an ACEI or ARB is clinically required with no reasonable alternative therapy available. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to the study.</criteria>
