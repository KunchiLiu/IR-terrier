	<brief_title>A Study to Determine Whether Urinary PGE-M Levels Correlate With Ulcerative Colitis Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The available clinical measures of ulcerative colitis activity can be overly influenced by functional symptoms. Placebo response rates in clinical trials are high. Several non-invasive biomarkers are currently available for assessing IBD disease activity including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, c-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin. Although these markers hold some promise, their performance is less than ideal. what is needed is a simple, non-invasive biologic measure of UC disease. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis and is expressed in epithelial inflammatory conditions and some cancers. We have developed an assay to quantify the major urinary metabolite of PGE2, PGE-M. PGE-M has been previously shown to be elevated in the urine of patients with advanced colorectal neoplasia relative to controls. We recently showed that PGEm was a sensitive and specific marker of Crohn's disease activity (Accepted for publication at DDW 2006).</detailed_description>
