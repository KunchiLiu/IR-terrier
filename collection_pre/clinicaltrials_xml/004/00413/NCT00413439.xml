	<brief_title>Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of an Antifungal in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who undergo aggressive chemotherapy are due to immunosuppression susceptible to infections, including fungal infections. As the failure rate in the treatment of invasive fungal infections is high, prophylaxis is frequently recommended. This open label study investigates the safety and tolerability of two different dosages of a water soluble azole antifungal, as well as the efficacy in prevention of invasive fungal infections and pharmacokinetic data.</detailed_description>
