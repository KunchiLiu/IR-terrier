	<brief_summary>We plan to determine changes in the immune system during the allergic response to grass pollen allergens. We have chosen a particular element of the immune response, the immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) as an indicator. We hypothesize that treatment with Grazax will increase serum levels of Phleum pratense specific IgG4 and IgE, as well as reduce the cutaneous sensitivity of the early (IgE mediated) and late (cell mediated) allergic response.</brief_summary>
