	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic stage IIIB or stage IV NSCLC receiving 21day cycles of gemcitabine/carboplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks at the time of screening Thrombocytopenia as evidenced by a platelet count ≤ 50 x 10^9/L during the qualifying cycle of chemotherapy, OR platelet count &lt; 100 x 10^9/L on Day 22 of the qualifying cycle (for eligibility inclusion: ability to receive the same dose of chemotherapy on study), this criteria ensures that the patient must be dose delayed for platelet recovery Ability to receive the same dose and schedule of chemotherapy during the first onstudy treatment cycle as was given in the qualifying cycle (except Day 8 gemcitabine) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL, hemoglobin ≥ 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count ≥ 100 x 10 ^9/L on Day 1 of the first on study chemotherapy treatment cycle Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 at the time of screening Adequate Liver function; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Gilbert's Syndrome) Adequate renal function; serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN Receipt of &gt; 1 prior systemic chemotherapy regimen Sepsis, disseminated coagulation or any other condition (i.e. immune [idiopathic] thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP], thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP], hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS]) that may exacerbate thrombocytopenia History of unstable angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or recent (within 1 year of screening ) myocardial infarction History of arterial thrombosis (e.g., stroke or transient ischemic attack) within 1 year of screening History of pulmonary embolism or other venous thrombosis within 1 year of screening (except for catheterrelated clots) Use of any nitrosourea or mitomycinC within 6 weeks of screening Have received any thrombopoietic growth factor or related substance Have received granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) within the last 4 weeks prior to screening Have received any experimental therapy within 4 weeks prior to screening Have ever received a bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell infusion (within 1 year of screening) Known hypersensitivity to any recombinant E. coliderived product.</criteria>
