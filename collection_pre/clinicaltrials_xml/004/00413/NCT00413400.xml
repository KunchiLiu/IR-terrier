	<brief_title>Study of TNF-Antagonism in the Metabolic Syndrome (II)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome is an increasingly prevalent disorder associated with elevated risks of type II DM (diabetes mellitus) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A subclinical inflammatory state is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and coronary artery disease (CAD). Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) -alpha is an inflammatory cytokine that is increased in a spectrum of inflammatory diseases as well as in insulin resistance. TNF-alpha antagonists are clinically effective in the inflammation of arthritides, and have recently been shown by our group to decrease inflammatory cardiovascular risk markers in metabolic syndrome. Data suggests that adiponectin, a recently discovered adipocytokine that may protect against the development of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, may be downregulated by TNF-alpha. In addition, population based studies have shown that those with the highest levels of TNF-alpha have an increased relative risk of cardiovascular morbidity while rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with TNF-alpha blockade appear protected from cardiovascular disease. We will perform a 6-month study in which we will administer etanercept, a TNF-alpha receptor fusion protein, to subjects with metabolic syndrome to investigate its effect on surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease, including inflammatory markers, adiponectin and glucose tolerance and endothelial function. The results of the proposed study will have broad implications regarding the physiological role of TNF-alpha on the inflammatory cascade, cardiovascular indices and endothelial function.</detailed_description>

Plus two of the following: Abdominal obesity defined by waist hip ratio &gt; 0.90 for men and &gt; 0.85 for women and BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 Dyslipidemia including serum triglycerides &gt;= 150 mg/dl or serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) &lt; 0.9 mmol/L for men (35 mg/dL) and &lt; 1.0 mmol/L (39mg/dL) for women Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;= 140/90 or on medication 1. Age &lt; 18 or &gt; 60 years 2. Body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 kg/m2 3. Positive tuberculosis (purified protein derivative [PPD]) skin test (5mm induration or more) on screening 4. Mycobacterial disease treated less than 6 months. 5. Current or recurrent infection or any underlying condition that may predispose to infection or anyone who has been admitted to the hospital due to bacteremia, pneumonia or any other serious infection. 6. Therapy with glucocorticoid or immunosuppressant at time of recruitment or within past 3 months. 7. Prior or concurrent cyclophosphamide therapy 8. Use of a live vaccine 90 days prior to, or during this study. 9. History of blood dyscrasia including any kind of anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia. Women with a reversible cause of anemia that has resolved will be eligible. 10. Hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dl 11. History of malignancy (except patients with surgically cured basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers who will be eligible) 12. History of organ transplantation 13. HIVpositive status determined by HIV test at screening or known history of any other immunosuppressing disease. 14.

Chronic use of fibrates, niacin, or antihypertensives for &gt; 6 weeks prior to study initiation at a stable dose is not exclusionary, but chronic use of statins for &gt; 6 months is exclusionary. Initiation of statins, fibrates, niacin or antihypertensive treatments during the study is not exclusionary but will be considered in the analysis (see Protection against risks). 22.

History of recent alcohol or substance abuse (&lt; 1 year) 28. Any condition judged by the patient's physician to cause this clinical trial to be detrimental to the patient. 29. History of noncompliance with other therapies</criteria>
