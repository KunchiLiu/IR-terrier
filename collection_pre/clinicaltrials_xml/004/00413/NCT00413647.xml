	<brief_summary>Safety and dosimetry of CardioPET™ will be evaluated in normal healthy volunteers and CAD subjects both male and female between the ages of 50-85. Nine normal controls will undergo repeated whole body imaging for biodistribution and dosimetry estimation. Six other normal healthy subjects will undergo heart imaging only. Six CAD subjects will undergo heart imaging only.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study in Healthy Volunteers to Evaluate the Safety of CardioPET™ in Detection of Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CardioPET™ is a modified fatty acid (MFA) that closely resembles naturally-occurring free fatty acids (FFAs) in the human body. Study Procedures: Visit 1: Screening - Eligibility determination Visit 2: Injection and PET Imaging Visit 3: Follow-up Visit</detailed_description>
