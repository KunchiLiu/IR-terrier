	<brief_summary>Insulin-resistance in type 2 diabetes is associated with chronic inflammation. Anti-inflammatory actions might increase sensitivity to insulin. Since some probiotics have anti-inflammatory properties, ingestion of the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus Acidophilus NCFM might increase insulin-sensitivity. The inflammatory response to endotoxin injection and the insulin-sensitivity is examined before and after four weeks ingestion of probiotics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Type 2 Diabetes and the Effect of Probiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous studies have shown an association between insulin-resistance in type 2 diabetes and chronic low-grade inflammation. Some probiotics have an anti-inflammatory properties. Ingestion of probiotics might therefore, due to this property, increase sensitivity to insulin. In this study type 2 diabetics (N=24) and healthy control (N=24) are given the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus Acidophilus NCFM for four weeks. The anti-inflammatory effect is examined by evaluating the inflammatory response (White blood cell count, plasma-cytokines) to an iv injection of endotoxin (0,3 ng/kg) before and after the intervention. Also the insulin-sensitivity is measured with an hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp before and after L. acidophilus NCFM.</detailed_description>
