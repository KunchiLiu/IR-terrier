	<brief_title>Isavuconazole (BAL8557) in the Treatment of Candidemia and Other Invasive Candida Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Candida infections, representing approximately 80% of all major systemic fungal infections, are the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections, with a mortality rate of 40%. Isavuconazole is not yet approved for the treatment of fungal infections. This study investigates the efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral Isavuconazole. Patients are randomized to Isavuconazole and the reference regimen. Patients with a positive blood- or deep tissue culture of candida fungi can be included.</detailed_description>
