	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of Beclomethasone Dipropionate 100 µg + Formoterol 6 µg pMDI Via HFA-134a Vs. Budesonide 160 µg + Formoterol 4,5 µg Dry Powder Via Turbuhaler®. (Symbicort®)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is a chronic disease that is estimated to affect over 25 million people both in the U.S. and in Europe (i.e. approximately 10% of the total population). Pharmacological therapy is used to treat reversible airway obstruction, inflammation and hyper-reactivity. Medications include preventive treatments in forms of antinflammatory/antiallergic agents (i.e. glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, cromolyn sodium) and reliever treatments, in forms of bronchodilators (i.e. β-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics). In patients treated with inhaled glucocorticosteroids whose asthma is not fully controlled, national and international guidelines recommend a stepwise approach. Recent evidence-based clinical trials show that the addition of a LABA to inhaled glucocorticosteroids is more beneficial in terms of asthma control than increasing the dose of corticosteroids alone. COMPARISONS: CHF 1535 (BECLOMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE 100 µg+ FORMOTEROL 6 µg) pMDI via HFA-134a compared to SYMBICORT (BUDESONIDE 160 µg + FORMOTEROL 4,5 µg).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe persistent asthma for at least 6 months, according to GINA revised version 2002 guidelines: Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) &gt; 50% and &lt; 80% of the predicted normal; Asthma not adequately controlled with the current therapies, defined as presence of daily asthma symptoms &gt; once a week and nighttime asthma symptoms &gt; twice a month, and daily use of shortacting β2agonists. These findings are to be based on recent medical history and are to be confirmed in the 2week runin period. Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at a daily dose ≤ 1000 μg of BDP or equivalent. The daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids taken at visit 1 will be assessed taking into account the following ratios between the doses of the different steroids: fluticasone propionate : BDP CFC = 1 : 2; budesonide : BDP CFC = 4 : 5; flunisolide : BDP CFC = 1 : 1. The ratios between inhaled steroids are irrespective of the formulations (i.e. spray aerosol or powder) used. When BDP is given in the new extrafine HFA134a formulation (as QVAR®, 3M Healthcare), the ratio with BDP CFC is set as 2 : 5. Therefore, the maximum allowed daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids at study entry will be: budesonide 800 μg, fluticasone propionate 500 μg, flunisolide 1000 μg, BDP 1000 mcg, BDP HFA extrafine 400 μg. Positive response to the reversibility test in the screening visit, defined as an increase of at least 12% (or, alternatively, of 200mL) from baseline value in the measurement of FEV1 30 minutes following 2 puffs (2 x 100 µg) of inhaled salbutamol administered via pMDI. The reversibility test can be avoided in patients having a documented positive response in the previous 6 months. A cooperative attitude and ability to be trained to correctly use the metered dose inhalers and to complete the diary cards. Written informed consent obtained. At the end of the 2week runin period, the presence of daily asthma symptoms (of at least mild intensity) and nighttime asthma symptom (of at least mild intensity) &gt; once a week, as well as of daily use of relief salbutamol is to be confirmed by reviewing the diary cards for runin Inability to carry out pulmonary function testing; Diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as defined by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute/World Health Organisation (NHLBI/WHO) Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines (30); History of near fatal asthma; Evidence of severe asthma exacerbation or symptomatic infection of the airways in the previous 8 weeks; Three or more courses of oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation due to asthma during the previous 6 months; Patients treated with longacting β2agonists, anticholinergics and antihistamines during the previous 2 weeks, with topical or intranasal corticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists during the previous 4 weeks; Patients who have changed their dose of inhaled corticosteroids during the previous 4 weeks, or treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at a daily dose &gt; 1000 μg of BDP or equivalent (except for extrafine formulations, see inclusion criteria); Current smokers or recent (less than one year) exsmokers, defined as smoking at least 10 cigarettes/day; History or current evidence of heart failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias; Diabetes mellitus; Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) during the previous six months; Patients with an abnormal QTc interval value in the ECG test, defined as &gt; 450 msec in males or &gt; 470 msec in females; Other haemodynamic relevant rhythm disturbances (including atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation with ventricular response, bradycardia (≤ 55 bpm), evidence of atrialventricular (AV) block on ECG of more than 1st degree; Clinically significant or unstable concurrent diseases: uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, significant hepatic impairment, poorly controlled pulmonary (tuberculosis, active mycotic infection of the lung), gastrointestinal (e.g. active peptic ulcer), neurological or haematological autoimmune diseases; Cancer or any chronic diseases with prognosis &lt; 2 years; Pregnant or lactating females or females at risk of pregnancy, i.e. those not demonstrating adequate contraception (i.e. barrier methods, intrauterine devices, hormonal treatment or sterilization). A pregnancy test is to be carried out in women of a fertile age. History of alcohol or drug abuse; Patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or betablockers as regular use; Allergy, sensitivity or intolerance to study drugs and/or study drug formulation ingredients; Patients unlikely to comply with the protocol or unable to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study; Patients who received any investigational new drug within the last 12 weeks; Patients who have been previously enrolled in this study; At the end of the runin period, patients will not be admitted to the treatment period in the case of an increase of PEFR (L/sec) measured at the clinics at the end of the runin period &gt; 15% in respect of values measured at the start of the runin period; Patients with asthma exacerbations during the runin period will also be excluded from the study.</criteria>
