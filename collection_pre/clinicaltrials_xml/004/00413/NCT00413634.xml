	<brief_summary>Age related differences in response to a drug could arise from variation in pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles between age groups. Whilst the efficacy and safety profile of anagrelide is well established through a well-documented clinical trial programme in patients of all ages, no formal studies have been carried out to investigate whether the PK profile of anagrelide and its metabolites is altered with age. This study is designed to allow comparisons to be made in terms of pharmacokinetics of anagrelide and its metabolites between elderly (â‰¥ 65 years) and young (18-50 years) ET patients</brief_summary>
