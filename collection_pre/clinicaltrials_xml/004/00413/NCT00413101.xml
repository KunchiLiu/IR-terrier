	<brief_summary>This single arm study will determine the effects of complete anemia correction in anemic patients with end-stage renal disease currently receiving suboptimal doses of NeoRecormon. Patients on dialysis receiving NeoRecormon, and with a hemoglobin level &lt;105g/L, will be treated with subcutaneous NeoRecormon at a dose determined by the investigator in order to reach (within 3 months) and maintain a hemoglobin level in the range of 120-135g/L. Heart function and quality of life will be measured before and after anemia correction. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100 individuals.</brief_summary>
