	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of RAR Gamma versus placebo in ex-smokers with moderate or severe emphysema treated with optimal COPD therapy. Following optimization of COPD therapy (up to 6 weeks) patients will be randomized to receive either RAR Gamma (5mg) or placebo once daily using a 2:1 ratio (active:placebo), in addition to their standard therapy. Following the double-blind treatment period, patients will enter a 4-week follow-up period. The anticipated time on study period is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
