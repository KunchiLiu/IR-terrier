	<brief_title>Study of Renal Blood Flow During Human Endotoxemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many septic patients develop acute renal failure and the risk is higher in patients with diabetes. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind the development of acute renal failure in connection with sepsis is not completely understood. One among many possible explanations is a change in renal hemodynamics. However, it is still largely unknown what happens to the renal plasma flow during human sepsis. In this study we give endotoxin injection (0,3 ng/kg) to type 2 diabetics and healthy controls as an experimental model of sepsis. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate are measured by DTPA-renography 1 day before before and 1,25 and 6,5 hours after injection of endotoxin. Furthermore WBC, plasma-cytokines,VCAM-1/ICAM-1, endothelin-1, Thromboxane B2, angiotensin 2, renin and PAI-1 are measured on an hourly basis up to 8 hours after endotoxin injection.</detailed_description>
