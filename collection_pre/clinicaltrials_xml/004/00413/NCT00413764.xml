	<brief_summary>Tibolone has been registered for treatment of menopausal symptoms. It is, however, not known what the effects are of tibolone in postmenopausal women diagnosed with sexual dysfunction. This is important because there is currently no approved treatment of libido problems in postmenopausal women. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of tibolone with an estrogen/progestogen skin patch in postmenopausal women diagnosed sexual dysfunction.</brief_summary>

Women were to suffer from decreased satisfactory sexual activity compared to younger age and sexual problems were not to be considered caused by relationship/partner problems. The decreased sexual functioning was to result in sexually related personal distress as confirmed by the FSDS (score =15). An affirmative answer was to be given to the following questions: (a) In previous years did you find sexual activity satisfying? (b) Has there been a decline in your satisfaction with sexual activity? (c) Are you satisfied with your partner as a friend?
