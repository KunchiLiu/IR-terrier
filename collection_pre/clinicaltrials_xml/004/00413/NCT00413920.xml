	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of a steroid avoidance regimen in comparison with steroid treatment in combination with an initially higher dose of enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) and cyclosporine microemulsion in de novo renal transplant recipients. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either EC-MPS or steroids in combination with EC-MPS. Patients of both treatment groups will receive monoclonal antibody induction therapy and a perioperative bolus of steroids and cyclosporine.</brief_summary>
