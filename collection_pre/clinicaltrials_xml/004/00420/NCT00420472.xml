	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, efficacy and effect on quality of life of switching kidney transplant patients from reduced dose EC-MPS treatment due to gastrointestinal problems to a higher than the equimolar dose of CellCept. Patients will be switched, initially, from EC-MPS (&lt;1440g/day) to an equimolar dose of CellCept, and at the next visit (day 10 +/- 5) the CellCept dose will be increased by 250mg/day, and the daily dose will be split into 3-4 doses. The anticipated time on study treatment is &lt;3 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
