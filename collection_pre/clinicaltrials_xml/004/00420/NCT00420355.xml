	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Two HIV Protease Inhibitors in Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patients with HIV infection will be enrolled in this open-label, parallel arm pharmacokinetic study. Subjects receiving either lopinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir as part of their antiretroviral therapy will have a pharmacokinetic study performed over 12-20 days to examine whether coadministration of lopinavir and atazanavir alters the pharmacokinetics of either agent. The safety of these agents in combination will also be explored.</detailed_description>
