	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Topical Phenylephrine Gel in the Management of Faecal Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Faecal seepage and even frank incontinence at night can be a problem for approximately 30% of patients who have undergone ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). Nocturnal seepage may be a problem in patients who do not have gross incontinence, or who may even have no incontinence during the day. Although baseline continence during the day is maintained by involuntary control of the internal anal sphincter, this can be supplemented by voluntary contraction of the external sphincter. While sleeping, this supplementary external sphincter effect is lost and internal anal sphincter tone is reduced, leading to seepage. This is obviously distressing and leads some patients to wear a pad to reduce the soiling that may occur. The primary objective is to determine the effect of 10% phenylephrine hydrochloride gel, applied three times a day, on the change from baseline to the end of study (8 weeks)in the faecal incontinence score (St Mark's) with passive faecal incontinence after ileo-anal pouch construction, compared with placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Incontinence of solid or liquid stool/mucus following ileoanal pouch construction, at least once per week over the last month At least six months must have elapsed since IPAA surgery or six months since closure of a loop ileostomy created during IPAA surgery, whichever is the later Aged 18 years or over If female, the subject must not be lactating and must be (a) postmenopausal, (b) surgically sterilised, or (c) have a negative pregnancy test result prior to entry into the study and will use adequate contraception for the duration of the study (sterilization of partner, abstinence, an intrauterine device (IUD), double barrier method or oral hormonal contraception). Written informed consent to participate has been provided NB: Seepage, leakage, soiling of faecal material is regarded as incontinence. A history of surgery to the anal sphincter complex Active pouchitis (determined by clinical examination and macroscopic inflammation on endoscopy. Patients on maintenance antibiotics need not be excluded but their antibiotic dose should remain the same throughout the study) Undergone pelvic radiotherapy at any time Cardiac or cardiovascular disease, including ischaemic heart disease, history of stroke, cerebral arteriosclerosis, aneurysm, tachycardia or hypertension Hyperthyroidism or diabetes mellitus Crohn's disease (indeterminate colitis is not an exclusion criterion) The use of α or βadrenoceptor agonists (other than inhaled βadrenoceptor agonists) or antagonists, other sympathomimetics or any cardiovascular drugs during the study (including eyedrops, nasal drops and OTC cold cures containing phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine) The use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants in the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication or during the study Any mental or other impairment which, in the investigator's opinion, would render them unlikely to be able to comply with the requirements of the study Considered by their physician unlikely to be able to comply with the protocol Participation in a clinical trial within the past three months Known hypersensitivity to phenylephrine or excipients History of drug or alcohol abuse</criteria>
