	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by progressive deterioration in the function of the pancreatic beta-cells, which are the cells that produce and secrete insulin (the hormone primarily responsible for the handling of glucose in the body). The investigators propose a double-blind, randomized controlled pilot study comparing the effect of sitagliptin (a novel anti-diabetic drug with beta-cell protective potential) versus placebo, on the preservation of beta-cell function over one year in patients with T2DM on metformin, the first-line agent for the treatment of T2DM (ie. the study groups will be (i) sitagliptin and metformin versus (ii) placebo and metformin). This study may demonstrate an important beta-cell protective capacity of sitagliptin. Hypothesis: In patients with T2DM on metformin, treatment with the DPP-IV inhibitor sitagliptin will preserve pancreatic beta-cell function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Medications currently used in the treatment of T2DM have not been shown to modify the progressive decline in beta-cell function that occurs over time. Recent evidence, however, suggests that a new class of anti-diabetic medications, called dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, may be able to protect beta cells and hence alter the natural history of T2DM. We thus wish to study the effect of sitagliptin (a DPP-IV inhibitor) on the preservation of beta-cell function in patients with T2DM randomized to either (i) sitagliptin and metformin or (ii) placebo and metformin.</detailed_description>

A1c at screening between 6.5% and 9% inclusive if on no oral hypoglycemic agents or 6.0% and 9.0% inclusive if on 12 oral hypoglycemic agents 1. Current insulin therapy 2. Type 1 diabetes or secondary forms of diabetes 3. Any major illness with a life expectancy of &lt; 5 years or that may interfere with the patient's participation in the study 4. Involvement in any other study requiring drug therapy 5. Renal dysfunction as evidenced by serum creatinine &gt;/= 136 umol/L for males or &gt;/= 124 umol/L for females or abnormal creatinine clearance (&lt; 60 ml/min by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula) 6. Hepatic disease considered to be clinically significant (includes jaundice, chronic hepatitis, or previous liver transplant) or transaminases &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal 7.
