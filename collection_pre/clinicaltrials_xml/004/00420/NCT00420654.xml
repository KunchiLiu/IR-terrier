	<brief_summary>Growth hormone treatment is used in girls with Turner syndrome to increase final height. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of growth hormone treatment on body composition and heart function in adult women with Turner syndrome. The hypothesis is that the fat mass will decrease and lean body mass will increase. There is only very limited documentation of the effect on the heart in this study population.</brief_summary>
