	<brief_summary>The only trial in participants who are methotrexate-inadequate responders and have active Rheumatoid Arthritis, in which gadolinium-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Bone Mineral Density; and biochemical markers of bone, cartilage, and synovial tissue metabolism are used to evaluate early effects (4 months) of Abatacept on inflammation/structural damage. Study will provide valuable mechanism-of-action information on how Abatacept exerts its effects (including on bone) through new techniques.</brief_summary>
