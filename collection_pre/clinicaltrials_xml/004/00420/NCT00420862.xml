	<brief_summary>High survival rates have been reported for screen-detected Stage I lung cancer patients, but there are concerns about the potential biases of uncontrolled studies. DANTE is a prospective randomized controlled trial exploring the effects of screening with LDCT on lung-cancer-specific mortality, and on the prevalence and incidence rates of lung cancer, stage distribution and resectability rates in a selected high-risk population. The prevalence of a set of biomarkers in sputum and blood samples is also being determined.</brief_summary>
