	<brief_title>Mesh Repair of Anterior Vaginal Wall Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anterior vaginal wall prolapse is the most common type of pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women. This anatomic defect has traditionally been repaired with anterior colporrhaphy plication, a series of interrupted stitches being the main surgical component. The procedure is associated with a high recurrence rate, up to 32 % even after using paravaginal repair along with anterior colporrhaphy.It has been sought to resolve the problem of recurrence using artificial mesh as in the repair of abdominal hernias. Comparison: Anterior vaginal wall repair with or without reinforcement with polypropylene mesh were compared in a prospective randomized study</detailed_description>
