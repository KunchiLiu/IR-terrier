	<brief_summary>To determine if treatment with BG00012 can decrease the number of MS relapses during a certain time period. To determine if, over time, BG00012 treatment can decrease the number of certain types of brain lesions commonly seen in MS patients and slow down the time it takes for the disease to get worse. The purpose of this study is also to determine the safety of BG00012 and how well it is tolerated. Another goal is to see what effect BG00012 may have on tests and evaluations used to assess MS.</brief_summary>
