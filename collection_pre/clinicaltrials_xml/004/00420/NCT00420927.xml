	<brief_title>Study of the Optimal Protocol for Methotrexate and Adalimumab Combination Therapy in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a 78-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-treatment period study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of adalimumab and MTX with placebo and MTX in subjects with early RA. Subjects were randomized to receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) or placebo subcutaneous injections in combination with orally administered MTX for 26 weeks (Period 1). All subjects in all arms received open-label MTX weekly throughout the study (both Period 1 and Period 2). At Weeks 22 and 26, subjects were assessed for achievement of low disease activity, defined as a DAS28 score below 3.2. DAS28 is a measure of RA disease activity calculated using the number of tender and swollen joints (out of a total of 28), C-reactive protein level (CRP, a blood marker of inflammation), and the patient's global assessment of disease activity (indicated by marking a 10 cm line between very good and very bad). Subjects who achieved low disease activity at Week 22 and 26 in the adalimumab arm at the end of Period 1 were randomized to receive MTX monotherapy (placebo and MTX) or combination therapy (adalimumab and MTX) in a 1:1 ratio for the duration of Period 2 (52 weeks, i.e., to Week 78 of the study). Subjects achieving low disease activity at Week 22 and 26 in the placebo arm (MTX monotherapy) at the end of Period 1 continued to receive MTX monotherapy (and placebo injections in a blinded fashion) for the duration of Period 2. Subjects failing to achieve low disease activity at Week 22 and 26 at the end of Period 1 received open-label combination therapy during Period 2 regardless of treatment assignment in Period 1.</detailed_description>
