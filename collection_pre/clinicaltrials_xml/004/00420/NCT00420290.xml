	<brief_summary>Chronic hemodialysis (CHD) patients display multiple metabolic abnormalities related to advanced uremia. Despite vigorous attempts to prevent these abnormalities and their consequences, most CHD patients suffer from a unique form of nutritional derangement, which can be termed as "uremic wasting". Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of uremic wasting, especially the degree of loss of muscle mass, sharply increases mortality and hospitalization rate in CHD patients. Several factors have been thought to be associated with uremic wasting, including hormonal derangement, anorexia, physical inactivity, and concurrent illnesses. Chronic inflammation, also highly prevalent in these patients, causes muscle catabolism in animal models and certain clinical conditions. Epidemiological studies show an association between chronic inflammation and uremic wasting in hemodialysis patients indicating a possible causal relationship. The cause for the activated inflammatory state in CHD patients is believed to be multi-factorial. Nevertheless, it is certainly important for the host to limit its biological activity by eliciting a stronger anti-inflammatory response, for example through the production of naturally occurring receptor antagonist. Interleukin 1 beta, one of the major pro-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to be associated with protein catabolism in several chronic disease states, including advanced uremia. A balance between interleukin 1 beta (agonist) and its naturally occurring receptor antagonist IL-1ra may play a pivotal role in controlling the inflammatory response and its consequences in this population. The overall goal of this particular grant application is to examine the short-term effects of the administration of the recombinant form of IL-1ra on 1) chronic inflammatory state and 2) protein homeostasis in chronically inflamed CHD patients. We have updated our protocol to perform an interim analysis. The interim analysis will be performed after half of the planned study sample has been enrolled (14 subjects; 7 in each arm). The interim analysis has been approved by the Data Safety Monitoring Board.</brief_summary>
