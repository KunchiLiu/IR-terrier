	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma. All patients must have measurable disease. Patients must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol. Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority GOG protocol, if one exists. Patients who have received one prior regimen must have a GOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2. Patients who have received two prior regimens must have a GOG Performance Status of 0 or 1. Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration. Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted. Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least four weeks prior to registration. Patients must have had one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound. Patients must NOT have received any noncytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease. Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception (for example, intrauterine device [IUD], birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for 3 months after discontinuation of study treatment. Patients with previous enzastaurin treatment. Patients who have received radiation to more than 25% of marrowbearing areas Patients with other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, who had (or have) any evidence of other cancer present within the last 5 years or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy. Patients who have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry. Patients who are unable to discontinue use of carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin (refer to Concomitant Medications for a discussion of enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs [EIAEDs]). Patients who are receiving concurrent administration of any other systemic anticancer therapy except for a biphosphonate if patient has bony metastases. Patients who have received prior therapy with noncytotoxic agents (i.e. bevacizumab). Patients with serious concomitant systemic disorders (for example, active infection or abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) indicative of cardiac disease) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient and his/her ability to complete the study.</criteria>
