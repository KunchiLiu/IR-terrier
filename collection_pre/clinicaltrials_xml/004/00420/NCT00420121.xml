	<brief_summary>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and a variable prognosis. The aim of the study is to create a standardized evaluation of the different subtypes of this disease in order to receive an overview of the spectrum of clinical and laboratory features as well as the therapeutic strategies for patients with CLE.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods: A core set questionnaire has been developed in the course of the "European Society of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (EUSCLE)", and a total of 40 patients (32 females, 8 males) in two centres, Germany and Sweden, were included in this study. Results: CLE was diagnosed in 39 individuals (5 with acute CLE, 10 with subacute CLE, 13 with chronic CLE, and 18 with intermittent CLE) and one individual presented with a systemic manifestation of the disease. Furthermore, disease onset and duration as well as activity and damage of skin lesions using a modified CLASI were examined. Interestingly, 75% of the patients with CLE showed a positive history of photosensitivity, but only 62.5% exhibited characteristic lesions after standardized phototesting. Laboratory analysis revealed positive antinuclear antibodies in 50% of the patients, positive anti-Ro/SSA in 12 and positive anti-La/SSB antibodies in 8 cases. The predominantly used treatments included sunscreens (38 patients), topical steroids (31 patients), topical calcineurin inhibitors (12 patients), chloroquine (19 patients), hydroxychloroquine (11 patients), and systemic steroids (12 patients). Conclusions: The new core set questionnaire enables the clinician to characterize the different skin manifestations involved in CLE and to evaluate disease activity and reasonable treatment modalities. Furthermore, epidemiological data and laboratory features can be assessed for the various subtypes. In the future, this standardized evaluation might lead to the development of diagnostic guidelines and evidence based therapeutic strategies thus improving quality of care for patients with CLE.</detailed_description>
