	<brief_summary>The drug ABR-217620/naptumomab estafenatox is a fusion of two proteins, one that recognizes tumor cells and one that triggers an attack on the tumor cells by activating some white blood cells belonging to the body's normal immune system. This results in an accumulation of white blood cells in the cancer that can fight the cancer. This study will compare the safety and effectiveness (assessed by tumor status and survival) of ABR-217620/naptumomab estafenatox when given with standard therapy IFN-alpha to IFN-alpha alone in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).</brief_summary>
