Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) Ability to expectorate sputum samples on command. Ability to tolerate a 1week washout interval with no inhaled tobramycin or other aminoglycoside treatment. Clinically stable in the opinion of the investigator. Inhaled or intravenous aminoglycosides within 7 days before study drug administration. Any investigational drug within 2 weeks before screening. Loop diuretics within 7 days before study drug administration. Current use of inhaled tobramycin delivered by the PARI LC PLUS jet nebulizer without washout period of at least 1 week before entering the study.
