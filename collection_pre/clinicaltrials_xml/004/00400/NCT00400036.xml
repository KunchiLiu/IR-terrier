	<brief_summary>The objective of our research project is to determine the effects of fish protein, present in fish, on insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant human individuals, and its mechanism of action on glucose metabolism. Our hypothesis is that fish protein improves insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and plasma lipid profile through an improvement in a primary defect in insulin signaling in overweight and insulin-resistant subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Fish Protein in Subjects With Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent data show that cod protein prevents the development of insulin resistance in rats. Dietary fish protein may also enhance insulin sensitivity in overweight insulin-resistant subjects by improving a primary defect in insulin signaling to PI 3-kinase, leading to reduced activation of the downstream effectors Akt and PKC. To determine whether this is the case, we will study the effects of fish protein on insulin sensitivity in humans, and how it improves the ability of muscles to use glucose. Such studies will help to advise individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes about eating fish.</detailed_description>
