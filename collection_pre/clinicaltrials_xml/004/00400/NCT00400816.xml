	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well temozolomide works in treating patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma or Mixed Oligoastrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) or mixed oligoastrocytoma (MOA) treated with temozolomide. - Determine the response rate in these patients. - Assess the quality of life of patients with AO or MOA treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type (anaplastic oligodendroglioma vs mixed oligoastrocytoma). Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before courses 1, 3, 5, and 7, every 3 months for the first year after completion of treatment, every 4 months for the second year, every 6 months for the third and fourth years, and once a year thereafter. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
