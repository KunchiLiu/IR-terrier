	<brief_summary>This is an open label single site Phase II clinical trial to identify a potentially promising therapy dose for Sunitinib malate. The study drug will be taken orally once daily on days 1 through 28 of each 42 day cycle. Treatment will be continued until there is either disease progression or cumulative/acute toxicity. All patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS): leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) seen at the Moffitt Cancer Center will be screened for eligibility to be enrolled in the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Sunitinib Malate for Metastatic and/or Surgically Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label single site Phase II clinical trial to identify a potentially promising therapy dose for Sunitinib malate, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor. The study drug will be taken orally once daily on days 1 through 28 of each 42 day cycle. Treatment will be continued until there is either disease progression or cumulative/acute toxicity which in the opinion of the treating physician or the trial Principal Investigator (PI) compromises the ability of the patient to receive treatment or the patient desires to stop treatment. All patients with unresectable or metastatic STS: leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and MFH seen at the Moffitt Cancer Center will be screened for eligibility to be enrolled in the study. An office visit will be required before the beginning of every cycle every 6 weeks to assess toxicity and for physical examination. Complete blood count (CBC) and differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained at every scheduled visit.</detailed_description>

Major surgery or radiation therapy or chemotherapy within 4 weeks of starting the study treatment. NCI CTCAE version 3 grade 3 hemorrhage within 4 weeks of starting the study treatment. History of or known brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis, or evidence of symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal disease. Any of the following within the 6 months prior to study drug administration: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE greater than or equal to grade 2 Prolonged QTc interval on baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) &gt; 500 msec.
