	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination valsartan with hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine in hypertensive patients previously treated with valsartan with hydrochlorothiazide and remaining uncontrolled. A naturalistic approach will be taken comparing two different possible ways to achieve the higher dosage of the triple combination, i.e. 160 mg of valsartan and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide with amlodipine 10 mg.</brief_summary>
