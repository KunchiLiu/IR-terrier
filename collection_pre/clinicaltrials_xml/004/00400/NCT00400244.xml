	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to develop French Canadian versions of the Wheelchair Skills Program (WSP). Translating a measurement instrument in the field of biomedical sciences requires not only the language to be taken into account but also the cultural context. We will determine the measurement properties of the WST-F and complete the randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of the WSTP-F.</brief_summary>
