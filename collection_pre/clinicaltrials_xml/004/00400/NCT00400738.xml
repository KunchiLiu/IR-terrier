	<brief_title>The Pharmacokinetics of Double Boosted Protease Inhibitors in Antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with only protease inhibitors might benefit HIV patients, who experience problems with the other antiretrovirals drugs classes. Another reason to only use protease inhibitors is that the remaining classes are spared. This leaves the option to use these classes in the future, for instance in cases of drug resistance. Laboratory data have shown that the combination of saquinavir with lopinavir and ritonavir may a good regimen. This study will explore this idea.</detailed_description>
