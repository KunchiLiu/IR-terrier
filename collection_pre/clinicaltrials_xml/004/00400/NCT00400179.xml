	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, international, two-arm, parallel, randomized, Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of S-1/cisplatin versus 5-FU/cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer previously untreated with chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to S-1/cisplatin (experimental arm) or 5-FU/cisplatin (control arm). Patients will be stratified by number of metastatic sites (one vs. more than one), locally advanced or metastatic disease, prior adjuvant therapy (yes or no), measurable or non-measurable disease, and center.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment in this study: Has given written informed consent Has histologically confirmed, unresectable, locally advanced (Stage IV) or metastatic gastric cancer, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction Has measurable or evaluable but nonmeasurable disease, defined as follows: Measurable Disease Patients with measurable disease as defined by RECIST criteria, i.e., the presence of at least one measurable lesion. A measurable lesion is one that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter &gt;_ 20 mm using conventional techniques or &gt;_ 10 mm using spiral Computed Tomography (CT)scan. Locally recurrent disease (other than primary) is accepted if there is at least one measurable lesion (i.e. peritoneal mass, lymph node, etc.) Evaluable but Nonmeasurable Disease Patients with all lesions below the limits defined above for measureable disease (i.e., longest diameter &lt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or &lt; 10 mm with spiral CT) excluding those patients with only a primary lesion and/or with only nonevaluable cancer such as bone metastases, ascites, pleural or pericardia effusions, lymphangitic carcinomatosis of the skin or lung, previously irradiated lesions not in progression, or peritoneal carcinomatosis &lt; 10 mm in diameter with conventional imaging techniques. No prior palliative chemotherapy is permitted. Adjuvant and /or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is permitted if more than 12 months have elapsed between the end of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy and first recurrence. This does not qualify as 1st line therapy. Is able to take medications orally Is &gt;_ 18 years of age Is at least 3 weeks from prior major surgery Is at least 4 weeks from prior radiotherapy Has a ECOG performance status 0 to 1 Has adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria: AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;_ 2.5 x ULN; if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying liver metastasis, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;_ 5 x ULN Total serum bilirubin of &lt;_ 1.5 x ULN Absolute granulocyte count of &gt;_ 1,500/mm (i.e. &gt;_ 1.5 x 10/L by International Units (IU) Platelet count &gt;_ 100,000/mm (IU: &gt;_ 100 x 10/L Hemoglobin value of &gt;_ 9.0 g/dL Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;_ 60 mL/min (CockcroftGault formula) Is willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests and other study procedures Exclude a patient from this study if he/she does not fulfill the inclusion criteria, or if any of the following conditions are observed: Has had a treatment with any of the following within the specified timeframe prior to study drug administration: Any prior palliative chemotherapy or any previous therapy for malignancy, including any chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy, within the past 5 years. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy within the past 12 months Concurrent treatment with any investigational anticancer agent Prior cisplatin as neoadjuvant and /or adjuvant chemotherapy with cumulative dose &gt; 300 mg/m &gt; 25% of marrowbearing bone radiated Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent or within 30 days from randomization Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study Has a serious illness or medical condition(s) including, but not limited to the following: Known brain or leptomeningeal metastases Uncontrolled ascites requiring drainage at least twice a week Other malignancies within the past 5 years, except adequately treated carcinomainsitu of the cervix or nonmelanoma skin cancer Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, severe/unstable angina, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV Chronic nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDSrelated illness Psychiatric disorder that may interfere with consent and/or protocol compliance Known neuropathy, Grade 2 or higher Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgement of the Investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study Is receiving concomitant treatment with drugs interacting with S1. The following drugs are prohibited because there may be an interaction with S1: Sorivudine, uracil, cimetidine, folinic acid, and dipyridamole (may enhance S1 activity) Allopurinol (may diminish S1 activity Phenytoin (S1 may enhance phenytoin activity) Flucytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent (may enhance S1 activity) Is receiving concomitant treatment with drugs interacting with 5FU: Sorivudine, uracil, cimetidine, folinic acid, and dipyridamole(may enhance 5FU activity) Allopurinol (may diminish 5FU activity) Phenytoin (5FU may enhance phenytoin activity) Is receiving concomitant treatment with drugs interacting with cisplatin: Phenytoin (cisplatin may diminish phenytoin activity) Aminoglycosides (should be avoided within 8 days after cisplatin administration) Ethyol (may diminish cisplatin activity Is a pregnant or lactating female Has known hypersensitivity to 5FU or cisplatin Patients with reproductive potential who refuse to use an adequate means of contraception (including male patients)</criteria>
