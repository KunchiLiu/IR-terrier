	<brief_summary>Thyroidectomy is an operation that is commonly performed. After an operation a pressure dressing by Hypafix is usually used due to the belief that it will help to reduce complications such as post-operative bleeding or haematoma. However, the practice is uncomfortable to patients and makes it hard to detect early haematomas. We carried out a prospective randomised study to study the role of pressure dressing after thyroid surgery by evaluating the amount of fluids collected in the operative bed by ultrasonography compared with normal dressing.</brief_summary>
