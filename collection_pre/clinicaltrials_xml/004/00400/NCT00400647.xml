	<brief_summary>This study will assess the quality of life in renal transplant recipients who require a reduced dose of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) because of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects and will also access the relationship between mycophenolic acid (MPA) dose in those patients receiving enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium formulation(EC-MPS). Patients will be evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks after study medicine conversion and then again at 12 weeks post-conversion.</brief_summary>
