	<brief_title>Maintenance Effect of Clobex Shampoo on Subjects With Moderate to Severe Scalp Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis is a chronic disease that affects the skin, the scalp and joints. Scalp psoriasis is very common and can have an important impact on people's life. Primary objective of scalp psoriasis treatments is to gain initial and rapid control of the disease process with a minimum of side-effects and improve patient quality of life. Still, one of the unmet needs of scalp psoriasis therapies is the maintenance of a long-term remission. For corticosteroids in particular, one of the drawbacks is the disease recurrences after cessation of the treatment. Therefore the establishment of a modified corticosteroid dosing regimen that would allow remission with minimal side-effects is suitable. The purpose of this study is to assess how long a patient can be successfully maintained in a good condition when using Clobex® shampoo only twice a week.</detailed_description>
