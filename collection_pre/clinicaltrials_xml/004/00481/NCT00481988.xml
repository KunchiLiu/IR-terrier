	<brief_title>Treating Depression With Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to learn about a brain stimulating procedure called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In tDCS therapy, two moistened sponges are applied to the forehead while a small amount of electric current flows between them. These electrodes are placed on the head so that the electricity will pass through a region in the brain that is believed to contribute to depression. This study is intended to test the theory that the electromagnetic field created by the current may affect this region of the brain in a way that may improve the symptoms of depression. This may affect brain activity and function.</detailed_description>
