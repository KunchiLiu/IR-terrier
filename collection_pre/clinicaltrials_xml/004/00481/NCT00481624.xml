	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find a better, more convenient way to improve anemia results by increasing the amount of medication given at 3 week intervals. Researchers want to know if giving a higher dose of Procrit® and intravenous (IV) iron once every 3 weeks would give better results in treating anemia without the need for more office visits.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Iron With Procrit in Advanced Lung Cancer Patients With Chemotherapy-Induced Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are more than 170,000 patients diagnosed with lung cancer in the United States each year and many will develop anemia (iron deficiency) during the course of treatment. Anemia is associated with poor quality of life and treatment delays for advanced lung cancer. The treatment of iron deficiency anemia is with iron. Iron is an essential mineral used in red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron is necessary to make hemoglobin, a key element in red blood cells. The FDA has approved Procrit® (epoetin alfa) to treat anemia in people with non-myeloid (bone marrow) malignancies. Procrit® is a man-made, injectable drug for treating anemia and it encourages red cell production. While the administration of intravenous iron therapy, injected into veins through an IV, did increase the response rate of Procrit® in a previous study, researchers want to find out the best amount of drug to use and the best time to administer Procrit®, along with ferric gluconate, (Ferrlecit®), added for lack of iron.</detailed_description>
