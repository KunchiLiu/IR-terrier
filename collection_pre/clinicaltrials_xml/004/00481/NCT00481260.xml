	<brief_summary>Hgb C is an hemoglobinopathy quite rare in Israel. The clinical status of patients that are diagnosed as homozygous to this disease is quite benign but not study in large groups. Also the characteristics of carriers and the incidence in northern Israel were a large arab population lives, was not study. The results of this study can be useful for screening purpose in a area were another hemoglobinopathies are frequent.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hgb C is an hemoglobinopathy quite rare in Israel. The clinical status of patients that are diagnosed as homozygous to this disease is quite benign but not study in large groups. Also the characteristics of carriers and the incidence in northern Israel were a large arab population lives, was not study. The results of this study can be useful for screening purpose in a area were another hemoglobinopathies are frequent. The study will record the clinical characteristics of the homozygous Hgb C patients and the hematology characteristics of all the heterozygous carriers detected in northern Israel</detailed_description>
