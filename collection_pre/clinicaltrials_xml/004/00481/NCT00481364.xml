	<brief_title>Atorvastatin Treatment to Attenuate the Progression of Cardiovascular Disease in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effects of statin treatment on coronary artery calcifications, carotid artery intima-media thickness, and endothelial functions have never been investigated in hemodialysis patients. Regarding inflammation, the present data in hemodialysis patients are derived from small studies with short follow-up. We postulate that atorvastatin would reduce progression of coronary calcification and carotid artery intima-media thickness, decrease inflammation, and improve endothelial function. In this prospective, controlled, randomized study, four hundred forty-six prevalent hemodialysis patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to atorvastatin (20 mg/day in first month; increased to 40 mg/day afterwards) and placebo arms (each arm consists of 223 patients), after completion of baseline investigations. Randomization will be performed with random permuted blocks and will be stratified according to dialysis center, age, sex, diabetic status, duration of dialysis, high flux dialyser use, and dialysate calcium level. Follow-up period will be twelve months. It is estimated that 446 patients would provide 90% power with a two-sided, alpha error rate of 5%, of detecting a significant difference between treatment arms. Dropout rate is expected to be 20%, not to be replaced.</detailed_description>
