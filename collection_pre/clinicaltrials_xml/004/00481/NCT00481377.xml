	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the role of ablation in appropriate ICD interventions reduction in patients with coronary artery disease. The group will consist of 200 patients with implanted ICD and appropriate intervention in the 3 months prior to enrollment. The patients will be randomized into ablation arm and conventional treatment. Number of appropriate ICD interventions is the primary endpoint of this study. All patients will have control follow-up visits every 3 months. The follow-up will be based on ICD memory.</brief_summary>
