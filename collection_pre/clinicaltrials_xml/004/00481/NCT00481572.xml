	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether: A)the continuous infusion ultra-low dose of terlipressin (1.3 micrograms/kg/h) is able to stabilize hemodynamic in patients with septic shock, reducing the risk of adverse effects related to the bolus dose.B)the continuous infusion ultra-low dose of terlipressin may be use in lieu of vasopressin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Forty-five septic shock patients requiring vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to be treated with either a) a continuous terlipressin infusion (1.3 µg•kg-1), b) vasopressin (0.03 U•min-1), or c) titrated norepinephrine (control; each n = 15). In both the terlipressin and vasopressin group, norepinephrine was additionally administered to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 65 and 75 mmHg, if necessary. Data from right heart catheterization, thermo-dye dilution catheter, gastric tonometry as well as data from organ function, cytokines concentrations, were obtained at baseline and after 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours.</detailed_description>
