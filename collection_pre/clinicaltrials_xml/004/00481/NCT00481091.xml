	<brief_summary>The Phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of ABT-263 under two different dosing schedules with the objective of defining the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose. The Phase 2a portion of the study will evaluate ABT-263 at the defined recommended Phase 2 dose to obtain additional safety information and a preliminary assessment of efficacy. The Extension Study portion will allow active subjects to continue to receive ABT-263 for up to 7 years after the last subject transitions with less frequent study evaluations.</brief_summary>
