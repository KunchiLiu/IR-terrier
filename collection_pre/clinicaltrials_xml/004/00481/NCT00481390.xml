	<brief_summary>This study is a cross-sectional observational study to evaluate the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 in the European area and in major European ethnotypes. Any HIV-1 infected patient will be eligible for this study including treatment na√Øve and experienced patients, as well as patients previously tested for HLA-B*5701. Patients will be approached during a standard clinic visit, and will be consented prior to any study specific procedure. They will be asked to provide a tissue sample (cheek cells and blood sample) which will be used to assess HLA-B*5701 status by local and central laboratories. In selected sites patients may be asked to provide an additional blood sample. This sample will be used to develop and validate different methodologies for assessing HLA-B*5701 status.</brief_summary>
