	<brief_title>Conversion Study From Cyclosporine to FK506MR Based Immunosuppression in Kidney Transplant Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, single-arm, open phase IIIb, conversion study where a Cyclosporine A-based immunosuppressive regimen is replaced by the administration of tacrolimus modified release formulation, MR4, once daily (morning dosing only) in stable renal transplant subjects. The initial recommended dose of MR4 is 0.1 mg/kg/day. Twenty-four weeks of treatment on MR4-based immunosuppressive regimen is considered to be an appropriate study duration in order to assess the response in subjects suffering from one or more known cyclosporine side effects, hypertrichosis/hirsutism, gingival hyperplasia, hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension. Stable, adult kidney transplant recipients (≥ 12 months post transplant) who are currently treated with cyclosporine and who meet the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
