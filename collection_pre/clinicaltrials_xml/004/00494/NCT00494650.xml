	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in People With Additional Serious Mental Illnesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after experiencing a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. People with PTSD have persistent frightening thoughts and memories about the traumatic event and may experience sleep problems, feel detached or numb, or be easily startled. Studies have shown that PTSD occurs at high rates among people with serious mental illnesses (SMI), such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depression. Research has also proven that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective PTSD treatment for caucasians living in rural areas when it is administered by a PhD-level clinician. It is not clear, however, how successful this treatment will be when it is delivered to a minority population by frontline mental health clinicians in an urban setting. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of tailored CBT in treating PTSD in people with additional mental illnesses who live in urban areas of New Jersey. Participants in this 4- to 5-month open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive either brief PTSD treatment or CBT. Participants assigned to brief PTSD treatment will have three meetings with a therapist per week. Participants will learn about PTSD, how symptoms may be affecting their lives, and a technique for reducing anxiety associated with PTSD. Participants assigned to CBT will attend 12 to 16 counseling sessions per week or every other week. Participants will learn about PTSD and ways to decrease anxiety associated with PTSD by completing homework assignments and practicing skills learned in counseling sessions. Outcomes will be assessed for all participants through interviews that will occur immediately post-treatment, 6 months post-treatment, and 1 year post-treatment.
