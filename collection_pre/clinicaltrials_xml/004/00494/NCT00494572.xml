	<brief_title>Montelukast With Status Asthmaticus, Ages 6-18</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study of montelukast efficacy in addition to standard treatment of status asthmaticus in children who are in the PICU. The study will be stratified in 2 groups: children 6-12 years of age and adolescents 13-18 years of age. Children who meet eligibility requirements will be randomized to receive a rapid-dissolving oral dose of montelukast or placebo. Participants will be given a physical exam, have FEV1 measurements and clinical asthma scores recorded pre- and post- completion of a nebulized albuterol treatment of 0.1 mg/kg/dose (min 2.5 mg/dose). Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected prior to study drug administration and at predetermined time intervals to determine the plasma level of montelukast. In addition, a blood sample will be obtained for genetic study of polymorphisms of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C9.</detailed_description>

Participant must have a history of reactive airway disease (RAD) or asthma and must currently be admitted for an acute exacerbation of RAD or asthma. Primary physician must believe that patient would benefit from improved bronchodilation and improvement in clinical asthma severity score. Participant must have received standard therapy for status asthmaticus: 1. Oxygen as needed 2. &gt;3 nebulized albuterol treatments of at least 2.5mg/dose 3. Methylprednisolone or prednisone loading dose of 2mg/kg 4. Ongoing methylprednisolone therapy @ 0.5mg/kg every 6 hours Participant must have received steroids at least 6 hours prior to their inclusion, and must still require nebulized albuterol at least every 2 hours, as determined by PICU team in accordance with the PICU standard for evaluating and treating patients with RAD or asthma exacerbations. Participant must have an indwelling catheter in place from which to obtain blood specimens. Catheter may be peripheral or central, arterial or venous. Known hypersensitivity to montelukast Chronic lung disease other than RAD or asthma Known renal disease Known hepatic disease Cardiac or pulmonary congenital anomalies Known immunologic disorders other than allergy and atopy Other explanations for respiratory distress Use of leukotriene modifiers within 2 weeks of the acute presentation Pregnant females Intubated patients Inability to participate in portable spirometry for FEV1 measurement</criteria>
