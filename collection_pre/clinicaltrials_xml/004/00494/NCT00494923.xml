The primary aim is the evaluation of diagnostic and prognostic validity of morphometrical, sensory and hemodynamical diagnostic procedures. No therapeutic studies are performed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Diagnosis, Pathogenesis and Progression of Open Angle Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: Detection of onset and progression of structural and functional damage due to glaucoma. Determination of rate and amount of progressive change due to glaucoma. Characterisation of the relationship between structural and functional change over time. Evaluation of predictive factors for the development and progression of glaucoma.</detailed_description>
