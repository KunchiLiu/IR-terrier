	<brief_title>Oxygen Toxicity in the Resuscitation in Extremely Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized trial enrolling premature infants of less than 28 weeks gestation. Patients are randomly assigned to become resuscitation with an initial oxygen inspiratory fraction (FiO2) of 30% or 90%. Main objective is to reach a target saturation of 85% at 15 min of life. Immediately after birth pre-and-postductal pulse oximeters are set and oxygen saturation (SpO2) continuously monitored and registered as long as the patient requires oxygen supplementation. FiO2 is stepwise adjusted (increased or decreased 10%) every 90 sec according to heart rate, SpO2 and responsiveness. Blood samples are drawn from umbilical cord and at day 1, 2 and 7 from peripheral vein to determine oxidative stress markers (GSH, GSSG), angiogenic factors (VEGF, VEGF receptors, Angiopoietin), pro-inflammatory markers (IL8, TNF alfa) and pro-apoptotic markers (Fas Ligand; Cytochrome C). Urine is collected every day during the first week of life to determine oxidative stress markers (8-oxo-dG; O-tyrosine; F2 isoprostanes; Isofurans). Babies are followed in the NICU and clinical condition recorded. Serial examinations for ROP and Auditory evoked potentials will be performed. Neurodevelopmental outcome is evaluated at 2 years of postnatal life. Main outcome: Achievement of a target saturation of 85% at 15 min of life. Secondary outcomes: acute complications during delivery; chronic complications (BPD, ROP, IPVH); mortality in the neonatal period.</detailed_description>
