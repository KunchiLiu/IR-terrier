	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperglycemia is is associated with more complications and higher morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Therefore, strict glycemic control with a target blood glucose level between 80 and 110 mg/dl is recommended. Intensive insulin therapy requires continuous intravenous insulin infusion according to an algorithm and frequent blood glucose measurements. Implementation of intensive insulin therapy increases workload for both physicians and especially for nurses. Continuous glucose measurement would facilitate blood glucose control in critically ill patients. Numerous studies have shown accuracy of the subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring derived glucose values compared to blood glucose measurements in diabetics. Studies evaluating the subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring in an inpatient-population especially in an ICU-setting are rare. Therefore the aim of this study is the prospective evaluation of continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring in critically ill patients with circulatory shock demanding norepinephrine therapy as compared to critically ill patients without shock.</detailed_description>
