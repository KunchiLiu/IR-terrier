	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two types of group counseling for cancer patients: Meaning-Centered counseling and Supportive counseling. Many cancer patients seek counseling to help with the emotional burden of their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. "Meaning-Centered" group counseling is intended to teach cancer patients how to maintain or even increase a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives, despite cancer. "Supportive" group counseling is intended to help you cope with cancer by giving you a place to express your feelings and get support from other cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to compare the benefits of these two types of counseling approaches for cancer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of Group Psychotherapy Interventions for Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy (MCGP) versus a standardized Supportive Group Psychotherapy (SGP) in reducing psychological distress (depression and anxiety), end-of-life despair (hopelessness, desire for hastened death, and suicidal ideation), and improving spiritual well-being and overall quality of life in a sample patients with advanced cancer. To assess the relative impact of Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy on different aspects of spiritual well-being (e.g., a sense of meaning and purpose versus spirituality linked to religious faith). To examine clinical and demographic variables that may correspond to differential responses to Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy (e.g., potential mediating and moderating influences such as illness severity, religion and religiosity, level of education, race/ethnicity, level of pre-intervention social support, presence of pain and physical symptom burden).</detailed_description>

All patients with stage IV solid tumor cancers; or Stage III solid tumor cancers(excluding breast and prostate cancer) who are receiving ambulatory care at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center. Able to communicate with an English speaking therapist Able to comprehend English to complete study assessments Significant psychiatric disturbance sufficient, in the investigator's judgment, to preclude participation in a groupformat intervention (i.e., acute psychiatric symptoms which require individual treatment). Presence of cognitive impairment disorder (i.e., delirium or dementia) sufficient, in the investigator's judgment, to preclude meaningful informed consent and/or data collection. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) will be used as a cognitive screening tool. Patients with MMSE scores below 20 will be excluded. Karnofsky Performance Rating Scale score below 50 or physical limitations or illness severity sufficient to preclude participation in outpatient group psychotherapy.</criteria>
