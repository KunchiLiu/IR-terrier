	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to confirm the efficacy of NB UVB phototherapy in alleviating uremic pruritus and investigate the association between improvement of pruritus and change of serum parameters, including routine biochemical data, immune profile and dialysis adequacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Phototherapy on Pruritus of Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We would conduct a randomized study to evaluate the effect of NB UVB therapy on uremic pruritus. The intensity of pruritus will be evaluated using visual analog scale (VAS) score (0 [no pruritus]-10 most severe pruritus]) and a detailed questionnaire assessing various characteristics of pruritus at baseline . The patients with the intensity of pruritus VAS score more than 5 will be randomized to narrow band UVB and control group. Phototherapy was administered to the whole body surface 2-3 sessions per week for total 18 sessions in a UV irradiation cubicle. The dose increased from 210mJ/cm2 .Doses were increased by 10 % at every session. The control group received time-matched exposures to long-wave ultraviolet light. The investigator will determine the pruritic intensity at baseline every 3 sessions by VAS score and by detailed questionnaire at baseline and after 18 sessions. The blood sample will also be collected at baseline and after treatment to determine factors associated with improvement.</detailed_description>
