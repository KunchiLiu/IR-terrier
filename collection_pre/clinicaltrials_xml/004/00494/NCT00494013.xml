	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and safety of insulin lispro protamine suspension (ILPS) as compared to insulin detemir as basal insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes. A gatekeeper strategy will be employed for sequentially testing the secondary objectives.</brief_summary>
