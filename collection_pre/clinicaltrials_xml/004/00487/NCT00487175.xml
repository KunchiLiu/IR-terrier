	<brief_summary>Tramadol is a largely used analgesic drug. Its role however on sensitization as occurs for example in neuropathic pain is not very well known. This protocol aims therefore at studying the effect of tramadol in a human pain model with sensitization induced by a cold stimulus, using evoked potentials to elucidate how pain is modified when tramadol is administered.</brief_summary>
