	<brief_title>Magnetic Anastomosis Device Relief of Malignant Gastric Outlet Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical treatments for malignant gastric outlet obstructions carry substantial risks and are associated with postoperative morbidity. External compression from advancing tumor or tissue growth through the stent can cause stenosis or re-obstruction. In these patients, the creation of a patent fistula that allows gastric emptying may significantly improve palliation. Minimally invasive techniques that carry no greater risks than enteral stenting may provide a viable palliative treatment. The primary objectives are safety, and successful creation of a gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Secondary objectives are successful resumption or improvement in the ability to tolerate PO feeding, rate of stent migration, and duration of stent and anastomosis patency.</detailed_description>
