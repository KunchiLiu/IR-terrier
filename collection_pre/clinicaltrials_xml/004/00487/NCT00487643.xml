	<brief_summary>Purpose: to build a library of normal tear lacritin values by collecting tears from normal adult human subjects and to develop a non-invasive clinical assay for lacritin. Such an assay will provide more sensitive indicators of eye disease for clinicians and determine if a particular therapy, such as recombinant lacritin drops, is of benefit.</brief_summary>
