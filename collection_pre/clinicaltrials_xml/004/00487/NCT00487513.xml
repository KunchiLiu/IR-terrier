	<brief_summary>In order to learn more about follicular lymphoma and anti-cancer vaccines, we are collecting samples from people with this diagnosis. We then hope to make a vaccine from this tissue to help the immune system destroy cancer cells. We plan on keeping samples in the tissue bank indefinitely.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Procurement of Follicular B Cell Lymphoma Cells for the Purpose of Possible Use in Future Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The following tests and procedures will be performed: Approximately 50cc of peripheral blood will be drawn and stored in the tissue bank; patients who have follicular lymphoma cells circulating in the blood will have about 40cc's of blood drawn and stored for processing; patients undergoing a lymph node biopsy will have samples of the biopsy stored; patients having fluid drained from the abdomen or from around the lung will have some of their fluid saved to cell collection and processing; patients undergoing a bone marrow biopsy will have some of the sample stored for cell collection and processing.</detailed_description>
