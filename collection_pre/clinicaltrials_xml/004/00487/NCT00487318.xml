	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: addition of fluvastatin will increase the cure rate of standard anti-HCV therapy. Summary: This trial is limited to veterans in Oklahoma who qualify for care with the Veterans Administration. It is a randomized control format including genotypes 1 and 3. There will also be pilot arms for HCV carriers who present for screening already on a statin, who will be allowed to stay on their current statin or switched to another statin. In all ways, standard therapy as noted on pegylated interferon and ribavirin will be given per FDA package insert.</brief_summary>
