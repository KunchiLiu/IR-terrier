	<brief_title>Effect of Different Doses of Budesonide on Markers of Bone Metabolism in Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease of respiratory tract, the largest frequency is noticed in children. iGCS are the basic group of drugs in asthma, because of inflammatory character of disease. All iGCS are absorbed to the systemic circulation (small amounts) despite of local exposition in lungs and possess systemic effects.
