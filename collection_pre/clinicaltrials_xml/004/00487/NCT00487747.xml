	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of PEGASYS in patients with chronic hepatitis B who are either treatment-naive, or who have failed lamivudine- or interferon-treatment in the past. All patients will receive PEGASYS, 180 micrograms s.c. weekly for 48 weeks, followed by 48 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
