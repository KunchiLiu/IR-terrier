	<brief_summary>- Measure the mid-facial volumetric correction from SCULPTRA treatment, using three-dimensional digital surface imaging - Determine the mean change from baseline in facial contour deficiency as measured by the Dermik Nasolabial Photo-numeric Scale - Correlate volumetric correction with clinical improvement as measured by the Dermik Nasolabial Photo-numeric Scale - Correlate the mean volumetric change in mid-facial treatment area with the amount of product used - Evaluate subject and investigator global assessment of improvement and subject treatment satisfaction at the end of treatment - Obtain photographs pre- and post-treatment for the purpose of providing a subject visual aid during the course of treatment - Collect safety data</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must sign a statement of informed consent. Subjects must be 1875 years of age, of any race or gender. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to the first treatment with the product and must use an acceptable form of birth control throughout the study (e.g., oral/systemic contraceptives, an intrauterine device (IUD) or Norplant starting at least 28 days prior to study entry and throughout the study). Subjects must display signs of facial contour deficiencies in the area of the nasolabial folds [nasolabial fold scores greater than or equal to 2 (bilaterally) on the Dermik Nasolabial Photonumeric Scale. Subjects must be a suitable candidate for SCULPTRA treatment. Subjects must be able to understand the requirements of the study and be willing to comply with the study requirements Subjects with an allergy to any of the constituents of the product. Subjects with a known history of keloids or bleeding disorders. Subjects of childbearing potential who are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant within the study timeframe, or who are nursing. Subjects with significant facial hair (e.g. mustaches, beards, etc.) Subjects with an active inflammatory process or infection in the area to be treated (skin eruptions such as cysts, pimples, rashes, cancerous/precancerous lesions, or any other active skin disease in the treatment area). Subjects who plan to undergo major facial surgery [e.g., rhinoplasty (with or without implant), facelift, congenital defect repair, etc.] during the course of the study. Subjects who have used or plan to use exclusionary medications/treatments.</criteria>
