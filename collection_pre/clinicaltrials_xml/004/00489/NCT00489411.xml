	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Duloxetine may lessen peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether duloxetine is more effective than a placebo in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying duloxetine to see how well it works compared with a placebo in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy in patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duloxetine in Treating Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by Chemotherapy in Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of duloxetine hydrochloride in cancer patients with painful chemotherapy-induced (taxane or platinum agent) peripheral neuropathy. Secondary - Determine the influence of this drug on peripheral neuropathy-related functional status and quality of life of these patients. - Describe the differences in duloxetine hydrochloride efficacy when used to treat pain caused by chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy based on the neurotoxic drug and class. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Patients are stratified according to prior neurotoxic agent (paclitaxel vs oxaliplatin vs other taxane agents without paclitaxel vs platinum agents [cisplatin] without oxaliplatin) and high risk for developing painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (no vs yes). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral duloxetine hydrochloride once or twice daily in weeks 1-6. After a 1-week rest period, patients cross over to receive an oral placebo once or twice daily in weeks 8-13. - Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo once or twice daily in weeks 1-6. After a 1-week rest period, patients cross over to receive oral duloxetine hydrochloride once or twice daily in weeks 8-13. Patients complete pain and quality of life questionnaires, including the BPI-SF once weekly and FACT/GOG-NTX and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires, in weeks 1, 6, 8, and 13. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of cancer CNS malignancy allowed with the exception of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis Must have painful sensory chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) resulting from prior treatment with singleagent taxane or platinum agents (paclitaxel, docetaxel, nabpaclitaxel, oxaliplatin, cisplatin) (may not have received drugs from both classes) CIPN &gt; grade 1 as measured by NCICTCAE v 4.0 Average neuropathic pain score ≥ 4 Patients with the following illnesses known to cause peripheral neuropathy are eligible, provided they have no evidence of neuropathy from these illnesses: Diabetes mellitus Peripheral vascular disease HIV infection Significant degenerative or familial neurologic disorder known to cause peripheral neuropathy No clinical or subclinical neuropathy from nerve compression injuries (i.e., carpal tunnel syndrome, brachial plexopathy, spinal stenosis, or spinal nerve root compression) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: AST ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal Total bilirubin ≤ normal Creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min Not pregnant or nursing Able to take oral or enteral medication No history of seizure disorder No diagnosis of ethanol addiction or dependence within the past 10 years No history of narrowangle glaucoma None of the following: History of suicidal thoughts Symptoms of or history of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, or a major depression Serious eating disorder such as bulimia or anorexia where electrolyte imbalance is likely PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: At least 3 months since prior and no concurrent taxane or platinum agent At least 14 days since prior and no concurrent monoamine oxidase inhibitors or other antidepressants No other prior or concurrent neurotoxic drugs (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, cytarabine, thalidomide, bortezomib, carboplatin, or procarbazine) No concurrent anticonvulsants No concurrent B or E vitamin supplementation in doses greater than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) Centrum (standard formula) and OneADay "essential" formula which contain 100% RDA for vitamins B6, E, and B12 allowed Other multivitamins allowed provided they contain no more than 100% RDA of B vitamins and vitamin E No concurrent treatment (pharmacologic) for depression</criteria>
