	<brief_summary>Hospitalization is a traumatic event for the patient and his family at any age nevertheless in the older age. One of its consequences is the difficulty to resume previous activity of daily living especially in older (over 75 years) patients. Sub acute completes the acute phase of the hospitalization and its main purpose is to improve the patient's functional status and quality of life. There are not enough clinical trails to proof this assumption. The purpose of our study is to compare the outcome of acute and sub-acute hospitalization programs by a randomized controlled prospective intervention study. Outcome measures will comprise activity of daily living, functional status, re-hospitalization and utilization of medical services following the hospitalization.Study hypothesis is that sub-acute hospitalization will improve outcomes and will cost less.</brief_summary>
