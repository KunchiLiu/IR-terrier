	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies against all the vaccine antigens 1, 3, 5 and 9 years after an initial vaccination with Tdap, and also to assess immunogenicity and safety of another dose of Boostrix, administered in this study. This protocol posting deals with objectives and outcome measures of the extension phase. The objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00346073).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persistence Study of GSK Biologicals' Tdap Vaccine 1, 3, 5 and 9 Years Following Administration as an Initial Single Dose in Healthy Young Adults and to Evaluate the Immunogenicity and Safety of Boostrix as a Second Dose of Tdap, When Administered at Year 9</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects were previously vaccinated with either Boostrix or a control Tdap vaccine (Sanofi Pasteurs' Adacel) in study NCT00346073. Only subjects who were part of the primary study will be invited to participate in this study. All subjects will receive a single dose of Boostrix at Visit 6 (Day 0) and subjects will be observed till Visit 7 (Day 30) for safety in terms of solicited adverse events (during 4 days post vaccination), unsolicited adverse events (during 31 days post vaccination) and serious adverse event (during the trial period). A blood sample will be collected from all subjects before vaccination (Visit 6) and one month after vaccination (Visit 7) for antibodies estimation. This summary has been updated following Protocol amendment 1 dated 09 November 2010, amendment 2 dated 18 February 2014, and amendment 3 dated 10 December 2014. The protocol was amended first due to the following reasons: 1. The maximum window period allowed for the return of subjects for the Year 5 and Year 10 follow-up visits (Visit 5 and Visit 6) was extended from ± 5 weeks to ± 8 weeks. 2. The contact details for reporting of SAEs were clarified. 3. Text pertaining to the reporting of spontaneous abortion was removed from the protocol. 4. The number of attempts to contact subjects who did not return for scheduled persistence visits was clarified. The main purpose of protocol amendment 2 is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Boostrix as a second dose of Tdap vaccine when administered 8 years after an initial dose of Tdap. The Year 10 time point for evaluation of persistence has been cancelled because it is no longer feasible to conduct after a second dose of Tdap vaccine has been administered at Year 8. The purpose of amendment 3 is to add co-primary objective to demonstrate that the immune response elicited by a second dose of Tdap vaccine, Boostrix (Boostrix group and Adacel group) is non-inferior to the immune response elicited by a first dose of Tdap vaccine (Control group), with respect to booster response against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (PT, FHA and PRN) antigens, one month following vaccination according to CBER's input. Accordingly, the study start has been pushed to Year 9 and this is reflected throughout the document.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Persistence followup phase up to Year 9 time point: The following criteria are applicable to subjects who refuse vaccination at Year 8 time point: All subjects who received study vaccination (Boostrix or Adacel) in study NCT00346073 will be considered eligible to participate in this study. Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to each study time point. Vaccination phase at Year 9 applicable for subjects in Boostrix and Adacel groups only: The following criterion is applicable to subjects willing to consent to vaccination at Year 9 time point in the Boostrix and Adacel groups: • All subjects who received study vaccination (Boostrix or Adacel) in study NCT00346073 will be considered eligible to participate in this study. Vaccination phase at Year 9 applicable for subjects in the Control group only: The following criterion is applicable to subjects willing to consent to vaccination at Year 9 time point in the Control group only: • Subjects within the age range of 2873 years will be considered eligible to participate in this study in the Control group. Vaccination phase at Year 9 applicable for ALL subjects (Control, Boostrix and Adacel groups): The following criteria are applicable to subjects willing to consent to vaccination at Year 9 time point in the Boostrix, Adacel and Control groups: All subjects must satisfy the following criteria at study entry at Year 9 time point: Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits). Written informed consent obtained from the subject for vaccination at Year 9 time point. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of child bearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception for 1 month after completion of the vaccine dose The following criteria should be checked at the time of Year 9 vaccination time point. If any criteria is applicable, the subject must not be vaccinated in the study: For subjects in Boostrix and Adacel groups: • Administration of Tdap vaccine since the last dose received in the study NCT00346073. For subjects in the Control group: • Administration of Tdap (Boostrix or Adacel) vaccine at any time prior to the administration of Boostrix vaccine in this study. For ALL subjects (Control, Boostrix and Adacel groups): Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period, 31 days (Day 030). Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to Visit 6 (prevacc). Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after the dose of vaccine, with the exception of inactivated Influenza vaccine which is allowed throughout the study period, 31 days (Day 030). Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product. Hypersensitivity to latex. History of diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis diseases. Severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) after previous administration of any tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or pertussisantigen containing vaccines, or any component of Boostrix. History of any neurological disorders or seizures.
