	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to estimate the tolerability and safety of 2 doses of teriflunomide administered once daily for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, in patients with multiple sclerosis [MS] with relapses who were on a stable dose of interferon-β [IFN-β]. Secondary objectives were: - to estimate the effects of the 2 doses of teriflunomide, compared to placebo, in combination with a stable dose of IFN-β on Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] parameters, relapse rate and patient-reported fatigue; - to perform pharmacokinetic analyses of the 2 doses of teriflunomide in combination with a stable dose of IFN-β.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Teriflunomide as Adjunctive Therapy to Interferon-beta in Subjects With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study period per participant was approximatively 44 weeks broken down as follows: - Screening period up to 4 weeks, - 24-week double-blind treatment period*, - 16-week post-treatment elimination follow-up period. '*' participants successfully completing the week 24 visit were offered the opportunity to enter the optional long-term extension study LTS6047 - NCT00811395.</detailed_description>
