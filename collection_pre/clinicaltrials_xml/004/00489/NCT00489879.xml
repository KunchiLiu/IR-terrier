	<brief_title>Management of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension Using Mobile Health Care System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes care is facilitated by a patient's being engaged in a self-management program with the advice and counsel of physicians, but many diabetic patients can not receive the continous monitoing and advice from his physician in their every day life. It is very difficult to keep up life style modification in their real life. Few studies have examined the effects of cellular phone based intervention that provide an interactive component daily. Our goal is to test the hypothesis that diabetes and hypertension management using cellular phone based health care system would result in significant improvement of blood glucose and blood pressure level.</detailed_description>
