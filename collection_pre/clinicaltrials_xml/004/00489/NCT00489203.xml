	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Beclomethasone dipropionate may be effective in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease in patients undergoing a stem cell transplant for hematologic cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well beclomethasone dipropionate works in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease in patients undergoing a donor stem cell transplant for hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of oral BDP for prevention of acute GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with myeloablative conditioning regimens. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive oral beclomethasone dipropionate 4 times daily beginning at the start of the conditioning regimen and continuing through day 75 post-transplant. Patients also receive a standard immunosuppressive regimen comprising tacrolimus and methotrexate post-transplant. ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily beginning at the start of the conditioning regimen and continuing through day 75 post-transplant. Patients also receive a standard immunosuppressive regimen comprising tacrolimus and methotrexate post-transplant. In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
