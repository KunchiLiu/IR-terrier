	<brief_title>ProAlgaZyme Novel Algae Infusion: Applications in Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome, a set of symptoms strongly associated with increased risk for both cardiovascular disease and diabetes, is generally linked to obesity and has become a serious problem in many industrialized countries. Agents that aid in weight loss or help to normalize blood lipids or inflammation may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome and therefore, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This study is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, to evaluate the effects of ProAlgaZyme (4 fl. oz. daily) on metabolic syndrome and markers of cardiovascular health including blood lipids, inflammatory markers and anthropometric measurements. Comparisons: ProAlgaZyme vs. placebo [Time frame: 10 weeks]</detailed_description>
