	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of protected early weightbearing (PEWB) compared to non-weightbearing (NWB) after surgery for an Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) on health related quality of life (HRQL) in the initial six week period after surgery, functional recovery over time, return to work and activity and complications. We hypothesized that PEWB following ATR repair would result in: i) improved HRQL in the initial postoperative period, ii), a quicker recovery of HRQL, strength and endurance, iii) earlier return to work and sport, and iv) no increase in complications, such as re-rupture compared to NWB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Protected Early Weightbearing Versus Non-Weightbearing After Surgery for Achilles Tendon Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) is commonly treated with open surgical repair. Following surgical repair, there are a variety of protocols, ranging from complete immobilization to immediate postoperative mobilization with early weightbearing. However, no clear consensus regarding the optimal postoperative rehabilitation protocol for ATRs exists. Early rehabilitation after ATR has been shown to be beneficial in animal and human studies. Human prospective studies and randomized controlled trials have shown that early postoperative mobilization do not pose additional risks compared to cast immobilization, with a trend toward a reduction in lost work days and an earlier return to sport. However, these trials define early postoperative mobilization differently (i.e. use different combinations of weightbearing and range of motion). This makes it difficult to determine which factor in the early rehabilitation process plays an important role in optimizing recovery. An important component of early rehabilitation is weightbearing. Comparison: Patients weightbearing in the early rehabilitation period after surgical repair of the Achilles tendon compared to patients non-weightbearing after the surgical repair of the Achilles tendon repair. With the exception of weightbearing status, both groups performed the same rehabilitation program.</detailed_description>
