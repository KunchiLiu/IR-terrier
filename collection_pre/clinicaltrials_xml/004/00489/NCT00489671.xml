	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Measuring cadmium levels in urine samples from patients with chronic pancreatitis may help doctors predict which patients may develop pancreatic cancer. It may also help the study of cancer in the future. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying urine cadmium levels in predicting pancreatic cancer risk in patients with chronic pancreatitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urine Cadmium Levels in Predicting Pancreatic Cancer Risk in Patients With Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Obtain urine samples and questionnaire data on cadmium exposure in patients with chronic pancreatitis. - Analyze these data to determine risk of pancreatic cancer using urine cadmium levels. Secondary - Analyze these data in conjunction with data on serum CA 19-9, to determine whether urinary cadmium has clinical utility in predicting pancreatic cancer. - Determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the cadmium test alone, CA 19-9 alone, and both tests together. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients complete a questionnaire over approximately 20 minutes on lifetime exposure to cadmium, including dietary, occupational, and recreational exposure, smoking history, and residence. Patients also provide a urine sample that is analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Serum CA 19-9 levels are obtained from medical record if available.</detailed_description>
