	<brief_title>Phase I Study to Investigate the Alcohol Interaction of SK3530</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was a randomized, open, single-dose, three-treatment, three-period, three-sequence, crossover study in which subjects were received, in random order, SK3530 100mg alone, 0.5g/Kg of alcohol alone, and SK3530 plus alcohol together. There was a minimum of a 7 day washout period between treatments. The alcohol was diluted to 240 mL with water. The contents were drunk in 1 minutes or less. For SK3530 and metabolite measurement, plasma samples were collected at pre-scheduled time and the safety was monitored all through the study.</detailed_description>
