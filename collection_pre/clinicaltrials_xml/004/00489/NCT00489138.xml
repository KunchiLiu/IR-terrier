	<brief_summary>Goal of study: To assess the tissular and plasma kinetics of ertapenem; To determine the optimal dosages in the patients according to norepinephrine administration: - to assess muscular diffusion of free form of ertapenem after administration to mechanically ventilated patients requiring such a treatment. The patients are included in the groups "with norepinephrine" or "without norepinephrine" according to their hemodynamic status. - to assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of ertapenem in mechanically ventilated patients treated or not by norepinephrine. Open-label, prospective study performed in a single ICU (16 beds) of a tertiary hospital (700 beds).</brief_summary>
