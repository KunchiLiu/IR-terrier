	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of certain anti-HIV medications on mitochondrial activity and fat cell death. This study will enroll participants from another study, ACTG A5202, who are on treatment regimens that do not include zidovudine, stavudine, or other thymidine-containing anti-HIV medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Effects of Non-Thymidine Analogue Anti-HIV Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to observe the effects of anti-HIV medication lacking thymidine on mitochondrial metabolism and adipocyte apoptosis (fat cell death). Changes in mitochondrial metabolism and increases in adipocyte apoptosis are associated with lipoatrophy. Lipoatrophy is a common condition characterized by loss of subcutaneous fat and can be caused by many anti-HIV medications. This study will examine the metabolic consequences of the use of thymidine analogue-sparing treatment regimens. This study will evaluate HIV infected patients who are enrolled in ACTG A5202, starting their first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-containing regimen. This regimen will include either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC), which are thymidine-sparing regimens. The changes in mitochondrial activity and fat cell death will be compared between participants taking thymidine-sparing regimens (TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC) and thymidine-containing regimens. This study will last for 96 weeks, with two study visits occurring at entry and another visit at Week 96. During each visit, a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and blood collection will occur, and a fat biopsy will be performed in the lower abdomen under local anesthetic.</detailed_description>
