	<brief_summary>Despite major advances in the treatment of chronic kidney disease, the age and sex matched mortality far exceeds that of the normal population. As in the normal population, the majority of deaths are related to cardiovascular disease. Mounting data point to the lethal synergy between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. This relation is present from early stages of chronic kidney disease on. Several uremic toxins have been demonstrated to play an important role in kidney disease related endothelial dysfunction. In peritoneal dialysis patients, data on the relation between uremic toxins, endothelial dysfunction and microparticles are lacking. The investigators hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction and uremic toxins are interrelated in peritoneal dialysis patients</brief_summary>
