	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help doctors learn how efaproxiral works in the brain and help plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is using MRI to evaluate the effect of efaproxiral on the brain in patients with recurrent or progressive glioma receiving treatment on clinical trial NABTT-9806.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI in Evaluating the Effect of Efaproxiral on the Brain in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioma Enrolled on Clinical Trial NABTT-9806</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether efaproxiral has a measurable effect on the brain as shown by T2 and/or T2* MRI in patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma enrolled on NABTT-9806. - Determine predicted oxygenation changes based on observed T2 MRI changes in these patients. - Determine the effects of this drug on T2 and T2* MRI relaxation times of normal areas of the brain in these patients. - Determine baseline oxygen extraction ratios in tumors of patients treated with this drug. - Determine whether administration of this drug reveals any new tumor- or non-tumor-related abnormalities on T2 and T2* MRI in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, pilot study. Patients receive efaproxiral and carmustine on clinical trial NABTT-9806. During any one course of treatment on that study, patients undergo MRI before oxygen administration (baseline), before efaproxiral infusion, and then every 5 minutes until 1 hour after efaproxiral and carmustine treatment. Data is evaluated for extent and intensity of T2/T2* changes and oxygen concentration changes in both abnormal and normal brain. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24 months.</detailed_description>
