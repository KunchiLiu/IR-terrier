	<brief_title>Vinorelbine (Oral) Plus Trastuzumab for 1st-line Treatment of HER2/Neu Overexpressing Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of vinorelbine and trastuzumab was demonstrated to be highly effective in several trials showing response rates in the range of 59-78%. This combination is characterized by good tolerability and can be applied for a prolonged period without the risk of major cumulative toxicity The availability of oral vinorelbine promises a further simplification of therapy. The present trial therefore investigates the safety and efficacy of a combined treatment with trastuzumab and oral vinorelbine.</detailed_description>
