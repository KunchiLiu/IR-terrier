	<brief_title>Immune Suppression Of Infants Treated With Steroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants with large or complicated hemangiomas are often treated systemically with oral steroids. The side effects of the drug on young infants has not been studied. The goal of this study is to clarify the degree of immune suppression in infants requiring therapy and to create guidelines for evaluation and prevention of infection in infants on oral steroids for hemangiomas. Prednisone will be started according to established standard of care. Visits will occur every four weeks for follow-up. There will be six blood draws from baseline to completion of study. Approximately up to 1 Â½ teaspoons per blood sample will be drawn to test the strength of the infant's immune system. Participation in this study will last up to 14 months or until stabilization of the hemangioma. Evaluation will occur 12 weeks after discontinuing the steroid for its long-term effects on the immune system.</detailed_description>
