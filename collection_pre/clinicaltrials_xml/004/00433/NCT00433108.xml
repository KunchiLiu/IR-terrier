	<brief_summary>A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel design trial of two doses of mitoquinone mesylate (MitoQ) and of placebo in patients with chronic Hepatitis C. MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that rapidly permeates the lipid bilayer and accumulates within mitochondria in organs such as liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle. There is strong evidence for increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage leading to apoptosis via caspase activation. Several studies have shown that MitoQ protects cells from apoptosis by acting as a caspase inhibitor and may be effective in reducing cell damage in liver disease. It is hypothesised that administration of MitoQ will lower raised ALT seen in patients with chronic Hepatitis C compared with placebo. Approximately 36 patients who have been unresponsive or not suitable for interferon-based therapy will be enrolled at one centre. Treatment duration will be 28 days with 28 days post-treatment follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of MitoQ for Raised Liver Enzymes Due to Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C is a viral liver infection that contributes significantly to the burden of chronic liver disease. It is currently estimated that over 170 million individuals (3% of the world's population)are infected. In New Zealand, an estimated 25,000 people are living with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and prevalence is predicted to increase by 50% over the next 10 years. HCV is primarily spread by blood-to-blood contact. The single most important risk factor for acquiring HCV is the use of injected recreational drugs, accounting for approximately 80% of infections. Unlike hepatitis B, no hepatitis C vaccine is currently available. In the absence of an effective vaccine the current treatment of choice is interferon and ribavirin. However, treatment of chronic HCV infection with interferon-alpha monotherapy does not achieve sustained virologic response. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative treatment strategies for patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to current antiviral therapy. The aim of this protocol is to compare two doses of a mitochondrial antioxidant treatment (MitoQ) and placebo for the treatment of patients with raised liver enzymes due to HCV infection. Approximately 36 eligible patients with chronic HCV infection will be randomised to receive one of two doses of MitoQ or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment duration will be 28 days with 28 days post-treatment follow-up.</detailed_description>
