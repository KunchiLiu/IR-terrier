	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the trial are: 1. To establish the safety and efficacy of the use of bivalirudin (+ bail-out GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) compared to the use of unfractionated heparin + GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing a primary angioplasty strategy. 2. To establish the safety and efficacy of the slow rate release paclitaxel-eluting TAXUS™ stent compared to an otherwise identical uncoated bare metal EXPRESS2™ stent.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective, 2 x 2 factorial single blind, randomized, multi-center trial of 3400 patients enrolled at up to 200 centers. Patients will be randomized 1:1 in the emergency room to a) anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin plus routine GP IIb/IIIa inhibition vs. b) bivalirudin and bail-out GP IIb/IIIa inhibition. Following angiography, patients with lesions eligible for stenting will then undergo a second randomization (3:1) to stent implantation with either a) a slow rate-release paclitaxel-eluting stent (TAXUS™) or b) an otherwise identical uncoated bare metal stent (EXPRESS2™).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have clinical symptoms consistent with AMI (e.g., angina or anginal equivalent)lasting &gt;20 minutes but &lt;12 hours in duration; STsegment elevation of &gt;1 mm in &gt;2 contiguous leads, or (presumably new) left bundle branch block, or true posterior MI with ST depression of &gt;1 mm in &gt;2 contiguous anterior leads; The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical and angiographic followup, and provides informed, written consent. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following medications: Heparin, pork or pork products Both abciximab and eptifibatide Aspirin Both Clopidogrel and Ticlopidine Bivalirudin Paclitaxel or Taxol The polymer components of the TAXUS™ stent (SIBS) Stainless steel and/or Contrast media; Prior administration of thrombolytic therapy, bivalirudin, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux for this admission. Patients receiving prior unfractionated heparin may be enrolled, and treated per randomization; Current use of coumadin; Systemic (intravenous) Paclitaxel or Taxol use within 12 months; Female of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative, who possibly plans to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study; History of bleeding diathesis or known coagulopathy (including heparininduced thrombocytopenia), or will refuse blood transfusions; History of intracerebral mass, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or hemorrhagic stroke; Stroke or transient ischemic attack within the past 6 months, or any permanent residual neurologic defect; Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the last 2 months, or major surgery within six weeks; Recent history or known current platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or Hgb &lt;10 g/dL; Extensive peripheral vascular disease, such that emergent angiography and intervention in the opinion of the investigator is likely to be difficult or complicated; An elective surgical procedure is planned that would necessitate interruption of thienopyridines during the first six months post enrollment; Noncardiac comorbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that may result in protocol noncompliance; Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational study, which have not completed the primary endpoint followup period; Previous enrollment in this trial; Patients who underwent coronary stent implantation within the past 30 days.</criteria>
