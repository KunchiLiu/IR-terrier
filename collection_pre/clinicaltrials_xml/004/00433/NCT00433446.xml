	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody works in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0354, Anti-IL-6 Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond to Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess the confirmed prostate-specific antigen response in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer treated with anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody. Secondary - Assess overall survival and progression-free survival of these patients. - Assess the objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial response) in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen. - Assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for up to 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
