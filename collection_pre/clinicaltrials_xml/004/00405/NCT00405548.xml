	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of cardiac hormone replacement with SQ (subcutaneous or under the skin) injection of BNP (brain natriuretic peptide, a hormone produced by the heart) on the pumping ability of the heart, kidney function and levels of different hormones in the blood in response to an intravenous salt solution.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior to initiation of the study, subjects will be stabilized for at least one week on a no added salt diet (120 milliequivalent (mEq) Na/Day) which will be maintained during the study. Participants in this study will be randomized to receive BNP or placebo (an inactive, saline shot). The participant will need to give themselves a shot in their stomach (similar to diabetics giving themselves insulin) twice a day for twelve weeks. The study requires a screening visit to determine eligibility and discuss the study. At this visit a blood draw for heart and liver function and a six minute walk will be done. There will also be two other outpatient visits and two inpatient stays, for 48 hours, in the Clinical Research Unit at St. Marys Hospital. During the two overnight stays, blood and urine samples will be done to get heart and kidney function as well as a research echocardiogram. An acute saline load (0.9% normal saline 1.25 ml/kg/min for 1 hour) will be given and blood and urine samples collected After enrollment, the study lasts for twelve weeks. It is planned to treat 2 subjects with active drug per each placebo subject to improved the precision of between group comparison.</detailed_description>
