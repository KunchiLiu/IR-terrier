	<brief_summary>Dyslipidemia and coronary heart disease (CHD) are increasingly recognized in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many antiretrovirals, including efavirenz (EFV), are associated with increases in serum lipids. The investigators investigated whether stopping EFV and replace EFV by nevirapine can reduce significantly Low-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol, while keeping virologic control of HIV.</brief_summary>
