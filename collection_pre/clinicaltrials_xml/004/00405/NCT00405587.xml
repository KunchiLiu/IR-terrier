	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this FIH study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of PLX4032 in patients with solid tumors. The secondary objective is to assess the pharmacodynamic activity in paired biopsy specimens obtained from patients with malignant melanoma who have the V600E BRAF oncogenic mutation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of PLX4032 in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Activating mutations of the BRAF gene have been observed in a variety of cancers, including 55-68% of malignant melanomas. In general, oncogenic mutations of BRAF correlate with a poor outcome. PLX4032 is a compound that selectively inhibits oncogenic B-Raf kinase. Two extension cohorts of patients with confirmed V600E mutations will be recruited, consisting of advanced melanoma and metastatic colorectal carcinoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Solid tumors confirmed histologically whose tumors are refractory to standard therapy, or for whom standard or curative therapy does not exist Patients from whom paired melanoma biopsies are planned must have a V600E+ BRAF mutation confirmed prior to the administration of PLX4032 Previous chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to starting PLX4032 therapy, and all associated toxicity must be resolved prior to administration of PLX4032 Patients in the Extension cohorts (melanoma or adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum) must have both a V600E+ BRAF mutation and measurable disease (by RECIST V 1.0 criteria) prior to the administration of PLX4032. All patients enrolled must provide archival or fresh melanoma tumor biopsy for confirmation of V600E+ BRAF mutation status by TaqMan assay ECOG performance status 0 or 1 Life expectancy â‰¥ 3 months Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function Brain metastases that are progressing or have been documented to be stable for less than 3 months, or for which systemic corticosteroids are required Investigational drug use within 28 days of the first dose of PLX4032 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption</criteria>
