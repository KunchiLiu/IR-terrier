	<brief_summary>Antiretroviral na誰ve patients with &lt;350 xE6/l CD4 cells and a HIV-viral load of &gt; 30.000 cop/ml are started on combivir 速 and Kaletra 速. When patients have reached an undetectable viral load of&lt; 50 cop/ml on two consecutive occasions at least at week 12, but no later than week 24, they are randomised in either continuation with Combivir/Kaletra or switch to Trizivir 速 twice daily one pill during 96 weeks. All patients randomised in the combivir/Kaletra arm are eligible to switch to Trizivir at any post randomisation visit when they reach predefined switch criteria for elevated levels of fasting glucose or lipids.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to compare the antiviral efficacy of an early switch from a boosted PI/2NRTI regimen to Trizivir (after undetectability of HIV-RNA has been achieved on 2 consecutive occasions) with uninterrupted use of the PI/2NRTI regimen for 96 weeks.</detailed_description>
