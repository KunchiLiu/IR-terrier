	<brief_summary>To determine a safe and effective doses of two biologic drugs, erlotinib and bevacizumab when used with chemotherapy and radiation therapy in advanced head and neck cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I of Biologics and Chemoradiation Therapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Locally advanced non-operative, Stage IV head and neck cancer has at best a guarded prognosis. Improvements in outcome have been achieved via the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is needed to optimize results, although recent data suggest a benefit from induction therapy as well. Nonetheless, despite high remission rates, most of these patients will suffer local-regional and/or distant recurrence from their disease. The proposed study will build upon the framework of chemoradiotherapy (induction plus concurrent) via the addition of a double biologic therapy. Specifically, the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib will be used, as has been studied in other types of cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Locally advanced Carcinoma (epithelial malignancy) of the head and neck. This may include nonsquamous carcinomas (e.g. parotid, thyroid, melanoma) in which a large portion of mucosa of the oral cavity and/or laryngopharynx is expected to be irradiated. Stage IV disease (T4Nany or TanyN23). "Oligometastatic" disease is allowable if it is asymptomatic. Measurable disease is not required; patients who have had surgical resection are eligible provided that it is felt that the likelihood of cure with conventional postoperative therapy is &lt;40% and provided that there will be at least 28 days from the date of surgery to the start of study therapy. Performance status 01. Creatinine &lt; or = 1.5 mg/dl. ANC &gt; or = 1,800 cells/mm3. Platelets &gt; or = 150,000 cells/mm3. Hemoglobin &gt; or = 10 g/dl (transfusion is acceptable if needed). SGOT and/or SGPT &lt; or = 2.5 times the upper institutional limit of normal. INR &lt; or = 2.0. Age &gt; or = 18 (informed consent). Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the Day 1, the first infusion of drug in this study) or planned participation in an experimental drug study other than this one. Poorly controlled blood pressure, defined as systolic bp &gt; 150 and/or diastolic bp &gt; 100 despite medication. Unstable angina. NY Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure. History of myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months. Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Presence of brain or spinal cord metastases. Major surgical procedure(s), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 (1st day of study treatment) and/or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study. Urine protein: Creatinine ratio &gt; or = 1.0 at screening.* Carotid artery exposure or other signs of impending carotid artery hemorrhage. History of abdominal fistula and/or gastrointestinal abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to enrollment. Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. Prior irradiation that would result in radiotherapy field "overlap." Requirement for high dose oral anticoagulation (i.e., goal INR &gt; 2.0). "Minidose" anticoagulation as may be used to assist in patency of central venous lines is acceptable. Subcutaneous Lowmolecular weight heparin is allowable. No known allergies to any of the drug therapies being used in this protocol. No pregnancy, lactation or inability to use medically acceptable birth control if of childbearing potential.</criteria>
