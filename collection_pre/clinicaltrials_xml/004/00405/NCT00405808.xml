	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To determine the effect of Rimonabant 20mg on the co-primary endpoint including Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels over a period of 12 months when prescribed with a mild hypocaloric diet in abdominally obese patients with impaired fasting blood glucose and with or without associated comorbidities. Main Secondary objectives: To determine the effect of 12 months Rimonabant treatment versus placebo on changes in waist circumference (WC), body weight, glycemic parameters and lipid parameters. To assess the safety of 12 months Rimonabant treatment versus placebo in these patients.</brief_summary>
