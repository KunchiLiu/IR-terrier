	<brief_summary>In this 2-year, multisite, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 607 children with vesicoureteral reflux that was diagnosed after a first or second febrile or symptomatic urinary tract infecton, we evaluated the efficacy of Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) prophylaxis in preventing recurrences (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes were renal scarring, treatment failure (a composite of recurrences and scarring), and antimicrobial resistance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to determine whether daily antimicrobial prophylaxis is superior to placebo in preventing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Eligibility criteria are described elsewhere. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment for 2 years with daily antimicrobial prophylaxis (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) or placebo. The study was designed to recruit 600 children (approximately 300 in each treatment group). The protocol encouraged prompt evaluation of children with UTI symptoms and early therapy of culture-proven UTIs. It was expected that approximately 10% of children will have to discontinue study medication due to allergic reactions. Assuming a 20% placebo event rate and 10% non-compliance rate, the study has 83% power to detect an absolute 10% event rate in the antimicrobial prophylaxis group. If the placebo event rate is instead 25%, power is 97% to detect an absolute 10% event rate in the treated group, even if non-compliance is as high as 15%. The primary analysis is intention-to-treat with missing outcome data analyzed as UTI. In addition to collecting follow-up data on urinary tract infections, renal scarring and antimicrobial resistance, quality of life, compliance, safety parameters, utilization of health resources, and change in VUR were assessed periodically throughout the study.</detailed_description>
