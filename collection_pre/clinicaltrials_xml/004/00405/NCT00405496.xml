	<brief_title>Study of Difluprednate Ophthalmic Emulsion in the Treatment of Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of 0.05% difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion in patients with endogenous anterior uveitis and to determine its clinical usefulness for treatment of this disease in the early phase of development, in comparison with Rinderon® solution (containing 0.1% betamethasone sodium phosphate) that has widely been used for treatment of postoperative inflammation, uveitis, etc. as a steroid ophthalmic solution. The secondary objective was to establish the evaluation system for a dose-finding study.</detailed_description>
