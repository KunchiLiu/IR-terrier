	<brief_title>A Validation Study of a New System for Measuring the End Expiratory Lung Volume During Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we aimed to evaluate a new system dedicated to estimate the end expiratory lung volume, by measuring the VO2-VCO2, during mechanical ventilation compared to the Helium dilution technique and the CT scan. We will compare the data considering the CT scan data as the gold standard.</detailed_description>
