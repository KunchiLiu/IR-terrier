	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention Study for Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Therapy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given that this is the first study to explore the potential effects of exercise training on exercise capacity, tumor vascularity and response in women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer, prior to the initiation of the full investigation, we will conduct a small vanguard study to ensure we can achieve acceptable exercise adherence rates in the absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Specifically, three operable breast cancer patients will be recruited and enrolled as described below and perform exercise training for a minimum of six weeks. If acceptable exercise rates are observed in the absence of severe DLTs during this time, we will proceed with the full investigation (recruitment of additional 20 patients) (see Figure 2). Using a prospective, randomized design, potential participants will be identified and screened for eligibility by an assigned Breast Protocol Nurse (TBD) via medical record review of patients scheduled for their primary neoadjuvant chemotherapy consultation at DCCC</detailed_description>
