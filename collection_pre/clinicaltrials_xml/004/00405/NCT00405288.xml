	<brief_title>The Safety of Proctofoam-HC in the Third Trimester of Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemorrhoids are a frequent condition in pregnancy. The rate is increased as pregnancy progresses, and they affect up to 24% of pregnant women in the third trimester. Complications of untreated hemorrhoids include bleeding, prolapse, soiling, discharge with perianal irritation and itching, and in severe cases, severe pain and venous engorgement which could even lead to thrombosis and infarction. Hemorrhoids are treated with a variety of suppositories and gels, based on analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. The safety of these antihemorrhoidal products has not yet been documented in pregnant women. Proctofoam-HC® has been on the Canadian market for 25 years. It combines the anti-inflammatory action of hydrocortisone with the surface anesthetic effect of pramoxine HCl. It is approved for temporary relief of anorectal inflammation, pruritus, pain and swelling associated with haemorrhoids, fissures, pruritus ani, cryptitis, proctitis and postoperative pain. We hypothesize that local application of Proctofoam-HC® in the third trimester of pregnancy is safe for the mother and fetus.</detailed_description>
