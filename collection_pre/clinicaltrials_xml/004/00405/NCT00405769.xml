Study Group 2 will also participate in Change of Heart. Group 2 will be provided an over the counter supplement consisting of red rice yeast 2.4-3.6 gms day) Blood work consisting of a lipid panel, cardiac CRP, CPK, liver function panel and TSH will be obtained prior to study, and at 12 and 26 wks. Questionnaires will be administered regarding quality of life indexes, and ancillary symptom relief (i.e. degree of arthritis discomfort, generalized weakness) before, 12 and 26 weeks.
