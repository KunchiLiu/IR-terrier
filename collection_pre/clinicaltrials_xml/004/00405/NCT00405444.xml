	<brief_title>Intranasal Fentanyl Versus Placebo for Catheterization During a Voiding Cystourethrogram in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies have shown that the voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) can be distressful and painful for children as the child is catheterized during the procedure. Currently no sedation or analgesia is recommended for the procedure. The practice of pediatrics is constantly seeking measures to decrease pain and distress for children. The opioid fentanyl was originally synthesized in the 1950's and 60's as an alternative to morphine and meperidine. The safety and efficacy of intranasal (IN) fentanyl has been previously demonstrated in the setting of a pediatric emergency department. We are proposing the use of IN fentanyl for analgesia prior to the catheterization for a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). If we prove that IN fentanyl is effective in reducing the pain while ensuring patient safety, it could become the analgesic of choice for this procedure.</detailed_description>
