	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, phase II study of the safety and efficacy of two dose levels of oral ATN-224 in patients with prostate cancer with a rising serum PSA in the absence of detectable disease. Patients will be randomized (1:1) after confirmation of eligibility requirements. The primary endpoint is to determine the proportion of patients who do not have PSA progression for 24 weeks. PSA progression is defined as at least a 50% increase in PSA and &gt;5 ng/mL from baseline or post-treatment nadir if lower than baseline, confirmed by another PSA at least 28 days later.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ATN-224 in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ATN-224 is an orally active, small molecule that has been shown in cellular and animal models to be anti-angiogenic and to have activity against prostate cancer cell lines. ATN-224 has the potential to affect the progression of prostate cancer by mechanisms that include both antiangiogenic and antitumor pathways. ATN-224 may change the time to overt metastatic disease in patients with rising PSA as the only manifestation of disease after treatment with curative intent and delay the need for hormonal therapies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients with histologically confirmed, localized prostate cancer who have a prostatespecific antigen (PSA) doubling time (DT) as calculated according to the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center nomogram (http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/10088.cfm) Doubling time &lt; 12 months after local therapy in patients who have not had any previous hormone therapy, or Doubling time &lt; 12 months starting at least 6 months after their last dose of hormone therapy Patients must have a serum testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL at the time of study entry. Patients may have received previous castrating hormonal therapy or antiandrogens, provided that the testosterone level is &gt;150 ng/dL at the time of study entry. Prior chemotherapy is also allowed as long as the requirements for adequate organ and marrow function are met. No detectable disease as assessed by physical examination and bone and CT (abdomen and pelvis) scans within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of ATN224 A minimum of three PSA values, each at least 4 weeks apart, to calculate PSADT. The last PSA level prior to enrollment must be at least 2.0 ng/mL and be rising over the prior value. Age ≥18 years Life expectancy of greater than 6 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥50%; see Appendix A) Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/uL platelets ≥100,000/uL hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL total bilirubin ≤2 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) ≤2 X ULN creatinine clearance (measured or calculated) ≥30 mL/min serum testosterone &gt;150 ng/mL or return to pretreatment values for patients who received hormone therapy Patients are allowed to receive erythropoietin or blood transfusions before receiving their first dose of ATN224 to bring the hemoglobin level to &gt;9 g/dL to meet eligibility criteria. At least 28 days from receiving any investigational agent The effects of ATN224 on sperm at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason men with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal and/or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation through the follow up visit 28 days after the last dose of ATN224 Willingness to forgo taking copper or zinccontaining vitamins or supplements Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Exclusion Criteria Patients who have had radiotherapy within 3 months prior to the first dose of ATN 224 Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ATN224 or omeprazole or other long acting antacids History of malabsorption syndromes or other gastrointestinal disorders that may affect ATN224 absorption, including bowel obstruction, celiac disease, sprue, cystic fibrosis Ineligible to receive either omeprazole (Prilosec®), lansoprazole (Prevacid®), pantoprazole (Protonix®), or ranitidine (Zantac®) Inability to swallow study medication capsules Other serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent or with the potential to interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of ATN224 treatment Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Patients known to be positive for HIV or infectious hepatitis type A, B or C No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or any other cancer from which the patient has been diseasefree for 5 years Patients receiving steroid therapy for concurrent illness unless they have been on a stable dose for 3 months. Patients receiving hormonal therapy including gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonist/antagonist, antiandrogens, diethylstilbestrol, any other estrogenlike agents, any hormonally active overthecounter compounds such as PCSPES or finasteride</criteria>
