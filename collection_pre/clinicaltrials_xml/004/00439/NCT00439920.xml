	<brief_title>GIMEMA LAL 0496: High-Dose Anthracycline in the Induction Regimen for the Treatment of Adult ALL.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present trial is a prospective multicentric GIMEMA study, in which adult ALL patients are extensively analyzed at diagnosis by a multiparametric approach including CC and molecular analysis for the following gene rearrangements: BCR-ABL, MLL-AF4, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, MLL, p15 and p16 deletion in order to give place to a carefully characterization of the genetic lesions occurring in adult ALL and to evaluate their prognostic significance in a large cohort of patients homogeneously treated. This study requires a central handling and analysis of bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood samples at presentation.</detailed_description>
