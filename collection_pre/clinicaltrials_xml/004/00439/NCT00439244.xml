	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Postmenopausal (PMO) women between 45 and 89 years of age. Bone mineral density T score of 2.5 or less at femoral neck, total hip or lumbar spine OR Bone mineral density T score of 2.0 or less at femoral neck, total hip or lumbar spine with at least one documented osteoporotic vertebral fracture or a previously documented history of an osteoporotic clinical nonvertebral fracture not due to excessive trauma Exclusion criteria: Any prior use of strontium Any past or active kidney disease or problems with kidney function Prior treatment with any intravenous (i.v.) or oral bisphosphonate (such as but not limited to alendronate, risedronate and pamidronate) longer than 3 months consecutively.
