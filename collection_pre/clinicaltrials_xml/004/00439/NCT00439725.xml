	<criteria>Patients with confirmed symptomatic PE or DVT who have been treated for 6 or 12 months with VKA or rivaroxaban Legal lower age limitations (country specific) Indication for VKA other than DVT and/or PE Patients in whom anticoagulant treatment for their index PE or DVT should be continued Childbearing potential without proper contraceptive measures, pregnancy or breast feeding. Proper contraceptive measures are defined as a method of contraception with a failure rate &lt; 1 % during the course of the study (including the observational period). These methods of contraception according to the note for guidance on nonclinical safety studies for the conduct of human trials for pharmaceuticals (CPMP [Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products]/ICH [International Conference on Harmonization]/286/95, modification) include consistent and correct use of hormone containing implants and injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormone containing intrauterine devices, surgical sterilization, sexual abstinence and vasectomy</criteria>
