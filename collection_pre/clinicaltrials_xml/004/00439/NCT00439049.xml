	<detailed_description>Approximately 1500 candidates per year will respond to advertisements and will complete preliminary telephone screening without identifiers. Appropriate candidates will be given appointment times and on arrival will undergo the consent process for evaluation. A complete medical, social, psychiatric, and drug use history will be obtained. Subjects fulfilling general health inclusion requirements will then be offered an appropriate study for which the specific consent will be obtained. The evaluation period will be no more than one day with all results evaluated within the two following days. Acceptable candidates will then be invited to complete the study specific consent.</detailed_description>
