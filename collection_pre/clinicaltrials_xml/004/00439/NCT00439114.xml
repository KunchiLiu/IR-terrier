	<brief_summary>This study is planned to compare the results of ultrasonic and Orbscan pachymetry in corneal haze not related to surgery. Corneal haze is graded with slit-lamp by a single examiner. Ultrasonic and Orbscan II pachymetry measurements are obtained. Paired t and Kruskal-Wallis tests are used to evaluate the difference between ultrasonic and Orbscan pachymetry measurements. Correlation of the two methods and haze grade is determined with Kendall’s tau-b correlation analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Ultrasonic Pachymetry With Orbscan in Corneal Haze</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We planned this study to compare the results of ultrasonic and Orbscan pachymetry in corneal haze not related to surgery. In this institutional based, prospective, controlled clinical trial subjects with corneal haze not related to surgery are included. Normal eyes are used as control group to calculate the customized acoustic factor. Corneal haze is graded with slit-lamp by a single examiner. Ultrasonic and Orbscan II pachymetry measurements are obtained by one technician each masked to the other measurement. Paired t and Kruskal-Wallis tests are used to evaluate the difference between ultrasonic and Orbscan pachymetry measurements. Correlation of the two methods and haze grade is determined with Kendall’s tau-b correlation analysis. According to the results of the study, we will determine which method is accurate in subjects with corneal haze.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with significant corneal haze on slitlamp are included in the study group. 50 eyes of 50 agematched patients with normal eye and clear cornea are included in the control group. Only one eye of each subject is included. Exclusion criteria to participate in the study are previous ocular surgery, history of contact lens use, glaucoma, and topical ocular medication use, excluding artificial tears.</criteria>
