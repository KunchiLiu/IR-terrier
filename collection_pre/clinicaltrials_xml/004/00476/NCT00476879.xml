	<brief_title>Growth Hormone During Fasting.Signaltransduktion in Muscle and Adipose Tissue and Changes in Intrahepatic Lipid Content</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During fasting the human body is known to metabolize relatively large amounts of fat, in the expense of proteins and glucose. Partly this shift in metabolism is caused by increasing GH secretion, but exactly how growth hormone exerts these effects remains to be further investigated. 10 healthy lean young men are studied at 4 different occasions in a randomized single-blinded cross-over study. 1: after 12 hours of fasting + GH bolus, 2: after 36 hours of fasting + GH bolus, 3: after 36 hours + saline, 4: after 36 hours of fasting + Somavert. Aim: - to study the signal transduction in muscle and fat tissue - to study the metabolism during fasting - to study the intrahepatic fat content using magnetic resonance techniques</detailed_description>
