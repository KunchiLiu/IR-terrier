	<brief_title>Does Topical Steroid Treatment Impair the Adrenal Function?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adrenocortical suppression is a potential complication of systemic corticosteroid treatement but also of non systemic therapy like topical therapy. The normalcy of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA axis) of patients with chronic skin diseases like atopic dermatitis, pemphigus or psoriasis which are treated with topical steroids, will be assessed with the low dose (1mcg) adrenocortocotropin ( ACTH) stimulation test. During this test serum cortisol levels are measured before, 30 and 60 mn after intravenous administration of 1mcg of ACTH (synacthen).The results will be compared with age and sex matched subjects with normal HPA axis as assessed by low dose ACTH stimulation test.</detailed_description>
