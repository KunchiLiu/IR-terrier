	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin and Gemcitabine Followed by Radiation Therapy in the Management of Mixed Mullerian Tumors of the Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary To determine the feasibility of dual modality therapy described as cytotoxic therapy followed by radiation therapy for the management of Malignant Mixed Mullerian Tumors (MMMTs). Secondary * To describe the response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors STATISTICAL DESIGN: This study used a two-stage design to evaluate feasibility of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine prior to radiation therapy defined as completing 3 cycles of chemotherapy. The null and alternative therapy completion rates were 25% and 50%. If 3 or more participants enrolled in the stage one cohort (n=9 participants) complete therapy than accrual would proceed to stage two (n=15 participants). If therapy was completed by at least 10 participants in the final set of 24 evaluable participants then this regimen would be deemed worthy of further study. This design had 80% power given one-sided type I error of 5% with the probability of stopping early 0.60.</detailed_description>
