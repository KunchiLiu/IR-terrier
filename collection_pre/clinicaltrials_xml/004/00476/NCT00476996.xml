	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab, compared with placebo, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to at least one anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Patients will be randomized to receive placebo, 200mg of intravenous ocrelizumab, or 500mg of i.v. ocrelizumab on days 1 and 15. A repeat course of i.v. treatment will be administered at weeks 24 and 26. All patients will receive stable doses of either concomitant methotrexate (7.5-25mg/week) or leflunomide (10-20mg po daily) and may receive additional DMARDs. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years. Target sample size is 1000.</brief_summary>
