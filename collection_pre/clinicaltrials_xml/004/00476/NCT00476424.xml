	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Study of Once Daily Efavirenz 400 mg Versus 600 mg in Thai HIV-1 Infected Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efavirenz Pharmacokinetic evaluation supports once-daily dosing (T1/2 is 10-52 hours). The recommended dosage of efavirenz in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and/or protease inhibitor (PI) is 600mg orally, once daily. In Thai populations, many ARV levels are very high. We believe that 600 mg efavirenz is too high for Thai people and would like to see the pharmacokinetic data and safety and efficacy of efavirenz at 400 mg.</detailed_description>
