	<brief_title>Yoga Study in Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of breast cancer than normal weight women. Furthermore, women who are overweight or obese or gain weight after diagnosis have an increased risk of recurrence or dying from breast cancer compared with normal weight women. Yoga has been associated with reduced weight gain and weight loss in persons without cancer. However, no studies have tested whether yoga leads to less weight gain or weight loss in breast cancer patients. Both obesity and the sequelae of breast cancer therapy can result in reduced health-related quality of life and severe fatigue, which may also be favorably affected by yoga practice. The specific aims of the proposed trial are to examine, in women with Stage 0-IIIa breast cancer who are at least 3 months post primary treatment for their disease (other than tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors), the effects of a 6-month yoga intervention on health-related quality of life, fatigue, and body weight.</detailed_description>
