	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Efficacy of SQV/r 1500/100 Plus Tenofovir/Emtricitabine 300/200 mg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be performed in patients who were previously treated with SQV /r 1000/100mg twice daily or Lopinavir/r plus TDF/FTC once daily as part of the Gemini study. After 48 weeks of the study, the patients will be treated with SQV film coated tablet 1500/100mg once daily plus TDF/FTC300/200mg once daily with good CD4 and VL outcomes. In this study, we would like to evaluate the once-daily dosing of SQV using SQV- SQV film coated tablet 1500/ritonavir 100mg in combination with TDF/FTC300/200mg once daily. We believe that the PK parameters of SQV given at 1500mg daily will be equivalent to the 1000mg twice daily dosing when combined with RTV and TDF/FTC300/200mg OD, and that the once daily regimen will have better safety, tolerability profile than the twice daily regimen while maintaining good CD4 and VL outcome</detailed_description>
