	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out how common diseases of the esophagus can cause chest pain. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), commonly known as heartburn, is a common cause of chest pain in patients that do not have heart problems. The study test is called PillCam Eso, it is a small, pill sized capsule that has a small camera inside it. The camera will take pictures of the esophagus and the stomach as it goes down. Findings of the PillCam Eso will be compared to findings during conventional upper endoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Patients With Non-cardiac Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is defined by recurrent episodes of retrosternal chest pain in the absence of significant cardiovascular disease after a thorough cardiac evaluation. It accounts for 2-5% of all emergency department visits. Studies examining the prevalence of esophago-gastric lesions in patients with NCCP referred to gastroenterologists have found esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, hiatal hernias, gastritis, and gastric ulcers in 62% of patients. Advances in endoscopic technologies, particularly, the introduction of the wireless video-capsule (PillCam Eso) allows for the possibility of direct visualization of the upper gastrointestinal tract in the emergency department. During capsule endoscopy, a patient will swallow a pill-sized video-capsule, the wireless images of the gastrointestinal tract are transmitted to a computer. Findings of the PillCam Eso will be then compared to findings during conventional upper endoscopy.</detailed_description>
