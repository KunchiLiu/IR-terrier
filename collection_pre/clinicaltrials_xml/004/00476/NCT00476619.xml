	<brief_summary>Full Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Procrit for the Prevention of Acute Renal Failure in Patients Receiving Intravenous Contrast Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a one-time dose of intravenous erythropoietin administration in the prevention or attenuation of contrast-induced acute renal failure. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate serum and urinary markers of renal injury, including KIM-1, BMP-7, and TGF-b, along with other biomarkers, in subjects receiving intravenous contrast and correlate their expression with clinical outcomes Study Design: Prospective, multi-centered, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of a one-time dose of EPO. Subjects will be followed for seven days or until hospital discharge, whichever is longer. Total estimated study duration 3 years.</brief_summary>
