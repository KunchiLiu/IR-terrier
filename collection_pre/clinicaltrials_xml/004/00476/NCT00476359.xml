	<brief_summary>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LPV/r with saquinavir in HIV-1 infected children. To evaluate treatment response (clinical, immunological and virological) to LPV/r, SQV in Thai children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A PK and Salvage Study for Children With HIV-infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PK and 24 week data has been published in Pediatric Infectious Diseases Journal. It showed that plasma drug concentrations of saquinavir, lopinavir and ritonavir were at the higher limits of expected ranges for adult treatment at approved dosages (1000/100 mg BID for saquinavir, 400/100 mg BID for lopinavir/r). The regimen was well tolerated and showed significant CD4 rise and VL decline at 48 weeks.</detailed_description>
