	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of Beclometasone/Formoterol Single Inhaler in Patients With Moderate to Severe Persistent Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of beclometasone/formoterol single inhaler in a twice daily regimen in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma. Patients are randomised to receive either beclometasone/formoterol single inhaler (total daily dose: BDP/FF 400/24 mcg) or beclometasone CFC + formoterol DPI (total daily dose: BDP 1000 mcg + FF 24 mcg) or beclometasone CFC (total daily dose: BDP 1000 mcg) during 24 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe persistent asthma (according to GINA 2002 guidelines) FEV1 &gt; 40% and &lt; 80% of predicted normal postbronchodilator (and at least 0.7 L absolute value) Patients already treated for at least 2 months with an association of inhaled corticosteroids plus LABA at doses of: 750 1000 µg beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent (ICSs) 24 µg formoterol or 100 µg salmeterol (LABAs) Or patients naïve of LABA already treated for at least 2 months with inhaled corticosteroids (doses as above) associated with a daily use of SABA and/or with clinical symptoms &gt; 3 times in the week prior to inclusion A documented positive response to the reversibility test. Pregnant or lactating females or women of childbearing potential without any efficient contraception. Heavy smokers defined as smoking for &gt; 10 pack years. Evidence of asthma exacerbation causing an hospitalisation or requiring treatment with oral/parenteral corticosteroids or evidence of symptomatic airways infection in the 4 weeks prior to inclusion (3 months for slowrelease corticosteroids). Seasonal asthma or asthma occurring only during episodic exposure to an allergen or occupational chemical sensitizer. Clinically significant or unstable concomitant diseases, including clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. Patients with an abnormal QTc interval value in the ECG test, defined as &gt; 450 msec in males or &gt; 470 msec in females. Evidence of asthma worsening during the week preceding randomisation (e.g. PEF variability &gt; 30% during 2 consecutive days, SABA use &gt; 8 puffs/day during 2 consecutive days, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma symptoms during 3 consecutive days</criteria>
