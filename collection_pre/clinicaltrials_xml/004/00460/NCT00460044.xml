	<brief_title>ADMA and Mechanical Ventilation in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the normal development and maturation of the lungs. In addition, NO is an important mediator of vascular smooth muscle relaxation, ventilation perfusion matching, neurotransmission and host defence and bacteriostasis. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous derivative of arginine that inhibits NOS and thereby the bioavailability of NO. Preterm infants have increased concentrations of ADMA. Therefore, inhibition of NO by increased concentrations of ADMA which could be associated with reduced pulmonary functioning.</detailed_description>
