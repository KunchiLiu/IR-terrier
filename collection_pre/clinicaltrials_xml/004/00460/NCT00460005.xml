	<brief_summary>Understanding the speed at which migraine headaches develop is of importance to patients. Determining the proportions in which different headache pain build-up occurs, may provide health care practitioners with valuable information with which to prescribe the most appropriate treatment. Patients who experience a slow pain build-up may gain more benefit from medications which have a slow onset of effect, high tolerability and long action. Conversely, medications with a rapid onset of effect may be of greater benefit to patients who experience rapid onset of migraine pain.</brief_summary>
