	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Measuring levels of interleukin-6 and depression may help doctors understand the relationship between interleukin-6 and depression. It may also help the study of cancer in the future. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying depression and interleukin-6 production in patients with ovarian epithelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depression and Interleukin-6 Production in Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Correlate tumor production of interleukin (IL)-6, serum levels of IL-6, and IL-6 coding or promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms with IL-6 protein production in patients with ovarian epithelial cancer. - Correlate tumor culture supernatant, ascitic fluid, and/or serum IL-6 level with levels of depression and/or anxiety in these patients to determine whether catecholamines or cortisol may alter production of IL-6 by cultured ovarian cancer cells. - Determine the effects of neuroendocrine activity on modulation of IL-6 production in these patients. - Compare immune response to autologous tumor tissue in "MLR-like" reactions between tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. - Correlate the levels of immunologic response with relapse and/or survival times, clinical response to CA 125 antibody treatment (e.g., in a pre- vs post-therapy sampling framework), and IL-6 parameters in these patients. - Determine the use of epitope prediction bioinformatic tools in consultation with Coulter to set up a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramer assay for assessing cytotoxic T lymphocyte levels in peripheral blood from these patients. - Determine the incidence of herpes virus infections in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Before and after cytoreduction surgery, patients complete multiple questionnaires, including Beck Depression Inventory, Positive &amp; Negative Mood State, Fatigue Symptom Inventory, Revised NEO Personality Inventory, COPE, SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, and Mental Adjustment to Cancer, to assess depression and coping mechanisms. Blood samples are collected at baseline and on postoperative days 1-4 and analyzed for interleukin (IL)-6, c-reactive protein, herpes simplex virus-8 (HSV8), epinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormones, and cortisol. Ovarian carcinoma tissue samples and peritoneal fluid are also collected and evaluated for production and utilization of IL-6, HSV8, and autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
