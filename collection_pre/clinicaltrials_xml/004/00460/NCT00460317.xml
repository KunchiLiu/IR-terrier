Known history of allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel or carboplatin. Any anticoagulation therapy within 7 days prior to randomization. The use of lowdose warfarin [ &lt; = 2 mg daily] or low molecular weight heparin or heparin flushes for prophylaxis against central venous catheter thrombosis is allowed. History of arterial or venous thrombosis within 12 months prior to randomization. History of bleeding diathesis or bleeding within 14 days prior to randomization. Peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. Clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of randomization, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, grade 2 or greater peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent, congestive heart failure, or ongoing arrhythmias requiring medication. History of other primary cancer unless: Curatively resected non melanomatous skin cancer. Curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ. Other primary solid tumor curatively treated with no known active disease present and no curative treatment administered for the last 3 years Any kind of disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to comply with the study procedures. Open wound, ulcer or fracture. Uncontrolled hypertension as defined by resting blood pressure &gt; 150/90 mm Hg. Antihypertensive medications are allowed if the subject is stable on their current dose at the time of randomization. Surgery: Major surgical procedures within 28 days prior to randomization Minor surgical procedures within 14 days prior to randomization Failure to recover from prior surgery Placement of a central venous access device (including ports and tunneled or nontunneled catheters) within 7 days prior to randomization Planned elective surgery while on study treatment Core needle biopsy within 7 days prior to randomization Not recovered from all previous therapies (ie, radiation, surgery and medications). Adverse events related to previous therapies must be CTCAE grade &lt; = 1 at screening or returned to the subject's baseline prior to their most recent previous therapy. Participation in therapeutic clinical trials or currently receiving other investigational treatment(s) within 30 days prior to randomization. Pregnant (eg, positive HCG testserum or urine) or breast feeding woman. Any subject not consenting to use adequate contraceptive precautions (eg, hormonal, barrier or abstinence) during the course of the study and for 6 months after the last treatment.

Active infection requiring systemic treatment or any uncontrolled infection &lt; = 14 days prior to randomization. History of any medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risks associated with the study participation or investigational product(s) administration or may interfere with the interpretation of the results.
