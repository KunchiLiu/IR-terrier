	<brief_title>A Research Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Dexmedetomidine in Preventing Delirium After Hip Fracture Repair Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative delirium is an acute decline in cognition and attention which is usually transient but when delirium persists it can impact cognitive function, morbidity and morality. There are no drugs that are currently approved to prevent the onset of delirium but dexmedetomidine has the potential to meet this unmet medical need. Hip fractures, unfortunately are frequent occurrences in the elderly population and the elderly are more prone to developing delirium after surgery. Dexmedetomidine is currently approved for use for 24 hours in patients on ventilators in the ICU. Study participation will last from within 72 hours of surgery to 3 days after surgery, continue throughout surgery and up to 2 hours after surgery. Delirium will be assessed prior to surgery and for 72 hours after surgery. This assessment will consist of questions to determine memory and thought process. At discharge patient's resource utilization will be evaluated and thirty days after surgery questions will be asked regarding quality of life.</detailed_description>
