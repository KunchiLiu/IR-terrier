	<brief_title>Compliance Survey of ADHD Medication for Optimal Satisfaction (COSMOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an Observational, survey study. The survey is designed to be administered in two stages. In the first stage, patients who were prescribed Immediate-Released Methylphenidate (IR-MPH) for over 3 months, who are also on IR-MPH 1 month prior and who meet inclusion criteria will be enrolled. On survey day 1, the patients, parents/caregivers, and clinicians will assess patient drug compliance. For patients considered non-compliant, the Investigator will decide whether or not to change current medication. Those patients whose medication is changed from IR-MPH to another treatment for ADHD, will be enrolled into the second stage. On survey day 1, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the effects of the medication on sleep quality, decreased appetite, dizziness and or headache, and gastrointestinal upset will be assessed based on clinical interview. Any other side effects shown during medication treatment will be also recorded in the first stage. Parent/Caregivers will need to complete the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP) Questionnaire which will evaluate the ADHD child's symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity and oppositional defiant disorder. In the second stage, those ADHD patients who meet the definition of non-compliance will be treated with other medications for over three weeks. On the first visit back after starting treatment with other medications, drug compliance, CGI, any change in negative parent-child interaction, overall classroom behavior, overall academic performance, the effects on sleep quality, decreased appetite, diziness and or headache, and gastrointestinal upset will be assessed by Investigator interview. Parent/Caregivers will need to complete SNAP Questionaire which will evaluate the ADHD child's symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity and oppositional defiant disorder. It is a survey type of study. No study drug has been used in the study.</detailed_description>
