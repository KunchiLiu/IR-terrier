	<brief_summary>20010133 is an open-label, dose escalation study in pediatric patients with acute leukemias receiving myelotoxic therapy (high dose etoposide, cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation [TBI]) followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of palifermin in pediatric patients. Three doses (40 μg/kg/day, 60 μg/kg/day, and 80 μg/kg/day) are to be evaluated in each age group (1 to 2, 3 to 11, and 12 to 16 years, respectively) using a conventional dose escalation design. Palifermin is administered for 3 consecutive days (Day -10 to Day -8, respectively) before the start of the conditioning regimen and for 3 consecutive days (Day 0 to Day +2) following HSCT. Patients will be enrolled simultaneously to each age group to identify a safe, well tolerated, efficacious dose in each age group. Patients will also be followed for secondary malignancies, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)</brief_summary>
