	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore tolerability, safety and effectiveness of flexibly dosed paliperidone extended release (ER) in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self) previously unsuccessfully treated with an oral antipsychotic medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy, Safety And Tolerability Study of Flexibly Dosed Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in Participants With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized (the study drug is not assigned by chance), single arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) 6-month study. Participants can be transitioned to an effective dose of paliperidone ER from any oral antipsychotic medication due to lack of efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack of compliance or other reason. A transition period of maximum 4 weeks will be allowed. Throughout the study, participants will receive flexible dose of 3 to 12 milligram (mg) of paliperidone once daily orally for 6 months. Adjustment of the dosage will be done at Investigator's discretion, based on the individual participant's clinical response and tolerability of the study drug dosages. Participants who complete this 6-month study and would like to continue will be eligible to be enrolled in an extension phase until paliperidone ER is available. The starting dose of the extension phase will be the same as at the end of the 6-month study and may be changed throughout the extension period. The extension phase will consist of a main extension phase (ending with an End of Main Extension Phase Visit) and a modified extension phase (ending with an End of Study Visit). Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Safety will primarily be evaluated by Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).</detailed_description>
