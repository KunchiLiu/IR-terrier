	<criteria>Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must meet all of the following criteria: Patients with upper limb spasticity who are at least 6 months post stroke and present with spasticity of both the wrist and fingers at the start of doubleblind phase (Visit 2). Wrist flexor muscle tone of ≥3 and finger flexor muscle tone of ≥2 on the MAS, and at least one functional disability item (i.e., hygiene, pain, dressing or limb posture) with a rating of ≥2 on the Disabilty Assessment Scale (DAS) at the start of doubleblind phase (Visit 2). Male or female between 20 and 80 years of age at the time of informed consent. For males, only those who can practice contraception during the study period are eligible. ≥40kg in weight at the start of doubleblind phase (Visit 2). Inpatient or outpatient; however, the hospitalization status must remain unchanged during the doubleblind phase. Written informed consent from the subject him/herself. If the subject's signature is not legible, the attendance of a witness is required. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: Bilateral hemiplegia or quadriplegia. Presence of fixed contractures of the wrist and/or fingers (absence of range of motion). Profound atrophy of the muscles to be injected. Previous surgical intervention, phenol block, ethanol block, or muscle afferent block (MAB) for wrist and/or finger spasticity. Casting of the study upper limb within 3 months prior to the start of doubleblind phase (Visit 2). Current treatment with intrathecal baclofen. Use of peripheral muscle relaxants (dantrolene sodium, suxamethonium chloride, pancuronium bromide, vecuronium bromide, rocuronium bromide). Concurrent use of antibiotics that interfere with neuromuscular transmission, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g., streptomycin sulfate, kanamycin sulfate, gentamicin sulfate, neomycin sulphate, spectinomycin hydrochloride), polypeptide antibiotics (e.g., polymixin B sulfate), lincomycin antibiotics (e.g., lincomycin hydrochloride, clindamycin), and enviomycin sulfate. Previous botulinum toxin therapy. Diagnosis of systemic neuromuscular disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis, LambertEaton syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Females who are pregnant, nursing, may be pregnant, or planning a pregnancy during the study period. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any ingredient of study medication (e.g., human serum albumin). Presence of psychiatric disorder or impairment of intellectual function that may interfere with the subject's ability to give informed consent or the conduct of the study. Bedridden patients. Presence of clinically unstable severe cardiovascular disease. Presence of clinically significant severe renal, hepatic or respiratory disease. Infection or dermatological condition at the proposed injection sites. Previous or planned participation in another clinical study (including the lower limb spasticity study of GSK1358820) within 6 months prior to the start of doubleblind phase (Visit 2). Others whom the investigator or sub investigator considers not eligible for the study. Clinically significant severe reduction of muscle strength. Angle closure glaucoma or its preposition (narrow angle).</criteria>
