	<brief_summary>This study in PD patients is designed to assess the affect food has on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of ropinirole (by dosing some patients in the fasted state and other patients following a high-fat breakfast), and to assess the difference in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of ropinirole if patients are given three 4mg ropinirole tablets versus one 12mg tablet.</brief_summary>

Blood donation or significant blood loss less than 90 days before Day 1 of the current study. Definite or suspected personal history, or family history, of adverse reactions or hypersensitivity to ropinirole or to drugs with a similar chemical structure. Use of any investigational drug (with the exception of ropinirole PR/CR) within 30 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) before the start of dosing with study medication. Patients who have received overthecounter (OTC) medicine within 48 h before the first dose of study drug. Recent history, or suspicion, of drug dependence or abuse of alcohol Significant concern, or likelihood, that the patient will drop out of the study prematurely, will require new or prohibited concomitant medications during the study period, or will not be compliant with study procedures. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Female patient is currently either of: 1.
