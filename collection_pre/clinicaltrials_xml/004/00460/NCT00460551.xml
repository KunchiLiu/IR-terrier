	<brief_title>Zalutumumab in Combination With Chemo-Radiation in a Certain Type of Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Originally the study was planned as Part 1A, Part 1B and Part 2. Part 1A was one arm with zalatumumab fixed dose 8 mg/kg. Part 1B was planned as zalutumumab dose-titration and Part 2 adding a comparator. The trial was prematurely closed for enrolment when patients had only been enrolled in Part 1A due to published results showing increased toxicity from induction chemotherapy without any survival benefit.</detailed_description>
