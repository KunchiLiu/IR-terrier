	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of Novel A2A Agonist in Treatment of Diabetic Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The planned study is an exploratory study which aims to provide proof of the efficacy of BVT.115959 in the reduction of the symptoms of pain. Thus, the primary objective is to evaluate the anticipated analgesic properties of BVT.115959 in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain and to confirm its activity against placebo. The study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oral BVT.115959 7 mg administered three times a day (t.i.d.) versus a matching placebo in diabetic patients with neuropathic pain who are either not on analgesia or are on stable analgesia in the month prior to entering the study and who are being maintained on stable analgesia throughout the study. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 (BVT.115959: placebo). The study consists of a 1-week screening/baseline period, a 4-week treatment period and a 1 week follow-up period.</detailed_description>
