	<brief_title>Sevoflurane-Remifentanil Anaesthesia. The Risk of Post Operative Nausea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia are used world wide at the anaesthetists discretion. Propofol is superior to inhalational anaesthetics as anaesthesia for patients at risk of post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) as PONV is diminished. However, when remifentanil is used as adjuvant to sevoflurane, the total dose of the latter is reduced. Therefore, we wanted to investigate if sevoflurane-remifentanil anaesthesia is similar to propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia with emphasis on nausea, vomiting and total PONV during 24 hours. In the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and in the surgical ward nausea was scored on a visual analogue score. Vomiting was registered.</detailed_description>
