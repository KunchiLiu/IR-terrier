	<detailed_description>In a consecutive patients series of about 12500, blunt head injuries were observed (during a 16 month period), in a prospective analysis. Based on a retrospective study, we created a checklist of individual patients data which was completed for each patient. In accordance with the institutions guidelines all patients with blunt head injury received plain skull x-ray in 2 plains and additional cranial CT-scan (CCT) in case of fracture or neurological symptoms. We developed also an diagnostic algorithm consisting of anamnestical data and clinical signs and symptoms to define these risk factors and to catch all patients with minor head injury who are at risk to develop intracranial bleeding.</detailed_description>
