	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn whether apixaban prevents the development of blood clots in the leg (deep vein thrombosis) and lung (pulmonary embolism), which sometimes occur after knee replacement surgery, and to compare the efficacy of apixaban with that of enoxaparin (Lovenox®) in the prevention of these clots. The safety of apixaban will also be studied.</brief_summary>
