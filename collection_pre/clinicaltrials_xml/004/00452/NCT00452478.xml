	<criteria>Male or female subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age receiving a stable regimen of haemodialysis for chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 5 (defined as haemodialysis two or three times per week for at least two months prior to screening). Females of child bearing potential (FOCP) must be nonpregnant, nonlactating, have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test, and agree to comply with any applicable contraceptive requirements of the protocol. Subjects on a stable phosphate binder dose (defined as no change in medication or dosage for at least the one month prior to screening) with a serum phosphorus level between greater than 1.78 and less than or equal to 2.43 mmol/L (5.5 and 7.5 mg/dL). Subjects with a corrected serum calcium level less than 2.1 mmol/L (8.5 mg/dL). Subjects with an intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level greater than 500 pg/mL, or a history of previous parathyroidectomy within 12 months of screening. Subjects with any significant bowel obstruction, active inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, abnormal or irregular bowel motion, or a history of major GI surgery within the last 6 months will be excluded. Subjects receiving aluminium, magnesium, or combination therapy other than sevelamer hydrogen chloride (HCl) and calcium as a phosphate binder at the time of screening will be excluded.</criteria>
