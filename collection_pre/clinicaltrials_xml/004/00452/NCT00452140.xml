	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to demonstrate clinical efficacy of the investigational trifunctional bispecific antibody ertumaxomab for treatment of patients with HER-2/neu 1+ or 2+ (FISH-) expressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer (stage III b/IV) which has progressed after endocrine therapy. Ertumaxomab is a trifunctional bispecific antibody targeting Her-2/neu and CD3 on T cells. Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells [DCs] and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to preclinical data, trifunctional antibodies activate these immune cells, which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study With the Trifunctional Antibody Ertumaxomab to Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer Progressing After Endocrine Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, one-stage, phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the investigational trifunctional bispecific antibody ertumaxomab (anti-Her-2/neu x anti-CD3) for the treatment of hormone therapy refractory advanced or metastatic breast cancer tumours (stage IIIb or IV) which are known to express HER-2/neu (1+ or 2+/FISH negative).Ertumaxomab will be administered at 7 day intervals by constant rate 3 hour intravenous (i.v.) infusions according to the following sequential dose schedule: 10 µg (day 0) and thereafter 100 µg flat doses once every 7 days (± 1 day) for a maximum of up to 12 weeks or until disease progression or any other unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
