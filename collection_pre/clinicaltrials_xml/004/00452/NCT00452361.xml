	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate whether conversion from cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor (CI) to sirolimus (SRL) results in improved long-term renal function without a negative impact on safety or immunosuppressive efficacy, and to further examine the potential of SRL to reduce the severity and/or progression of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating of Calcineurin Inhibitors Versus Sirolimus in Renal Allograft Recipient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label, randomized, parallel-group, comparative, outpatient study will be conducted in multiple centers in Taiwan. The study will randomize approximately 120 patients. 80 patients will be randomized to the SRL therapy group (conversion from CI- to SRL-based immunosuppression: group A) and 40 patients to the CI therapy group (continued CI therapy: group B). Dosage and Administration SRL Therapy: At the time of randomization on day 1, each patient will have been receiving: - triple therapy with a CI (tacrolimus or CsA) that began at the time of transplantation or within 2 weeks thereafter AND - corticosteroids corresponding to a dosage range of 2.5 to 15 mg/day for prednisone or prednisolone (2 to 12 mg/day for methylprednisolone) or the alternate day equivalent for at least 12 weeks before randomization, PLUS - either MMF (minimum dose 500 mg/day)/MPS (minimum dose 360 mg/day) or AZA (minimum dose 50 mg/day) for at least 12 weeks before randomization. SRL will be added to the immunosuppressive regimen for Group A. Group B will continue on this CI immunosuppressive regimen.</detailed_description>
