	<criteria>Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must meet all of the following criteria: Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from the subject and/or subject's legally acceptable representative prior to study participation. Type of Subject: Outpatient Gender: Male or female Females are eligible to participate only if they are currently nonpregnant and nonlactating. A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is: 1. of nonchildbearing potential; OR 2. of childbearing potential but has a negative urinary pregnancy test at Screening (Visit 1 and when specified in Appendix 1) and agrees to take contraceptive precautions (including abstinence) which are adequate to prevent pregnancy during the study. Acceptable methods of contraception [Hatcher, 2004] are: Abstinence oral contraceptive (either combined or progestogen only) injectable progestogen implants of levonorgestrel estrogenic vaginal ring percutaneous contraceptive devices intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is the sole sexual partner for that female subject double barrier method: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent 1. Age: A subject must be 12 years of age at Visit 1 (screening). 2. Asthma Diagnosis: A documented diagnosis of persistent asthma, for at least six months, as defined by the following American Thoracic Society definition: Asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased responsiveness of the airways to a variety of stimuli. The major symptoms of asthma are episodes of dyspnea, wheezing, and cough, which may vary from mild and almost undetectable to severe and unremitting (status asthmaticus). The primary physiological manifestation of this hyperresponsiveness is variable airway obstruction. This can take the form of spontaneous fluctuations in the severity of obstruction, substantial improvements in the severity of obstruction following bronchodilators or corticosteroids, or increased obstruction caused by drugs or other stimuli [American Thoracic Society, 1987]. 1. Asthma Medication History: A subject must be using a low to medium dose of an ICS (Table 1) OR a combination of controller medications (Table 2), containing a low (total daily) dose ICS (as defined in Table 1) for at least 4 weeks preceding screening. Table 1 (ICS Dosage Table) Inhaled Corticosteroid (Dosage (mcg/day))(LowMedium) Beclomethasone dipropionate CFC(168 = 504&gt; 504 = 840) Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA (80 = 240&gt;240 = 640) Triamcinolone acetonide(400 = 1000&gt;1000 = 2000) Flunisolide (500 = 1000&gt; 1000 = 2000) Fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol (176 = 220&gt; 220 = 440) Fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (100 = 250&gt; 250 = 500) Budesonide1 (200 = 600&gt; 600 =1200) Mometasone (200 = 400&gt; 400 = 800) Ciclesonide (80 = 160&gt;160 = 320) 1.Respules are allowed at a dosage of 250500mcg/day. Table 2 (Asthma Controller Medications) Asthma Controller Medication(s) Low dose ICS + Leukotriene modifiers Low dose ICS + Theophylline products Low Dose ICS + Inhaled anticholinergics or combination products (e.g., Atrovent or Combivent) Low Dose ICS + Long acting inhaled anticholinergic (e.g. Spiriva) Low dose ICS+ long acting beta agonist or combination products containing a low dose ICS and a longacting betaagonists (e.g. ADVAIR™/SERETIDE™1 100/50 mcg BID or Symbicort 160/9 mcg BID (i.e 80/4.5 mcg two inhalations BID) 1) ADVAIR/SERETIDE =250/50 mcg BID or Symbicort 320/9 mcg BID (i.e 160/4.5 mcg two inhalation BID) are not permitted. 1. Pulmonary function: A prealbuterol (salbutamol) FEV1 of 50% and 85% of predicted normal value at screening (Visit 1) after withholding asthma medications as detailed in the protocol (Section 6.8.1). Predicted FEV1 will be based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) predicted normal values for ages 8 years and older [Hankinson, 1999]. 2. Reversibility: An increase in FEV1 of 12% over the prealbuterol (salbutamol) FEV1 within 30 minutes after the inhalation of 24 puffs of albuterol (salbutamol). Historical documentation of reversibility will not be permitted. 3. Asthma symptom criteria: Each subject must have experienced asthma symptoms requiring albuterol (salbutamol) use within the 4 weeks preceding screening (Visit 1). Specific information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events, and other pertinent information on the investigational product that may impact subject eligibility is provided in the IB and the product labels. Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study: 1. LifeThreatening Asthma: A subject must not have lifethreatening asthma. Lifethreatening asthma is defined for this protocol as a history of significant asthma episode(s) requiring intubation associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures, or asthmarelated syncopal episode(s) within the 12 months prior to screening (Visit 1). 2. Worsening of Asthma: A subject must not have experienced a worsening of asthma which involved an ER visit, hospitalization or use of oral/parenteral corticosteroids within 4 weeks of screening (Visit 1). 3.
