	<brief_summary>A phase II study of Tarceva (Erlotinib) and predictive markers as first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer for patients unfit for chemotherapy (NSCLC) Clinical Phase II Stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Primary end point: Disease control rate (= CR+PR and SD at 8 weeks /patients). Secondary end point: Safety (Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events leading to premature withdrawal, unexpected TarcevaTM related AEs) .Correlation of EGFR expression rate (HER1) and FISH potentially predictive for response. An open-label, non randomized, multicenter, clinical trial of TarcevaTM as single agent The sample size is 29 patients in 2 stages and based on Simon´s optimal 2 stage design. Stage 1 will accrue 10 patients, if less than 1 response is observed the study will stop; if more than 1 response is observed the accrual will continue up till 29 patients. A total of 29 patients would be entered and the treatment will be declared to have sufficient activity to deserve further attention if at least 5 patients obtain disease control.</brief_summary>

Any other malignancies within 5 years (except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell skin cancer). Nursing mothers or pregnant woman. Hypersensitivity to Tarceva or coformulants. Patients with brain metastasis or spinal cord compression that has not yet been definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation. Patients with brain metastasis or spinal cord compression that not are in a stable condition despite treatment with steroids.</criteria>
