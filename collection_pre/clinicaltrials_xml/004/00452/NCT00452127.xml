	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I/II study of the safety of escalating doses of single-agent PRO131921 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive indolent NHL. The trial will enroll in two phases: a Phase I dose-escalation portion for patients with indolent NHL and a Phase II portion with enrollment of additional patients with follicular NHL into two expanded treatment cohorts in order to expand the safety database and collect preliminary anti-lymphoma activity data.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent Ability and willingness to comply with the requirements of the study protocol Age ≥ 18 years Documented history of histologically confirmed CD20positive follicular NHL (Phases I and II); for Phase I, other CD20positive indolent lymphomas (marginal zone lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma) are also included. Patients with a history of a CD20positive NHL of mixed (indolent/aggressive) histology may also be included in Phase I if the most recent relapse biopsy shows only indolent NHL Indolent lymphoma (Phase I) or follicular lymphoma (Phase II) that either has relapsed after a documented history of response (CR, CRu, or PR) of ≥6 months to a rituximabcontaining regimen or was refractory to a previous rituximabcontaining regimen Bidimensionally measurable disease, with at least one lesion &gt;1.5 cm in its largest dimension Absolute B‑cell count ≥LLN at screening (Phase I only) ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 For patients of reproductive potential (males and females), use of a reliable means of contraception during the study and for 1 year following the last dose of study treatment For females of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to enrollment Prior use of antiCD20 monoclonal antibody therapy (other than rituximab or radioimmunotherapy) Prior use of any nonCD20targeted monoclonal antibody therapy within 6 months of enrollment Current or recent lymphoma treatment History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to human, humanized, chimeric, or murine monoclonal antibodies Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, nervous system, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal disorders Evidence of myelodysplasia or myelodysplastic changes on bone marrow examination Untreated or persistent/recurrent malignancy (other than lymphoma) Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection A major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV antimicrobials within 4 weeks of screening or oral antimicrobials within 2 weeks of screening History of recurrent significant infection or bacterial infections Positive hepatitis B or C serology Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology Pregnancy or lactation Central nervous system lymphoma Recent major surgery within 4 weeks of screening, other than diagnostic surgery</criteria>
