	<brief_summary>A major complication of diabetes mellitus is diabetic nephropathy. In previous studies the investigators could demonstrate that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus despite unaltered basal and stimulated nitric oxide (NO) - activity, the renal response to the antioxidant vitamin C was more pronounced compared to control subjects. These data suggest that oxidative stress is increased in the renal vasculature of diabetic patients. Furthermore, NO-activity in diabetic patients appears to be up regulated to compensate for increase in oxidative stress. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in kidney biopsies of diabetic patients. Angiotensin receptor blockers have been found to reduce oxidative stress in various vascular beds. Some drugs of this class, Telmisartan for example, also exhibit partial agonist properties to the PPARÎ³ receptor and might be of great benefit for patients with diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome due to an additional improvement in insulin resistance. Despite its effect on oxidative stress angiotensin receptor blockers beneficially alter renal haemodynamics by reducing intraglomerular pressure and thus protect against glomerular injury. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging lead to the development of new techniques that allow a separate measurement of renal medullar and cortical perfusion. This magnetic resonance imaging technique might be a useful tool to detect alterations at an early level in the kidneys of patients at high risk for diabetic nephropathy. In the current study, the investigators want to evaluate the new magnetic resonance imaging technique by measuring medullar and cortical renal perfusion before and after pharmacological intervention with telmisartan in patients with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
