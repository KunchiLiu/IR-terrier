	<brief_title>Acamprosate Added to Escitalopram and Behavioral Treatment for Comorbid Depression and Alcoholism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression and alcohol use disorders contribute to a significant proportion of the burden of disease, in the United States and abroad. Patients who suffer from co-morbid depression and alcohol abuse/dependence have illnesses that are more severe, persistent and costly than people with either depression or an alcohol use disorder alone. The treatment of these patients remains controversial. Several studies have demonstrated that antidepressants can be safe and efficacious in the treatment of depression in people who continue to drink, and it is now considered the standard of care to provide such treatment. Other studies have shown that pharmacotherapy with naltrexone or acamprosate can help reduce drinking in alcoholics without co-morbid depression. A logical extension of these findings would be to study the treatment of depressed alcoholics with dual pharmacotherapy, combining an anti-depressant with a medication aimed at treating the alcohol use disorder. We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of escitalopram plus acamprosate and behavioral treatment vs. escitalopram plus placebo and behavioral treatment in 20 depressed alcoholics. Outcome measures will include depression, alcohol use and global functioning.</detailed_description>

Current diagnosis of alcohol abuse/dependence as per SCID I/P 1. Subjects with suicidal ideation where outpatient treatment is determined unsafe by the study clinician. These patients will be immediately referred to appropriate clinical treatment. 2. Pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using a medically accepted means of contraception (defined as oral contraceptive pill or implant, condom, diaphragm, spermicide, IUD, s/p tubal ligation, partner with vasectomy). 3. Known history of serious or unstable medical illness, including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, endocrine, neurologic or hematologic disease. 4. History of seizure disorder, brain injury, any history of known neurological disease (multiple sclerosis, degenerative disease such as ALS, Parkinson disease and any movement disorders, etc.). 5. Clinical or lab evidence of untreated hypothyroidism. 6. History or current diagnosis of the following DSMIV psychiatric illness: organic mental disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, psychotic disorders not otherwise specified, bipolar disorder, patients with mood congruent or mood incongruent psychotic features, patients with substance use disorders (excluding alcohol and nicotine) active within the last 12 months. 7. Current use of other psychotropic drugs, including current use of benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticonvulsants. Concomitant use of antihistamine drugs will be allowed. Patients will need to be off all antidepressants for at least two weeks by the time of the baseline visit, and four weeks for fluoxetine, and off benzodiazepines and other psychotropics for at least one week. The decision about whether to taper existing medications should be made by the individual and their primary treater based on clinical care and will not be made for purposes of study enrollment. allowed. 8. Patients who have failed to respond during the course of their current major depressive episode to at least two adequate antidepressant trials. An adequate antidepressant trial is defined as six weeks or more of treatment with escitalopram &gt; 20mg/day or its antidepressant equivalent: (fluoxetine 40mg/day, sertraline &gt; 100 mg/day, paroxetine &gt; 40 mg/day, fluvoxamine &gt; 100 mg/day, citalopram &gt; 40 mg/day, escitalopram &gt; 20 mg/day, venlafaxine &gt; 150 mg/day, and duloxetine &gt; 60 mg/day). 9. Any depressionfocused or substanceabuse focused psychotherapy (family or marital counseling would be allowed). 10. Patients who have taken an investigational psychotropic drug within the past year. 11. Need for medical or inpatient detoxification from alcohol. This determination will be made by the screening clinician, based on clinical judgement as in the multicenter STAR*D study (PHRC #2000P001955 in accordance with methods used in the multicenter STARD study.</criteria>
