	<brief_summary>Cardiac rehabilitation programmes are a proven treatment for individuals with recent myocardial infarction, resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality compared to usual care. Unfortunately, following completion of a cardiac rehabilitation programme, risk factors and lifestyle behaviours may deteriorate. The GOSPEL study investigates the benefits of a programme of continued educational and behavioural intervention to achieve optimal long-term secondary prevention goals.</brief_summary>
