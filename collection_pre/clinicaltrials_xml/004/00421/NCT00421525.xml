	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of hLL1 in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients receive hLL1 administered intravenously twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive escalating doses of hLL1 in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for this administration schedule. Up to approximately 30 additional patients will be entered at one or more dose levels at or below the MTD in order to determine the optimal dose for subsequent studies.</detailed_description>
