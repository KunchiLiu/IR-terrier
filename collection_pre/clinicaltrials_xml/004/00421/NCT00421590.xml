Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to first dosing, or longer if required by local regulation. Subjects with a hemoglobin level equal to or below 7.5 mmol/L at screening. Significant illness within two weeks prior to dosing.

A known hypersensitivity to the study drug or drugs similar to the study drug. Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or which may jeopardize the subject in case of participation in the study.
