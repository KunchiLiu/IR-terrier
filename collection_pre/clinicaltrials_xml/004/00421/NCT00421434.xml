	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nitazoxanide-peginterferon and nitazoxanide-peginterferon-ribavirin combination regimens compared to the standard of care (peginterferon-ribavirin) in treating chronic hepatitis C genotype 4. The study will also evaluate the effect of the studied treatment regimens on end of treatment virologic response, ALT normalization and safety parameters.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 years. Chronic hepatitis C infection (at least 6 months) evidenced by a positive enzyme immunoassay for antiHCVantibodies and a positive quantitative RTPCR amplification of HCV RNA. Chronic inflammation on liver biopsy compatible with a diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis. HCV genotype 4. Patients who have previously failed to respond to ≥12 weeks of peginterferonribavirin combination therapy. Females who are either pregnant, breastfeeding or not using birth control and are sexually active. Males whose female partners are pregnant. Patients with other causes of liver disease (i.e., autoimmune hepatitis, decompensated liver disease). Patients coinfected with hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis D virus. Patients with a history of alcoholism or with an alcohol consumption of &gt;40 grams per day. Patients with hemoglobinopathies (i.e., thalassemia major, sicklecell anemia). Patients with any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude evaluation of response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy and followup could be completed. History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to any of the excipients comprising the nitazoxanide tablets, peginterferon alfa2a injectionable solution or ribavirin tablets.</criteria>
