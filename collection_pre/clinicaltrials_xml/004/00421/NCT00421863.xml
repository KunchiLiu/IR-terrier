	<brief_summary>Multicenter, prospective, randomised, open study comparing the effect of the following two strategies in hypertensive subjects &gt; 55 years and poorly controlled (systolic blood pressure &gt;= 150 mmHg) by antihypertensive treatment: - usual strategy: reduction of systolic blood pressure to below 140 mmHg, independently of diastolic blood pressure levels; - intensive strategy: reduction of systolic blood pressure to below 130 mmHg, independently of diastolic blood pressure levels. During the initial run in period two qualifying visits at distance of 7-14 days will be carried out to establish whether blood pressure remains uncontrolled (systolic blood pressure &gt;=150 mmHg)by current drug treatment. At the end of the second visit eligible patients will be admitted to the study and the following examinations will be carried out: clinical visit, routine laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG. At this point eligible patients will be randomised to one of the two blood pressure goals outlined above. Subsequent clinical visits will be carried out at 4 month-intervals up to the end of the study (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 months).</brief_summary>
