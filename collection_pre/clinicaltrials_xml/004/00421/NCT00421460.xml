	<brief_title>The Therapy of Nebido as Mono or in Combination With PDE-5 Inhibitors in Hypogonadal Patients With Erectile Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypogonadism is a pathophysiologic and clinical factor in a substantial number of patients with ED,and data indicate that a threshold level of testosterone is necessary for normal erectile function.Testosterone therapy is clearly indicated in hypogonadal patients and is beneficial in other patients with ED and hypogonadism.However,testosterone efficacy as monotherapy for ED could be limited,and combination therapy with testosterone and other ED treatments,such as PDE-5 inhibitors may be valuable in certain subpopulations of patients.</detailed_description>
