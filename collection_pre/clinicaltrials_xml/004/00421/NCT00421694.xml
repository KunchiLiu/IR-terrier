	<brief_summary>Following radical prostatectomy (RP), about 20% to 40% of the patients with prostate cancer (PCa) exhibit pathological parameters which are associated with a high risk of disease recurrence. The rationale for NHT is based on the theory that androgen ablation induces PCa apoptosis which induces a regression of the primary tumor bulk before RP. However the use of NHT prior RP is highly controversial. In spite of these unenthusiastic results, the relative short time of treatment and the use of different drugs from those utilized in other trials might still to make this regimen attractive in terms of drug related side effects and effectiveness. In this regard, Bicalutamide presents unique characteristics since it work differently respect to other anti-hormonal agents by interfering on both genotropic and non-genotropic mechanisms of androgen receptor</brief_summary>
