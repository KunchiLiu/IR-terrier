	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of bevacizumab and sunitinib given in combination for kidney cancer. The drugs act to stop blood vessel growth but in different ways. They have not been studied together in a previous study. We also want to find out what effects (good and bad) the combination of bevacizumab and sunitinib have on you and your tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of Bevacizumab and Sunitinib in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the maximum tolerated dose and overall safety and tolerability of sunitinib administered in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. To assess antitumor activity of the combination of sunitinib and bevacizumab. To evaluate serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients treated with sunitinib and bevacizumab. Study Design: This is a single center, open-label, Phase 1 study of sunitinib in combination with bevacizumab in patients with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study is designed to confirm that the two agents can be administered safely in combination. Patients will begin treatment with bevacizumab on Day 0 and sunitinib on Day 1. Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously every two weeks. Sunitinib will be given orally on a 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off schedule. DLT determination will be based on toxicities observed in Cycles 1 - a cycle is defined by sunitinib dosing (6 weeks). Once the MTD for the combination has been identified, 10 additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to further assess safety and efficacy. Patients will be treated with bevacizumab and sunitinib until there is disease progression, significant toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent. The maximum treatment duration is 24 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma (of any histological subtype) and with metastases. Patients with unresected primary tumors may be enrolled as long as evidence of metastatic disease is also present. Evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease (i.e., greater than or equal to 1 malignant tumor mass that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional computerized tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or greater than or equal to 10 mm with spiral CT scan [if spiral CT scan is used, minimum lesion size should be twice the reconstruction interval used, e.g., if reconstruction size is 7 mm, lesion size should be greater than or equal to 14 mm]). Bone lesions, ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis or miliary lesions, pleural or pericardial effusions, lymphangitis of the skin or lung, cystic lesions, or irradiated lesions are not considered measurable. Male or female, 18 years of age or older. ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgical procedure to NCI CTCAE grade less than or equal to 1. Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria: Serum aspartate transaminase (AST; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Total serum bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL Total white blood cell count greater than or equal to 3000 cells/µL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1500/µL Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/µL Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL Serum calcium less than or equal to 12.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 x ULN PT less than or equal to 1.5 ULN Urine protein:creatinine ratio less than or equal to 1.0 at screening Negative pregnancy test (only in women of childbearing age) Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrollment. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Patients eligible for the higher priority IRB protocol #07066 Major surgery, open biopsy, traumatic injury, radiation or systemic therapy within 4 weeks of starting the study treatment. Anticipation of major surgical procedure during the study. Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted, provided there is at least one measurable lesion that has not been irradiated. More than 2 prior systemic therapies for metastatic RCC. Minor surgical procedures such as fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days prior to Day 0. NCI CTCAE grade 3 hemorrhage within the past 1 month. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to Day 0. History of or known brain metastases, current spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis. Any of the following within the 12 months prior to study drug administration: severe/unstable angina, MI, CABG, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack or peripheral vascular disease. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE grade greater than or equal to 2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or prolongation of the QTc interval to &gt;450 msec for males and &gt;470 msec for females. Blood pressure &gt; 150/90mmHg Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer or bone fracture Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)related illness. Current treatment on another therapeutic clinical trial. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within the 7 days prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. Receipt of any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to study entry. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to bevacizumab or to any other component of bevacizumab. Prior treatment with sunitinib, bevacizumab Prior sorafenib given less than 8 weeks prior to study entry. Unresolved symptoms or signs related to sorafenib within 8 weeks prior to study entry. Use of therapeutic doses of coumadin. Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures</criteria>
