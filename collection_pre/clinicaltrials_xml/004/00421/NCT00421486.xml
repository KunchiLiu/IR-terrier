	<brief_summary>Human papillomavirus (HPV)-infection belong to the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. HIV-infected men having sex with men /MSM) are strongly associated with a higher prevalence of genitoanal HPV-infection, and perianal HPV-infections have been detected in up to 90% of HIV-positive men. The data concerning the incidence of oral HPV-infection in HIV-positive men, especially in the era of highly antiretroviral therapy, are conflicting. Thus, this prospective study mainly focuses on the incidence and prevalence of oral HPV-infection, spectrum of HPV-types, and oral high-risk HPV viral load in HIV-positive men.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human papillomavirus (HPV)-infection belong to the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. Estimated prevalences of subclinical genital HPV-infection in the immunocompetent sexually active population range from 10 to above 50%. Genetic or iatrogenic immunosuppression is known to play a decisive role in the initiation of a variety of cutaneous neoplasias and their precursor lesions. In this context, HPV-associated anogenital malignancies occur with high frequency in patients with HIV-infection. In several studies, perianal HPV-infections have been detected in up to 90% of HIV-positive men and a high incidence of anal dysplasia has been reported in these patients. The data concerning the incidence of oral HPV-infection in HIV-positive men, especially in the era of highly antiretroviral therapy, are conflicting. Thus, this prospective study mainly focuses on the incidence and prevalence of oral HPV-infection, spectrum of HPV-types, and oral high-risk HPV viral load in HIV-positive men.</detailed_description>
