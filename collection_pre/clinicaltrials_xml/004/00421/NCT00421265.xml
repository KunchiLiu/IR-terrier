	<brief_summary>In patients with prostate cancer with indolent features, disease progrssion may be very slow and in many cases will never become clinically evident during the patient's lifetime. Active surveillance is a continuous process of monitoring disease characteristcs aiming to avoid the morbidity of active therapy in patients with stabe indolent parameters, while offering early detection of disease activity in others who will need active therapy to control their disease. We hypothesize that active surveillance will permit the avoidance of therapy related morbidity in the majority of appropriate patients and will be associated with maintaining their quality of life.</brief_summary>
