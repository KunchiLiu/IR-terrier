	<brief_summary>The proposed protocol is a double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study of the safety and efficacy of Adderall-XR (ER-MAS) and topiramate in the treatment of cocaine dependence. Since both of these medications have independently shown promise in helping with cocaine abuse we are proposing that together they may be even more successful in the treatment of cocaine abuse. We plan to enroll 120 subjects in a 14-week trial. The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of ER-MAS and topiramate in promoting cocaine abstinence among cocaine-dependent patients. This study includes free treatment for cocaine dependence that includes medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Placebo-Controlled Study of Mixed Amphetamine Salts and Topiramate for the Treatment of Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of ER-MAS and topiramate in promoting cocaine abstinence among cocaine-dependent patients. Primary Hypothesis: The proportion of participants achieving sustained cocaine abstinence (via urine toxicology) for three consecutive weeks during the study will be significantly greater for the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group. Hypothesis 2: The proportion of urine samples negative for cocaine metabolites will be greater in the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group. Hypothesis 3: The pattern of cocaine use (amount of cocaine used per day in dollars and the number of using days per week), as measured by the time-line follow-back method, will show a greater reduction in use for the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of ER-MAS and topiramate on cocaine craving among cocaine-dependent patients. Hypothesis 4: Cocaine craving symptoms will be reduced to a greater degree in the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group. Specific Aim 3: To explore a set of related secondary outcomes (treatment retention, global functioning, HIV risk behavior) as well as moderators and mediators potentially reflective of mechanism of action.</detailed_description>

They must also agree to use a method of contraception with proven efficacy and agree not to become pregnant during the study. To confirm this, blood pregnancy tests will be repeated monthly. Women will be provided a full explanation of the potential dangers of pregnancy while on the study medication. If a woman becomes pregnant, the study medication will be discontinued. 1.
