	<brief_summary>N-cadherin, a protein involved in blood vessel cell binding and on the surface of many tumor cells, is increased as cancer progresses. ADH-1 blocks N-cadherin. This study will test the safety and effects of the combination ADH-1 with Normothermic Isolated Limb Infusion of Melphalan in subjects with locally advanced malignant melanoma.</brief_summary>
