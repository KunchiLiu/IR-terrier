	<brief_title>Experimental Study to Assess Interventions Aimed at Improving the Equity Impact of Community-Based Health Insurance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community based health insurance is often cited as a means of improving access and financial protection in developing countries, but such schemes may not benefit the poorest. We evaluate alternative strategies for improving the uptake of benefits of a community based health insurance scheme by its poorest members. Comparisons: Three groups are compared to standard insurance scheme members (Control). One group is provided with after-sale service and supportive supervision (AfterSS). A second group is provided with prospective reimbursement (PR). A third group is provided with these two interventions together (Both).</detailed_description>
