	<brief_summary>Statin therapy is a treatment with a proven positive impact on survival after heart transplantation. However, it is unclear whether the beneficial effect of this class of drugs depends solely on their LDL-lowering properties or on anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory properties. Thus, this study was designed to compare safety and efficacy of two different strategies: 1. high fixed statin dose vs. 2. low starting dose with LDL-driven doses adjustments.</brief_summary>
