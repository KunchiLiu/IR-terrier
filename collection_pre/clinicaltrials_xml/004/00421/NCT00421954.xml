	<brief_summary>This open-label study will assess the medication Geodon速 (Ziprasidone) in pediatric patients, aged 13-17, diagnosed with psychotic disorder. Eligible adolescents will receive Geodon速 for 7 weeks and stay at the NYSPI Children's Day Unit (CDU) during the day. If clinically appropriate, they may also stay at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) Schizophrenia Research Unit (SRU) inpatient facility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-label Ziprasidone Study for Psychosis Treatment in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label assessment of the feasibility of treating adolescents with psychotic disorders (schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified [NOS], major depressive disorder with psychotic features, and bipolar disorder with psychotic features) in an inpatient and day hospital setting with ziprasidone (Geodon). Ziprasidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) that is FDA-approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of the manic phase of bipolar disorder in adults. It is also used clinically in the treatment of psychotic disorders in children, adolescents and adults. This protocol will help to elucidate the feasibility of studying the treatment of psychotic disorders with ziprasidone in adolescents 13-17 years and help facilitate the further study of the treatment of psychosis with novel agents that have a favorable side effect and weight gain profile. The duration of the study can be up to 7 weeks. Depending on the level of symptom severity patients will be managed on either the Schizophrenia Research Unit (SRU) (GAS&lt;35, CGI-S&gt;5), or the Children's Day Unit (CDU) of the NYSPI. The seven weeks would encompass a 3 day period at the beginning of the study including time for screening and reviewing lab results. Over a period of one to two weeks patients will be titrated up to 120 mg/day (80 mg for patients under 45kg), and, if necessary, cross tapered off of another SGA that had not been working successfully. Subjects who do not respond to the medication after 1 week at the target dose will be discontinued from the study.</detailed_description>
