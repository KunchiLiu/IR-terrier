	<brief_summary>Several studies have reported greater weight loss when following high meat-protein diets but limited studies have studied high plant-based protein diets. Thus we aim to investigate the effect of high protein diets in weight management and also to investigate the superior protein source in achieving this effect. In addition, we aim to develop dietary intervention strategies that are realistic and sustainable.</brief_summary>
