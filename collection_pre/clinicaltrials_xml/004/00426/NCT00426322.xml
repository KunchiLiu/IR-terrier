	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical study is to compare the amount of newly formed bone after bone augmentation with Bio-Oss® (BO) 0.25-1 mm vs. Bio-Oss® (BO) 1-2 mm in the sinus floor augmentation procedure bilaterally in 8 patients. Hypothesis: There is no difference in the relative amount of newly formed bone plus BO between the large (1-2 mm) and small (0.25 - 1 mm) granules.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Sinus Floor Augmentation Using Large or Small Bovine Bone Mineral.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the use of bovine bone mineral particles (Bio-Oss®)in sinus floor augmentation is well established. bovine bone mineral is an oseoconductive material which serves as a space maintainer and a scaffold for bone augmentation. the commercial product is manufactured in two different particles sizes, "large"1-2 mm, and "small"0.25-1 mm. Comparison: the histologic characteristics of augmented bone after the use of Bio-Oss® (BO) with particle size of 0.25-1 mm vs. Bio-Oss® (BO)with particle size of 1-2 mm.</detailed_description>
