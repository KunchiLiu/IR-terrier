	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the treatment combination of the commercially available chemotherapy drugs, docetaxel and liposomal doxorubicin, and a blood thinner Enoxaparin on pancreatic cancer. The main goal of the study is to find out if this combination chemotherapy and enoxaparin increases the number of individuals whose tumors shrink.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel and Liposomal Doxorubicin Chemotherapy With Enoxaparin in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of docetaxel and liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy combined with enoxaparin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Docetaxel (TAXOTERE) belongs to the group of anticancer drugs called mitotic inhibitors. Liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) is an anthracycline, and is thought to prevent nucleic acid synthesis that is needed to make DNA. Enoxaparin (Lovenox) is an anticoagulant. We are interested in combining chemotherapy with the blood thinner enoxaparin because there is a scientific link between blood clotting and malignancy. This research is being done to improve on currently available chemotherapy treatments for advanced pancreatic cancer. The main goal of the study is to find out if this combination chemotherapy and enoxaparin increases the number of individuals whose tumors shrink. Another purpose of this study is to find out how this study treatment effects blood clotting levels in individuals. We will also determine the incidence of elevated D-dimer and the effect of this regimen on the level of D-dimer, and collect safety data on this regimen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed pancreatic carcinoma, with at least one lesion measurable by CT scan with a longest diameter of &gt; 10mm, (other than bone) that has either not been previously irradiated, or if previously irradiated, has demonstrated progression since the radiation therapy based on RECIST criteria. Locallyadvanced unresectable disease or be ineligible for neoadjuvant therapy (Stage III disease, unresectable and medically unfit for neoadjuvant treatment or decline chemo radiation treatment) or have metastatic disease. 18 years of age or greater. Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. All patients of reproductive potential must agree to practice effective contraception in order to participate in this study for duration of treatment and for 3 months post. WBC &gt;3000 cells/mm3 with segments over 1800, hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl, platelets &gt;150,000 cells/mm3, creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dl. Hepatic function: Total Bilirubin &lt;/= ULN. AST and ALT and Alkaline Phosphatase must be within the range allowing for eligibility. In determining eligibility the more abnormal of the two values (AST or ALT) should be used. ECOG performance status of &lt;/= 2 and an expected survival of at least 3 months. Stable neurological status without clinical evidence of CNS metastases and/or stroke. Peripheral neuropathy must be &lt;/= Grade 1. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 4 weeks. Patients must never have had docetaxel or liposomal or regular doxorubicin. Spinal/epidural anesthesia and/or catheters for pain management New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure Evidence of duodenal erosion from the cancer. Heparin or coumadin at the time of enrollment, with the exception of low dose coumadin (1 mg/day or less) administered prophylactically and/or heparin for maintenance of indwelling lines or ports. Acute DVT or PE on initial evaluation History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80 Pregnant or breast feeding Undergone a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or major traumatic injury less than 4 weeks prior to study entry. Fine needle aspirations or venous access devices are allowed if placed &gt; 7 days before study treatment begins. Presence of active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection, including abscess or fistula HIV positive History of another malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry, except curatively treated basal cell skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ Medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude study or informed consent and/or history of noncompliance to medical regimens or inability or unwillingness to return for all scheduled visits Enoxaparin is contraindicated in patients with active major bleeding or who are at high risk for bleeding, in patients with thrombocytopenia associated with a positive in vitro test for antiplatelet antibody in the presence of enoxaparin sodium, or in patients with hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium. Patients with known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products should not be treated with enoxaparin injection or any of its constituents.</criteria>
