	<brief_summary>multicenter, randomized (1:1), semi-single blind study comparing the safety and efficacy of HDSD daptomycin (10 mg/kg q24h for 4 days) with that of comparator (vancomycin +/- SSP for 7-14 days) in patients with cSSSI due to Gram-positive bacteria. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either daptomycin 10 mg/kg i.v. q24h for 4 days or vancomycin 1 g. q12h for up to 14 days.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>multicenter, randomized (1:1), semi-single blind study comparing the safety and efficacy of HDSD daptomycin (10 mg/kg q24h for 4 days) with that of comparator (vancomycin +/- SSP for 7-14 days) in patients with cSSSI due to Gram-positive bacteria. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either daptomycin 10 mg/kg i.v. q24h for 4 days or vancomycin 1 g. q12h for up to 14 days. The main criteria for evaluation will be: - Efficacy - Safety - Microbiologic eradication</detailed_description>
