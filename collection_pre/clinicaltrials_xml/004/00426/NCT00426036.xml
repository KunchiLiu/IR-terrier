	<criteria>Male and female subjects/patients from 1860 years of age Body mass index (BMI) must be within the range of 18 and 30 kg/mÂ². Subjects/patients must weigh a minimum of 50 kg. Female subjects/patients must either have been surgically sterilized or hysterectomized at least 6 months prior to screening. Subject/patient must be able to provide written informed consent prior to study participation. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values at the screening evaluation or at the baseline reevaluation, for patients excluding those normally associated with severe degree of renal impairment or the primary cause of renal insufficiency. Use of any overthecounter medications or herbal / natural supplements during 2 weeks prior to dosing. (acetaminophen is acceptable, but must be documented in the Concomitant Medications / NonDrug Therapies page of the CRF). Participation in any clinical investigation within 4 weeks prior to dosing or longer if required by local regulation. Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to dosing or other amount considered to compromise the health of the subject/patient if previous history of anemia exists. Significant acute illness within the two weeks prior to dosing. History of any significant cardiovascular events (M.I., angioplasty, angina) within 6 months of study start. A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history of a prolonged QTinterval syndrome. History of hyponatremia. History of seizures. Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs other than renal impairment or which may jeopardize the subject/patient in case of participation in the study. The investigator should be guided by history of any of the following: inflammatory bowel syndrome, gastritis, ulcers, gastrointestinal or rectal bleeding gastropathy (gastroparesis) or enteropathy major gastrointestinal tract surgery such as gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, or bowel resection clinical evidence of pancreatic injury or pancreatitis History of immunocompromise, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot) test result. A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result . History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 6 months prior to dosing or evidence of such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening or baseline evaluations. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
