	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish safety and feasibility of utilizing Adipose Derived Stem &amp; Regenerative Cells (ADRCs) in patients who have areas of myocardium that are not revascularizable and have demonstrated reversible ischemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Clinical Trial of Adipose-derived Stem Cells in Treatment of Non Revascularizable Ischemic Myocardium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects who have coronary artery disease that cannot be revascularized and demonstrate reversible ischemia in the area supplied by the non-revascularizable vessel(s) will be evaluated for eligibility in this study. Eligible subjects will undergo standard pre-operative testing after admission to the hospital, and then will undergo liposuction under anesthesia, after which ADRCs will be isolated from the lipoaspirate. According to randomization subjects will receive either ADRCs or placebo. The outcomes of this trial will be based on assessment of primary and secondary endpoints at 6 months post index procedure. Long Term Follow-up will be conducted at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months after the procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Able to provide written informed consent Males or females 20 to 75 years of age, inclusive Coronary artery disease not amenable to any type of revascularization procedure (percutaneous or surgical) in the target area Hemodynamic stability Ability to undergo liposuction Ability to walk on a treadmill Negative urine pregnancy test (females only). Key Unstable angina Serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL Planned or scheduled staged treatment of CAD or other interventional or surgical procedures Cardiogenic shock History of resuscitated sudden cardiac death; or symptomatic or sustained ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Vascular anatomy that precludes cardiac catheterization Peripheral artery disease that precludes insertion of an 8 Fr sheath Severe valvular disease Pregnant or nursing females Known and relevant allergies or sensitivities Life expectancy &lt;1 year Participation in any other clinical research study that has not reached its primary endpoint or otherwise would interfere with the subject's participation in this study Any concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.</criteria>
