	<criteria>Signed informed consent for study by subject, or parent/guardian if subject is a minor. Assent will be obtained from all minors 11 years of age and older. Histological findings on esophageal biopsy to include peak eosinophil density â‰¥ 24 per high power field (400x) in the proximal or distal esophagus validated by a pathologist at CCHMC. Allergy evaluation including skinprick testing with multiple food antigens to ensure elimination diet is not indicated. Have undergone a minimum 3 months of elimination diet as indicated by skinprick testing without detectable resolution by repeat endoscopy with biopsies demonstrating persistent EE OR subject/parental refusal to follow elimination diet. If the subject/parent refuses the elimination diet, they are eligible for this study. Treatment with a protonpump inhibitor for at least two months (rounded to nearest month) prior to endoscopy OR failure of histological improvement as defined by &lt; 1 eosinophil per HPF after 2 month (rounded to nearest month) trial of proton pump inhibitor documented by prior endoscopy. The PPI must be used prior to endoscopy to rule out the possibility of GERD. History of poor tolerance to Fluticasone Propionate (FP), as defined as multiple episodes of oral candidiasis, hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis suppression as evidenced by signs of Cushing syndrome, headaches, or increased respiratory infections during exposure to Flovent Unable to cooperate with use of MDI Pregnant females Concurrent or recent (within 3 months) use of systemic corticosteroids. Unable to swallow medicines (i.e., fed only by gastrostomy tube). Comorbid eosinophilic disorders. Previously treated with swallowed glucocorticoid for EE within 3 months of the screening visit. Nasal glucocorticoids taken for EE are permitted.</criteria>
