	<brief_summary>Prospective controlled randomized clinical trial. Consecutive patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities, with or without contemporary manifestations of pulmonary embolism, are randomized to receive either a below-knee or a full-leg graduated compression (30-40 mm Hg at the ankle) elastic stocking for prevention of the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). All patients are followed up to three years to assess the development of the PTS, defined according to a validated clinical score (the Villalta scale). The rate of PTS is compared between the two study groups. In addition, there is an assessment of patients' compliance and tolerability of the two different devices.</brief_summary>
