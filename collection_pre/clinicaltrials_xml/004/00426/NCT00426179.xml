	<criteria>Healthy male nonsmoking subjects aged 1855 years, with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis consistent with Timothy grass pollen allergy. They must show: a positive skin prick test to Timothy grass pollen (wheal difference Timothy grass pollen negative control ≥ 3 mm) at or within the 12 months preceding the screening visit and demonstrate symptomatic worsening (TNSS ≥4) within one hour after nasal allergen challenge Be otherwise healthy with no health problems that may jeopardize the subjects participating in the study, absence of history of other significant allergies. Subjects and their partners must agree to use effective contraceptive measures from screening until the end of study visit. Respiratory disease other than a history of mild stable asthma not requiring treatment and associated with normal lung function. Structural nasal abnormalities or nasal polyps on examination, a history of frequent nose bleeding, recent nasal surgery or recent (within 8 weeks prior to baseline visit) or recent (four weeks) or ongoing upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Use of any medication that would affect the response to the allergen challenge (e.g. corticosteroids, decongestants, antihistamines, medications with antiinflammatory effects) or any other nasally applied medication within 14 days prior to allergen challenge (30 days for systemic antiinflammatory therapy including oral corticosteroids), or known to influence Imatinib bioavailability or clearance History or laboratory evidence of acute or chronic renal insufficiency or abnormal liver function. Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from or be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the investigator or the sponsor at any time. Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prematurely for one of the following reasons: Subject withdrew consent Upper respiratory tract infection Presence of allergic rhinitis symptoms in the screening period or prior to prewash on Day 1 A past medical history of inherited heart disease, valve defect, cardiomyopathy, rheumatic fever, arrhythmias, cardiac interventions or clinically significant ECG abnormalities. Adverse events and nontolerable symptoms resulting from allergen challenge Administration of a concomitant medication (other than those randomized to receive Fluticasone propionate) that would impact on the study results (e.g. corticosteroids), including any subjects requiring asthma therapy (inhaled or systemic). Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
