	<brief_summary>a statement of the study hypothesis:the effect of valsartan in patients with IgA nephropathy have been proved,and the efficacy of probucol in combination with valsartan is to be proved in patients with IgA nephropathy. This is a prospective randomized controlled, double blinded pilot study to identify the efficacy of probucol in combination with valsartan in patients with IgA nephropathy. The renal function deterioration will be the primary outcome studied. The expected study duration will be 36 months.</brief_summary>
