	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of romidepsin in patients with progressive or relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) who have already been treated with systemic therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Romidepsin for Progressive or Relapsed Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm trial. This study is designed on the basis of complete response [CR or CR(u)] as the measure of efficacy, based on the best overall response of each patient. The sample size of 65 patients evaluable for efficacy would yield lower 95% confidence limits on the rate of CR + CR(u) that would range from 2.2% to 7.7%, if the observed rate of CR + CR(u) ranges from 8% to 15%. The study was amended to include an Extension Phase, during which patients at non-US sites who are benefitting from treatment can continue to receive romidepsin. The Extension Study Phase is active in EU countries where currently no Marketing Authorisation exists for romidepsin. Patients may remain on study until progressive disease occurs or they withdraw their consent and only serious adverse events and study drug administration data will continue to be collected and reported for these patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must fulfill all of the following criteria to be eligible for study participation and have: Histologically confirmed PTCL not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma, extranodal natural killer (NK)/Tcell lymphoma nasal type, enteropathy type Tcell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitislike Tcell lymphoma, cutaneous γδ Tcell lymphoma (excludes mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome), transformed mycosis fungoides, hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL; anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]1 negative), or patients with ALK 1 expressing ALCL (ALK1 positive) who have relapsed disease after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT); Age ≥18 years; Written informed consent; Progressive disease following at least one systemic therapy or refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy; Measurable disease according to the International Workshop Response (IWC) criteria and/or measurable cutaneous disease; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02; Serum potassium ≥3.8 mmol/L and magnesium ≥0.85 mmol/L (electrolyte abnormalities can be corrected with supplementation to meet inclusion criteria); Negative urine or serum pregnancy test on females of childbearing potential; and All women of childbearing potential must use an effective barrier method of contraception (either an intrauterine contraceptive device [IUCD] or double barrier method using condoms or a diaphragm plus spermicide) during the treatment period and for at least 1 month thereafter. Male patients should use a barrier method of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 1 month thereafter. Hormonal methods of contraception such as the contraceptive pill or patch (particularly those containing ethinylestradiol) should be avoided due to a potential drug interaction. Patients are ineligible for entry if any of the following criteria are met: Known central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma [computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are required only if brain metastasis is suspected clinically]; Chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks of study entry (6 weeks if nitrosoureas given); Initiation of corticosteroids during study (defined as 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1[C1D1] until study drug discontinuation) Patients treated with a pulse of steroids were to discontinue steroid use 7 days prior to C1D1 and have a repeat CT scan and disease assessment after discontinuation of corticosteroids and before starting romidepsin; Concomitant use of any other anticancer therapy; Concomitant use of any investigational agent; Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks of study entry; Any known cardiac abnormalities such as: Congenital long QT syndrome; QTc interval &gt;480 milliseconds (msec); A myocardial infarction within 6 months of C1D1. Patients with a history of myocardial infraction between 6 and 12 months prior to C1D1 who are asymptomatic and have had a negative cardiac risk assessment (treadmill stress test, nuclear medicine stress test, or stress echocardiogram) since the event may participate; Other significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities including 2nd degree atrioventricular (AV) block type II, 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardia (ventricular rate less than 50 beats/min). Symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), e.g., angina Canadian Class IIIV. In any patient in whom there is doubt, the patient should be referred to a cardiologist for evaluation; An ECG recorded at screening showing significant ST depression (ST depression of ≥2 mm, measured from isoelectric line to the ST segment at a point 60 msec at the end of the QRS complex). If in any doubt, the patient should have a stress imaging study and, if abnormal, angiography to define whether or not CAD is present; Congestive heart failure (CHF) that meets New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II to IV definitions and/or ejection fraction &lt;40% by MUGA scan or &lt;50% by echocardiogram and/or MRI; A known history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), Torsade de Pointes, or cardiac arrest unless currently addressed with an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD); Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or restrictive cardiomyopathy from prior treatment or other causes (if in doubt, see ejection fraction criteria above); Uncontrolled hypertension, i.e., blood pressure (BP) of ≥160/95; patients who have a history of hypertension controlled by medication must be on a stable dose (for at least one month) and meet all other inclusion criteria; Any cardiac arrhythmia requiring antiarrhythmic medication; Serum potassium &lt;3.8 mmol/L or serum magnesium &lt;0.85 mmol/L (electrolyte abnormalities can be corrected with supplementation to meet inclusion criteria); Concomitant use of drugs that may cause a significant prolongation of the QTc; Concomitant use of CYP3A4 significant or moderate inhibitors; Concomitant use of therapeutic warfarin or another anticoagulant due to a potential drug interaction. Use of a small dose of a anticoagulant to maintain patency of venous access port and cannulas is permitted; Clinically significant active infection; Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; Previous extensive radiotherapy involving ≥30% of bone marrow (e.g., whole pelvis, half spine), excluding patients who have had total body irradiation as part of a conditioning regimen for ASCT; Major surgery within 2 weeks of study entry; Previous allogeneic stem cell transplant; Inadequate bone marrow or other organ function as evidenced by: Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL (transfusions and/or erythropoietin are permitted); Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤1.0 × 10^9 cells/L [patients with neutropenia (ANC 11.5 10^9 cells/L) as a function of their disease may be supported with granulocytecolony stimulating factor (GCSF)]; Platelet count &lt;100 × 10^9 cells/L or platelet count &lt;75 × 10^9 cells/L if bone marrow disease involvement is documented; Total bilirubin &gt;2.0 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or &gt;3.0 × ULN in the presence of demonstrable liver metastases; Aspartate transaminase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) and alanine transaminase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) &gt;2.0 × ULN or &gt;3.0 × ULN in the presence of demonstrable liver metastases; or Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 × ULN; Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding; Coexistent second malignancy or history of prior solid organ malignancy within previous 3 years (excluding basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and in situ carcinoma of the cervix (CIN 1) that has been treated curatively); Any prior history of a hematologic malignancy (other than Tcell lymphoma); Any significant medical or psychiatric condition that might prevent the patient from complying with all study procedures; or Prior exposure to romidepsin (other histone deacetylase inhibitors are allowed).</criteria>
