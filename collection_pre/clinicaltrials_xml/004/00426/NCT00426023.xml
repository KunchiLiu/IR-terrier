	<brief_title>Cyclosporin A Eye Drop Treatment in Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a severe allergic disease, characterised by chronic ocular surface inflammation with seasonal relapses. Active phases of VKC require treatment with topical steroids to control inflammation and corneal damage that may lead to impairment of visual function and severe ocular discomfort. To date, safe and effective therapies in preventing relapses and controlling active phases of VKC are not available. Few controlled trials have used topical Cyclosporine A (CsA) for the treatment of VKC. The present multicenter, double-masked, randomised, controlled clinical trial will allow to obtain further data on the safety and efficacy of topical treatment with Cyclosporine in patients affected by VKC. Moreover, this study will evaluate the efficacy of topical CsA in both preventing the relapses of VKC and controlling the active phases of the disease. It is important to highlight that Cyclosporine eye drops are not currently commercially available in Italy and must be custom-made by specialized pharmacies. As VKC mostly affects young patients, it influences their daily life and their social interactions. Moreover, the severe signs and symptoms of the disease result in frequent ophthalmologic controls, influencing school activities of children and working days for their parents with a relevant economic cost for the National Health System. Comparisons: Efficacy of Cyclosporine A 0.05% eye-drops in preventing VKC relapses compared to standard antiallergic (Ketotifen fumarate 0.025% eye-drops) treatment, and efficacy of Cyclosporine A 0.1% eye-drops in controlling acute phases compared to antiinflammatory (Desametasone 0.15% eye drops) treatments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients affected by VKC will be enrolled by the three Centres involved in the project Diagnosis of VKC will be performed on the basis of personal and family history of systemic allergic diseases, clinical examination (presence of conjunctival tarsal and/or limbal papillae) and presence of eosinophils in the conjunctival scraping Contact lens wearers Patients affected by other ocular diseases Patients subjected to ocular surgery in the preceding 6 months Patients under eye drop or systemic treatments for other diseases, or Patients enrolled in experimental trials in the preceding 6 months</criteria>
