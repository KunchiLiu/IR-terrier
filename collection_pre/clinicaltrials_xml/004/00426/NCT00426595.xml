	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease and reflux-esophagitis are a major chronic problem in most children with cerebral palsy and mental retardation. Oral administration of enteric-coated formulations of the acid-labile proton pump inhibitor omeprazole is often problematic in these patients who may be suffering from swallowing disorders. A suspension of omeprazole in a sodium bicarbonate solution is often used for administration via the gastrostomy tube. This trial aims to compare the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole administered through the gastrostomy tube as a suspension in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy and mental retardation versus the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole administered as a multi-unit-pellet system (MUPSÂ®). The crossover study will consist of 2 consecutive treatment periods of 14 days.</brief_summary>
