	<brief_summary>Patients who had received kidney transplantation may suffer from rejection. Recently, positive staining for C4d in kidney biopsies of malfunctioning transplant kidney is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic indicator of poorer long-term kidney outcome. Data is, however, lacking in Hong Kong.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study on a New Staining Method (C4d Staining) of Transplanted Kidney Biopsies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>All renal allograft biopsies performed in Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) during the period 1st April 2003 to 31st August 2005 for unexplained acute renal dysfunction (Creatinine rise from baseline by â‰¥ 20%) or delayed graft function in the immediate posttransplantation period were included in the study. Both cadaveric and livingdonor transplant allografts were included. patients who were &lt; 18 years' old at the time of renal biopsy or whose records were so incomplete that preclude meaningful analysis</criteria>
