	<brief_title>Anisometropia Amblyopia Improved by Perceptual Learning and Patching</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with anisometropic amblyopia were randomized to patching or perceptual learning group. Corrected amblyopic logMAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity function were measured at four-weekly intervals until visual acuity stabilized or amblyopia resolved. Improvement in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and the resolution of amblyopia were compared between groups.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Anisometropia without strabismus An interocular acuity difference of at least 0.2 logMAR in children (3â€“7 years of age) or in older children and adult patients without a history of patching or atropine penalization All patients wore their spectacle at least one year A history of prior spectacle correction A history of patching or optical penalization The existence of an ocular disease that could contribute to decreased visual acuity Learning difficulties The presence of strabismus</criteria>
