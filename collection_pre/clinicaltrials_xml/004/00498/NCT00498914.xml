	<criteria>Male or female subjects aged 18 years or older Histologically confirmed primary DLBCL of any stage Refractory to the last treatment regimen Previously treated with the following treatment regimens: Anthracyclinebased combination chemotherapy with rituximab Secondline combination chemotherapy Autologous BMT if the subject was eligible and did not refuse the procedure At least one measurable lesion defined as &gt; 1.5 cm in the longest diameter No known central nervous system involvement ECOG performance status &lt; 2 Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks If female, nonpregnant and nonlactating IRBapproved consent and HIPAA Authorization Transformed, composite or discordant lymphoma Therapy for lymphoma within 21 days prior to the first dose of YM155 Within 4 weeks of the screening FDGPET scan, receipt of the following: Radiation therapy Surgical procedures (except biopsies and central catheter / port placement) Active infection (bloodstream or deep tissue) Inadequate marrow, hepatic and/or renal function Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN or calculated serum creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &lt; 750/mm3 Platelet &lt; 50,000/mm3 Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate Transaminase (AST) &gt; 2.5 x ULN; &gt; 5 x ULN if secondary to liver metastases Treated with &gt; 3 prior treatment regimens. The following should be considered: Planned maintenance therapy should be considered as part of the previous treatment regimen Any preparative treatment (salvage chemotherapy, highdose chemotherapy, radiation therapy, etc.) should be included with the autologous BMT or PBSCT as one treatment Prior allogeneic BMT or PBSCT Previously treated with YM155 Other investigational therapy or procedures within 28 days Known HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibody Other malignancy requiring treatment within 2 years Significant and/or uncontrolled cardiac, renal, hepatic, or other systemic disorders or significant psychological conditions that in the Investigator's judgment would jeopardize subject enrollment or compliance</criteria>
