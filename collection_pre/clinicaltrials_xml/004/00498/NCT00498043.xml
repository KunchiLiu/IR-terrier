	<brief_summary>This Phase II study randomized R-ACVBP and R-CHOP as induction treatment in patients from 18 to 59 with DLBCL CD20+ lymphoma and 2 or 3 adverse prognostic factors of the age-adjusted IPI. The consolidation treatment is allocated according to the response to induction treatment assessed by PET after the 2nd and 4th induction cycles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Two Associations of Rituximab and Chemotherapy, With a PET-driven Strategy, in Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1) Induction Arm A: 4 cycles of R-ACVBP, 2 weeks interval. After the 3rd cycle, if PET 2+ (fixing), collection of peripheral blood stem cell progenitors will be organized at the time of hematological recovery under support with G-CSF. The consolidation treatment will depend on results of PET evaluation after cycle 2 (PET2) and cycle 4 (PET4). - Consolidation 1A (in case of PET 2- PET 4 -): - High-dose Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue; 2 cycles spaced out 14 days. - Rituximab-Ifosfamide-Etoposide : 4 cycles spaced out 14 days - Cytarabine sub-cutaneous, during 4 days; 2 cycles spaced out 14 days. - Consolidation 2 A (in case of PET 2+ PET4 -): - 2 cycles high-dose Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue - High dose with Z- BEAM conditioning regimen followed by autologous transplant. - Salvage(in case of PET 4 +): The patient will be treated with a salvage regimen, after a biopsy of the residual mass whenever possible. 2) Induction arm B: 4 cycles of R-CHOP, 2 weeks interval. After the 3rd cycle, if PET 2+ (fixing), collection of peripheral blood stem cell progenitors will be organized at the time of hematological recovery under support with G-CSF. The consolidation treatment will depend on results of PET evaluation after cycle 2 (PET2) and cycle 4 (PET4). - Consolidation 1B(in case of PET 2- PET 4 -): 4 additional cycles of R-CHOP, 2-weeks interval - Consolidation 2 B(in case of PET 2+ PET 4 -): - 2 cycles high-dose Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue - High dose with Z- BEAM conditioning regimen followed by autologous transplant - Salvage(in case of PET 4 +): The patient will be treated with a salvage regimen, after a biopsy of the residual mass whenever possible</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient with histologically proven CD20+ diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (WHO classification). Age from18 to 59 years, eligible for transplant. Patient not previously treated. Baseline FDGPET Scan (PET0) performed before any treatment with at least one hypermetabolic lesion. Index prognostic factors (IPI) 2 or 3. With a minimum life expectancy of 3 months. Negative HIV, HBV and HCV serologies Â£ 4 weeks (except after vaccination). Having previously signed a written informed consent. Any other histological type of lymphoma. Any history of treated or nontreated indolent lymphoma. However, patients not previously diagnosed and having a diffuse large Bcell lymphoma with some small cell infiltration in bone marrow or lymph node may be included. Central nervous system or meningeal involvement by lymphoma. Contraindication to any drug contained in the chemotherapy regimens. Poor renal function (creatinin level &gt;150 mmol/l), poor hepatic function (total bilirubin level &gt;30 mmol/l, transaminases &gt;2.5 maximum normal level) unless these abnormalities are related to the lymphoma. Poor bone marrow reserve as defined by neutrophils &lt;1.5 G/l or platelets &lt;100 G/l, unless related to bone marrow infiltration. Any history of cancer during the last 5 years with the exception of nonmelanoma skin tumors or stage 0 (in situ)cervical carcinoma. Any serious active disease (according to the investigator's decision). Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days before planned first cycle of chemotherapy. Pregnant or lactating women or women of childbearing potential not currently practicing an adequate method of contraception Adult patient under tutelage. Impossibility to performed a baseline PET scan (PET0) before randomization and treatment beginning</criteria>
