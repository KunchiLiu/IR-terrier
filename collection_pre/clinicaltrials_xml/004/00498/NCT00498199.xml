	<brief_summary>This study consists of two parts. The first part is a survey to examine vision-specific health-related quality of life in a cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis. We test visual impairment like visual acuity, visual field, colour discrimination, contrast sensitivity, eye movement. The aim of this part is to examine the association between responses to the quality of life scale and objective measures of visual impairment. The second part is an open controlled study, in which we measure motion detection threshold in MS patients with oscillopsia due to pendular nystagmus and in a group of control subjects. The objective of this part is to determine whether patients with pendular nystagmus develop adaptation to oscillopsia using increased threshold of motion detection. We plan to test the effect of visuo-motor rehabilitation on this threshold in patients with oscillopsia due to pendular nystagmus.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the first part, 100 patients with multiple sclerosis are included. A vision-specific health-related quality of life scale and neuro-ophthalmological tests are administered. The duration of intervention is about 3 hours by patient and one year to finish this part. In the second part, we include about 40 of 100 MS patients who present an oscillopsia due to pendular nystagmus and a group of 20 control subjects. The patients and subject will perform a motion detection task and the vision-specific health-related quality of life, the intervention lasting 1 hour. Then the patients will be randomized in one group treated by rehabilitation (one 30 mn session per week during 3 months) and the other one without treatment. A motion detection task and the vision-specific health-related quality of life scale will be performed at the end of the treatment for both groups.</detailed_description>
