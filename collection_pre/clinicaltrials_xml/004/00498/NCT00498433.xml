	<brief_summary>Part 1 determined: aliskiren, amlodipine and angiotensin II concentrations in interstitial fluid of fat and skeletal muscle; aliskiren and angiotensin II concentrations, and renin activity and concentration in fat and skeletal muscle tissues (biopsies); aliskiren, amlodipine and angiotensin II concentrations, and renin activity and concentration in plasma. Part 2 investigated the potential for aliskiren to modulate renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity, and lipid/carbohydrate metabolism in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue in obese patients with hypertension in comparison to amlodipine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: PART 1: Male and female patients 20 to 65 years of age with a diagnosis of hypertension and with abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 102 cm in men and ≥ 88 cm in women) For patients with a history of treated hypertension, mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP)/ mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP) had to be ≥ 120/80 mmHg and ≤ 160/100 mm Hg. For patients with newly diagnosed, untreated hypertension msSBP/msDBP had to be ≥ 135/85 mmHg and ≤ 160/100 mm Hg Pulse rate 40 90 bpm PART 2: Male and female patients 18 to 65 years of age , with a diagnosis of hypertension and with abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 102 cm in men and ≥ 88 cm in women) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate were assessed after the patient had rested for at least five (5) minutes. Vital signs had to be within the following ranges: 1. Patients with history of treated hypertension: msSBP/msDBP ≥ 135/85 mmHg and &lt; 160/100 mmHg at baseline 2. Patients with newly diagnosed, untreated hypertension: msSBP/msDBP ≥ 135/85 mmHg and &lt; 160/100 mmHg at screening and baseline. Exclusion criteria: PART 1 Hypertension Grade 2 (msSBP ≥ 160 mmHg) or Grade 3 (msDBP ≥ 110 mmHg and/or msSBP ≥ 180 mmHg) WHO classification Current treatment with three or more antihypertensive drugs. PART 2 Hypertension Grade 2 (msSBP ≥ 160 and/or msDBP ≥ 100 mmHg). Current treatment with three or more antihypertensive drugs. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied</criteria>
