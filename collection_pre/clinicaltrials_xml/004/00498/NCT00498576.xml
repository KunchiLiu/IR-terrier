	<brief_summary>Recently we have shown that melatonin secretion is impaired in rats with metabolic syndrome. We have also demonstrated that exogenic melatonin supplementation can improve blood pressure profile in nondipper patients. The aim of this study is to find whether there is a difference between melatonin secretion in hypertensive kidney recipients versus "normal" hypertensive patients. Secondly, to ask if there is any correlation between melatonin secretion and adiponectin levels.</brief_summary>
