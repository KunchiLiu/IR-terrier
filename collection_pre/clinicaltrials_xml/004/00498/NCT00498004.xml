	<detailed_description>Prolactin related adverse events are closely related to patient's perception on their illness and quality of life . Poor subjective wellbeing induced by prolactin elevation after antipsychotic drug treatment can complicate the clinical outcomes of treatment.Quetiapine has negligible effects on the elevation of prolactin and does not produce hyperprolactinemia related adverse events such as amenorrhea, galactorrhea that may disturb quality of life in famel patient. In this Randomized, Open Label, 8-week Study, the impact of quetiapine and risperidone on quality of life in female patients with schizophrenia will be compared.</detailed_description>
