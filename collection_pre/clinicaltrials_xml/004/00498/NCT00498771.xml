	<brief_title>Aquatic Exercise Study for Breast Cancer Patients With Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will examine the effectiveness of aquatic exercise in reducing Lymphedema. The study is designed for breast cancer patients who have developed Lymphedema following cancer treatment. Potential study participants should have explored conventional treatments such as decongestive therapy and lymph drainage massage before joining the study. There are two groups that the participants may choose from until enrollment for the group has reached its capacity.The active arm of the study will attend 12 one-hour aquatic exercise classes and classes will be held in an indoor heated pool. There is no cost to the participants.Both the active arm and the control group (not attending aquatic exercise classes) will have 3 measurement assessments that will compare the circumference and volumetric measurement of arms, as well as height, weight and body mass index (BMI). Both group will fill out a program questionnaire. Quality of life survey taken at baseline, week 6, month 6 and 12 will be compared. A follow up questionnaire will be completed at 6 and 12 month intervals, and annually for five years.</detailed_description>
