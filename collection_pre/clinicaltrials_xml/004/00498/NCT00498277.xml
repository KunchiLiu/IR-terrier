	<brief_title>Quantitative Diffusion and Fat Imaging of the Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers believe that they may be able to use MRI scans to tell if fractures of the bones in the spine are due to cancer. They believe this can be done by looking at MRIs of diffusion (the random motion of molecules) and fat. For benign and malignant processes, either diffusion or fat, or both of them, can be different, because the cell density (which affects diffusion) and bone marrow content (which affects fat) are expected to be different. All patients in this study will have already been scheduled for MRI exams of the spine at UTMDACC. You will have one extra MRI sequence done to look for relative fat, and a second extra MRI sequence done to look for the diffusion. The extra time required for the study should be less than 10 minutes, and the total imaging time should fall within a standard MRI time slot. Available data from your medical record, including imaging data, will be used to set up guidelines and clear examples for checking spinal fractures. This is an investigational study. A total of 48 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.</detailed_description>

Patients who are contraindicated for MRI (such as due to metal implants, cardiac pacemaker). 2. Patients who are unable to give informed consent 3. Patients who are younger than 18 years of age since the disease (osteoporosis) is not present in children.</criteria>
