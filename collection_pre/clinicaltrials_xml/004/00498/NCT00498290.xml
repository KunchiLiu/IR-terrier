	<brief_title>The Protocol of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery in Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The key factors that keep a patient in hospital after uncomplicated major colorectal surgery include the need for parenteral analgesia(persistent pain), intravenous fluids (persistent gut dysfunction), and bed rest (persistent lack of mobility). These factors often overlap and interact to delay return of function. Obviously, postoperative complications will also prolong the time until recovery and ultimately length of stay. A clinical pathway, called Enhanced Recovery After Surgery(ERAS), to accelerate recovery after colonic resection based on a multimodal programme with optimal pain relief, stress reduction with regional anaesthesia, early enteral nutrition and early mobilisation has demonstrated improvements in physical performance, pulmonary function, body composition and a marked reduction of length of stay. Comparison(s): A total of 500 cases colorectal surgery were randomized to receive ERAS protocol or the traditional protocol, such as mechanical bowl preparation, intravenous fluids until bowl movement recovery and bed rest.</detailed_description>
