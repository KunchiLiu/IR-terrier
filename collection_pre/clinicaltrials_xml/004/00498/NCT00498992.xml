	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Regenecare® wound gel may help relieve pain and itching in patients who develop an acne-like rash while undergoing treatment with cetuximab or another epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor for cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well Regenecare® wound gel works in treating rash in patients receiving cetuximab or another epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy for cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regenecare® Wound Gel in Treating Rash in Patients Receiving Cetuximab or Other Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor Therapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of Regenecare® wound gel in alleviating pain and itching in patients who develop an acneiform rash while undergoing treatment with cetuximab or other EGFR inhibitor therapy for cancer. Secondary - Determine the efficacy of this drug in reducing the severity of rash in these patients. - Determine the efficacy of this drug in reducing the redness and appearance of the rash in these patients. - Determine the tolerability of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a prospective study. - Observation: Patients undergo evaluation by full-face photography prior to development of skin rash (baseline). While undergoing concurrent cancer therapy, patients self-monitor for the appearance of an acneiform rash. Upon initial onset of rash, patients proceed to treatment. - Treatment: Patients apply topical Regenecare® wound gel to the face ≥ 4 times daily. Treatment continues for 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are evaluated weekly by facial examination, full-face photography, and patient satisfaction questionnaires.</detailed_description>
