	<brief_title>SPIRIT V: Post-marketing Evaluation of the XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System in Europe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SPIRIT V Clinical Evaluation consists of two concurrent studies,the Diabetic Sub-Study and the Registry. The SPIRIT V Registry is a prospective, single arm, multi-center registry evaluating performance of the XIENCE V® EECSS in real-world use, per its Instruction For Use (IFU). 2,700 patients will be enrolled in the SPIRIT V Registry. The long term safety and efficacy of the XIENCE V EECSS have been demonstrated in the SPIRIT FIRST trial up to 5 years, the SPIRIT II trial up to 4 years, and in the SPIRIT III Randomized Control Trial (RCT) up to 3 years. In addition, these pre-approval studies have shown low rates of Target Vessel Failure and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) that were observed to plateau or gradually decline after about 1 year and were consistently lower than the comparator arm of each study. This benefit in MACE is sustained for up to 5 years and is also independent of the first year results. The post approval SPIRIT V study demonstrated that the use of the XIENCE EECSS in complex lesions in a real-world population resulted in 1 year MACE, Stent Thrombosis and Target Lesion Revascularization rates that are comparable to those of the previously mentioned pre-approval studies which included patients with more restricted inclusion / exclusion criteria. Therefore, based on existing data from these trials, Abbott Vascular has decided to discontinue further follow up in the SPIRIT V Registry study after 2 years.</detailed_description>
