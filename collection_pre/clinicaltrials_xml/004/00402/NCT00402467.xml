	<brief_summary>The study drug, BAY59-7939, is a new drug currently being tested in the prevention of VTE. It directly inhibits factor Xa, a blood component in the pathway which leads to coagulation (clotting of blood cells). It is available as a tablet. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of BAY59-7939 with the safety and efficacy of the licensed drug Enoxaparin. Enoxaparin, a so-called low molecular heparin, is approved and widely used in the area of thromboprophylaxis and will be given once daily subcutaneously. In this study 4 different doses of the investigational drug BAY59-7939 will be tested in comparison to Enoxaparin. You will receive during the study either one of the following BAY59-7939 treatments or Enoxaparin. The following doses of BAY59-7939 will be tested: Dose I ; Dose II, Dose III, Dose IV. This study will run for approximately 7 months in a number of countries. In total, up to 600 patients may participate in this study.</brief_summary>

Patient not able to stop ASA therapy will be excluded All other drugs influencing coagulation, (exception: NSAIDs with half life &lt; 17 hrs will be allowed) Systemic and topical treatment with azole compounds (e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole). Azole compounds should be stopped at least four days before enrollment Miscellaneous: Planned intermittent pneumatic compression during active treatment period Planned epidural anaesthesia with indwelling epidural catheter (spinal and epidural anaesthesia without indwelling catheter is allowed) Therapy with another investigational product within 30 days prior to the start of the study Concomitant participation in another trial or study Removal of Subjects from Study: A subject who withdraws is one who discontinued a clinical study for any reason. Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable representative If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the subject's wellbeing At the specific request of the sponsor</criteria>
