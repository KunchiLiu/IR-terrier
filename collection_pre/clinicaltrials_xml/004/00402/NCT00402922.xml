	<brief_summary>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. One common risk factor for CHD is obesity. The presence of certain types of fat over others is more commonly associated with the development of CHD. This study will use data from a previous study to examine the association between pericardial fat, a type of fat that surrounds the heart, and CHD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Association Between Pericardial Fat and Coronary Heart Disease - Ancillary to MESA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CHD is caused by a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. It usually results from atherosclerosis, a condition in which deposits of fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up along the inner walls of arteries. Risk factors for CHD include tobacco use, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Visceral fat, the type of fat found in the abdomen and surrounding vital organs, is considered a greater risk factor for CHD than subcutaneous fat, the type of fat found directly below the skin. Pericardial fat, the fat surrounding the heart, is similar to visceral fat, and may be particularly damaging because of its lipotoxicity effects and its ability to trigger inflammation in the coronary arteries. Increased amounts of pericardial fat may therefore accelerate the development of atherosclerosis and CHD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between pericardial fat and the development of CHD. This study will use previously collected data from participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study, a study that examined characteristics of the subclinical, or the early stages of, cardiovascular disease in individuals. There will be no study visits specifically for this study. Participants' study data and computed tomography (CT) scans will be analyzed to determine the following: 1) the presence of pericardial fat and subclinical CHD at study entry; 2) changes in pericardial fat levels and plaque formation; and 3) the presence of pericardial fat and CHD at a 6-year follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
