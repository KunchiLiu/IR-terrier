	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To demonstrate that risedronate 35-mg once weekly is more efficacious than placebo in increasing or maintaining bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine after 1 year of treatment in women who are non-osteoporotic and 0.5-5 years postmenopausal. Secondary objectives: - To demonstrate that risedronate 35-mg once weekly is more efficacious than placebo in increasing or maintaining total proximal femur, femoral neck, and trochanter BMD after 1 year of treatment in women who are 0.5-5 years postmenopausal - To assess the general safety of 35-mg risedronate administered once weekly.</brief_summary>

Main Inclusion/Exclusion criteria are listed hereafter: Inclusion criteria: Be postmenopausal for 0.55 years.Menopause is defined as 12 months without menses, based on medical history. Subjects who are postmenopausal secondary to bilateral oophorectomy must have serum FSH &gt;40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt;20 pg/mL. Subjects with 3 contiguous lumbar spine vertebral bodies (L1L4) without fracture or degenerative disease. Lumbar spine BMD mean value &gt; 0.772g/cm2 (Hologic) or &gt;0.880 g/cm2 (Lunar). Exclusion criteria : Subjects with adequate lumbar spine BMD but osteoporotic by total proximal femur BMD (&lt;0.637 g/cm2 [Hologic]) or &lt;0.694 g/cm2 [Lunar]) as determined by dualenergy xray absorptiometry (DXA)</criteria>
