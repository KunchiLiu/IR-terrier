	<brief_title>Ambulatory Physical Exercise Program in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation is a frequently used therapy option to increase survival in hematological and lymphatic malignancies. These malignancies and their treatment are associated with numerous physical and psychological symptoms and severe side effects. Physical exercise has been proposed as a promising strategy for the treatment of some of these physical and psychological complaints, and various exercise interventions are currently available after cancer treatment. To date, promising preliminary results concerning exercise programs in PBSCT recipients were published with limited sample size populations. Results of musculoskeletal outcomes in PBSCT recipients after cancer treatment are lacking.</detailed_description>
