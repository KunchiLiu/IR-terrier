	<brief_summary>In non-ST-elevation the optimal time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unclear. Some studies showed benefit of very early PCI, some others early PCI between 12-48 hours and others even showed a benefit of a selective invasive approach only in case of recurrence of symptoms or a positive stress test. The optimal timing of intervention is still matter of debate as a result of a randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Immediate Versus Early and Selective Invasive Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in NSTEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial we compare a very early cardiac catheterization (&lt; 2,5 hours after randomization) similar to ST-elevation myocardial infarction treatment, versus an early invasive approach (within 2-48 hours after randomization) versus a selective invasive approach in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All patients are treated with heparin, ASA, Clopidogrel loading dose (600 mg) with subsequent 75 mg/d and tirofiban for 24 hours.</detailed_description>
