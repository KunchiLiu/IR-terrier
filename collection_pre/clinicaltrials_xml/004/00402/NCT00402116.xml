	<brief_summary>There will be 2 phases in this study. Patients will either be enrolled to the first phase or to the second phase, depending upon when they enroll into the study. The first phase of this study is done to evaluate the safety of enzastaurin in patients. This is done by gradually increasing the dose of the drug in small groups of patients and watching closely for side effects. In the second phase of the study, the dose determined to be safe will be used with temozolomide during and following radiation therapy to see if the combination can help patients with brain tumors live longer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma (GS). Biopsy or resection must have been performed no more than 5 weeks prior to treatment. An MRI or CT scan must be obtained within 14 days prior to treatment. Patients must not have received prior drug therapy for brain tumors. Patients must have adequate organ function demonstrated by lab tests within 14 days prior to treatment. Patients will be excluded if unable to swallow tablets. Patients will be excluded if unable to discontinue use of enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs or have been off of these agents less than 2 weeks prior to treatment (i.e. phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine, etc.). Patients will be excluded if have active infection. Patients will be excluded if have a significant medical illness that, in the investigator's opinion, cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy. Patients will be excluded if they have concurrent therapy with an anticoagulant. If the patient requires anticoagulant therapy after starting treatment, the patient may remain on study but should be monitored carefully.</criteria>
