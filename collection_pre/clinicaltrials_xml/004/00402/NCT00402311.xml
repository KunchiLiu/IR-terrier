	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects and cost-effectiveness of a Diagnostic Observation Center for PsychoGeriatric patients (DOC-PG). Our main hypothesis is that DOC-PG has added value compared with usual care regarding Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects and Cost-Effectiveness of an Integrated Multidisciplinary Approach for Psychogeriatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An integrated multidisciplinary approach to diagnosing and managing dementia is generally recommended, though rarely investigated. In recent years, multidisciplinary memory clinics (MCs) for patients with dementia have been established in many places over the world. These services have recently also been criticised for being principally hospital-based, for their apparently limited focus that entails only medical diagnostics and pharmacotherapy and for thus diverting resources from community mental health teams(CMHTs) .On the other hand, CMHTs are mainly concerned with the provision and organisation of integrated care, and unlike MCs, CMHTs generally have limited access to hospital-based diagnostics such as brain-imaging. In April 2002, an outpatient diagnostic facility, the Diagnostic Observation Centre for PsychoGeriatric patients (DOC-PG) was established in Maastricht, the Netherlands. DOC-PG combines the hospital-based approach of the MC with the care-oriented approach of the regional CMHT and aims to provide the general practitioner (GP) with elaborate diagnostic and therapeutic advice for patients with cognitive disorders. Comparison: DOC-PG is compared with usual care i.e. the GP took care of the diagnosis, or he or she referred the patient to one of the separate regional services, e.g. the Maastricht Memory Clinic (MMC), geriatric medicine, or the department of mental health for the elderly of the mental health community service (CMHT).</detailed_description>
