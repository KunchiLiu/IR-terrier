	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the ability of clinicians to receive and review information from patients implanted with a heart device over the internet (remote care) is comparable to patients who are seen in-office for routine visits to check the status of their device.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient will be implanted with a Medtronic Conexusenabled Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRTD) or Implantable CardioverterDefibrillator (DRICD) device. Patient has permanent rapid beats in the upper chamber of the heart (Atrial Fibrillation) (constant atrial fibrillation in which pharmacological therapy or cardioversion failed or not attempted). Patient plans to be on chronic warfarin therapy postimplant and is no longer receiving therapies to attempt to control the rhythm of the beats in their atrium. Patient has a previous ICD, CRTD, Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemaker (CRTP).</criteria>
