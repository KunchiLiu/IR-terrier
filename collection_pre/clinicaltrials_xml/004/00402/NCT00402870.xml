	<brief_summary>The ProSeal laryngeal mask airway is a relatively new airway device with a modified cuff to increase the seal and a drain tube to provide a channel for regurgitated fluid, prevention of gastric insufflation and insertion of a gastric tube. In the following randomized prospective double-blind trial, we test the hypothesis that the postoperative analgesic requirements is higher for the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway than the tracheal tube.</brief_summary>
