	<brief_summary>Patients, who are considered suitable by their physicians to take part in this research, will have a physical examination (including an Electrocardiogram (ECG)), blood and urine samples taken, as well as a sample of the secretions or tissue around their infection site. In addition, the site of the infection will be photographed. The patients will be randomly assigned one of the treatments: intravenous (IV)/per oral (PO) moxifloxacin (drug under evaluation) or IV piperacillin/tazobactam followed by PO amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (i.e., one of the reference treatments for this kind of infection). The maximum treatment duration will be 21 days, and the minimum will be 7 days. During the hospitalization, the patients will have a physical examination every day. On Day 3-5 during therapy as well as at the end of treatment, the patients will have repeated examinations. These tests and evaluations will be repeated 14 to 28 days after the end of treatment. During this visit, blood and urine samples will be taken only if judged necessary by the physicians.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent Men or women of 18 years and above with a diagnosis of bacterial skin and skin structure infection that requires Hospitalization and Initial parenteral therapy for at least 48 hours and Meets at least one of the following criteria: Involvement of deep soft tissue (e.g. fascial, muscle layers) Requirement for a significant surgical intervention including surgical drainage, drainage procedure guided by imaging and/or debridement Association with a significant underlying disease that may complicate response to treatment. An underlying disease is considered significant if it includes any of the following conditions that are present at the time of presentation: cancer (except basal or squamouscell cancer of the skin), cardiac (i.e., congestive heart disease), diabetes mellitus, hepatic (i.e., cirrhosis or another form of chronic liver disease), immunologic, renal disease, respiratory, transplantation or vascular disease Duration of infection &lt; 21 days Diagnosis of one of the following skin and skin structure infections that requires hospitalization and initial parenteral antibiotic therapy for at least 48 hours: Major abscess(es) associated with extensive cellulitis, which requires antibiotic therapy in addition to surgical incision and drainage Diabetic foot infection of mild to severe intensity (perfusion, extent/size, depth/tissue loss, infection and sensation (PEDIS) grade 24) in the presence or absence of osteomyelitis. Subjects with osteomyelitis may only be enrolled if the infected bone is completely removed by surgery and if residual infection requiring antibiotics is still present following surgery Wound infection including: post surgical (surgical incision), posttraumatic, human bite/clenched fist and animal bite wound and wound associated with injection drug abuse: Infections must have occurred within 30 days of a surgical procedure, trauma, animal bite, or human bite, and involve the skin and skin structures at the site of the incision, trauma, or bite In addition, postsurgical/trauma wound infections must meet the following criteria: Involvement of deep soft tissues (e.g. fascial and muscle layers) of the incision/trauma At least one of the following criteria: Purulent drainage from the deep incision/trauma Identification of an infecting organism from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from incision/trauma At least one of the following signs and symptoms: Localized pain or tenderness Fever (see below) AND the incision (in case of postsurgical wound infections) is deliberately opened by a surgeon, unless the culture is negative Abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision/trauma, found on direct examination, during reoperation/operation (in case of trauma), or by histologic or radiologic examination Diagnosis of a deep incisional/posttrauma Skin Structure Infections (SSI) by a surgeon or attending physician Bite wounds/clenched fist infections and wounds associated with injection drug abuse must meet the criteria defining a Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (cSSSI) Infected ischemic ulcers with at least one of the following conditions: Peripheral vascular disease Conditions predisposing to pressure sores such as paraplegia, peripheral neuropathy Presence of at least 3 of the following signs or symptoms: Purulent drainage or discharge Erythema extending &gt; 1 cm from the wound edge Fluctuance Pain or tenderness to palpation Swelling or induration Fever, defined as body temperature &gt; 37.5°C (axillary) &gt; 38°C (orally) &gt; 38.5°C (tympanically) or &gt; 39°C (rectally) OR Elevated total peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count &gt; 12,000/mm3 or &gt;15 % immature neutrophils (bands) regardless of total peripheral WBC count C reactive protein (CRP) &gt;20 mg/L Specimen obtained for culture from infected area by needle aspiration of obviously purulent material or by tissue biopsy or by curettage of the surface of ulcer within 48 hours prior to the initiation of study drug therapy Duration of treatment of the skin/skin structure infection is anticipated to be at least 7 days.
