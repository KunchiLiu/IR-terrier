	<brief_summary>Background Chronic inflammation in peripheral airways plays an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma. Extrafine hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) beclometasone is distinguished from other ICS because of its fine aerosol characteristics. As a result, there is a greater extent of deposition of extrafine HFA-beclometasone in the peripheral airways. Therefore, extrafine HFA-beclometasone may have an extra anti-inflammatory effect in children with asthma. Aim To analyse the potential extra anti-inflammatory effect of extrafine HFA-beclometasone compared to HFA-flucticasone in children with asthma by means of alveolar nitric oxide (NO) concentration and bronchial NO flux, inflammatory markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), and conventional parameters. Method In a cross-over study design of 6 months, 33 children, aged 6-12 years, with doctor diagnosed mild persistent asthma, were treated with extrafine HFA-beclometasone inhaled from an autohaler and HFA-flucticasone inhaled from a discus. Primary outcome parameters of this study were; alveolar NO concentration and bronchial NO flux. Secondary outcome parameters were inflammatory markers in EBC, lung function parameters, symptoms, presence and duration of exacerbations and adverse effects. All parameters were recorded at baseline and after each treatment period.</brief_summary>
