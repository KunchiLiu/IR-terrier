	<brief_title>Bowel, Urinary and Sexual Function After Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There have been some reports that laparoscopically assisted rectal resection is associated with a higher rate of male sexual dysfunction compared with the open approach. But these reports are studied retrospectively. We examine the frequency of bowel, urinary and sexual dysfunction prospectively in patients who received laparoscopic colorectal surgery. We examine before operation, 7 days after, 3 months after, 6 months after and 12 months after operation, by questionnaires (International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) 、Short Form-8 (SF8)、International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form(ICIQ-SF)、International Prostate Symptom Score(IPSS)、Gastro-Intestinal Functional Outcome(GIFO)) and function tests (uroflowmetry and US).</detailed_description>
