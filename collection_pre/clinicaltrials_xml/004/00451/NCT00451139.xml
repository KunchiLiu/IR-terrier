	<brief_title>Ototoxicity of Artemether / Lumefantrine (Coartem) and Other Antimalarials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinin based combination therapies (ACT) currently are the most promising treatment options for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. There have been controversial reports about possible ototoxicity of artemether / lumefantrine (Coartem®) from retrospective studies. In this investigation treatment of uncomplicated malaria with artemether / lumefantrine, quinine, where side-effects on hearing are known, or atovaquone / proguanil, where no such effects have been reported, are compared. Auditoy function is examined (Auditory Brainstem Response, Pure-tone Audiometry, Otoacustic Emissions) before treatment, after 7, 28, and, for determination of irreversibility, after 90 days.</detailed_description>
