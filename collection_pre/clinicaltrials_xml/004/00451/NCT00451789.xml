	<detailed_description>Minor head injury (MHI)is one of the most common diagnoses in emergency rooms and traumatological outpatient departments. The aim of this study is to find clear evidence which risk factors are the most important in MHI patients to develop intracranial bleeding. We hypothetize that anticoagulation is one of the main risk factors for intracranial bleeding.</detailed_description>
