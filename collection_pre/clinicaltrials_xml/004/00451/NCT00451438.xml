	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the muscle activity of gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata in health control group and patients with PFPS during submaximal isometric muscle contraction.The research question :Is there any difference of muscle activity of gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata between health control group and patients with PFPS during submaximal isometric muscle contraction ？Null hypothesis:There is no difference of muscle activity of gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata between health control group and patients with PFPS during submaximal isometric muscle contraction.</brief_summary>
