	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of SMOFlipid 20% in comparison to a standard lipid emulsion Intralipid 20% in patients requiring long-term parenteral nutrition. The safety and tolerance will be evaluated by biochemistry, hematology and coagulation variables, vital signs and adverse events. Further objectives to evaluate are the influence of SMOFlipid 20% on inflammation processes, the efficacy of anti-oxidative properties of vitamin E supplemented to SMOFlipid 20%, and the fatty acid pattern in red blood cells and serum.</brief_summary>
