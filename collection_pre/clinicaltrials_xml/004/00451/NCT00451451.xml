	<brief_summary>To determine if treatment with BG00012 can decrease the number of MS relapses during a certain time period. Other goals of the study are to determine if, over time, BG00012 treatment can decrease the number of certain types of brain lesions commonly seen in MS patients and slow down the time it takes for MS to get worse. Other objectives of the study are to determine the safety and tolerability of BG00012, as well as the effect it may have on tests and evaluations used to assess MS. Additionally, glatiramer acetate is being used to compare its benefits and risks with placebo and BG00012.</brief_summary>
