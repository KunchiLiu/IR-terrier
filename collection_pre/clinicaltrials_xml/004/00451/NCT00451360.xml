	<brief_summary>We carried out a 3 years, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial in patients with hip osteoarthritis in order to: - evaluate the ability of diacerein, an interleukin-1Î² inhibitor, to slow the progressive decrease in joint space width observed in patients with hip osteoarthritis - to investigate the potential structure-modifying effect of diacerein in patients with hip osteoarthritis This study compare also after ten years the percentage of patients in each treatment group who require a hip replacement surgery</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Outpatients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis. Lequesne algofunctional index of at list 3 points. Radiographic criterion for inclusion: joint space width (JSW) between 1 mm and 3 mm. If the JSW exceeded 3 mm, it had to be at least 0.5 mm thinner than JSW of the contra lateral hip, measured at its narrowest point. Intraarticular injection or arthroscopy of the hip during the three months prior to inclusion in the study. Any systemic or intraarticular corticosteroid as well as other potential symptommodifying drugs for osteoarthritis were not allowed during the study.</criteria>
