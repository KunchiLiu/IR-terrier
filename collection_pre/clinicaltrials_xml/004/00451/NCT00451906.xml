	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the safety and efficacy of Avastin combined with platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens in patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Avastin will be given as first-line treatment in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy or in combination with any standard of care NSCLC first-line chemotherapy used in line with the licensed national prescribing information. Eligible patients will receive Avastin (15mg/kg iv on day 1 of each 3 week cycle) concomitantly with chemotherapy. Avastin treatment will continue after completion of chemotherapy cycles until disease progression, and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.</brief_summary>
