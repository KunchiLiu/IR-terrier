	<criteria>Patients must: 1. Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL based on the World Health Organization classification (Harris et al. 1999) at the time of original diagnosis.

Renal: serum creatinine &lt; or = to 1.5 X ULN Adequate bone marrow reserve: platelets &gt; or = to 75 X 10 to the ninth/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; or = to 1.0 X 10 to the ninth/L, unless there is bone marrow involvement. Patients must not: 6. Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug (not including enzastaurin) that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry. 7. Are receiving concurrent administration of any other systemic anticancer therapy. 8. Are pregnant or breastfeeding. 9. Are unable to swallow tablets. 10.
