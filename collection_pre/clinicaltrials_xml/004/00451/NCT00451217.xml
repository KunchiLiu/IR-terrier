	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to demonstrate in adult patients faster recovery from a neuromuscular block induced by either rocuronium or vecuronium after reversal at reappearance of T2 by 2.0 mg/kg Org 25969 (sugammadex) compared to 50 ug/kg neostigmine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects of ASA 1 4; Subjects above or equal to the age of 18; Scheduled for surgical procedures with a general anesthesia with the use of rocuronium or vecuronium for endotracheal intubation and maintenance of neuromuscular block; Scheduled for surgical procedure in supine position; Given written informed consent. Subjects in whom a difficult intubation because of anatomical malformations was expected; Subjects known or suspected to have neuromuscular disorders impairing neuromuscular block (NMB) and/or significant renal dysfunction; Subjects known or suspected to have a (family) history of malignant hyperthermia; Subjects known or suspected to have an allergy to narcotics, muscle relaxants or other medication used during general anesthesia; Subjects receiving medication in a dose and/or at a time point known to interfere with neuromuscular blocking agents such as antibiotics, anticonvulsants and Mg2+; Subjects in whom the use of neostigmine and/or glycopyrrolate may be contraindicated; Subjects who had already participated in an Org 25969 trial; Subjects who had participated in another clinical trial, not preapproved by NV Organon, within 30 days of entering into CT 19.4.301.
