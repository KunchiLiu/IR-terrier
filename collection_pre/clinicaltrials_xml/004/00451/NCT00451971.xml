	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives 1. To test the feasibility, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, of using an 'aggressive' treatment algorithm to bring a short term treatment objective (STO) within the normal or an arbitrarily defined 'desirable' range. 2. To determine whether patients with active rheumatoid arthritis randomly allocated to a particular STO show a reduced rate of Magnetic resonance imaging damage progression at two years compared to those randomly allocated to usual care. Secondary Objectives 1. To establish the relationship between achieving a given STO or combination of STOs and damage progression. 2. To identify the characteristics of responders and non-responders with respect to STO achievement and predictors of greater and lesser degrees of damage progression.</brief_summary>
