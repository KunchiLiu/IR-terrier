	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Freezing and Thawing of Human Eggs in Assisted Reproductive Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ViaCell's product is an investigational product intended to broaden reproductive options for women through freezing and thawing of human eggs. The egg is a large cell with a high water content, historically making it difficult to freeze. It uses a choline chloride-based media designed to protect the cells from damage during the freezing process with the goal of making it possible to successfully store and thaw eggs for future use. Following informed consent, female subjects will be screened according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the protocol and eligible subjects will undergo hormonal stimulation using standard IVF drugs.</detailed_description>
