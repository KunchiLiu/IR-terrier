	<brief_title>Intermittent Liposomal Amphotericin B Primary Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invasive Fungal Infections (IFI)are a significant cause of death in patients with acute leukaemia who are undergoing chemotherapy. This is despite improvements in antifungal therapy for the treatment of IFI. The major reason for this is that the current standard diagnostic tests of culture and biopsy lack the ability to make a diagnosis, either early or accurately. Thus other strategies such as the use of prophylaxis are needed. Several antifungal agents have been trialled as prophylaxis but all have disadvantages that limit their effectiveness. Liposomal amphotericin B(LAB) is a broad spectrum antifungal agent that kills fungal cells. When given in high doses intermittently it supersaturates the liver and the overspill into the bloodstream is absorbed by tissues such as lung, brain and kidneys (i.e. sites where IFI are likely to occur). This effect has been shown in a number of animal and laboratory test-tube studies to reduce fungal burden, improve survival and maintain adequate levels of the drug in between doses. However no intermittent high-dose prophylaxis study has been done in humans. Thus before we proceed to a randomised controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of intermittent high-dose LAB compared with another antifungal agent it is necessary to determine in a phase 2 study which of 2 intermittent dosing LAB regimens (i.e. 3mg/kg three times a week or 10mg/kg once a week) administered during the neutropenic phase of induction-consolidation chemotherapy for treatment of acute leukaemia is safest and best tolerated compared to the standard dosing regimen of 1mg/kg daily of LAB. Males and females aged &gt;18 years who are undergoing intensive combination chemotherapy for acute leukaemia will be randomised 1:1:1 to either 1mg/kg daily; 3mg/kg 3 times a week or 10mg/kg once weekly of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. The 3 arms will be compared for the safety of the 3 dosing regimens.</detailed_description>
