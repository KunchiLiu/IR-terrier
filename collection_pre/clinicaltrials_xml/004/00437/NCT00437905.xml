	<brief_title>Balloon Angioplasty vs. Cutting Balloon Angioplasty of Femoropopliteal Arteries- a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Balloon Angioplasty is a minimal invasive technique for treatment of superficial femoropoliteal artery obstructions. Despite high initial success rate and an acceptably low complication rate, long-term-results are disappointing as restenosis may frequently occur. One of the hypothesis for the differences in the reported patency rates is that the amount of vessel trauma correlates directly to the prognosis (restenosis) of the treated vessel wall segment. With the introduction of cutting balloons the problems of elastic recoil and residual stenosis might be resolved, by reduction of vessel wall trauma, vessel wall inflammation and consequently reduced neointima formation. The promising results especially in coronary arteries led us to initiate a RCT comparing primary PTA vs. CB-PTA for treatment of femoropoliteal obstructions in patients with intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia.</detailed_description>
