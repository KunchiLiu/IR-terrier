	<brief_summary>This type of study is called a "Phase I study". Its purpose is to determine the side effects of the two medicines listed in this study when given together with whole brain radiation, and the highest dose of valproic acid that can be given together with temozolomide and whole brain radiation. We will also study the drug combination's effectiveness in treating cancer. While both of these drugs and whole brain radiation have been used in people for many years, they have never been combined for the purpose of treating patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Temozolomide, Valproic Acid and Radiation Therapy in Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the start of the study, patients will be informed which dose level they will be treated with. On day 1, patients will have a physical exam and several blood draws including draws to measure the level of valproic acid in their body. Patients will start your whole brain radiation and also at the same time start the valproic acid and temozolomide pills. Patients will be asked to take the valproic acid pills every 12 hours and the temozolomide pills once daily. Patients will not need to come to the center for that but will need to come to the center to receive you whole brain radiation for 3 weeks (on weekdays, excluding holidays). Radiation therapy will not be administered on weekends but patients will still take their pills for the whole 3 weeks from starting the radiation. Patients will have to come back for a study visit weekly for the 6 months. Two more visits are also required: approximately 6 weeks and 10 weeks from starting the treatment. Patients will be asked about any old or new symptoms to determine if adjustment in the pill dose is required. Every study visit except the last one will include blood draws. These will evaluate blood counts, blood chemistry and also measure the level of valproic acid in your body. The Mini Mental Status examination described above will be repeated in every visit.</detailed_description>

Leptomeningeal disease or hydrocephalous on MRI scan performed within 4 weeks of enrollment Pregnant and breast feeding women are excluded from the study because effects on the fetus are unknown and there may be a risk of increased fetal wastage.</criteria>
