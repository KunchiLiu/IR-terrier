	<brief_summary>This study was designed to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the combination valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg versus amlodipine 10 mg in patients with essential hypertension not adequately controlled (defined as mean sitting systolic blood pressure [msSBP] ≥ 130 mmHg and ≤ 160 mmHg) on amlodipine 5 mg alone. The study evaluated both the efficacy and tolerability of the treatments by providing data that assessed blood pressure and the proportion of patients developing peripheral edema.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female outpatients ≥ 55 years of age Patients with essential hypertension measured using a validated automated oscillometric device at Visit 1 Nontreated patients must have a MSSBP ≥ 140 mmHg and ≤ 160 mmHg Patients pretreated on monotherapy prior to Visit 1 must have MSSBP ≤ 160 mmHg To be eligible for randomization at Visit 2 (Day 1) all patients must have a MSSBP ≥ 130 mmHg and ≤ 160 mmHg No peripheral edema at Visit 2 (randomization) Written informed consent to participate in this study prior to any study procedures Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant Known or suspected contraindications, including history of allergy or hypersensitivity to angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, or to drugs with similar chemical structures Patients taking more than 1 antihypertensive medication at Visit 1 Administration of any agent indicated for the treatment of hypertension after Visit 1 with the exception of pretreated patients that require tapering down of antihypertensive treatments. For patients with previous antihypertensive medication that require a gradual downward titration, the tapering down should be done according to manufacturers instructions and last dose should be taken by week 2 prior to randomization msSBP &gt; 180 mmHg or msDBP &gt; 110 mmHg at any time between Visit 1 and Visit 2 Evidence of a secondary form of hypertension, including but not limited to any of the following: Coarctation of the aorta, hyperaldosteronism, unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, Cushing's disease, polycystic kidney disease, or pheochromocytoma History of hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) 12 months prior to Visit 1 History of heart failure Grade II IV according to the NYHA classification Second or third degree heart block with or without a pacemaker Concomitant potentially life threatening arrhythmia or symptomatic arrhythmia Concomitant unstable angina pectoris Clinically significant valvular heart disease Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not well controlled based on the investigator's judgment. It is recommended that Type 2 diabetic patients are adequately controlled and, if treated with medication, be on a stable dose of oral antidiabetic medication for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 Evidence of hepatic disease as determined by one of the following: AST or ALT values &gt; 2x UNL at study entry, a history of hepatic encephalopathy, history of esophageal varices, or history of portocaval shunt Evidence of renal impairment as determined by one of the following: serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x UNL at visit 1, history of dialysis, or history of nephrotic syndrome Serum potassium values &gt; 5.5 mmol/L at study entry Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of any drug Any surgical or medical condition which, at the discretion of the investigator or Novartis medical monitor, places the patient at higher risk from his/her participation in the study, or is likely to prevent the patient from complying with the requirements of the study or completing the study period Volume depletion based on the investigator's clinical judgment using vital signs, skin turgor, moistness of mucous membranes, and laboratory values Any severe, lifethreatening disease within the past five years History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last 2 years Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5 halflives of enrollment, whichever is longer Inability to communicate and comply with all study requirements including the unwillingness or inability to provide informed consent Persons directly involved in the execution of this protocol</criteria>
