	<brief_title>Evaluation of Three Continuation Therapies After ECT Concerning Efficacy and Cognition in Severly Depressed Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND While electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in major depression is effective, high relapse rates and cognitive effects limit its long-term use. Continuation treatment after ECT with combinations of C-ECT or psychotherapy and medication may decrease relapse rates and cognitive side effects while changing cognitive psychological variables like dysfunctional attitudes in the long-term. CENTRAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS - Evaluation of the efficacy of three continuation treatments aimed at preventing relapses after acute ECT - Examination of the cognitive side effects and the changes of cognitive psychological variables during acute and continuation treatment METHODS In a prospective, randomized, controlled, long-term study we assign 60 depressed ECT responder either to antidepressant treatment alone, or C-ECT plus medication, or cognitive behavioral group therapy plus medication. Depressive symptoms and cognition were assessed before, during, immediately after acute ECT and two, four, six, and 12 months during continuation therapy. HYPOTHESES It is hypothesized that the use of combination continuation therapies after effective ECT leads to lower HAMD scores and lower relapse rates than the standard treatment with antidepressants alone after 6 months. In addition, we assume that the CBT group will establish more functional macro-patterns than the somatic treatments in the long term and will have the lowest HAMD scores and relapse rates after 1 year. With regard to the cognitive side effects, the autobiographical memory is expected to be the only specific part of memory being affected negatively by ECT in the short and long term.</detailed_description>
