	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well aflibercept works in treating patients with stage II or stage III multiple myeloma that has relapsed or not responded to previous treatment. Aflibercept may be able to carry cancer-killing substances directly to multiple myeloma cells. It may also stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aflibercept for Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of VEGF Trap (aflibercept) in patients with relapsed or refractory, stage II or III multiple myeloma (MM). II. To perform correlative studies in order to evaluate the angiogenic properties of tissue from patients during the course of treatment with VEGF Trap. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 60 days and then periodically thereafter.</detailed_description>
