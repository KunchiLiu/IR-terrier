	<brief_summary>Multiple Drug Resistance is the phenomena whereby cells become resistant to a variety of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Drug resistance remains a significant impediment to successful cancer chemotherapy inhibitors have been developed and are currently in clinical trials. CBT-1 is a natural product currently in clinical trials as an inhibitor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of CBT-1 and Paclitaxel With Carboplatin in Patients With Advanced Inoperable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer has the highest incidence and prevalence among cancers in the world and remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. One-year survival of patients with best supportive care remains low. Non-small-cell lung cancer accounts for almost 85% of all lung cancer cases. Approximately 70% of patients have locally advanced or metastatic disease at presentation and are not candidates for surgery.</detailed_description>
