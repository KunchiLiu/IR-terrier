	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether there are differences in postprandial endothelial function following a high-AGE(Advanced Glycation End-products) meal vs. a low-AGE meal. We also intend to investigate if the therapy with 1050mg Benfotiamine for 3 days protects against the postulated deterioration of endothelial function after a high-AGE meal in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Benfotiamine and AGE on Endothelial Function in People With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AGEs are a heterogeneous group of compounds formed by the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugars with proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Diet has been recognized as an important exogenous source of AGEs. There is evidence for the implication of AGEs in the pathogenesis of diabetes-related complications, atherosclerosis, ageing processes or AlzheimerÂ´s disease. Although, only little information exists about their effects in humans. The hypotheses of this study are that a high-AGE meal leads to a more important acute vascular dysfunction comparing to a low-AGE meal, and that a 1050mg/day Benfotiamine therapy for 3 days has a protective effect on the endothelial function. Twenty-one people with type 2 diabetes shall be investigated in a randomized, single-blinded (investigator), cross-over design (please compare design description).</detailed_description>
