	<brief_summary>EFFICACY OF NEOADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY WITH ANASTROZOLE IN POMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH ER-POSITIVE BREAST CANCER. Flavia Morales-Vásquez, Horacio Noé López Basave. Background: Neoadjuvant Hormonal Therapy (HT) is being used increasingly to downstage locally advanced and large operable breast cancer. Following this treatment, inoperable breast cancer often becomes fully respectable and tumors requiring mastectomy may be successfully removed by breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Methods: Recruit postmenopausal women with ER(+) and/or PgR (+) breast cancer (BC) T2,N1-2 to T3,N0-1 were assigned to HT with anastrozole 1 mgr daily for 4 months. The primary endpoint was to compare overall objective response (OR) determined by clinical (palpation) and ultrasound. Secondary endpoint was the number of patients who qualified for BCS plus radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
