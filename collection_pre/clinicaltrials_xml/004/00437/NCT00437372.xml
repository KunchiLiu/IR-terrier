	<brief_summary>This study is using the combination of radiation and antiangiogenic agents (agents that destroy existing blood vessels) seems to be an approach to tumor cure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IB Study Using Sunitinib Plus Radiation Therapy for Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of ionizing radiation and antiangiogenic agents seems to be a counterintuitive approach to tumor cure because oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer and a reduction in oxygen concentration would be expected following a reduction in tumor vasculature after antiangiogenic treatment.</detailed_description>
