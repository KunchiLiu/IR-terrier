	<brief_title>UHR-OCT and HD-OCT for Preretinal Membranes: ICG Versus Membrane Blue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical procedures performed are pars-plana vitrectomy and membrane peeling with or without cataract extraction and IOL implantation. The type of the dyes is randomized. The study is designed to include a total of tweny cases (10 cases with ICG and 10 cases with Membrane blue) Main outcome measures are: UHR-OCT, HD-OCT distance and near visual acuity and contrast sensitivity amsler grid secondary outcome measures are: OCT Stratus 3000 and visual field. Clinical examinations: preoperative, and follow-up examinations after 1 week, 1 months, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.</detailed_description>
