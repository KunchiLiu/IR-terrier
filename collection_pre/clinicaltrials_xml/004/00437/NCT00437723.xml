	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will compare the level of anemia, and the decline in renal function, between patients receiving NeoRecormon, and those not receiving it. Patients with chronic kidney disease, stage 2-4, and not receiving dialysis, will be randomized 2:1 to a group receiving NeoRecormon (at a dose determined by the investigator to achieve and maintain an Hb level of 120-135 g/L), or to a control group not receiving NeoRecormon. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
