	<brief_summary>Covered self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) have been used to prevent tumor ingrowth, a common complication of uncovered SEMSs. However, they have revealed a high incidence of stent migration in patients with unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). A conformable covered SEMS was introduced to overcome both stent migration and tumor ingrowth. The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical outcomes of newly designed conformable covered and uncovered SEMS for palliation of malignant GOO.</brief_summary>
