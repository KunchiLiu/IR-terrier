	<brief_title>PaNeX: Partial Nephrectomy Under Xenon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A partial nephrectomy is accompanied by ischemia time, followed by reperfusion. This frequently leads to a kidney injury of the remained tissue and decrease of the renal function after surgery. As it was shown that Xenon has protective properties against ischemia/reperfusion injury, the investigators hypothesize that Xenon application during partial nephrectomy leads to a stronger nephroprotection than an anesthesia with Isoflurane. The study will be conducted by two investigator types: The study enrollment and the post-anesthesia follow-up will be performed by Investigator I who is blinded to the study treatment. Investigator II will only perform general anesthesia for partial nephrectomy and will therefore necessarily be unblinded to the treatment conditions. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following study groups. Group 1 (Xenon) will receive Xenon for maintenance of balanced anesthesia for partial nephrectomy. Group 2 (Isoflurane) will receive Isoflurane for the same surgery.</detailed_description>
