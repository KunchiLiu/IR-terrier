	<brief_title>A Randomized Phase II/Genomic Trial of Two Chemotherapy Regimens in Patients With Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study are to determine the relapse-free survival of resected pancreatic cancer patients following two novel regimens. The secondary objectives are 1) to assess the toxicity of each of these regimens in this setting. 2) To perform exploratory genomic analyses as a means of assessing molecular characteristics potentially associated with risk of relapse with one or both of the regimens. 3) To determine the relationship between known mutations and metabolic activity as measured by FDG-PET and risk of relapse.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed evidence of pancreatic carcinoma. Patients must have had all gross disease resected (R0 or R1 resection). Patients who underwent an R2 resection are not eligible. Patients must have had no prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer. Age &gt; 18 years. Patient must have ECOG performance status of 02. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function measured within 2 weeks. prior to registration as follows: ANC &gt; 1,500/µL Platelets &gt; 100,000/µL Total bilirubim less than 2fold ULN AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)&lt;2.5X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine clearance &gt; 60mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. Patients must be &gt; 4 weeks and &lt; 12 weeks postsurgery at time of study registration. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are stronglt advised to use appropriate contraceptive measures. Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. All agents used in this study as well as radiation therapy to the abdomen have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 2 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients with known metastases are not eligible. Patients with wounds that have not fully healed are not eligible.</criteria>
