	<detailed_description>60 patients with stage Ⅲ CRC, who had received neoadjuvant and (or) adjuvant chemotherapy or (and) radiotherapy according to NCCN guidelines, and got complete response (CR), will be randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly follow up), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1.
