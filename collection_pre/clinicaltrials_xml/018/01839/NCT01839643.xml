	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators propose to assess if a non-hormonal agent is absorbed by a local route (vaginal) and observe the effect on follicular development. This study will include 3 menstrual cycles, beginning with one menstrual control cycle, following by one menstrual cycle with meloxicam ring administration and finishing with another control menstrual cycle. Meloxicam will be administered via a vaginal ring in two doses of 2.4 g and 3.0 g/ ring during one menstrual cycle. Safety study of absorption will be assessed. Also the investigators will study the effect on follicular development and if it maintains ovarian cyclicity, as well as shown in recent study with oral administration.</brief_summary>
