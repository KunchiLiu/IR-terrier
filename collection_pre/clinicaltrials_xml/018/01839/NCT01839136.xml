	<brief_summary>Background: The cost for the treatment of infertility are limiting for the health care access, particularly if we consider that the success rate per cycle is approximately 35%. Alternative regimens for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS)have been described in the medical literature, that lead to a lower cost, fewer injections and less risk of adverse events, particularly ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Furthermore, some services report excellent results with less manipulation as possible, which reduces the cost of laboratory of human and ethically be considered less complicated once fertilization occurs in the uterus and not in vitro. Objectives: The main objective is to compare the reproductive outcomes between intrauterine transfer of gametes (TG) and embryos (TE), the secondary objective is to estimate the average number of eggs that are raised when using an EOC reduced cost. Methods: This study will be conducted in the area of Human Reproduction, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics Hospital of the FMRP-USP. We will conduct an open controlled study with random allocation of the participants in a 1:1 ratio, and we plan to include 100 participants. All participants will undergo an EOC reduced cost. We will compare the chance of the treatment (TE or TG) result in a live birth and clinical pregnancy per woman allocated and to estimate the number of oocytes retrieved considering all participants.</brief_summary>
