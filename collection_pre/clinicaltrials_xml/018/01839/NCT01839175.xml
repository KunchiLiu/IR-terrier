	<brief_summary>Primary Series Primary objectives - To demonstrate that the concomitant administration of the hexavalent vaccine with a meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine is non inferior to the administration of the hexavalent vaccine without a MenC vaccine concomitantly in term of seroprotection rate for hepatitis B one month after the third dose of the hexavalent vaccine - To demonstrate that the concomitant administration of a MenC vaccine with the hexavalent vaccine induces an acceptable response for MenC in term of seroprotection rate (SPR) one month after the second dose of MenC Booster Primary objectives - To describe the immunogenicity of a booster dose of the hexavalent vaccine and of a meningococcal group ACWY conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine either co-administered at 12 months of age or given separately.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Series Secondary objectives - To describe the antibody response to all the hexavalent vaccine antigens one month after the third dose of the hexavalent vaccine when given concomitantly or not to MenC - To describe the antibody response to MenC vaccine when a MenC vaccine is given concomitantly with the hexavalent vaccine, one month after the first and the second dose of MenC vaccine - To describe the safety profile of the hexavalent vaccine after each and any injection when given concomitantly or not with a MenC vaccine Booster Secondary objectives - To describe the antibody (Ab) persistence at 12 months of age for the hexavalent valences following a 3-dose primary vaccination at 2, 3 and 4 months of age (prior to administration of a booster dose) - To describe the safety of a booster dose of the hexavalent vaccine and of a meningococcal group ACWY conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine either co-administered at 12 months of age or given separately.</detailed_description>
