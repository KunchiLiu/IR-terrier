	<brief_summary>Post operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a well-recognized complication of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Previous studies reported near-infrared spectroscopy provides information on the occurrence of cerebral desaturation resulted in POCD. But evidence of POCD after general surgery has been lacking. Especially, the prone position is used primarily for surgical access to the posterior spine, if there is any significant lowering of the legs or tilt of the entire table, venous returns may be decrease or augmented accordingly. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between POCD and intra-operative cerebral oxygen saturation after spine surgery in elderly patients.</brief_summary>
