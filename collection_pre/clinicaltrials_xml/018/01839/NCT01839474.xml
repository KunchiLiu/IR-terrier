	<brief_title>CPAP Survival Study in Ghana</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory infections, malaria, and sepsis remain leading causes of death in children throughout the world.These conditions may lead to respiratory distress and eventually failure if not adequately managed. In developing countries with limited resources, advanced airway management and support can be challenging and needs to be approached in a different manner than is done in developed nations. For example, the use of invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress is not an option in many resource-limited countries due to the lack of available technology, infrastructure, and trained personnel. Other alternatives should be utilized in order to support children with reversible conditions during their acute respiratory distress stage. One such alternative is non-invasive positive pressure. Prior research demonstrated that nasal bubble CPAP can be successfully introduced and utilized in a developing country's emergency ward. Nurses in four Ghanaian district hospital emergency wards (Kintampo, Mampong,Nkoranza, and Wenchi) were able to safely apply CPAP and monitor the patient's response. The investigators demonstrated that patients receiving CPAP had a significant decrease in respiratory rate compared with those that did not with a mean difference of 14 breaths per minute. There were no major side effects associated with the use of CPAP. Now that CPAP has demonstrated to decrease respiratory rate in a non-specific disease population presenting with respiratory distress it is important to determine if it also improves survival. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to determine if the use of CPAP in children 1 month to 5 years of age with respiratory distress decreases mortality.</detailed_description>
