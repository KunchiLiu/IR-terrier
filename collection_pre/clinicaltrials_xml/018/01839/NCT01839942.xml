	<brief_summary>For laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, the technique to close the hernia gap is not well established. Mainly three techniques are currently applied: - no closure at all - extracorporal suturing of the gap - intracorporal suturing of the gap All three techniques have been applied at our hospital. Patients who received laparoscopic hernia repair between 2006 and 2011 will be identified from the patient database and will be contacted by phone to inquire about the outcome and the satisfaction of the surgery.</brief_summary>
