	<criteria>Written informed consent (IC) obtained. Good general health ascertained by detailed medical history and physical examination. Finnishspeaking males between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive). Body mass index (BMI) between 18.030.5 kg/m2 (inclusive). Weight 55.0100.0 kg (inclusive). Suspected poor compliance or inability to communicate well with the investigator. Veins unsuitable for repeated venipuncture. Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolicendocrine, neurological, urogenital or psychiatric disease as judged by the investigator. Any condition requiring regular concomitant drug treatment, including herbal products, or likely to need any concomitant drug treatment during the study. Susceptibility to severe allergic reactions. Intake of any medication that could affect the outcome of the study within 2 weeks prior to the first study drug administration or within less than 5 times the elimination halflife of the medication. Regular consumption of more than 21 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = 4 cl spirits, about 13 g of alcohol). Current use of nicotinecontaining products more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent/day. Inability to refrain from using nicotinecontaining products during the stay in the study centre. Inability to refrain from consuming caffeinecontaining beverages during the first 24 hours after treatment administration e.g. propensity to experience headache when abstaining from caffeinecontaining beverages. Blood donation or loss of a significant amount of blood within 2 months prior to the screening visit. Abnormal 12lead ECG finding of clinical relevance after 10 min rest in supine position at the screening visit HR &lt; 45 beats/minute or &gt; 90 beats/minute after 10 minutes rest in supine position at the screening visit. At the screening visit, systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 140 mmHg after 10 minutes in supine position, diastolic BP &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg after 10 minutes in supine position, or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, or decrease of ≥ 20 mmHg of systolic BP or decrease of ≥ 10 mmHg of diastolic BP after 3 minutes in standing position. Abnormal 24hour Holter ECG recording of possible or confirmed clinical relevance Any abnormal laboratory value, vital sign, or physical examination finding, which may in the opinion of the investigator interfere with the interpretation of the test results or cause a health risk to the subject if he takes part in the study. Suspected current use of illicit drugs (according to medical history enquiry or physical examination), positive drug screen or history of longterm drug abuse. Positive serology to human immunodeficiency virus antigen/antibodies (HIVAgAb), hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus antibodies (HCVAb). Participation in another clinical drug study within 3 months prior to the first treatment administration in this study. Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the evaluation of the results or constitute a health risk for the subject.</criteria>
