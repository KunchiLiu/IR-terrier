	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare three CE-marked daily disposable contact lenses for tear film stability as measured by pre-lens non-invasive keratograph break up time (PL NIK-BUT). Secondarily, contact lens surface wettability was assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subjective Comparison of Pre-Lens Tear Film Stability With Daily Disposable Contact Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each participant wore 3 brands of contact lenses in a randomized, cross-over fashion, with a washout phase of at least 1 night between brands.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Hyperopia</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Refractive Errors</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Sign Informed Consent. Adapted soft contact lens wearer. Willing to wear contact lenses up to 12 hours and attend all study visits. Vision correctable to 0.1 (logMAR) or better in each eye at distance with prestudy lenses at Visit 1. Contact lens prescription within the power range specified in the protocol. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Any ocular infection, inflammation, abnormality, or active disease that would contraindicate contact lens wear. Any use of systemic or ocular medications that would contraindicate contact lens wear. Any ocular finding observed during the Visit 1 examination that would contraindicate contact lens wear. Monocular (only 1 eye with functional vision) or fit with only 1 lens. History of herpetic keratitis, ocular surgery, or irregular cornea. Known pregnancy. Unstable tear film with a NIKBUT value below 13 seconds in either eye without lenses. Participation in any clinical study within 30 days of Visit 1. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
