	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to examine the clinical efficacy of multiple doses of nusinersen (ISIS 396443) administered intrathecally to participants with Infantile-Onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). The secondary objectives are to examine the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of nusinersen administered intrathecally to participants with infantile-onset SMA and to examine the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and plasma Pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of nusinersen administered intrathecally to participants with infantile-onset SMA.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Genetic documentation of 5q SMA (homozygous gene deletion or mutation) Onset of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with SMA at ≥ 21 days and &lt;6 months (180 days) of age At study entry, receiving adequate nutrition and hydration (with or without gastrostomy), in the opinion of the Site Investigator Body weight &gt;5th percentile for age using Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines Medical care meets and is expected to continue to meet guidelines set out in the Consensus Statement for Standard of Care in SMA (Wang et al. 2007), in the opinion of the Site Investigator Gestational age of 35 to 42 weeks and gestation body weight ≥2 kg Reside within approximately 9 hours groundtravel distance from a participating study center for the duration of the study. Residence &gt;2 hours groundtravel distance from a study center must obtain clearance from the Site Investigator and the study Medical Monitor Able to complete all study procedures, measurements and visits and parent or guardian/participant has adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the opinion of the Site Investigator Key Hypoxemia (O2 saturation awake &lt;96% or O2 saturation asleep &lt;96%, without ventilation support) Presence of an untreated or inadequately treated active infection requiring systemic antiviral or antimicrobial therapy at any time during the screening period History of brain or spinal cord disease that would interfere with the lumbar puncture (LP) procedures, CSF circulation, or safety assessments Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or an implanted central nervous system (CNS) catheter History of bacterial meningitis Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters, as assessed by the Site Investigator, at screening that would render the participant unsuitable for inclusion Treatment with another investigational drug (e.g., albuterol, riluzole, carnitine, creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, salbutamol, valproate, hydroxyurea etc), biological agent, or device within 90 days prior to enrollment or anytime during the study. Any history of gene therapy or cell transplantation The participants parent(s) or legal guardian(s) is unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study, or does not agree to comply with the protocol defined schedule of assessments Ongoing medical condition that according to the Site Investigator would interfere with the conduct and assessments of the study. Examples are medical disability other than SMA that would interfere with the assessment of safety or would compromise the ability of the participant to undergo study procedures NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
