	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to estimate and compare the percentage of patients with abnormal glucose metabolism at 4-12 weeks postpartum between two groups: patients diagnosed with gestational diabetes before or after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Abnormal glucose metabolism is defined as type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance or impaired fasting glucose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abnormal Post-partum Glucose Metabolism After Gestational Diabetes Diagnosed Before or After 24 Weeks of Gestation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are to compare between the two groups: A. the rate of type 2 diabetes only, glucose intolerance only, impaired fasting glucose only, and patients requiring insulin at 4-12 weeks postpartum B. rates of maternal and obstetric complications C. risk factors (age, body mass index, personal history of gestational diabetes or macrosomia, first degree family history of diabetes). D. For fasting glucose done before 24SA, we will calculate the optimal threshold for predicting abnormal glucose metabolism in the immediate postpartum period among women with gestational diabetes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must have given her informed and signed consent The patient must be insured or beneficiary of a health insurance plan The patient is available for 10 months of followup The patient is pregnant and consulting before 24 weeks of amenorrhea AND has at least one of the following risk factors: age &gt; 35 years; body mass index &gt; 25; family history of type 2 diabetes; history of gestational diabetes; history of macrosomia. The patient has a fasting blood glucose level &gt;= 0.92 g/l before 24 weeks of amenorrhea OR a fasting blood glucose level &lt; 0.92 g/l before 24 weeks of amenorrhea AND an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (75 g of glucose) between 24 and 28 weeks of amenorrhea (normal values are set at T0 &lt; 0.92 g/l; T60 &lt; 1.80 g/l; T120 &lt; 1.53 g/l). The patient is participating in another study The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study, with the exception of the following studies: Papillo PMA (RCB 2013A0053837), LXRs (RCB 2009A0096849), GrossPath (RCB 2014A0112047), BAKRI (RCB 2013A0091441), OASIS II (RCB 2013A0077342), ElastoMAP (RCB 2013A0114837), ElastoDéclench (RCB 2014A0082839) and UpSideDown (RCB 2014A0192146). The patient is under judicial protection, under tutorship or curatorship The patient refuses to sign the consent It is impossible to correctly inform the patient The patient cannot read French The patient has a known history of type 2 diabetes The patient is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during pregnancy (fasting blood glucose level &gt; 1.26 g/l) The patient has a contraindication for a treatment necessary for this study The patient is taking chronic or intermittent oral or inhaled corticosteroids, or a β2 agonist treatment for a previous disease or a disease discovered during pregnancy within one week preceding the fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance test.</criteria>
