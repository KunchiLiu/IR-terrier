	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPI-613 in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine initial estimates of overall survival (OS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine response rate. II. To determine progression free survival (PFS). OUTLINE: Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5 of week 1 (pre-course 1 only), days 1 and 4 of weeks 2 and 3 (course 1 only), and days 1 and 4 of weeks 1-3 (courses 2-6). Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
