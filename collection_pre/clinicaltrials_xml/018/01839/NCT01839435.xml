	<brief_title>Feasibility of Outpatient Appendectomy for Acute Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies and corresponds to an high number of admissions (about 120.000) in France. It mainly affects young adults and is associated to fewer complications and to a short length of stay. The notion of outpatient refers to a shorter hospital length to stay i.e. less than 12 hours without an overnight hospitalization. This notion came from 3 learned society recommendations' (SFCD, ACHBT, and AFCA) and has been considered as a national priority. There is no consensus about appendectomy in an outpatient setting.</detailed_description>
