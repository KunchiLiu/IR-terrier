	<brief_title>Study Comparing Early and Late Nutrition in Cancer Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a controversy regarding the timing of initiation of parenteral nutrition in cancer patients undergoing abdominal surgery in whom caloric targets cannot be met by enteral nutrition alone. This is a randomized and controlled trial comparing early initiation with late initiation of parenteral nutrition. Early-initiation group: patients will be randomized to initiate parenteral nutrition in the 2nd day after surgery. Late-initiation group: patients will be randomized to initiate parenteral nutrition in the 7th day after surgery. Calculations regarding the caloric goal included protein energy and were based on corrected ideal body weight, age and sex. When oral or enteral nutrition covered 80% of the calculated caloric goal, parenteral nutrition was reduced and progressively stopped.</detailed_description>
