Patients with CNS metastases(confirmed through brain imaging if there are symptoms) 3. Patient diagnosed with another cancer type (except nonmelanoma skin cancer, cervical cancer, or any other cancer that did not recur or metastasized for more than 5 years and considered as complete remission can be registered) 4. Patient who received radiation therapy within past 2 weeks or who had major surgery including organ resection within past 4 weeks from random assignment date 5. Patient with the history of failure to the taxane chemotherapy 6. Patient who need chronic concomitant use of P glycoprotein, immune suppressor, proton pump inhibitor, or H2receptor antagonist during the period of clinical trial 7. Chronic treatment using steroid (except oral, local injection, or for externally applied) or other immune suppressor 8. Patient with myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia showing abrupt change in the ECG, severe or unstable angina, or other serious heart disease 9. Patient with other serious internal disease (chronic obstructive or chronic inhibitory lung disease including shortness of breathe at rest due to all reasons, uncontrollable diabetes and hypertension) 10. History of abuse of a drug or alcohol within 3 months 11. Lactating or pregnant women, or patient (or spouse) who has no intension of using, or cannot use very effective mean of contraception 12. Patient who has or is suspected to have problem in bile acid secretion 13. Patient with active gastrointestinal bleeding, or taking oral anti vitamine K (With the exception of low dose of Warfarin and acetylsalicylic acide when INR≤2.0) 14. History of serious hypersensitive reaction to the main ingredient or the excipient of the investigational drug 15. History of being seropositive for HIV (HIV test is not a prerequisite). 16.
