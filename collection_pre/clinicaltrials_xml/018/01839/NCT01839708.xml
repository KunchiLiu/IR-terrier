	<brief_title>Mothers in Motion Program to Prevent Weight Gain in WIC Mothers (MIM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mothers in Motion will draw on the successes of the pilot intervention of the same name and will promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes (eating more fruits and vegetables, increasing physical activity, dealing with stress) in low-income WIC mothers of young children. Both treatment groups will receive usual WIC care (nutrition counseling and similar services). The control group will receive generic printed health and nutrition materials to read at their own pace if they wish. The intervention group will watch the culturally sensitive DVD chapters according to a study calendar, complete action plan worksheets, and call in to peer support group teleconferences to discuss the DVD chapter contents. The teleconferences will be led by moderators trained in motivational interviewing (MI) and group factilitation. Participants will complete phone interviews and provide body weight measurements at baseline (T1), immediately after (T2) and 3 months after (T3) the intervention time period. T3 body weight will be the primary outcome.</detailed_description>
