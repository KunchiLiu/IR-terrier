	<brief_summary>This study is being done to investigate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Cohort A), advanced head and neck cancer (Cohorts B and B2), advanced urothelial cancer (Cohort C), or advanced gastric cancer (Cohort D)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-3475-012/KEYNOTE-012)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amendment 2 of the protocol added a new study arm (Cohort B2) for participants with advanced head and neck cancer who will receive a lower dose of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) every three weeks (Q3W); participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-negative tumors will also be analyzed separately.</detailed_description>
