	<brief_summary>Among youth populations, American Indians have the highest prevalence of diabetes in the United States. This study will use exercise as the principal lifestyle modification approach to reduce the risk of diabetes in this population. The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma has several excellent, but underutilized wellness facilities in their Health Services Area in rural Southeast Oklahoma, a low socioeconomic region. It has been established that exercise lowers diabetes risk, and many overweight/obese, insulin resistant American Indian youth who live in this region would benefit from an increase in regular exercise. The challenge is to modify behavior so that routine exercise is established and maintained. The proposed study will test whether monetary incentives can elicit greater frequency and duration of exercise in American Indian youth when transportation and access barriers are reduced.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study participants in the intervention arm of the study will be asked to exercise on 3 days per week for 48 weeks. Clinical and physical assessments will be performed at baseline and after 16, 32 and 48 weeks. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups. Each group will receive payment for exercise sessions completed but one group will be on a fixed schedule of compensation and the other will have a schedule that incentivizes frequency or duration of exercise. In addition, two reference groups of age-matched participants who are normal weight and subclassified as having either low or high levels of physical activity and fitness will be tested. The reference groups will complete baseline tests and will not enter the exercise intervention program.</detailed_description>
