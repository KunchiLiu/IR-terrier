	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine how two different types of iodinated contrast media (CM) agents, low-osmolar ionic ioxaglate and iso-osmolar non-ionic iodixanol, affect specific markers of thrombogenesis and platelet function in patients undergoing coronary angiography, and if the use of bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor used during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), affects any contrast-related changes in thrombogenesis and platelet function.</brief_summary>
