	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of RVL-1201 in Acquired Blepharoptosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory, proof-of-concept study. The objectives include establishing the efficacy and duration of effect of once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) administration of RVL-1201 and the safety profile following 14 days of treatment in 72 subjects (24 per arm) with acquired blepharoptosis. Efficacy will be assessed at each treatment visit by the Humphrey Visual Field 36-point ptosis protocol test, photographic measurement of marginal reflex distance, palpebral fissure distance and contrast sensitivity in the study eye only and Visual Acuity assessment in both eyes. Safety assessments will include slit lamp examination/corneal fluorescein staining, pupil size measurement, ophthalmoscopy/ fundus examination, tonometry, visual acuity; urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential only), vital signs (Heart Rate/Blood Pressure); and collection of adverse events. Subject rating of study medication comfort and assessment of ongoing tolerability will also be obtained. Primary efficacy endpoint is the mean increase from baseline in points seen on the HVF 36-point ptosis protocol test at various timepoints according to a hierarchical analysis. Analysis of exploratory endpoints will provide characterization of the efficacy and duration of effect of RVL-1201 with a variety of efficacy measures, as well as the potential additional effect of BID over QD dosing and safety profile of BID administration of RVL-1201. Exploratory endpoints will be analyzed by each regimen against placebo and between regimens and will include: - The change from baseline in HVF, MRD, PFD, VA, and CS. - The change from baseline in BP/HR</detailed_description>
