	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether acupuncture is effective at improving comfort in children on a ventilator in the intensive care unit. Our hypothesis is that the patients receiving acupuncture will require less medications to keep them comfortable than those who receive sham or fake acupuncture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acupuncture to Improve Comfort of Children on a Ventilator in the Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Use of narcotics and benzodiazepines is common in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to alleviate pain and anxiety, especially for patients who are mechanically ventilated. Pain control and sedation decrease oxygen consumption, facilitate mechanical ventilation, ensure patient safety and help patients tolerate nursing care. However, these medications can also have negative consequences. Patients receiving greater amounts of pharmacologic sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) have longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. In fact, daily interruption of sedation shortens duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. Sedatives have also been associated with development of delirium in ICU patients and linked to delusional and disturbing memories and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after recovery from critical illness. Benzodiazepines and opiates are associated with abnormal sleep architecture. Furthermore, patients experience tolerance, physical dependency and withdrawal from these agents. Lastly, there is evidence that sedatives, anesthetics and opiates are associated with neurotoxicity in animal studies leading to growing concern about the potential effects of these agents on the developing brains of children. Novel Approach: In light of these negative aspects of pharmacologic sedation, we are looking for alternative ways to provide comfort to critically ill children in the PICU. Acupuncture has been found to be effective in reducing anxiety, acute pain, procedural pain, post-operative pain, chronic pain, headache, infant colic, and has been found to reduce anesthetic requirement during surgery. Study Plan: We plan to randomize patients 6 months - 17 yrs old who are receiving mechanical ventilation in the PICU to either acupuncture or sham acupuncture as an adjunct to standard of care pharmacologic sedation as prescribed by the PICU medical team caring for the patients. Our hypothesis is that those patients receiving acupuncture will require less medications to keep them comfortable. Our study is powered (80%) to detect a 33% decrease in pharmacologic sedation/analgesia.</detailed_description>
