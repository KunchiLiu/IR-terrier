	<brief_summary>This study intends to examine this rational by comparing the infiltrative transversusabdominis plane (TAP) block with liposomal bupivacaine to EA in major abdominal surgery . The efficacy of the TAP block for abdominal surgery is well documented in the literature (McDonnell 2007) (Kadam 2011), but there are no studies utilizing long-acting bupivacaine. The investigators believe the primary outcome will demonstrate no difference between the two in terms of pain scores and opioid consumption. The investigators anticipate that patients who have undergone TAP blocks will have improved secondary outcomes with respect to a decreased costs, urinary retention, and hypotension.</brief_summary>
