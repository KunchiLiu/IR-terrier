	<brief_summary>Hypothyroidism is a common clinical entity which is often complicated by dyslipidemia. It is also reported increased risk for incidence of atherosclerosis and resulting coronary heart disease(CHD), heart failure(HF) and cardiovascular(CV) death. The effect of L-thyroxine replacement treatment on serum lipid and atherosclerosis is controversial in hypothyroid patients, especially in those with mild or moderate subclinical hypothyroidism. The present study was designed to investigate whether L-thyroxine replacement was effective in improving serum lipid profiles and retarding atherosclerosis progress.</brief_summary>
