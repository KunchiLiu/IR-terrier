	<brief_summary>The evaluation of Perfusion of free flaps in patients with moderate anaemia and possible reduction of the transfusion threshold. - Trial with surgical intervention</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study on the Effects of Moderate Anaemia in Free Microvascular Tissue Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study group 1 patients will be kept at a hematocrit level below 28% and only receive transfusions if symptomatic or the fall below 25%. Patients in group 2 will receive transfusions to reach a hematocrit always above 30%. Tissue perfusion in free flaps will be measured with indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, confocal microscopy and oxygen partial pressure measurement probes.</detailed_description>
