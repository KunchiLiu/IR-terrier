	<brief_summary>Prebiotics are thought to be a potential means to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea because of their ability to stimulate beneficial bacteria. In-vitro results showed a promising recovery of Bifidobacteria combined with an increase of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) upon Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) supplementation to amoxicillin-treated microbiota. As the microbiota is nowadays considered as a key factor in human health, a further understanding of the gut microbiota functioning in-vivo is essential. This understanding of the use of specific prebiotics may possibly be beneficial in the prevention or recovery of antibiotic-disturbed microbiota. As the effects of GOS supplementation on the microbiota composition and activity from healthy adults receiving amoxicillin have never been tested in-vivo, the investigators propose the current study as a proof of principle. Objective: To explore whether the promising effects of GOS supplementation on the composition and activity of gut microbiota from healthy adults as found by in-vitro, can also be observed in-vivo. Study population: 10 healthy men and women volunteers, 18 - 40 yr old</brief_summary>
