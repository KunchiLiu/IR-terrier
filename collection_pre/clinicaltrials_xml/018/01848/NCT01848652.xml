	<brief_summary>The protocol is to assess the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) of treatment with non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg / m² in combination with dexamethasone in immunocompetent adult patients with primary brain lymphoma large B-cell refractory or relapsed after first-line treatment MTXHD and high-dose cytarabine, excluding strict eye lymphomas. This is a Phase II, open, prospective, multicenter, non-comparative with direct individual benefit.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient with cerebral lymphoma B cell refractory or relapsed within 12 months after firstline chemotherapy with highdose methotrexate (1.5 g / m²) and high dose cytarabine (2g / m²) and / or radiotherapy or autologous, or patient with an indication against these treatments. Refractory disease is defined by the absence of objective response to treatment or relapse within 3 months of it. A relapse is defined as disease progression after obtaining a complete or partial response. Age greater than or equal to 18 years Performance Index less than 4 Illness measured by CT or MRI Hematologic adequate: neutrophils&gt; 1.5 x 106 / L, platelets&gt; 100x106 / L Adequate hepatic function: ALT / AST and bilirubin less than the upper limit of the normal laboratory Adequate renal function: creatinine clearance greater than 60 ml / min adequate cardiac function measured by ejection fraction of the left ventricle&gt; 50% by echocardiography Informed consent signed Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing age Able to understand the arrangements for monitoring the study and to comply Corticosteroids are only accepted during the first cycle Patients with immunosuppression from any cause (HIV, history of transplantation, immunosuppressive treatments ...) Prior treatment MYOCET ® or other anthracycline Active infection Surgery large (more than 3 days hospitalization) within 28 days before enrollment in the study, except for a diagnostic neurosurgical Hypersensitivity to any component of the treatment Contraindications to the administration of MYOCET ® and / or dexamethasone Participation in a clinical trial within 4 weeks prior to study entry</criteria>
