	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Adjuvant chemotherapy has been proven to reduce significantly the risk for relapse and death in women with operable breast cancer.In the North American Inter-Group factorial trial design (CALGB 9741) the concept of dosedense adjuvant chemotherapy was further tested in patients with node-positive breast cancer.Weekly paclitaxel after standard adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide improves disease-free and overall survival in women with breast cancer.Investigators asked if dose-dense 2-week intertreatment intervals (supported by the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) were better than the conventional inconvenient weekly intervals.</brief_summary>
