	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Coumarin and Troxerutin in the Symptomatic Treatment of Chronic Venous Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is the fixed-dose combination of coumarin and troxerutin called Venalot®. Venalot is being tested to treat the symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. This study will look at symptom relief in people who take Venalot®. The study will enroll approximately 808 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Combination coumarin + troxerutin extended release tablets - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient. All participants will be asked to take two tablets three times a day throughout the study. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Brazil. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 18 weeks. Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic.</detailed_description>
