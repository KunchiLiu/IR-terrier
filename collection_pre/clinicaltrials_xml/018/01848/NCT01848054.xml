	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of induction treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone (BNX) sublingual tablet s compared with induction treatment with buprenorphine only. The hypothesis is that starting directly on OX219 works equally well (e.g. not significantly worse) as starting on buprenorphine only and switching to OX219 on Day 3.</brief_summary>
