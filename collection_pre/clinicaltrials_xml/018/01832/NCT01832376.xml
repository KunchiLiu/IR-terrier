	<brief_summary>Study population: Subjects with long standing symptoms from calcific tendonitis, non-responsive to other forms of conservative treatment Study method: A cohort of 50 patients with symptomatic calcific tendonitis will be treated by ultrasound-guided needle lavage. At baseline all study subjects will be assessed by clinical examination, imaging of the shoulder by x-ray and sonography and by the self-report section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES). Follow-up will be performed after 1 and 4 weeks (score only), 3 (clinical, score, ultrasound, x-ray), 6 and 12 months (score only), and after 24 months (clinical, score, ultrasound, x-ray). Patients with insufficient treatment effect will be offered physiotherapy, re-lavage or surgical treatment by acromioplasty. Purpose of the study: The investigators want to find out - if shoulder function, measured by a shoulder score, will increase during follow-up - how much of the calcific material can be aspirated (in ml) - to which extend the calcific deposit disappears on x-rays and sonographic images - how many patients will need surgical treatment</brief_summary>
