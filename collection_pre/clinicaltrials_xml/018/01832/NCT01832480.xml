	<brief_title>Trichomonas Vaginalis Repeat Infections Among HIV Negative Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a phase III randomized clinical trial. HIV-negative women who test positive for TV at their routine gynecological exam at participating clinics will be referred to the nurse/study coordinator to screen for eligibility, provide a description of the study, and obtain written, informed consent (N=700). Subjects will undergo an audio computer assisted self- interview (ACASI), and will self-collect vaginal swabs for Trichomonas testing by InPouch and NAAT, Gram stain testing, and a future microbiome specimen. They will be randomized into one of two arms; metronidazole (MTZ) 2 g single dose (CDC recommended treatment regimen) or MTZ 500 mg BID 7-day dose (CDC alternative treatment regimen). All enrolled women will be scheduled for a follow-up visit at four weeks post treatment completion (window 3-13 weeks).</detailed_description>
