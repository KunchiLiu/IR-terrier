	<brief_summary>The Study examines the molecular basis of food allergy. It explores the interaction between T cells, InKT cells and cytokines in the development of food allergy. The study also explores these factors in development of tolerance "outgrowing" food allergy. It will also explore the genetic factors that lead to the development of food allergy. The study examines all type of food allergy including IgE mediated reactions, Eosinophilic Esophagitis and Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Food Allergy (FA) is a common pediatric atopic disease. Characteristically children affected by FA become sensitized to food in the first few months of life and spontaneously outgrow the disease by 5-6 years of age in about 80% of cases. At the present time, diagnosis of FA is made by a combination of history, skin testing and food challenge. The pathogenic mechanisms leading to food sensitization and subsequent spontaneous tolerance development are not understood.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Study Group: 1. Males or females age 1 month to 65 years. 2. Diagnosis of Food Allergy. Food Allergy can be either IgE or nonIgE mediated food allergy including Eosinophilic Esophagitis and Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis. Inclusion Criteria for Control group: 1. Age and sex matched patients without food allergies 2. Sibling and parents of patients with food allergies Inclusion Criteria for Control group with atopy: 1. Age and sex matched patients without food allergies 2. Sibling and parents of patients with food allergies 3. Patients with atopy Exclusion Criteria 1. Underlying disease or medical problem that is judged to serious or risky to allow 3 ml/kg of blood to be drawn from a vein (such as serious anemia, cancer, poor vein abscess, serious infections). 2. Subjects that do not meet the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any violations of these criteria will be reported in accordance with IRB policies and procedures study procedures.</criteria>
