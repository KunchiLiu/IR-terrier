	<brief_summary>Information about the presence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in tumor lesions in breast cancer patients is essential for diagnostic and therapeutic management of metastatic breast cancer. In daily practice however, obtaining a metastasis biopsy can be difficult or impracticable. Therefore, clinicians can be faced with a persistent clinical dilemma in some breast cancer patients, leading to suboptimal therapy decisions due to lack of HER2 receptor information. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which may provide additional information, have so far not been able to replace the biopsy. To solve this problem, non-invasive whole body visualization and quantification of HER2 expression by means of the HER2-PET may be a valuable tool. In this prospective multicenter imaging study, eligible patients will receive one HER2-PET and CTC analysis in addition to standard work up for metastatic disease. Subsequent administration of anti-HER2 therapy will be evaluated. Referring physicians fill in three questionnaires, one before HER2-PET and two after HER2-PET.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with a history of histological and/or cytological proven HER2positive primary breast cancer. In the Netherlands HER2positivity is defined as: HER2 immunohistochemical score of 3+, or HER2 immunohistochemical score of 2+ and positive FISH for HER2/cerbB2 amplification. In Belgium HER2positivity is defined as positive FISH for HER2/cerbB2 amplification. 2. Patients with suspected metastatic disease or local recurrence of HER2positive breast cancer and a clinical dilemma: in whom standard work up with imaging has failed to solve the clinical dilemma (diagnostic/therapeutic), leaving issues with regard to HER2 status of lesions and in whom a biopsy is desirable but cannot (easily) be performed due to technical or patient factors or otherwise. 3. Standard workup with imaging is defined as CT chest and abdomen, bone scintigraphy, as well as FDGPET. 4. Age &gt;18 years of age. 5. WHO performance status 02. 6. Signed written informed consent. 7. Able to comply with the protocol. 1. Pregnant or lactating women. 2. Prior allergic reaction to immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin allergy. 3. Inability to comply with study procedures</criteria>
