	<brief_summary>Several host factors underlie the pathogenesis of the reciprocal cycle of childhood diarrhea and undernutrition in developing countries. These include intestinal inflammation, mucosal damage, and alterations in intestinal barrier function that lead to malabsorption, growth failure, and heightened susceptibility to recurrent and prolonged episodes of diarrhea. Recent studies from Northeast Brazil demonstrate the benefits of a novel alanyl-glutamine-based oral rehydration and nutrition therapy (Ala-Gln ORNT) in speeding the recovery of damaged intestinal barrier function in cell culture, animal models, patients with AIDS, and underweight children. Oral supplementation with Alanyl-Glutamine (Ala-Gln; 24g a day for 10 days) improves short-term gut integrity and weight velocity 4 months after therapy in a group of undernourished children from Northeast Brazil. Intervention and Mechanisms of Alanyl-Glutamine for Inflammation, Nutrition, and Enteropathy (IMAGINE) is a study designed to answer the following questions: 1) What is the lowest dose of Ala-Gln that improves intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, and nutritional status in children at risk of underweight, wasting, or stunting? 2) What are the mechanisms by which Ala-Gln exerts these benefits?</brief_summary>
