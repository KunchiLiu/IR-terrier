	<brief_summary>175 second year medical students were assessed on their BLS CPR skill retention after an approximate one year after taking the initial certification class, and the investigators assessed which type of refresher course would be most effective in improving the students' CPR skills. Group 2 had no refresher, Group 3 had a multimedia refresher, and Group 4 had the same multimedia refresher plus hands on practice on a Laerdal BLS manikin. The investigators hypothesized that Group 4 would perform CPR skills with the highest competency compared to the other two groups.</brief_summary>
