	<brief_summary>This project is designed to examine the interaction between the microflora in the lower airway and the concentration of a serum protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin. The hypothesis is that alpha-1 antitrypsin impacts the diversity and content of the lower airway microflora, resulting in a less inflammatory airway. The Specific Aims are: 1. To compare the lower respiratory tract microbiome and virome population diversity and content in age and GOLD stage matched PiZZ individuals not receiving augmentation therapy, PiZZ individuals on augmentation therapy, PiMZ individuals not receiving augmentation therapy, and PiMM individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 2. Determine correlations between bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood gene expression patterns and patterns in lung microbial and viral populations across all cohorts. 3. Correlate the presence or absence of computed tomography (CT) bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis with patterns in the microbiome population diversity and content. 4. To identify and define novel molecular phenotypes of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) based on computational integration of clinical, transcriptomic, and microbiome data.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD, Alpha-1) is a genetic condition that predisposes to early onset pulmonary emphysema and airways obstruction, often indistinguishable from usual smoker's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Prominent features of AATD COPD include basilar predominant panacinar emphysema, frequent radiographic bronchiectasis, and a prominent interaction with environmental factors that influence clinical disease phenotypes. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is the most abundant serum and lung antiprotease and has a variety of biologic activities that influence lung homeostasis. Prominent among these are roles in neutrophil elastase inhibition, antiprotease activities against cathepsins, involvement in the complement cascade, and interaction with toll receptors. Since the effects of AAT on lung homeostasis remain poorly understood, the Alpha-1 protocol for the Genomic Research in AAT Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) grant (hereafter called GRADS Alpha-1 protocol) is designed to investigate the overarching hypothesis that alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) impacts the diversity and content of the lower airway microflora, resulting in a less inflammatory airway. Since the risk for bronchiectasis, COPD severity as measured by GOLD stage, and emphysema extent is proportional to the serum AAT concentration, comparison between different genotypes of AAT replete and deficient populations will provide data to determine if the diversity and content of the lower airway microflora influence the risk of COPD in the AATD population. The AATD population is selected because these individuals have a measurable interaction with environmental burdens22,28 and may be key to garnering an understanding of the interplay between this important anti-protease, airways and lower lung inflammation, peripheral blood gene expression, and radiologic and clinical phenotypes of COPD. The GRADS Alpha-1 Study is a prospective cross-sectional cohort study that will enroll approximately 200 participants at seven clinical centers with a total of nine recruitment locations over two years. An ancillary application to SPIROMICS will request data from 50 PiMM subjects, all (estimate 10) PiMZ subjects, and any (estimate 1) PiZZ subjects. The remainder of the participants (N=~139) will be recruited through GRADS Alpha-1 centers. All participants will have two study-related visits (Baseline and Bronchoscopy). During the study visits, clinic staff will conduct physical examinations and tests, collect biological specimens, and administer a series of questionnaires to study participants. Participants could also receive a telephone call to determine the final status of any adverse event, 1 month after study conclusion.</detailed_description>

NonCOPD obstructive disease (various bronchiolitides, sarcoid, LAM, histiocytosis X) or parenchymal lung disease, pulmonary vascular disease, pleural disease, severe kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular weakness, or other cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, that, in the opinion of the investigator, limit the interpretability of the pulmonary function measures 10. Prior significant difficulties with pulmonary function testing 11. Hypersensitivity to or intolerance of albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide or propellants or excipients of the inhalers 12. Hypersensitivity to or intolerance of all drugs required for sedation during conscious sedation bronchoscopy. 13.
