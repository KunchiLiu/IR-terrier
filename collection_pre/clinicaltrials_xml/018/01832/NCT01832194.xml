	<brief_summary>There are no previous reports on the use of Onabotulinum Toxin A to treat men with scrotal pain that we found published. We propose a pilot study to use Botox to block the testicular nerves on a group of 15 men with chronic scrotal pain who have failed the standard medical therapy. The men must have had temporary relief from a testicular cord block using marcaine. Before and 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the Onabotulinum Toxin A injection, the men would be asked to fill in visual analog scales for pain, a quality of life assessment, a depression index (MDI) and Chronic Epididymitis Symptom Index (CESI). They will also be subject to sensory testing of the scrotum before, after 1 month, 3 moths and 6 months.</brief_summary>
