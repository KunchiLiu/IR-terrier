	<brief_summary>The accurate prediction of depth of tumor invasion in early gastric cancer is essential for the proper selection of candidates for endoscopic resection. Conventional endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography have been useful diagnostic method for depth of invasion in early gastric cancer. However, there has been no prospective comparative study on the accuracy between the 2 methods. Therefore, the investigators prospectively compare the accuracy between the 2 methods regarding prediction of depth of invasion.</brief_summary>
