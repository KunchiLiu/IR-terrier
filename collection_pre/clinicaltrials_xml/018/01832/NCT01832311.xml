	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of several immunoregulatory factors in serums and aqueous humor of type II diabetes cataract patients with those in senile non-diabetic cataract patients since disturbed cytokine and growth factor microenvironment in diabetic eye may contribute to an increased frequency of intraoperative and postoperative intraocular lens surgery complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protein Profile of Immunoregulatory Factors in Diabetic Cataract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compared the levels of several immunoregulatory molecules (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), Fas Ligand (FasL), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-17 (IL-17)) in serum and aqueous humor between type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, without clinically evident diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema, and nondiabetic cataract patients. Investigators also investigated whether concentrations of immunoregulatory molecules significantly correlated with intraoperative and postoperative parameters. Particularly, investigators focused on the development of corneal edema as one of the main causes of low visual acuity in the immediate postoperative period after intraocular lens implantation. Since disturbed cytokine and growth factor microenvironment in diabetic eye may contribute to an increased frequency of intraoperative and postoperative intraocular lens (IOL) surgery complications, the findings may be relevant for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed to restore protein profile of immunoregulatory factors in parallel to cataract treatment.</detailed_description>
