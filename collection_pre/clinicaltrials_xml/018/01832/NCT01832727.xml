	<brief_summary>The primary objectives are as follows: Phase 1b: - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oprozomib given orally, once daily, on 2 different schedules. - To evaluate safety and tolerability Phase 2: - To estimate the overall response rate (ORR). - To evaluate safety and tolerability</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Diagnosis of multiple myeloma with measureable disease Patients requiring therapy who have relapsed and/or are refractory to their last therapy and have been treated with at least 1, but not more than 5 lines of multiple myeloma therapy. Prior carfizolmib is not required but is allowed if a patient had at least 2 cycles of carfilzomib alone or in combination with a dose of at least 20/27 mg/m2, as long as the patient : 1. Had at least a partial response to prior carfilzomib therapy 2. Was not removed from carfilzomib therapy due to toxicity, unless approved by the medical monitor 3. Was not removed from carfilzomib therapy for progressive disease nor experienced progressive disease within 6 months after any prior carfizolmib therapy Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate of ≥ 30 mL/min calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault [(140 − age) × mass (kg) / (72 × serum creatinine mg/dL)]. Multiply result by 0.85 if female. Key Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to first dose. Localized radiation therapy within 1 week prior to first dose. Immunotherapy/standard myeloma therapy within 2 weeks; prior stem cell transplant (SCT) therapy (autologous SCT within the prior 8 weeks; allogeneic SCT within the prior 16 weeks) Participation in an investigational therapeutic study within 3 weeks prior to first dose Prior oprozomib exposure Significant neuropathy (Grade 3, Grade 4, or Grade 2 with pain) at the time of the first dose Other malignancy within the past 3 years with the exception of adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell skin cancer, thyroid cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the breast, prostate cancer of Gleason Score 6 or less with stable prostate specific antigen levels, or cancer considered cured by surgical resection. Plasma cell leukemia History of previous clinically significant GI bleed in the last 6 months prior to first dose</criteria>
