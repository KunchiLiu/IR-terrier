	<brief_summary>The Sensor Optimization of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Response (SOCR) Study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized acute feasibility study that is being conducted to determine if subcutaneous heart sounds and/or intracardiac impedance can acutely identify the optimal atrioventricular (AV) pacing intervals and optimal left ventricular (LV) electrodes in patients indicated for cardiac resynchronization therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must be undergoing implant of a new or replacement/upgrade Medtronic CRTP or CRTD device for approved indications. Subject is implanted or will be implanted with an right ventricular (RV) lead that supports bipolar pacing and sensing (e.g. a bipolar pace/sense lead or a true bipolar defibrillation leads) Subject (or subject's legally authorized representative) must be willing to give informed consent Subjects must be at least 18 years of age Subject has congenital heart disease Subject has a tachyarrhythmia (atrial and/or ventricular) at the time of enrollment and a cardioversion will not be attempted prior to the research procedure Subject has unstable coronary artery disease Subject cannot undergo transvenous catheterization Subject has a mechanical tricuspid or aortic valve prosthesis or history of significant structural tricuspid or aortic valvular disease Subject requires dual chamber cardiac pacing or single chamber (ventricular) pacing at rest for rate control Subject has a recent echocardiogram (within prior 6 months) which revealed the presence of an LV thrombus Subject is pregnant Subject is enrolled in a concurrent study that may confound the results of this study without documented preapproval from Medtronic study manager</criteria>
