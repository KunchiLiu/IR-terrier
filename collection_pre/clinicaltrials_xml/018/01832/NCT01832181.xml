	<brief_summary>The prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy is rising in all maternal age groups. There is increasing evidence that in-utero exposure to maternal diabetes is associated with an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children and adults. There is an urgent need to reduce these increasing rates of obesity and diabetes in subsequent generations. The MiTy Trial (Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial) is a CIHR-funded multi-centre, randomized controlled trial of women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy (sample size n=500). The MiTy Trial is looking to determine the effect of the addition of metformin to a standard regimen of insulin in women with diabetes, on perinatal morbidity and mortality. The MiTy Kids Trial is a follow-up to the MiTy Trial which will determine whether treatment with metformin during pregnancy in women with type 2 diabetes will lead to a reduction in adiposity and improvement in insulin resistance in the offspring of women with diabetes at 2 years of age.</brief_summary>
