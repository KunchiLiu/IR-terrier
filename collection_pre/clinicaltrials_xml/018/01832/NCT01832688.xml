	<brief_summary>A national survey in Niger found that women and children are at risk of undernutrition and that many pregnant women don't visit health centers during pregnancy as often as is recommended. The aim is to assess the nutritional and health status of pregnant women in the Zinder region and to understand their knowledge, attitudes and practices related to health and nutrition during pregnancy. In collaboration with the Medical District of Zinder the prenatal care services will be optimized and the programmatic impact on gestational weight gain and anemia prevalence will be assessed.</brief_summary>
