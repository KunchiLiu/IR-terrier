	<brief_summary>This is a 3-arm double blind placebo controlled study to investigate the effect of Red Grape Cell (RGC) powder containing all the matrix of polyphenols that can be found in red grapes. polyphenols have several beneficial effects on various body systems, are present in many edible foods, and are considered safe for human consumption by regulatory authorities. Animal and human studies suggest a potential for polyphenol-rich compounds in enhancing mitochondrial activity and exercise capacity. However, the effect of RGC on exercise performance in humans had not yet been tested. A special population where increasing performance is highly sought are competitive athletes. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of RGC on measures of aerobic fitness, body composition and mood in trained male cyclists</brief_summary>
