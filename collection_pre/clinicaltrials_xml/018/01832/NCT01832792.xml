	<brief_summary>Guided self-help (GSH) is a recommended first-step treatment for bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and atypical variants of these disorders. The current study proposes to investigate the effectiveness of providing GSH either face-to-face or via e-mail, also using a delayed treatment control condition. Symptom outcomes will be assessed, and an estimate of cost-effectiveness made. Results are proposed to be disseminated locally and internationally (through submission to conferences and peer-reviewed journals), and will hopefully inform local service provision. Please note that we are only able to offer the intervention to individuals who are currently registered with a General Practitioner that is covered by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust - this is typically restricted to practices in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and parts of Wiltshire.</brief_summary>
