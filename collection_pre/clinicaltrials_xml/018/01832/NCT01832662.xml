	<brief_summary>Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages. It contains polyphenols (chlorogenic acids) and bioavailability of these bioactive compounds is now somewhat well understood. In addition, chlorogenic acids are known to be antioxidants in the cup, but reliable evidence remains to be observed in vivo. The objective of this trial is to understand if regular (10d) coffee intake may be beneficial on biomarkers of oxidative damage measured in urine and plasma. A secondary objective is to understand if polyphenols isolated from coffee may be as beneficial as the whole beverage in reducing oxidative stress compared to placebo</brief_summary>
