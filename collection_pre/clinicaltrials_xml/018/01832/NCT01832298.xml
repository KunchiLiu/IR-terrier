	<brief_summary>RATIONAL: Simmitecan is an anticancer ester prodrug, which involves activation to chimmitecan. Chimmitecan，a novel CPT derivative, exhibited potent antitumor activities both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting topoisomerase I. Also exerted comparable effects on topoisomerase I compared with topotecan and SN38 and possessed improved anticancer potency and pharmacologic profiles, compared with the clinically available CPT analogues. PURPOSE: to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of Simmitecan.</brief_summary>

Child bearing potential, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test result before initiating Famitinib. Male: All subjects who are not surgically sterile or postmenopausal must agree and commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study and for 6 months after the last dose of test article. Signed and dated informed consent. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedure. Less than 4 weeks from the last clinical trial. Known Spinal Cord compression or diseases of brain or pia mater by CT /MRI screening. Patients had ever severe diarrhea with prior therapy of camptothecin drugs. Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease (serious infection, serious diabetes) Significant cardiovascular disease or condition including ≥ class II cardiac function (NYHA) Acute and chronic viral hepatitis. (If HBsAg +, HBVDNA quantification ≤ LLN.) Pregnant, lactation period or men/women ready to birth. Psychiatric disorder or altered mental status. Evidence of significant medical illness that in the investigator's judgment will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and completion of the study</criteria>
