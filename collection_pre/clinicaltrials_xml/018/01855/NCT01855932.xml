	<brief_summary>The Enlighten study is an 8-week trial investigating the response to use of a smartphone diet and activity application. Participants are enrolled as part of a worksite intervention, and will receive the LoseIt! weight loss smartphone application, which requires participants to self-monitor dietary intake and physical activity, a component shown to effectively produce weight loss. The application will be programmed to deliver dietary intake recommendations during the first three weeks of the intervention. At the 3 week time point, self-monitoring adherence via the smartphone application will be assessed and those who are not responding will receive 4 weekly telephone coaching sessions. Those individuals who respond at the end of 3 weeks will be encouraged to continue self-monitoring on the application. All participants will also receive regular text messages throughout the trial. The importance of the proposed research lies in the objective to reconfigure weight loss treatment so as to achieve the intended outcome more efficiently and in a manner that allows greater reach.</brief_summary>
