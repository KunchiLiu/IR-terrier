	<brief_summary>The thought is that Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) plays a key role in the progression to prediabetes/T2DM in those with a history of Gestational Diabetes (GDM). The investigators want to know if having a fatty liver will be connected with more glucose abnormalities (higher fasting/oral glucose tolerance test glucose, more insulin resistance) and that a history of GDM will be common in those with NAFLD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A liver ultrasound will be completed during the last trimester of pregnancy along with a questionnaire. The questionnaire includes baseline maternal characteristics, age, race, ethnicity, parity, blood pressure, pulse, medications, activity level, sociodemographic and behavioral risk factors, pregravid BMI, previous obstetric history, medical and family history. The subject will come in person to clinic two times after the subject has had her baby (at 6 weeks postpartum, and at 6 months postpartum). The subject will give blood samples during the 6 weeks postpartum visit and 6 months postpartum visit, and an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test will be done at these visits. Blood samples will be drawn by putting a small needle or IV catheter (a small plastic tube) into a vein in the subject's arm. Blood samples will be obtained at timed intervals both before and after the subject is given a glucose beverage to drink, to see how well the subject's body deals with sugar in the blood over time. The total amount of blood to be drawn for each Oral Glucose Tolerance Test and research blood work will be approximately 90 ml (about 6 tablespoons). The total volume of blood taken over the course of the study for each subject will be approximately 180 ml (about 12 tablespoons). The subject will have their blood pressure measured with a blood pressure cuff during each clinic visit. The height, weight and pulse rate will also be measured. This will take about five minutes. The subject will have an ultrasound of her liver at the 6 week postpartum visit and 6 month postpartum visit. This will take about 30 to 60 minutes each time. The investigator's study coordinator will call the subject to do a questionnaire over the phone at 3 months after the subject has had the baby. During the phone call, the study coordinator will ask the subject how the baby is being fed. The study coordinator will also update information about development of any new medical problems and medications the subject's doctor might have started, activity levels, and health habits. Subjects will be asked questionnaires to update this information during their 6 week postpartum and 6 month postpartum clinic visits as well. The subject's understanding and approval of these procedures is required if she is to participate in this study.</detailed_description>
