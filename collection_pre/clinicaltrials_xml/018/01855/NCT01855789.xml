	<brief_summary>This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study will evaluate the impact of MTX discontinuation on the efficacy of subcutaneous tocilizumab (RoActemra/Actemra) in participants with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to current MTX therapy. Participants will be initiated on tocilizumab 162 milligrams (mg) weekly or every 2 weeks, remaining on a stable dose of MTX. At Week 24, participants achieving DAS28 less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 3.2 will be randomized to either continue receiving a stable dose of MTX or to switch to matching placebo until Week 52. In the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substudy of participants in both treatment arms (MTX or placebo), MRI images of hands and wrists will be obtained and analyzed.</brief_summary>
