	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if an anti-HIV medication known as Stribild (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) is safe, tolerable and acceptable when taken for 28 days, once a day after a possible, sexual, exposure to the Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stribild is a combination of 1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor, 1 pharmacokinetic enhancer, and 2 nucleos(t)ide analog HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and was approved in August 2012, as a complete treatment regimen for HIV-1 infection in adults who are antiretroviral treatment-na√Øve. We are proposing to evaluate the safety, tolerability and acceptability of Stribild given to participants over age 18 after a possible sexual exposure to HIV-1. Enrolled participants will have experienced a moderate to high risk exposure, as outlined in the study protocol, within the last 72 hours - per 2005 Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Participants will take one Stribild tablet, by mouth, once a day for 28 days. Study staff will assess for changes in blood chemistries and clinical signs and symptoms from baseline health. Study participation is 90 days and will include HIV testing, STI screening, HIV/STI risk reduction counseling, clinical assessments, blood draws and surveys designed to gather knowledge and perception of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Conditional referrals to continued HIV/STI risk reduction counseling and testing will be made if risk remains high at study termination. In addition, participants will be connected to a medical provider if risk demonstrates a potential need for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis.</detailed_description>
