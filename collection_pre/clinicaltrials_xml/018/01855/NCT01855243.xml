	<brief_summary>Purpose: To compare efficacy and safety of traditional sliding scale insulin (SSI) versus modified 70/30 insulin versus modified basal plus supplemental scale /bolus insulin regimens for glycemic control in hospitalized diabetic patients with diabetes. Methods: In a prospective trial, patients with diabetes will be randomized to receive either traditional hospital SSI , or twice daily 70/30 insulin plus supplemental lunchtime insulin for BG ≥ 150 mg/dL or once every night glargine plus three times prandial glulisine for BG ≥ 150 mg/dL . 70/30 insulin and glargine will be started respectively at 0.4 and 0.2 U/kg/day for BG ≤ 200 mg/dL or 0.5 and 0.3 U/kg/day for BG above 200 mg/dL.</brief_summary>
