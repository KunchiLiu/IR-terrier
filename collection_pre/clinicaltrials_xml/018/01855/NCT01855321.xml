	<brief_title>Effects of Treating Vitamin D Deficiency in Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject will undergo screening procedures, subject will have blood drawn from a vein in your arm to measure subject's Vitamin D level (about 1 tablespoon).If the subject is eligible based on the results of their blood work and the subject agrees to participate in this study, the subject will return to the clinic to begin the study. There will be 4 study visits every 2 months and phone interviews every 2 weeks during the 6 month study. In the beginning (Visit 1) and end of the study (Visit 4), fasting blood samples will be collected for analysis of fasting plasma glucose, %HbAlc (your long-term sugar control over a 3 month period), calcium, insulin, and Vitamin D level. Urine samples will be collected to determine urinary microalbumin-creatinine ratio (early protein loss in the kidneys). Blood pressure will be measured three times with an automatic blood pressure machine. Height and weight will be measured. A medical history questionnaire will be completed by subjects that will include basic demographics, typical dietary intake, smoking and alcohol history, medical history, as well as list of medications and over-the-counter supplements. At Visit 1 the subject will be randomized (like the toss of a coin) to receive either a sugar pill or a high dose Vitamin D medication, which the subject will take once a week for 8 weeks and then once a month for 4 months. The subject will have a 50:50 chance of receiving one or the other pill. At Visit 2 and Visit 3, the subject will also get blood work to analyze your calcium and Vitamin D level. At each clinic visit, the subject will also have your blood sugar and high blood pressure managed closely by the study investigators, both of who are doctors (one being a primary care doctor and another being an endocrinology/diabetes doctor), according to a standardized preset flowchart. This means that the doctors in this study will be controlling the subject's blood sugar and blood pressure values closely and may be changing the subject's blood pressure and/or your blood sugar medications during this study depending on what the subject's blood sugar and blood pressure values are. The subject will be instructed not to have their own primary care doctor or diabetes doctor adjust their diabetes or blood pressure as both will be managed closely by the study doctors during the entire 6 month study period. The subject doctors' will be sent a letter notifying of the subject's participation in the study and be instructed not to adjust any of the subject's blood sugar or blood pressure medications during the entire 6 month study as it will be done closely by the study doctors, as clinically indicated. The subject's doctor will be sent letters after each study visit detailing what changes were done, if any, to your blood sugar and blood pressure medication regimen. The subject will be interviewed on the phone every 2 weeks to assess for any medication adverse reactions and treatment compliance.</detailed_description>
