	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the pain experienced by patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with Invisalign ® corrective aligners with that of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with conventional braces. Because the aligners are removable, nearly invisible and don't involve metal that can irritate teeth and gums, we are expecting less pain in the Invisalign Treatment and less affectation of the quality of life.</brief_summary>
