	<brief_title>Comparing Blood Sugar Levels and Endothelial Function of PEAK ATP® With GlycoCarn®, PEAK ATP® and GlycoCarn® Supplements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of the study substances utilized to support improved healthy levels of blood sugar and endothelial function. Each subject will be randomized to receive a specific dose of PEAK ATP® (Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate Disodium Salt)with GlycoCarn® (Glycine Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride, USP (United States Pharmacopeia) , PEAK ATP® (Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate Disodium Salt) and GlycoCarn® (Glycine Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride, USP )or Placebo twice daily. Participants will undergo assessment of blood tests, brachial ultrasound for determining the change in flow mediated dilation, body weight, % body fat, BMI, waist/hip circumference and blood pressure. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of PEAK ATP® with GlycoCarn®, PEAK ATP® and GlycoCarn® on improving levels of blood sugar via assessment of plasma glucose. Secondary objectives: 1. To assess flow-mediated dilation as determined by brachial ultrasound evaluation. 2. To assess the effect on changes in blood levels of HbA1C, high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), Insulin, Nitric Oxide (NOx), Malondialdehyde (MAL), Soluble Inter-cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and E-Selectin. 3. To assess the effect on body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), % body fat as measured by skin caliper, waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure. 4. To assess the effect on general and sexual health for males and females as determined through questionnaires.</detailed_description>

Confirmed by a baseline fasting blood sugar level between 95.0125.0 mg/dl with the glucose meter via finger stick OR laboratory evaluation of glucose level between 95.0125.0 mg/dl Having no difficulty with digestion or absorption of food Primary Having ever received a clinical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (excluding hypertension), cancer (excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer), autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, etc.), gout, seizures, liver or kidney disease, gallbladder disease, thyroid disease, bipolar disorder, manic depression, schizophrenia, apathetic (inherited) depression, or any other diagnosis that would preclude study participation in the judgment of the investigator/subinvestigator. Having ever received a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance, or currently taking any medications for either of the aforementioned conditions. Having ever had a revascularization procedure (bypass, angioplasty or stent placement) or having received an organ transplant, pacemaker, or internal medical device. Currently receiving hormone replacement therapy or taking phosphodiesterase type5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as Sildenafil, Vardenafil and Tadalafil. If taking aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen or other antiinflammatory medication(s), cholesterol medications (including statins), an oral contraceptive, blood pressure medications or medications to treat congestive heart failure (including ACE inhibitors, ACE antagonists or diuretics), must have been on a stable dose for greater than 3 months prior to baseline and be willing to remain on stable dose for duration of study. If taking any other cardiovascular drugs including but not limited to antiarrhythmics (excluding beta blockers), inotropic agents, antianginals, or digitalis. Having had a history of any medical or surgical procedure that would preclude participation in the study in the judgment of the investigator/sub investigator. Having any blood coagulation disorder or vitamin K deficiency. History of allergy to any nutritional supplements, herbal remedies, foods, or any of the components in the study products. Have no clinically significant abnormalities on the basis of medical history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation and vital signs in the judgment of the investigator and/or subinvestigator.</criteria>
