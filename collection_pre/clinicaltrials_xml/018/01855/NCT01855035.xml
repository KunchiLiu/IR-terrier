	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether repeated enhanced and prolonged ECG monitoring after ischemic stroke results in a higher detection of atrial fibrillation (/flutter) compared to usual care (at least 24 hour of cardiac monitoring).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Recent cerebral ischemia defined as stroke (sudden focal neurologic deficit lasting &gt; 24h consistent with the territory of a major cerebral artery and categorised as ischemic) and/or a corresponding lesion on brain imaging. Stroke symptoms started ≤ 7 days ago. Age ≥ 60 years. Modified Rankin scale ≤ 2 (prior to index event). Known history of atrial fibrillation/flutter or atrial fibrillation/flutter on admission ECG. Indication for oral anticoagulation at randomisation. Absolute contraindication against oral anticoagulation at randomisation. Intracerebral bleeding in medical history. Patient scheduled for HolterECG or cardiac EventRecording monitoring ≥ 48 hours. Significant carotid artery or vertebral artery stenosis &gt; 50% (NASCET classification), significant intracranial artery stenosis suspicious of atherosclerotic origin or acute arterial dissection explanatory of stroke symptoms. Implanted pacemaker device or cardioverter/defibrillator. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year for reasons other than stroke (e.g. metastatic cancer). Concomitant participation in other controlled randomised trial.</criteria>
