	<brief_summary>Sedation and anesthesia for which to perform diagnostic imaging represents a rapidly growing field of practice, especially in children. Propofol is the most common sedative drug administered for MRI/CT. However, this drug is associated with adverse events, including pulmonary complications, and there has been no report on these complications in Korea. In this prospective observation study, the investigators will report the nature and frequency of adverse events associated with propofol-based sedation for MRI/CT.</brief_summary>
