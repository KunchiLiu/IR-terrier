	<brief_summary>This is a study to assess the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate behavioral intervention to reduce obesity levels and ultimately the risk of developing diabetes type II in immigrant Latino farm workers. Workers enrolled in a 2:1 ratio by random allocation into an intervention or control arm of the study. The intervention participants received weekly classes for 10 weeks with education on diabetes, diet and physical activity and practical exercises. Both control and intervention were measured for weight, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose and interviewed before and after the study intervention. The main hypothesis was that intervention, but not control participants, would experience reduction in body measurements after the intervention.</brief_summary>
