	<brief_summary>This Phase 4 study is designed for the collection of blood biomarker samples from participants who have completed CHB treatment with at least 24 weeks of a pegylated interferon alfa-2a (Peg-IFN alfa-2a) containing regimen and at least 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up. Participants may be enrolled from historical studies supported or sponsored by Roche, ongoing studies supported or sponsored by Roche, or from general medical practice. The follow-up of individuals who choose to participate in this study will be in accordance with the ongoing studies or with the general medical practice of the physician. Data from whole blood deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples collected in the GV28555 study or available from previously collected Roche Clinical Repository (RCR) samples will be used for combined analysis with data from other applicable studies. Procedures will include blood sample collection (not applicable for participants who previously have consented and donated RCR DNA samples) and medical record capture.</brief_summary>
