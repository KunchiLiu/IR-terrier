	<brief_title>Second-line Treatment With Icotinib in Esophageal Carcinoma Patients With EGFR Overexpression (IHC 3+) or Positive FISH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is critical for cancer cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to apoptosis.EGFR is overexpressed in many epithelial malignancies and therefore makes an attractive therapeutic target.This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotinib in treating advanced carcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction and esophagus with EGFR overexpression (IHC 3+) or positive FISH, the primary endpoint is objective response rates. Secondary endpoints include progress-free survival, overall survival, safety and so on.</detailed_description>
