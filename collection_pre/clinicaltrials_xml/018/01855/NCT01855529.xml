	<brief_summary>After surgery for breast cancer, the prevalence of chronic pain is estimated between 20 and 68%. They begin after surgery and may persist until more than 6 months. They respond poorly to opioid analgesics impair the quality of life. Among the different postoperative analgesic techniques used, the use of a local anesthetic infiltration continues catheter has advantages including improving the quality of analgesia, with a significant decrease in average of VAS (scale visual Analogue), a decrease in morphine consumption, improving the quality of life of patients. Our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a continuous local anesthetic infiltration in the control of postoperative pain after mastectomy.</brief_summary>
