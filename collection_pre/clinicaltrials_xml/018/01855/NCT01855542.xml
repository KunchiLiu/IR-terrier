	<brief_summary>Chloride-rich isotonic crystalloid solutions have been shown to exert electrolyte imbalance and metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients. The aim of this investigation is to compare the influence of 0.9% saline and plasmalyte solution on acid-base balance and electrolytes in healthy patients undergoing major spine surgeries.</brief_summary>
