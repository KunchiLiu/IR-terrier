	<brief_summary>1. Title: Clinical study of the relationship between Pharmacogenomics and warfarin dose in Chinese patients 2. Drug: Warfarin 3. Design: To value the accuracy of warfarin Pharmacogenomics algorithm by the algorithm calculated dose and actual dose in the Chinese patients. 4. Hypothesis:Pharmacogenomic algorithm guided dose can help to predict warfarin dose in Chinese patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Warfarin Maintenance Dose in Chinese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- For the patients who need to use warfarin, detect the "Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1),cytochrome p450 2C9 (CYP2C9), and cytochrome p450 4F2 (CYP4F2) genotype. - Record the demographic information: gender, age, height, and weight. - Record drug combination, complications, and international normalized ratio (INR), liver function and kidney function or other biochemical test results. - Put genotypes, demographic information and other clinical information into the algorithm to calculate warfarin dose for the patients, and compared with the actual dose.</detailed_description>
