	<brief_summary>Recently results have shown that Bevacizumab is active both in monotherapy and in combination therapy in patients with ovarian cancer. One of our objectives is to evaluate whether the addition of neoadjuvant bevacizumab improves the response and whether this affects the evolution of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Therapy in Advanced Ovarian Cancer With Avastin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women, after lung, breast and colon cancer, and it represents the most common cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. The high mortality associated with OC is due to the lack of screening tests that enable an early diagnosis, thus the majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease when the chances of a cure are very limited. In fact, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for stage III-IV OC does not exceed 20-30% in many series. The standard treatment for advanced OC is maximal cytoreductive surgery (or debulking) followed by the administration of 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. In recent years, a number of studies have been carried out with antiangiogenic drugs. Specifically, bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be active both in monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with OC that have received multiple previous lines of chemotherapy. One of the objectives is to evaluate whether the addition of neoadjuvant bevacizumab improves the response and whether this affects the evolution of patients.</detailed_description>

Administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy planned. 4. Previous systemic antitumor treatment against ovarian cancer. 5. Intestinal obstruction or subocclusion, intestinal infiltration shown by CT scan or rectosigmoid infiltration in gynaecological examination. 6. Uncontrolled hypertension. 7. Any previous radiotherapy: abdomen or pelvis. 8. Major traumatic injuries in the 4 weeks prior to the first potential dose of bevacizumab. 9. History or clinical suspicion of brain metastases or spinal cord compression. 10. History or evidence of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, unless properly treated with standard medical treatment. 11. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA) or subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in the 6 months prior to randomization. 12. Fertile women of childbearing age who are not willing to use effective contraception during the study and at least 6 months after the study. 13. Women that are breastfeeding or pregnant. 14. Prior exposure to mouse CA125 antibody. 15. Treatment with any other experimental product, or participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to inclusion. 16. Malignant tumors other than ovarian cancer within the 5 years prior to randomisation, with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ treated correctly and/or basalcell carcinoma. 17. Known hypersensitivity to bevacizumab or any of its excipients (including Cremophor). 18. Nonhealing wound, active peptic ulcer or bone fracture. Patients with healing incised granulomas by secondary intention, with no evidence of fascial dehiscence or infection can be included, but they require three weeks of wound control. 19. History or evidence of bleeding or thrombotic diathesis 20. Current or recent continued use of aspirin &gt; 325 mg / day (within 10 days prior to randomization) 21. Current or recent use (within 10 days before the first cycle of treatment) of full doses of anticoagulants or thrombolytics administered orally or parenterally for therapeutic purposes (except for vascular permeability, in which case the INR should be kept below 1.5). 22. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina (≤ 6 months before randomization) Congestive heart failure (CHF) class ≥ II of the NYHA (New York Heart Association) Poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia despite medication (may include patients with atrial fibrillation with controlled frequency) Peripheral vascular disease ≥ grade 3 (i.e. symptomatic and interfering with activities or daily living [ADL] needing repair or review) 23. Preexisting sensory or motor neuropathy, ≥ grade 2 24. Demonstration of any other neurological or metabolic dysfunction involving a reasonable suspicion of the existence of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an experimental drug, or that involves an increased risk to the patient of treatmentrelated complications 25. No medical or psychiatric illness that may impede the performance of a systemic or surgical treatment 26. Laboratory: Inadequate bone marrow function: ANC: &lt;1.5 x 109/l platelet count &lt;100 x 109/l Hb &lt;9 g/dl.
