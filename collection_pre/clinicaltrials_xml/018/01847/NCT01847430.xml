	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term persistence of immunity to hepatitis B in adolescents aged 15-16 years who were vaccinated with Engerix™-B Kinder in infancy. The study will also assess the immune response to a challenge dose of Engerix™-B Kinder in these subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Long-term Persistence of Immunity to Hepatitis B, in Adolescents Vaccinated in Infancy With Engerix™-B Kinder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This MDD has been updated following the Protocol Amendment 1, dated 20 June 2013. The Protocol was amended because GSK replaced its in-house Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) that was used to measure anti-HBs (antibodies to Hepatitis B surface antigen) antibody concentrations with ChemiLuminescence ImmunoAssay (CLIA). Additionally, the threshold level of prednisone was modified to reflect the dosage normally prescribed to adolescents.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject's parent(s)/guardians who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply, with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 15 and 16 years of age at the time of the vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. Written informed assent obtained from the subject in addition to the informed consent signed by the parent(s)/LAR(s). Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Documented evidence of previous vaccination with three consecutive doses of Engerix™B Kinder in Germany: with the first two doses received by 9 months of age and the third dose received by 18 months of age. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Previous hepatitis B vaccination since administration of the third dose of Engerix™B Kinder. History of hepatitis B disease. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before study vaccine dose, or planned administration during the study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C on rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be axillary. Subjects with a minor illness without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the study vaccine dose or planned administration during the study period. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.</criteria>
