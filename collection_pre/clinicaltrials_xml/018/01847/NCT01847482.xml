	<brief_summary>A multicenter, single-arm, prospective, interventional trial to evaluate therapeutic hypothermia with intravascular temperature management (IVTM) in post-cardiogenic cardiac arrest, post-return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) patients in Japan. The objective of this study is to verify that therapeutic hypothermia performed by intravascular cooling using the investigational device (IVTM) can control body temperature appropriately in post-cardiogenic cardiac arrest, post-ROSC patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Nontraumatic inhospital or outofhospital cardiac arrest 2. Unwitnessed cardiac arrest (Ventricular fibrillation), or witnessed cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation, pulseless electrical activity, asystole within 15 minutes following onset) 3. Patient is at least 20 years of age and less than 80 years of age with consent is given 4. In the judgement of an investigator or subinvestigator, the patient is unable to follow verbal instructions 5. Therapeutic hypothermia using the investigational device can be initiated within six hours of Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) 6. Written consent can be obtained from a legally acceptable representative 1. Traumatic cardiac arrest (blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, burns, exsanguination, suffocation, smoke inhalation, near drowning, etc) 2. Accidental hypothermia with core body temperature less than 35.0Â°C 3. Pregnant or of child bearing potential 4. Patient has given or indicated a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order 5. Femoral venous access is contraindicated by previous surgey, medical history, anatomy or the like 6. An inferior vena cava filter is in place 7. Patient has severe bleeding (Pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, etc.) 8. Intracranial hemorrhage as confirmed by CT scanning 9. Hemodynamic instability despite use of vasopressor agents and cardiac stimulants 10. Heparin hypersensitivity 11. Serious systemic infectious diseases (sepsis, etc.) 12. Platelet count less than 30,000/mm3 13. Serious hepatic dysfunction 14. Serious renal impairment 15. Using percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) 16. Using continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) 17. Therapeutic hypothermia has been otherwise implemented between ROSC and the start of the study (excluding the rapid infusion of nonglucosecontaining cold electrolyte fluid, or nonglucosecontaining cold plasma volume expander) 18. The patient's core body temperature cannot be monitored 19. Currently participating in another clinical trial or has participated in another clinical trial within the past six months 20. in the judgement of an investigator or subinvestigator, participation in this clinical trial is inappropriate for the patient</criteria>
