	<brief_title>Assessing Patient Comfort With Two Different Multi-Purpose Disinfecting Solutions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to recent surveys of contact lens fitters, the most prescribed treatments for contact lens dryness are: more frequent replacement schedule (24%), refit into different material (23%), rewetting drops (21%) and change care system (15%). Changing care systems has been a standard treatment for CL discomfort for many years. In the same survey, 30% of practitioners felt there is absolutely no difference among solutions with respect to reducing dryness and discomfort. The investigators set out to compare the clinical performance of these two solutions: AMO's RevitaLens and Alcon's Opti-Free PureMoist.</detailed_description>
