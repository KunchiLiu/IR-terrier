	<brief_summary>During aging there is a tendency for muscle protein synthesis (growth) to become less efficient and the resulting consequence leads to reduced muscle mass (sarcopenia) which can affect strength and mobility. Protein consumption may be one opportunity to alleviate this problem especially when consumed in appropriate amounts following resistance training. This study is designed to determine if a soy dairy protein blend, shown to be effective in younger adults, will produce beneficial muscle protein synthesis in older healthy adults following resistance exercise.</brief_summary>
