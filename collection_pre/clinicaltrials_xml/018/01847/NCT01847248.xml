	<brief_summary>- Molecules indicating endothelial injury may serve as biomarkers for severe sepsis because of the critical role of endothelial injury in organ dysfunction during severe sepsis. - HSPA12B is primarily located in endothelial cells and detectable during sepsis. - The investigators speculated that HSPA12B from endothelial cells might be correlated with severe sepsis.</brief_summary>
