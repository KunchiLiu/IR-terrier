	<brief_summary>Background Allergic rhinitis is a common health problem with a worldwide prevalence is 10-25%, and poses significant impact on the quality of life of the patients. In Thailand, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the general population is 13.5%, of which the frequency of allergic rhinitis increased from 23% to 38% in the children, and 61.9% in the graduate students. Despite intranasal steroid being the current first-line treatment of patients with allergic rhinitis, only 60% of patients achieve excellent control. Persistent nasal congestion is the major symptom which is difficult to control in these patients. Data are limited about efficacy and safety of the additional use of 0.05% intranasal oxymetazoline hydrochloride (OXY) for persistent nasal congestion that does not adequately respond to recommended doses of intranasal steroid (INS) and oral antihistamine(OAH). Objective To determine the efficacy and safety of the additional use of OXY for persistent nasal congestion in allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis patients inadequately controlled by combination treatment with INS and OAH. Methods The investigators performed a 6-week, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial in 50 patients with allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis whom inadequately controlled by combination treatment with INS and oral antihistamine (OAH). After an initial screening, qualified individuals were randomized into 2 groups including the treatment group and the control group. The treatment group received the INS (2 puffs in each nostril twice daily) and OAH (1 tablet once daily) plus OXY (2 puffs in each nostril twice daily) The control group received INS (2 puffs in each nostril twice daily) and OAH (1 tablet once daily) plus placebo (2 puffs in each nostril twice daily).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants will continue medications for 4 weeks, then stop using interventional medication and still take INS (2 puffs in each nostril twice daily) and OAH (1 tablet once daily) for 2 more weeks. Then, all participants will come for the last visit to see whether rebound nasal symptoms occur. Participants will be asked to record nasal symptom diary card, and nasal peak inspiratory flow. Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of life Questionnaire (Rcq) will be recorded during visit.</detailed_description>
