	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Relapsed or Advanced Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma and Oligoastrocytoma: Single-arm, Phase II Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient with relapsed or advanced anaplastic oligodendroglioma and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma will be enrolled. Enrolled patients will begin on temozolomide 200 mg/m2/d in a fasting state for 5 consecutive days (1,000 mg/m2 per 28-day cycle). Patients who were previously treated with any chemotherapy initially received temozolomide 150 mg/m2/d for 5 days (750 mg/m2 per cycle).Patients will be receving a total 6 cycles of chemotheray (4weeks/cycle * 6cycles = 24weeks). If the patients shows responses to Temozolomide, treatment can be continued by the investigator's discretion. During the administration of Temozolomide, vital signs, physical examination, ECOG performance status, height, weight, hematology and chemistry test, adverse events and concomitant drugs will be evaluated every four weeks. Brain MRI for tumor assessment will be performed once every 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
