	<brief_summary>The effective relief of pain is of paramount importance to anyone treating patients undergoing surgery. Post-operative pain increases the possibility of post-surgical complications, raises the cost of medical care, and most importantly, interferes with recovery and return to normal activities of daily living. Therefore pain control is essential in the management of patients undergoing spinal surgery.Parenteral administration of narcotics has been the mainstay for postoperative pain relief in patients undergoing laminectomy and discectomy. Epidural and intrathecal opioids are also effective means of pain control in several major surgical interventions including spinal surgery. However, some of the side effects have limited their widespread use (eg, late-onset respiratory depression). Therefore, alternative measures of pain control including infiltration of paraspinal musculature with local anesthetics have been investigated with conflicting results. In situations such as laminectomies, where the epidural space is exposed as part of the surgical procedure, the application of absorbable gelatin sponge soaked in local anesthetics appears to be an alternative for providing postoperative analgesia. By investigating the probable analgesic effects of this method the investigators may relieve post laminectomy pain with minimal side effects and also costs.</brief_summary>
