	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled trial with 50 veterans diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid alcohol dependence. Veterans will be randomized to receive either zonisamide (400 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks in a double blind fashion. Randomization will be done using 3:1 ratio and will be performed by our research pharmacy using a random assignment in blocks of 4- 3 will be assigned to active medication and 1 to placebo. Medication will be titrated over a 6 week titration phase followed by a 6 week treatment phase. All veterans will receive E-CPT-C therapy for the 12 weeks of treatment; E-CPT-C will be provided by trained and qualified clinicians with extensive experience providing E-CPT-C. Veterans will be recruited primarily through advertisement, but also through the clinical facilities at the VA and from other collaborators.</brief_summary>
