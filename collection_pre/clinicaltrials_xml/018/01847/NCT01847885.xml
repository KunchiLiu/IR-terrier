	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of electricity) reduces post-stroke shoulder pain. This study involves a device called the Smartpatch System. The Smartpatch System delivers mild electrical stimulation to the muscles in the shoulder. The Smartpatch System includes a small wire (called a "Lead") that is placed through the skin into the muscle of the shoulder. It also includes a device worn on the body that delivers stimulation (called the Smartpatch Stimulator).</brief_summary>
