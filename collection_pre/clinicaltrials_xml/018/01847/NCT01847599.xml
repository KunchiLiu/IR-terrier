	<brief_title>Educational Intervention to Adherence of Patients Treated by Capecitabine +/- Lapatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>200 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria treated by capecitabine +/- lapatinib, will be enrolled into the study. Adherence to treatment of all subjects will be assessed during a first adherence evaluation period of 3 cycles in order to identify patients who need educational intervention(non adherent patients). Only nonadherent patients (adherence rate &lt; 80%) will receive an education intervention. During the educational program, the efficacy of the implementation of an educational program on adherence to capecitabine alone or in combination to lapatinib will be evaluated for the 6 subsequent cycles.</detailed_description>
