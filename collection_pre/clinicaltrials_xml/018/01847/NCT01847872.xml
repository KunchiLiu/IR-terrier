	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to identify interference between intramuscular Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and other vaccines (Measles Rubella and Yellow Fever) co-administered at nine months of age and to confirm the safety of co-administration. In addition, the study will compare the immunogenicity and safety of IPV when administered via different routes. A total of 1504 healthy infants between the ages of nine to ten months, who have completed their primary immunizations, including at least three doses of trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (tOPV) will be recruited for this study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In studies conducted to date, Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) appears to boost the systemic immunity generated by Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) priming significantly more effectively than the use of additional doses of OPV. The use of IPV to both enhance the immunity generated by OPV and also to provide protection against circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2 outbreaks and Vaccine Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis has the potential to address concerns regarding a switch to bivalent OPV. Concomitant administration with Expanded Program of Immunisations(EPI) vaccines given at about nine months would be a feasible programmatic approach. Maternal antibodies will have largely waned by this point negating any inhibitory effect which they may have within the priming schedule. Significant interference between IPV, Measles and Rubella (MR) and Yellow Fever (YF) vaccines must be excluded to ensure that IPV introduction does not negatively impact on the immunogenicity or safety of the other vaccines in the program at the same point. Restricted manufacturing capacity in the context of a higher manufacturing cost than OPV would currently limit the rate at which IPV could be rolled out within a modified EPI schedule. The administration of a fractional dose of the vaccine by the Intradermal route would facilitate vaccine role out through limiting the cost and the manufacturing scale-up required. The proposed study is phase 4, eight-arm, open label, randomized controlled clinical vaccine trial. A total of 1504 randomized healthy infants between nine and ten months will receive IPV, MR and YF vaccines either alone, in combinations of two vaccines, or all three vaccines will be given together. Different routes (IM and fractional dose ID) and needle free jet injections devices for administration of IPV will be compared in the different groups. The participants will be assigned to one of eight groups using blocked randomization scheme in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Non- inferiority of serological responses and median antibody titers will be the primary immunogenicity end points. The incidence of serious adverse events and other important medical events at any point during the study will be the primary safety end point in all groups. Following device of reference needle/syringe administration, any local adverse event (reactogenicity), which will be collected on day 0(day of vaccination), day 1, day 2 and day 3 will be a second primary safety endpoint.</detailed_description>
