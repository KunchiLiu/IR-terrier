	<brief_summary>This study will look at the feasibility of using a type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging called Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) to detect your implanted radioactive seeds. Researchers hope that using SWI will eliminate the need to use CT imaging to detect your implanted radioactive seeds. This study will also see if the MRI seed detection is as effective as current standard practice of seed detection (routine MRI and CT imaging). This technique would be beneficial for brachytherapy without the need to fuse the MRI and CT images, as is done currently.</brief_summary>
