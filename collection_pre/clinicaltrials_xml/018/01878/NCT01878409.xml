	<brief_title>Study of Sexuality in Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because there is limited literature on sexual function in Parkinson disease, in this study, we examined sexual functioning in a large groups of patients with idiopathic Parkinson Disease compared with healthy subjects in the Italian community. To assess sexual function in PD we used the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning [(BISF-M for man; BISF-W for woman), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Participants were also assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). This study aimed to provide a thorough epidemiological description of sexual dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. The knowledge of sexual function in PD might help to plan effective interventionist measures and ultimately to optimize patient's and the partner's quality of life. Parkinson patients (aged 40-80) and 123 healthy controls (aged 40-80) will be recruited from four Italian Movement Disorders Clinics.</detailed_description>
