	<brief_summary>In recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on the link between oral and systemic health. Obesity, a growing medical problem worldwide, has been associated with multiple chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. With respect to the effect of obesity on periodontal health, it has been shown that obese subjects exhibit higher inflammation around natural teeth and are at increased risk of tooth loss than individuals with normal weight. Peri-implantitis, an inflammatory condition of bacterial origin that occurs around oral implants and resembles periodontal disease, has become a serious concern for the dental profession given its increasing prevalence and challenging treatment. There is also strong evidence that individuals with a history of periodontitis are also at risk for peri-implantitis. However, knowledge about the pathogenesis and treatment of peri-implantitis is scarce. Hence, it is extremely important to understand the implications of excessive body fat on peri-implant health. Based on the current understanding on the effect of obesity on systemic and local inflammation around natural teeth, the investigators hypothesize that obesity will have a significant impact on peri-implant health by inducing an increased inflammatory response as measured by clinical as well as molecular markers of inflammation.</brief_summary>
