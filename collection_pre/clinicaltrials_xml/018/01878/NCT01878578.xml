	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is determine the interaction of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL, BIA 2-093) on the steadystate pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in patients and to evaluate the tolerability and safety of ESL administered concomitantly with phenytoin in patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of BIA 2-093 on the Steady-state Pharmacokinetic Profile of Phenytoin in Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was planned as a single-dose, open label phase (Phase A) followed by a multiple-dose, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover phase (Phase B) study in patients taking phenytoin. Phase B consisted of two 14-day treatment periods separated by a washout period of 10 to 15 days. Subjects continued their usual phenytoin scheme and received a single dose of ESL 1200 mg (Phase A) and either ESL (600 mg from Day 1 to 7 and 1200 mg from Day 8 to 14) or matching placebo once-daily for 14 days in each period. The study was prematurely terminated due to impossibility of recruiting the planned number of patients. Only 4 patients were admitted and this was considered a too small sample size to allow a reliable assessment of the potential interaction between ESL and phenytoin. Therefore, no pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed.</detailed_description>
