	<brief_summary>This pilot study is being conducted in order to help make the case for later, more systematic research on the effectiveness of the Comprehensive Behavioral (COMB) model of treating trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling). The goals are to standardize COMB treatment techniques in the form of a clear written manual for therapists; determine whether therapists can use these guidelines in a consistent manner in making treatment decisions; develop and test the reliability of measures of how well therapists are conducting the treatment; and collect preliminary data on the acceptability of the treatment to patients.</brief_summary>
