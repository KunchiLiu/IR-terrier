	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate concentration-controlled everolimus with low dose tacrolimus compared to early conversion to CNI-free regimen and MMF/MPA with standard dose tacrolimus in de novo renal transplant recipients of ECD/DCD kidneys. Given tacrolimus and MMF/MPA is a widely prescribed immunosuppressive regimen in the United States, comparisons of tacrolimus and MMF/MPA regimens to investigational therapies and treatment regimens are needed. Also, considering the fact that ECD/DCD is a fast growing fraction of donors, evaluation of various regimens' effects on rather delicate ECD/DCD kidneys is necessary.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Everolimus With Other Medicines in Recipients of ECD/DCD Kidneys</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate concentration-controlled everolimus with low dose tacrolimus compared to early conversion to CNI-free regimen and MMF/MPA with standard dose tacrolimus in de novo renal transplant recipients of ECD/DCD kidneys. Given tacrolimus and MMF/MPA is a widely prescribed immunosuppressive regimen in the United States, comparisons of tacrolimus and MMF/MPA regimens to investigational therapies and treatment regimens are needed. Also, considering the fact that ECD/DCD is a fast growing fraction of donors, evaluation of various regimens' effects on rather delicate ECD/DCD kidneys is necessary. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate concentration-controlled everolimus and low dose tacrolimus compared to MMF/MPA with standard dose tacrolimus at 24 months post-transplant with respect to the composite efficacy failure rates (treated biopsy proven acute rejection episodes (BPAR), graft loss, death, loss to follow-up) in de novo renal transplant recipients. The key secondary objective is to compare renal function of the everolimus treatment arms to the MMF/MPA treatment arm at 12 and 24 months post-transplantation. Renal function will be measured by the calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), using the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) formula (20).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female recipients 1865 years of age undergoing primary or secondary kidney transplantation Recipients of primary or secondary cadaveric, ECD/DCD kidney (defined as follows) Donor whose heart has irreversibly stopped beating, previously referred to as nonheartbeating or asystolic donation Braindead donor &gt; 60 years old Donor aged 5059 years old with two of the following criteria: History of hypertension Terminal serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL Death resulting from cerebrovascular accident Patients who have given written informed consent to participate in the study Cold ischemic time (CIT) &gt; 30 hours Patients who are ABO incompatible transplants, or T, or B cell crossmatch positive transplant Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical class Noncontrolled DCD Donor age &gt;70 Patients with BMI &gt;32 at baseline before surgery Pregnant or lactating females Females of childbearing potential unwilling to use an effective means of contraception or are planning to become pregnant Patients with platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3 at the evaluation before randomization.
