	<brief_title>Long-term Study to Evaluate Different Dental Implant Alloys in Straumann 3.3mm Diameter Bone Level Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study objective is to compare implant survival with the Titanium Zirconium (Roxolid™) implant compared the Titanium grade IV (SLActive®) implant between baseline (surgery) and 10 years. The following outcome parameters will be evaluated at 5 and 10 years post surgery for the two different implant types Straumann® Bone Level SLActive, diameter 3.3 mm, Titanium-Zirconium (Roxolid®) vs. Straumann® Bone Level SLActive implant, diameter 3.3 mm, Titanium Grade IV: - Implant survival - Implant success according to Buser et al. (1990) - Crestal bone level change measured by Orthopantomogram (OPT) - Soft tissue health - Clinical measurements - Prosthetic parts assessments: Success and maintenance - Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) - Product Safety (Adverse events and device deficiencies)</detailed_description>
