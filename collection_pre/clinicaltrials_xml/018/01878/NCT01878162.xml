	<brief_summary>Law enforcement officials (LEOs) demonstrate an elevated risk for occupational injury. The effectiveness of exercise-based work injury prevention programs (WIPPs) to reduce the risk and costs associated with occupational injury has yet to be tested rigorously in LEOs. The accuracy of existing field tests of physical functioning to predict occupational injuries and related expenses remains unclear. The objectives of this study are to: (i) determine the effect of an exercise-based WIPP on occupational wellness and productivity in a cohort of LEOs, and (ii) to determine the accuracy of 2 common field assessments of physical function to predict lost work productivity and related expenses in a cohort of LEOs.</brief_summary>
