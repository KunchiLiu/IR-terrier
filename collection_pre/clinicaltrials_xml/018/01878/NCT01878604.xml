	<brief_summary>Identify new or novel genes which may impact on cholesterol level, and establish the relationship between those gene mutations with atherosclerosis, as well as responses to lipid-lowering drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Analysis and Treatment Optimization in Chinese Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To better understand the genetics basis for LDL-C elevation and develop an optimized lipid-lowering strategy, we propose to do the following studies: 1. To establish a China HoFH registry, and collect DNA and blood samples from all available family members of each proband (pedigrees); 2. To detect gene mutations known to cause FH and identify family suitable for future whole genome sequencing aimed to identify novel genes controlling cholesterol levels. 3.To establish the relationship between types of gene mutations and lipid and atherosclerosis profile, as well as responses to lipid-lowering agents.</detailed_description>
