	<brief_summary>NAC is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine. It is a common over-the-counter supplement and also is available as an injectable pharmaceutical that protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose. In the exercise physiology literature, both oral and injectable NAC have been shown to reduce fatigue and improve recovery from exertion which has interesting implications for exploring cancer-related fatigue. In terms of cancer cell biology, reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play an important role in the development and progression of breast cancer</brief_summary>
