	<brief_summary>Superiority of additional Remote Patient Management (RPM) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) in comparison to usual care in terms of, e.g.: - days lost due to unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization or death - all-cause mortality - cardiovascular mortality - quality of life</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telemedical Interventional Management in Heart Failure II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical trial assesses 1,500 patients over a period of 12 months each (2013 until 2015). All participants will continue to receive usual care from their general practitioner and specialist. All patients will be examined at the beginning of the study and will undergo a check-up every 3 months. 750 of the patients will be randomly allocated to receive devices for Remote Patient Management (RPM) which will measure various parameters on a daily basis (e.g. weight, blood pressure, heart rate). The devices are mobile and can be used at home or elsewhere.</detailed_description>
