	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant will experience some degree of clinical and/or biochemical hepatic dysfunction. This early injury is known as primary graft dysfunction and varies from minor abnormalities to primary nonfunction. Prostaglandin-class drugs, including prostacyclin and its analogs, could represent an important advance toward the goal of reducing transplant related morbidity, mortality and associated costs by providing these benefits.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Perioperative RemodulinÂ® in Orthotopic Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In vitro and in vivo research has consistently demonstrated an array of potential beneficial effects of prostanoids under both immune and non-immune circumstances relevant to liver allografts. (1-3) Recent reviews summarize the pharmacologic rationale and nonclinical and clinical experience supporting for the use of prostanoids, including prostacyclin and its analogs, in reducing early morbidity and mortality associated with liver transplantation. Prostaglandin-class drugs, including prostacyclin and its analogs, could represent an important advance toward the goal of reducing transplant related morbidity, mortality and associated costs by providing these benefits. Additionally, the reduction in serum creatinine and reduced need for post-operative dialysis observed in some studies has implications in protecting the kidneys from the nephrotoxic affects of the immunosuppressant agents, especially during the early post-operative period. As a chemically stable analog of prostacyclin (PGI2), peri-operative intravenous administration of Remodulin is hypothesized to ameliorate or prevent reperfusion damage and thereby decrease hospitalization time and improve the clinical outcome of liver transplantation, compared to placebo control. Remodulin, as a prostanoid, is expected to facilitate restoration of the blood supply to the revascularized graft, and to provide the well-characterized protective effects of this class of compounds in liver transplant patients.</detailed_description>
