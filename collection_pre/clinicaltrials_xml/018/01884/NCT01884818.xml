	<brief_summary>The study includes two phases. In phase one the reliability of thoracic spine mobility measurements are studied in subjects with thoracic spine pain. In phase two the reliable measurements are used to measure the effects of thoracic spine manipulation in subjects with thoracic spine pain. The changes in pain is measured as well. In second phase the control group receives TNS treatment six times at home as a placebo so that the power of TNS is limited to very low level. The number of treatments are controlled as well as the time of treatment. The treatment group receives six manipulation treatments within 3 week period. The effects are measured immediately after the treatment weeks, and 3 and 8 week follow-up. Moreover the one year follow-up will be performed by mail questionnaire.</brief_summary>
