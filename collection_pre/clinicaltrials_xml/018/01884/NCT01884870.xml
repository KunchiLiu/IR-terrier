	<brief_title>Silent Ureteral Stone: Impact on Renal Function and Kidney Anatomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of nephrolithiasis is increasing worldwide, reaching 5.2% in North America and 10.1% in Italy. The widespread use of computed tomography and ultrasonography have resulted in a greater detection rate of asymptomatic stones and, in part, might explain the trend. Clinically, kidney or ureteral stones range in severity from asymptomatic to presenting with complete renal failure. Therefore, it is not only the alarming incidence of urinary stone disease, but also the associated burden that makes this one of the most concerning conditions in public health. The situation becomes even more distressing when managing asymptomatic stones. Studies of the natural history of stones have revealed that only 20% of patients yearly actually become symptomatic from a new stone, and one half of those require surgical intervention at some point. The guidelines are well established for the treatment of symptomatic urolithiasis, and many investigators have extensively studied the management of silent kidney stones. Conversely, the same is not true for silent ureterolithiasis. The purpose of the present study is to report the investigators experience managing silent ureteral stones and to prospectively analyze their true influence on renal function.</detailed_description>
