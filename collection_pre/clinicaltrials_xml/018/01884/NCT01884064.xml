	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Treatment of Focal Hand Dystonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: The ability of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to enhance intracortical inhibition has motivated its use as a potential therapeutic intervention in focal hand dystonia (FHD). In this preliminary investigation, we assessed the physiologic and behavioral effects of multiple sessions of rTMS in FHD. Methods: 12 patients with FHD underwent five daily-sessions of 1 Hz rTMS to contralateral dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC). Patients held a pencil and made movements that did not elicit dystonic symptoms during rTMS. We hypothesized that an active but non-dystonic motor state would increase beneficial effects of rTMS. Five additional patients received sham-rTMS protocol. The area under curve (AUC) of the motor evoked potentials and the cortical silent period (CSP) were measured to assess changes in corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition, respectively. Behavioral measures included pen force and velocity during handwriting and subjective report.</detailed_description>
