	<brief_summary>Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a common clinical problem of musculoskeletal pain and various treatment modalities have been introduced. If self-applicable physical modalities and medications that are used for treatment of MPS patients are combined, they may open up new possibilities for effective and practical self-care. The aim of this study is to compared the therapeutic effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) patch given in monotherapy and NSAID patch in combination with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, heating pad, or topical capsaicin in the treatment of patients with MPS of the upper trapezius.</brief_summary>
