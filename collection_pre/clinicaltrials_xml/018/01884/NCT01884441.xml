	<brief_title>Bendamustine, Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine (BeGEV) as Induction Therapy in Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to evaluate bendamustine, gemcitabine and vinorelbine (BeGEV) scheme efficacy as induction therapy to high dose chemotherapy with Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem-Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) for patients with relapsed/refractory Hodglin's Lymphoma (HL). Four BeGEV courses repeated every 3 weeks in the absence of any reasons listed in the paragraph 7.5; whenever an objective response is observed at disease evaluation performed after IV cycle patients undergo to high dose chemotherapy with AHSCT (conditioning regimens based on preference of each Centre).</detailed_description>
