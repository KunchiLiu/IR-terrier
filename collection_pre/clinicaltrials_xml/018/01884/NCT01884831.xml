	<brief_summary>In Russia the treatment nonhealing skin defects often limited to surgical interventions, despite having developed modern methods of treatment of non-healing ulcers and other skin imperfections. During the many years of research we have developed a skin equivalent comprising living cells. During pilot trial showed that the skin equivalent provides healing skin defect within 1-4 weeks in 95% of patients.</brief_summary>
