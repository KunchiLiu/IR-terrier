	<brief_summary>To investigate gene expression profile and immunological associated analysis relating to immunotherapy response of patients with malignant tumor presenting malignant cavity effusion after DC-CIK immunotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Gene Expression Profiling and Immunological Mechanism Affects the Response of Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The patients with malignant cavity effusion are treated with dendritic cells (DC) plus cytokine induced killer cells (CIK) locally. 2. Malignant cavity effusion from cancer patients is obtained through puncture and is centrifugalized to get supernatant fluid and enrich cancer cells before and after the therapy. 3. The enriched cancer cells which are flash frozen, as well as the supernatant, are stored at -80°C until processing. 4. The T-Cell Receptor/B-Cell Receptor gene expression in cavity effusion is detected by micro-array to explore the mechanism that DC-CIK immunotherapy controls the malignant cavity effusion. 5. Statistical analysis is performed using unsupervised hierarchical cluster.</detailed_description>
