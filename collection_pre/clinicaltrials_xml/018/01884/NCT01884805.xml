	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the protocol is to evaluate the adaptive optics visual simulator to measure optical aberrations in hyperopic eyes. The study hypotheses are the: - Ability to measure optical aberrations in hypermetropia. - Knowledge of optical aberrations of the eye hyperopic. - To adapt therapeutic management in optical aberrations measured.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The procedure is guided by the custom made software and its graphical user interface. The interface has been designed to be user-friendly, being very similar to the software usually managed by the clinicians in their daily professional practice. The complete procedure in one patient takes less than 5 minutes and is completely non-invasive. The optical measurements only involve the use of low power infrared laser and the visual testing is as simple for the patients as watching television and making responses.</detailed_description>
