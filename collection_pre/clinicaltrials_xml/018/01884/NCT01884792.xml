	<brief_summary>The study is a crossover, pilot trial examining the acute effects of standing on blood sugar in prediabetic, working adults. Participants will complete oral glucose tolerance testing, once while sitting and once while standing. They will also wear a continuous blood sugar monitor once while sitting at their desk for a week and once while using their desk as a sit-stand desk with a goal of standing intermittently for at least half of the work day. Physical activity levels will be measured with an accelerometer. The primary study hypothesis is that blood sugar will differ between the sitting and standing conditions for each of the tests performed.</brief_summary>
