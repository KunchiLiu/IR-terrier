	<brief_title>Observational,Prospective Study to Develop and Validate a Prognostic Tool to Optimize Therapy in Patients With HCV G1/4</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Tool: 1. Predicting the overall impact of prognostic factors (including the new factor of genetic polymorphism of the IL28B) on Sustained Viral Response (SVR). 2. Identify those patients most likely to respond. 3. Therapy and therefore optimize resources The validation tool will check into clinical practice its predictive power (it will consider its ability to calibrate and discriminate) and make correct inferences and interpretations of the scores obtained when applying.</detailed_description>
