	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Metoprolol Succinate Extended Release Tablets 200 mg Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product: Metoprolol Succinate 200 mg Ipca Laboratories Limited, India and the corresponding Reference Product: TOPROL-XL® (Metoprolol Succinate) extended release Tablets 200 mg of Astrazenica LP, USA under fasting condition in healthy adult human subjects in a randomized crossover study. The study was conducted with 48 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single 200 mg dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the randomization schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting position. The duration of the clinical phase was approximately 11 days including washout period of at least 7 days between administrations of study drug in each study period.</detailed_description>
