	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Documentation from a previous attempt OR a concurrent reasonable attempt (at least 5 minutes) during this procedure, demonstrating resistance to conventional guidewire crossing; Patient must have objective evidence of lower extremity ischemia; Totally occlusive lesion in a native femoropopliteal artery classified angiographically as absolute (100% occlusion with no flow), where no antegrade filling beyond the occlusion is visible; Target occlusion length is &gt;1cm and ≤ 30 cm; Patient's reference vessel diameter is ≥ 4.0 mm and ≤6.0 mm (by visual angiographic estimation) Patient must be an acceptable candidate for PTA, peripheral artery bypass surgery or peripheral artery stent implantation; Female patients of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to the study procedure; Patient must have been informed of the nature of the study, agree to its provisions, and provide written informed consent; Patient is ≥ 21 years of age. Patient has hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, Plavix or radiographic contrast agents which cannot be adequately premedicated; The patient requires immediate treatment in more than one occluded vessel, in any combination of grafts or native vessels; Patient has planned femoropopliteal intervention scheduled within 30 days after index procedure; The patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device trial that may conflict with study data collection and has not completed the entire followup period; Patient has no collateral flow distal to the occlusion; Patient's target occlusion has a dissection that occurred within the past 30 days caused by a guidewire attempt; Patient has a history of bleeding diatheses, coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusion in cases of emergency; Patient suffered recent (within the past 6 months) significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; Patient's target lesion or the vessel proximal to the target lesion reveals significant ectasia, dissection, aneurysm or thrombus; Patient has other medical illnesses (i.e., cancer or congestive heart failure) that may cause the patient to be noncompliant with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with lifeexpectancy less than 1 year.</criteria>
