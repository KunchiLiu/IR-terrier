	<brief_summary>Central nervous system (CNS) malignancies are the second most common malignancy and the most common solid tumor of childhood, including adolescence. Annually in the United States, approximately 2,200 children are diagnosed with CNS malignancy and rates appear to be increasing. CNS tumors are the leading cause of death from solid tumors in children. Survival duration after diagnosis in children is highly variable depending in part on age at diagnosis, location of tumor, and extent of resection; however, most children with high grade glioma die within 3 years of diagnosis. All patients with high grade glioma experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). We have shown in previous phase I trials that a single Superselective Intra-arterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) of Cetuximab and/or Bevacizumab is safe for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in adults, and we are currently evaluating the efficacy of this treatment. Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an extension of that trial in that we seek to test the hypothesis that intra-arterial Cetuximab and Bevacizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of relapsed/refractory glioma in patients &lt;22 years of age. We expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of SIACI Cetuximab and Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma in patients &lt;22 years of age and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraarterial Infusion Of Erbitux and Bevacizumab For Relapsed/Refractory Intracranial Glioma In Patients Under 22</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include: 1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol 25%; 10 mL over 2 minutes) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma. We have used this without complication in our patients from our Phase I protocols as well. 2. To treat patients &lt;22 years of age with recurring or relapsing glioma with a single intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of Cetuximab and Bevacizumab. Our Phase I trials have demonstrated the safety of SIACI delivery of these drugs in adults. This trial will focus on the safety and efficacy in patients &lt;22 years of age.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion: 1. Male or female patients, under 22 years of age, with a documented histologic diagnosis of relapsed or refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), fibrillary astrocytomas (FA), pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PXA), oligodendroglioma, or anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AOA), or radiologically diagnosed brainstem glioma 2. Patients must have at least one confirmed and evaluable tumor site. *A confirmed tumor site is one in which is biopsyproven with the exception of brainstem glioma which will be eligible with radiographic diagnosis. NOTE: Radiographic procedures (e.g., Gdenhanced MRI or CT scans) documenting existing lesions must have been performed within three weeks of treatment on this research study. 3. Patients must have a Karnofsky or Lansky performance status 70%. Karnofsky is used for patients older than or equal to the age of 16 years and Lansky for those under 16 years old and an expected survival three months. 4. No chemotherapy for three weeks prior to treatment under this research protocol and no external beam radiation for eight weeks prior to treatment under this research protocol. 5. Patients must have adequate hematologic reserve with absolute neutrophils greater than or equal to 1000/mm3 and platelets greater than or equal 100,000/mm3. 6. Preenrollment chemistry parameters must show: bilirubin less than 1.5X the institutional upper limit of normal (IUNL); AST or ALT less than 2.5X IUNL and creatinine less than 1.5X IUNL. 7. Preenrollment coagulation parameters (PT and PTT) must be less than 1.5X the IUNL. 8. Concomitant Medications: Growth factor(s): Must not have received within 1 week of entry onto this study. Steroids: Systemic corticosteroid therapy is permissible in patients with CNS tumors for treatment of increased intracranial pressure or symptomatic tumor edema. Patients with CNS tumors who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to study entry. 9. Patients of reproductive age must agree to use a medically effective method of contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. A pregnancy test will be performed on each premenopausal female of childbearing potential immediately prior to entry into the research study. 10. Patients or their parents/guardians must be able to understand and give written informed consent. Informed consent must be obtained at the time of patient screening. 11. Because of known concerns with Avastin and wound healing, craniotomy patients are eligible for the treatment if they have had a craniotomy greater than two weeks prior to IA therapy. Craniotomy or major procedure after SIACI Avastin therapy should wait 4 weeks. Minor surgeries may be performed after two weeks. Exclusion: 1. Previous treatment with Avastin and Cetuximab 2. Females who are pregnant or lactating. 3. Females of childbearing potential and fertile men will be informed as to the potential risk of procreation while participating in this research trial and will be advised that they must use effective contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. If they do not agree, they will be ineligible for the study. 4. Patients with significant concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that would place them at increased risk or affect their ability to receive or comply with treatment or posttreatment clinical monitoring.</criteria>
