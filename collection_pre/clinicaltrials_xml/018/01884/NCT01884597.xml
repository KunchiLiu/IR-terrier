	<criteria>Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the full duration of the study Age &gt; 25 years Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy as noted on fluorescein and ICG angiography: active leakage, active bleeding or recent decrease in vision BCVA using ETDRS of 20/32 to 20/400 Any history of previous vitrectomy Any prior treatment with verteporfin photodynamic therapy in the study eye. Previous cataract surgery within the preceding 2 months of Day 0 Active intraocular inflammation in the study eye Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either eye A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular disease) Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that involved treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at the time of study entry. Prior antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Macugen, Avastin, Lucentis) in the study eye prior within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study Known allergy to any component of the study drug Blood pressure &gt;180/110 (systolic above 180 or diastolic above 110) If blood pressure if brought below 180/110 by antihypertensive treatment, the patient can become eligible. Major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization or major surgery planned within the next 12 months. Major surgery is defined as a surgical procedure that is more extensive than needle biopsy/aspiration placement of a central venous access device, removal/biopsy of a skin lesion, or placement of a peripheral venous catheter. Myocardial infraction, other cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 6 months prior to randomization. Systemic antiVEGF or proVEGF treatment within 3 months prior to randomization. History of recurrent significant infections or bacterial infections Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception. The following are considered effective means of contraception, surgical sterilization or use of oral contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicide gel, an intra uterine device (IUD), or contraceptive hormone implant or patch Prior enrollment in the study Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial.</criteria>
