	<brief_summary>To test the effect of ASEA consumption on 24-hour resting energy expenditure. Hypothesis: consumption of 8-oz of ASEA water (4-oz before breakfast and 4-oz before bedtime) will significantly elevate 24-h resting energy expenditure as compared to consumption of a placebo control (salt water, same dietary intake).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of ASEA on Energy Expenditure and Fat Oxidation in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ASEA beverage is a special oral formulation produced from a pure saline solution containing 123 mg sodium and 129 mg chloride per 4 oz. serving. A proprietary electrolytic and catalytic process rearranges the salt water solution to mimic the redox signaling molecular composition of the native salt-water compounds found in and around human cells. Data obtained thus far, suggests the possibility that consumption of the ASEA beverage may increase energy expenditure and thus be beneficial for the treatment of obesity, however, this has not been assessed in human clinical studies. To this end, we will measure the effects of ASEA consumption on energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry using the indirect room calorimeter at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Nutrition Research Institute. The primary outcome measures will be the change in 24-h energy expenditure and respiratory quotient in response to ASEA consumption. The secondary outcome variables will include changes in relevant peptide hormones, and norepinephrine/epinephrine and their relationship to changes in energy expenditure in response to consumption of ASEA.</detailed_description>
