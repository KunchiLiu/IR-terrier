	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the postprandial effects of cocoa supplementation in glucose and lipids, and surrogate markers of atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators aim to test the hypothesis that cocoa will lower high-fat mixed meal breakfast-induced postprandial rise of glucose, lipids and markers of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes. Randomized cross-over controlled trial, in which participants will be assigned to the placebo or cocoa group with breakfast meal. Patients with type 2 diabetes(n=25) will qualify for the study. The participants will be asked to consume 2 cups cocoa or placebo beverage on 2 separate postprandial study days. Both groups will receive high-fat mixed meal breakfast on each day. Blood draws and blood pressure (including HDI) measurements will be conducted at fasting, 30 min, 1,2, 4 &amp; 6 hours postprandial each day for 2 days.</brief_summary>
