	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together with ibrutinib in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving lenalidomide together with ibrutinib may work better in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To define the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when used in combination with ibrutinib in adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the response rate and response duration in relapsed and refractory CLL/SLL patients with ibrutinib and lenalidomide. II. To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between ibrutinib and lenalidomide. III. To explore whether pharmacogenetic studies can predict response, resistance or toxicity to ibrutinib and lenalidomide. IV. To explore the ability of ibrutinib to occupy its targets (Bruton's tyrosine kinase [BTK] in B-cells and interleukin-2 inducible kinase [ITK] in T-cells), and whether co-administration with lenalidomide influences this binding. V. To explore the early and late immunologic consequences of combining ibrutinib with lenalidomide in relapsed and refractory CLL. VI. To explore the impact of ibrutinib and lenalidomide on ras homolog family member H (RhoH) expression and whether baseline RhoH expression predicts outcomes with this regimen. VII. To explore mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib. VIII. To explore the influence of traditional and new CLL/SLL clinical and laboratory prognostic factors on response to ibrutinib and lenalidomide. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide. Patients receive a run-up course of ibrutinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Patients then receive ibrutinib PO and lenalidomide PO daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 courses, patients who have achieved complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), nodular partial remission (PR), partial remission or who have stable disease discontinue lenalidomide and continue ibrutinib. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a diagnosis of CLL/SLL or Bcell prolymphocytic leukemia, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) During dose escalation, patients must have received at least one prior therapy, need additional cytoreduction, and meet criteria for relapsed or refractory disease; relapsed disease is defined as a patient who previously achieved a CR or a PR, but after a period of six or more months demonstrates evidence of disease progression; refractory disease is defined as progression within six months of the last antileukemic therapy, or any response less than a CR or PR; patients who are previously untreated, and do not wish to receive chemotherapy or immunotherapy, are eligible for the dose expansion portion of the study Patients may have not received treatment for 28 days before the first day of the study protocol (dose escalation only) Estimated life expectancy greater than two months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 750 cells/uL (0.75 x 10^9/L) Platelets &gt;= 50,000 cells/uL (50 x 10^9/L) Hemoglobin &gt;

a FCBP is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point; 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months); the pre ibrutinib pregnancy test will be initiated at enrollment; the first prelenalidomide test will be performed within 1014 days of starting lenalidomide (course 0, day 15), and the second pre lenalidomide test (3rd total test) will be within 24 hours of study entry; the patient may not receive lenalidomide until the study doctor has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative; pregnancy tests (if applicable) are then to be conducted weekly during the first month, and monthly thereafter in women with a regular menstrual cycle, as well as at study discontinuation, and at day 28 following study discontinuation; if menstrual cycles are irregular, pregnancy testing will be conducted weekly for the first month, and then every 14 days while on the study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following study drug discontinuation;
