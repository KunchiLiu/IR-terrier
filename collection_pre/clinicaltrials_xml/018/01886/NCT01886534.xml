	<brief_summary>Close to ninety percent of older heart failure (HF) patients have some cognitive deficits at hospital discharge which may impact their ability to make effective decisions about their healthcare. However, informal care partners (CPs) may assist in managing HF when provided with appropriate education and support. The goal of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to evaluate an intervention which will provide 1) additional teaching on management of HF to the patient and CP following hospital discharge, 2) improved communication with the family physician, 3) a HF decision support tool for oral diuretic management, and 4) a digital talking scale. The investigators believe this intervention will improve outcomes and be cost saving. The investigators hypothesize that enhanced education and support for the CPs to assist older HF patients following hospital discharge, combined with improved communication with family physicians, contact with a HF nurse, and simple decision support tools, will lead to earlier recognition of clinical deterioration, and improved patient outcomes. Innovative and cost-effective approaches to manage HF patients following hospital discharge are urgently needed in Canada.</brief_summary>
