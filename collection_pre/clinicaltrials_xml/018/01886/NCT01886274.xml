	<brief_summary>Migraine has been described as one of the most common neurological diseases, with high social and economic impact. Despite the high prevalence, the pathophysiology of migraine is still unknown, several studies have been developed in order to advance the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease which are not yet entirely elucidated. The aim of this study is to observe the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), applied in the visual cortex, on neurophysiological and clinical measures (frequency, intensity, duration of attacks and severity of pain) in migraine patients.</brief_summary>
