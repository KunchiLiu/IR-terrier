	<brief_summary>Usability of the PALMS system, validity of the PALMS system and added value to an existing cohort study. Hypothesis: Addition of GPS device and use of PALMS system will allow researchers to better examine place-based interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of Objective Measures of Place-Based Physical Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Personal Activity Location Measurement System (PALMS) researchers at UCSD have created a web-based processing system for location (GPS) and physical activity (accelerometer) data. We will collect data on a pilot sample of 40 Hispanic persons to a) test the validity of PALMS assessments of transportation modes, and activity in different locations against an objective record of activities derived from images collected by Vicon Revue; b) compare PALMS assessments of transportation modes and activity locations to other self-report measures and interview measures; c) assess the construct validity of PALMS-based activity assessment. We will be assessing the usability of PALMS in a research staff with no previous experience of using the PALMS system. We will be assessing the added value of using PALMS to examine a place-based intervention in an existing cohort study.</detailed_description>
