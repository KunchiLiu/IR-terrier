	<brief_title>Effect of High Protein Diet on Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Factors Among Overweight and Obese Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Studies regarding the effects of high protein (HP) diet on cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors have reported contradictory results. Objective: In present study, the investigators aimed to determine the effects of HP diet on CVD risk factors among overweight and obese children. Design: In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators recruited 50 overweight and obese women, aged 6-11years into HP or control energy restricted diets for 10 weeks (protein, carbohydrate, fat: 25%, 45%, 30% vs. 15%, 55%, 30%, respectively). Total protein amount, divided to animal and plant sources in 50%-50% and animal sources distributed (half/half) between meats and dairy products. Fasting blood samples, lipid profile, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were measured based on the standard guidelines.</detailed_description>
