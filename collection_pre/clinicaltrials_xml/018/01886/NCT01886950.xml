	<detailed_description>Disturbances of mineral and bone diseaeses are frequently observed in CKD patients. Renal osteodystrophy is the term to describe the bone abnormalities. Epidemiological data showed adynamic bone disease (ABD) is the most frequent bone disorder in CKD stage 5D diseases. Low PTH, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, metabolic acidosis, hypogonadism and low 1,25(OH)2D vitamin D deficiency are known risk factors for ABD. Mounting experimental data point towards a role of protein-bound uremic retention molecules (p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate) in the pathogenesis and progression of ABD. ABD is not only recognized as a risk factor for fractures but also for arterial calcification. The aim of the present study is (1) to investigate the role of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate in the pathogenesis and progression of ABD and arterial calcification in CKD stage5 and (2) to investigate the influence of renal transplantation on bone and arterial metabolism.</detailed_description>
