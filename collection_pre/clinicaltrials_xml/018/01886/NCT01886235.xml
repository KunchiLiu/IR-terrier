	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies intravital microscopy for identifying tumor vessels in patients with stage IA-IV melanoma that is being removed by surgery. New imaging procedures, such as intravital microscopy, may determine the extent of melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravital Microscopy for Identifying Tumor Vessels in Patients With Stage IA-IV Melanoma That is Being Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of performing intravital microscopy on accessible human melanoma tumors during their standard course of treatment (i.e., wide local excision). (Part I) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the blood flow velocity of the tumor vessels and tissue penetration of fluorescein (fluorescein sodium) as a marker of tumor vessel permeability. (Part II) OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorescein sodium intravenously (IV) followed by intravital microscopic observation over 10-15 minutes during excision of the melanoma. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then periodically for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2 Have measurable disease in their skin by direct visualization (visible lesion typically &gt; 0.5 cm in maximal diameter); to perform a microscopic observation, the lesion will have to be visible by the naked eye, linedup visually, and be able to interface with the microscope objective; a melanoma lesion that is smaller than 0.5 cm in diameter would present several obstacles to obtaining a reliable microscopic observation in the operating room; therefore, a visible lesion, at a minimum of 0.5 cm in diameter, is proposed for this study Melanoma tumor that requires a wide local excision in the operating room; this may include any stage of melanoma from stage IA to stage IV that requires a wide excision in the operating room Subject or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure To determine any sensitivity to fluorescein, subject must have a skin prick test preoperatively (at the time of the preoperative visit and after signed informed consent for entry into this clinical trial is given); a negative skin prick test to fluorescein is an inclusion criteria Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Melanoma deposit is deemed inaccessible to microscopic observation during the operative procedure (i.e., lesion is less than 0.5 cm or is not clearly visible to the naked eye) Renal dysfunction as defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 70 Any known allergy or prior reaction to fluorescein; also, a positive skin prick test to fluorescein is considered an exclusion criteria and the patient would not be eligible for entry into this study Pregnant or nursing female subjects Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the subject an unsuitable candidate to undergo observational study (may also include preoperative testing results including electrocardiogram [EKG], chest xray, or pulmonary function tests that preclude a wide excision in the operating room)</criteria>
