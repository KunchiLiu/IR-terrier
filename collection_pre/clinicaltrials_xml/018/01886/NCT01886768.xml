	<brief_summary>Unsedated ultrathin transnasal esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD), in comparison with conventional peroral EGD (P-EGD) has been shown to be more tolerable, safer, cost-effective and time-efficient. The investigators and in other studies have showed that nasal pledgetting (or commonly termed nasal packing) is better than nasal spray in terms of patient tolerance and visual capacity. Although pledgetting method to a selected meatus can achieve better decongestion effect, epistaxis and nasal pain in some patients are still frustrating to endoscopists. The investigator has proposed a novel meatus scoring scale to evaluate nasal insertability by anterior rhinoscopy using a transnasal endoscope. The investigator also suggest endoscopic-guided gauze pledgetting can provide precise nasal anesthesia, thereby reducing trauma/bleeding in the nasal cavity and increasing patient tolerance during transnasal endoscopy. Endoscopic guidance to deliver a gauze strip can confirm delivering it to at least the posterior end of a turbinate. We hypothesize that by using endoscopic-guided method, gauze pledgetting to both the inferior nasal meatus (INM) and middle nasal meatus (MNM) simultaneously is more tolerable than only gauze pledgetting to a single meatus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Versus Single Pledget Nasal Anesthesia for Transnasal Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasal anesthesia is the rate-limiting step for a well tolerable unsedated transnasal esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) procedure. The investigator has proposed that a simple Endoscopic-Guided Gauze Pledgetting method (EGGP) is more tolerable than the "blind" cotton-tippled applicator method to deliver a gauze strip for anesthetizing the nasal cavity. The initial idea of EGGP is to anesthetize only one single selected meatus. To compare patient tolerance, safety and adverse events between double pledget (DPNA, i.e. INM and MNM) versus single pledget (SPNA, i.e. INM or MNM) methods of nasal anesthesia, the investigator is going to conduct a prospective randomized-controlled trial. The rationale for using double pledget is threefold: (1) the middle meatus is bounded by the INT and MNT; (2) the inserting and exserting meatuses may be different; (3) erective spongy tissue is mainly distributed in the inferior and middle turbinates and the nasal septum. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether DPNA is more tolerable and safer than DPNA before UT-EGD.</detailed_description>
