Must exhibit adequate visual, auditory, and communication capabilities to enable compliance with study procedures. This includes being able to lie down flat in the MRI or CT and PET scanner for a period of approximately 1 hour. Subjects must be willing to donate their brains for post mortem examination upon death (this consent can be obtained in the manner specific to the country/region involved).

Scheduled for surgery and/or another invasive procedure within the time period of up to 7 days after [18F]NAV4694 injection. Has severe cerebral macrovascular (i.e., multistroke) disease or brain tumor (metastasis/brain cancer) as verified by MRI that prohibits sampling of the required prespecified ROIs. Has any history of any transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (prion disease). Has received any contrast material (Xray, MRI) or radiopharmaceutical within 48 hours prior to, or a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical (e.g., 131I) within 10 days prior to, or any radiopharmaceutical administration within 10 radioactive halflives prior to the administration of the investigational product or for whom administration of such substances is planned within 7 days after investigational product administration. Is allergic to the investigational product or any of its constituents.</criteria>
