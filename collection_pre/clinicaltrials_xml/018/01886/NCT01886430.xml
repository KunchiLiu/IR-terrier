	<brief_title>Effects of Low-frequency Electrical Stimulation in Patients With Advanced HF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to assess the effects of low frequency functional electrical stimulation on control autonomic and peripheral function in heart failure patients hospitalized for treatment of the syndrome. A randomized clinical trial with 30 advanced heart failure patients will be randomly assigned to functional electrical stimulation (Functional EE, n= 15) e 2) sensory electrical stimulation (Sensory EE, n=15). The functional electrical stimulation will be applied in the rectus femoris, and gastrocnemius, with frequency of 10 Hz, pulse duration of 150 ms, stimulation time (time on) of 20 seconds, resting time (time off) of 20 seconds and intensity according to the discomfort threshold of the patient , checked every day until achieve a maximum of 70mA. The session will last 60 minuts. It will be held every weekday for a period of 10 days. The effects of interventions on functional capacity, autonomic control, peripheral function, peripheral muscle strength and quality of life will be analyzed at baseline and at the end of the protocol.</detailed_description>
