	<brief_summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by complaints of knee pain, aching and stiffness that commonly alter the way one will climb stairs and walk reducing an individual's function and the activities they may perform on a day-to-day basis. Providing a person with a knee brace designed for OA can help unload the arthritic part of the knee, thereby reducing pain and lead to improved function. The purpose of this study is to determine if use of the Rebel Reliever knee brace manufactured by Townsend Design can reduce pain and stiffness, improve strength and balance, and enhance functional activities such as stair and level gait, and ultimately lead to increased participation in the community.</brief_summary>
