	<brief_summary>The debate about tight glycemic control (TGC) in the operating room and on the intensive care unit is ongoing, especially in cardio-surgical patients treated with blood cardioplegia, due to high blood glucose levels during operations and subsequent high rates of sternal wound infections. We showed in a feasibility study that early computer based insulin therapy starting in the operating room is a safe therapy that allows to better warrant normoglycemia in patients undergoing major cardiac surgery with the use of blood cardioplegia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients are enrolled and randomized into 3 groups. Start of therapy is determined as the beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass. Group A: Therapy with computer-based algorithm and measurement of blood glucose every 30 min. Group B: Measurement of blood glucose every 15 min using the identical computer-based algorithm. Group C: Conventional therapy using a fixed insulin dosing scheme. End of therapy is defined as discharge from ICU.</detailed_description>
