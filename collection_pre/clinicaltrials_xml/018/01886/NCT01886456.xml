	<brief_summary>To investigate the effect of patterned laser trabeculoplasty (PLT) compared to selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) on intraocular pressure (IOP) in treatment naiv patients suffering from open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Values for IOP will be measured at baseline, 1 day and 1 month post-interventional as well as 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment. - Trial with medical device</brief_summary>
