	<brief_summary>Recently, a clinical trial showed that the use of lumbar drains compared to ventricular drain in patients suffering from subarachnoid hemorrhage resulted in less delayed ischemic neurological deficits but failed to show a clinical benefit after 6 months. The underlying assumption was, that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from lumbar drains has a higher concentration of blood than CSF from lumbar drains. The investigators decided to test this assumption. In this study, the investigators will randomize patients to either placement of a ventricular or a lumbar drain and analyze the CSF drainage on a daily basis.</brief_summary>
