	<brief_summary>To assess the potential value of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) for early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with sepsis, and then compared with C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cell (WBC) counts, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. 164 patients were enrolled in the study, including 25 cases with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and 139 cases with different levels of sepsis (46 moderate sepsis, 52 severe sepsis and 41 septic shock ). Serum levels of Alpha-1-acid Glycoprotein (AGP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT), and white blood cell (WBC) counts were measured on the day of admission to intensive care unit (ICU).</brief_summary>
