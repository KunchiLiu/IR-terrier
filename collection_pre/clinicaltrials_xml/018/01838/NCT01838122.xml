	<brief_title>Prevalence of HbA1C in Women With PCOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In view of recent suggestion of American Diabetes Association(ADA)to screen women with PCOS for HbA1C,we intend to study its prevalence in all categories of obesity in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS by Rotterdam criteria will be screened for insulin resistance by using different techniques or tests. Further, the sensitivity and specificity of HbA1C will be compared with sensitivity and specificity of other insulin resistance markers such as OGTT, Free androgen index, free testosterone, fasting insulin to glucose ratio, HOMA-IR and HOMA-B-CELL.</detailed_description>
