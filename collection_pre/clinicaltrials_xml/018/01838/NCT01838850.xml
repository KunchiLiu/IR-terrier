	<brief_summary>CS-8635 combines three widely prescribed antihypertensive medications, olmesartan medoxomil(OM), amlodipine (AML), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), to lower blood pressure. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple therapy with CS-8635 compared with dual therapy in Korean patients with hypertension not controlled with dual fixed dose combination therapy (Olmetec® Plus). The treatments that will be used in this study are as follows: Run-in period -OM/HCTZ 20/12.5 mg (Olmetec® Plus 20/12.5 mg) ; Double blind treatment period - OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5mg (CS8635 20/5/12.5mg) + its matching placebo vs.OM/HCTZ 20/12.5mg (Olmetec® Plus 20/12.5 mg) + its matching placebo; Open label extension period - OM/AML/HCTZ 40/5/12.5mg (CS8635 40/5/12.5mg) or OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5mg (CS8635 20/5/12.5mg).</brief_summary>
