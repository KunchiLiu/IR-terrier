	<brief_summary>The investigators wish to document the distribution of EGFR somatic mutations, and assess the relationship between specific genotype, clinical demographic, therapy, and survival, in a large cohort of EGFR mutant NSCLC. The investigators also wish to comprehensively investigate the relationship between germline DNA and risk of EGFR mutant NSCLC developing, through a GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) and candidate gene approach, and explore the relationship between germline DNA and clinical outcome, in order to potentially identify germline genetic modifiers of EGFR TKI (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetics of EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) Mutation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective 1: To identify germline allelic DNA variation associated with somatic EGFR mutation in NSCLC, Objective 2: Correlation between germline allelic variants and survival in EGFR somatic mutant NSCLC. Objective 3: Study germline allelic DNA variation associated with never /ex light smoking NSCLC. Objective 4: Catalogue distribution of somatic EGFR mutant genotypes in 1,000 EGFR mutant NSCLC cases and describe their relationship to clinical outcome.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically diagnosed NSCLC, all histologies are acceptable. Patients can be included in the study with any disease stage and at any time during the disease course. Any type (surgery, RadioTherapy, chemotherapy, targeted agents) of previous treatment and any line of treatment are eligible. Age â‰¥18 years. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial. Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP (International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice), and national/local regulations.</criteria>
