	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn whether blood flow in the brain is normal in people with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN). Specifically, preliminary data suggest a region of the brain called the globus pallidus (GP), a key region affected by PKAN, may have reduced blood flow. Standard MRI and perfusion scanning techniques will be used to learn about cerebral blood flow in the globus pallidus and compare it to blood flow in other brain regions as well as to healthy controls.</brief_summary>
