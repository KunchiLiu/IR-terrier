	<brief_title>Bioimpedance Spectroscopy for the Differential Diagnosis of Hyponatremia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Up to now, "Hyponatremia" differentially diagnosed by physical examination, plasma and urine osmolalities, Echocardiography and biochemical measurements. - The purpose of this study is to determine whether bioimpedance spectroscopy can be used for the detection of hypovolemia and hypervolemia for the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia.</detailed_description>
