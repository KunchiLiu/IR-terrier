	<brief_summary>In an open label, randomized, two-way cross-over study, 32 male healthy regular snus users will be given repeated doses of four different types of portion snus: "General", "Catch", "Catch Mini" and "Catch Dry Mini". Each portion of used snus will be collected and frozen (-20 oC) pending analysis of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), nicotine and tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). Unused snus is collected and deep frozen for analysis and calculation of extracted dose. Calculations of extracted amount of lead, cadmium, nicotine and tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) respectively, will be done for each type of snus.</brief_summary>
