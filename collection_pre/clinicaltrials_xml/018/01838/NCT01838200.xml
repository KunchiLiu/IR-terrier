	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, dose-escalation, non-randomized, phase I study in patients with histologically confirmed Stage III or IV melanoma and at least three metastatic cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions suitable for: intralesional (IL) injection (1 lesion), accessible for biopsy (1 lesion), and response evaluation by RECIST (v1.1) and modified RECIST (irRC) (1 lesion). The primary objective is to determine whether IL administration of BCG followed by intravenous (IV) infusion of ipilimumab is safe. Ipilimumab (YERVOY®) is the monoclonal anti-CTLA-4 antibody approved by the FDA and TGA as anticancer therapy for melanoma. Secondary objectives of the study are: a) clinical efficacy, to document whether this combination therapy induces tumour responses; and b) immunogenicity, to identify if the combination induces immune responses against the tumours. All patients will be included in the analysis of efficacy and immunogenicity. Cohort 1 (9 patients with &lt;10mm induration after tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative [PPD] test): Group 1 (3 patients) will receive one IL injection of 200 µl BCG containing 0.16 - 0.64 x 106 cfu followed by four IV infusions of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab every 3 weeks, starting on day 36. Group 2 (3 patients) and 3 (n=3) will receive 200 µl BCG containing 0.8 - 3.2 x 106 cfu and 4.0 -16.0 x 106 cfu, respectively, followed by the same ipilimumab regimen. Safety will be evaluated in this cohort. Cohort 2 (up to 9 patients with ≥10mm induration after PPD test): Enrolment will start after the final patient in Cohort 1, Group 1 has reached study week 7. Then enrolment can proceed in parallel for Cohort 2 and Cohort 1 Groups 2 and 3. Patients will receive 0.16 -0.64 x 106 cfu BCG followed by four IV infusions of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab every 3 weeks, starting on day 36. Evaluation of safety in this cohort will be observational.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed stage III (unresectable) or stage IV melanoma Minimum one metastatic lesion, cutaneous or subcutaneous, but ideally three or more lesions, to accommodate IL injection (1 lesion), accessibility for biopsy (1 lesion), and evaluability for response by RECIST v.1.1 (1 lesion) and modified RECIST (irRC). Performance status of ECOG 01 Within the last 2 weeks prior to study day 1, vital laboratory parameters should be within normal range, except for the following laboratory parameters, which should be within the ranges specified: Haemoglobin: ≥ 100 g/L, Platelets: ≥ 100 x 10^9/L, INR: ≤ 2.0, Creatinine: ≤ 120 µmol/L, Bilirubin: ≤ 30 µmol/L, eGFR: &gt; 0.75 x LLN, ALT/AST: ≤ 2.0 x ULN, Albumin: &gt; 28 g/L, Neutrophils: &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L, Lymphocytes: &gt; 0.9 x 10^9/L, Active cerebral metastases unless stable after radiation for at least one month and not requiring corticosteroid treatment for 30 days prior to enrolment Other known malignancy within 3 years prior to entry into the study, except for treated nonmelanoma skin cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ. History of tuberculosis History of hypersensitivity to BCG Any contraindication to the use of isoniazid Generalized skin disease Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g. GuillainBarre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis). Exceptions: vitiligo, type I diabetes, pernicious anaemia (treated). Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea. Prior immunotherapy or systemic adjuvant therapy for melanoma following most recent relapse and/or resection of melanoma Prior treatment with a CTLA4 inhibitor Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL2, interferon, or other nonstudy immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids Known HIV positivity, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosourea drugs). Lack of availability for immunological and clinical followup assessments. Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to first dosing. Mental impairment that may compromise the ability to give informed consent and to comply with the requirements of the study. Women who are pregnant (positive pregnancy test at baseline), or breastfeeding Men and women unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 8 weeks after cessation of study drug. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness.</criteria>
