	<brief_summary>This study aims to provide safety and efficacy data comparable to available over-the-counter bowel preparations prior to colonoscopy. While there are many bowel preparations available, most of them remain expensive and require prescription from a health provider. The investigators believe EZ2go Complete will provide a non-inferior colon cleansing in a more accessible way (over-the-counter). To accomplish this goal, the investigators decided to evaluate the proposed EZ2go combination versus currently available over-the-counter bowel preparations. The investigators believe the EZ2go kit will not be inferior to current FDA approved over-the-counter bowel preparations.</brief_summary>
