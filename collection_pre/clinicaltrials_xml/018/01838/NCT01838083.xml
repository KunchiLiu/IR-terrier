	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate equivalence in exposure to insulin glargine given as test formulation T and reference formulation R in steady state conditions after 6 once-daily subcutaneous (SC) doses Secondary Objective: - To assess relative Pharmacodynamic activity of the insulin glargine test formulation T to the insulin glargine reference formulation R in steady state conditions after 6 once-daily SC doses - To assess the safety and tolerability of the test and reference formulations of two new insulin glargine formulations</brief_summary>
