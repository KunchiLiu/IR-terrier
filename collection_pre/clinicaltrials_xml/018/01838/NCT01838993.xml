	<brief_title>Inhalation of Lidocaine Before Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sudden increases in blood pressure and heart rate after tracheal intubation and post-operative sore throat are two common undesirable side effects of general anesthesia and might lead to patients' morbidity or dissatisfaction. We investigated the possibility to attenuate both side effects with one single method, i.e. ultrasound-driven lidocaine inhalation immediately before induction.</detailed_description>
