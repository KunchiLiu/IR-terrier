	<brief_title>Thyroid Screening Protocol During Pregnancy: a Multi-center Prospective Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators conducted a single-blinded trial in which pregnant women at a gestation of less than 12 weeks, usually 6 to 8 weeks, provided blood samples for measurement of thyrotropin, free thyroxine(FT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb). Women were assigned to a screening group in PUMCH (in which measurements were obtained immediately) or a control group in HMCHH (in which serum was stored and measurements were obtained shortly after delivery). Each group enrolled 1000 pregnant women separately. Women with positive findings in the screening group were given individualized levothyroxine treatment and regular follow-up. Compare the pregnancy outcomes, IQ at 2-3 years of age in children of women with subclinical hypothyroidism between two groups.</detailed_description>
