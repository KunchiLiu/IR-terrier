	<brief_summary>This project aims at investigating the duration of human fecal carriage of bacteria harboring plasmid-borne resistance genes expressing Extended Spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), risk factors for infections with such bacteria and persistence, mobility and spread of ESBL in the environment and within households. It also aims to compare different methods of detecting ESBL carriage and treat patients with urinary tract infection caused by these bacteria.</brief_summary>
