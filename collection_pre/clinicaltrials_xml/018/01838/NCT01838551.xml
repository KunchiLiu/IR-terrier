	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of ascending doses of COR-003 in subjects with elevated levels of cortisol due to endogenous Cushing's Syndrome by assessment of reduction in Urinary Free Cortisol (UFC) concentrations and to identify the range of safe and effective doses of COR-003 that reduce mean UFC concentrations ≤ULN (upper limit of normal) of the assay at month 6 of the maintenance phase of dosing without a prior dose increase in that phase.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a single period, open-label, dose titration study to assess efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of COR-003 in subjects with CS. The trial design will identify both the minimally effective and maximally tolerated doses in this CS population. Following an initial screening period, this study will be conducted in 2 treatment phases as follows: - Dose titration phase: approximately 2 to 16 weeks to achieve an effective and tolerable maximum dose (the therapeutic dose) - Maintenance phase: 6 months of treatment at the therapeutic dose without a prior dose increase following the establishment of the appropriate dose identified in the titration phase; - Extended evaluation phase: 6 months of continued treatment after the maintenance phase (6 - 12 months); dose adjustments will be allowed as required for treatment Efficacy will be assessed by measuring UFC concentrations at specified times as described in the clinical protocol. Blood samples for the PK determination will be collected at the times indicated in the clinical protocol. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the safety of the drug throughout the study. The constituents of the DSMB membership and a adjudication committee is specifically described in the clinical protocol. Subjects completing the 6-month maintenance phase of the study will remain in the study for an additional 6 months for extended evaluations. COR-003 will be provided under a compassionate use protocol for subjects who wish to continue treatment with COR-003.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must meet all the following criteria: 1. Male or female ≥18 years of age 2. Able to provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures being performed; eligible subjects must be able to understand the informed consent form prior to inclusion into the study. 3. Confirmed diagnosis of newly diagnosed, persistent or recurrent CD if subjects are not candidates for surgery or radiotherapy CD is defined according to the criteria in the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for diagnosis of CD (Nieman 2008). Previous medical records will be collected and used to support the diagnosis of CD. Specifically, CD is defined as Mean 24hour UFC level of ≥1.5X ULN on repeated determination Morning plasma corticotropin (ACTH) level of 5 ng/L (1.1 nmol /L) or more Either MRI confirmation of pituitary macroadenoma, or inferior petrosal sinus gradient &gt;3 after corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH) stimulation for those patients with a microadenoma, or for subjects who have had prior pituitary surgery, histopathology confirming and ACTHstaining adenoma. If inferior petrosal sampling had been performed without CRH, then a central to peripheral prestimulation gradient &gt;2 is required 4. Confirmed diagnosis of newly diagnosed, persistent or recurrent endogenous CS of other etiology if subjects are not candidates for surgery or radiotherapy. CS will be defined according to the criteria in the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for diagnosis of CS (Nieman 2008). Previous medical records will be collected and used to support the diagnosis, and the differentiation of the cause of CS, specifically Mean 24hour UFC level of ≥1.5X ULN on repeated determination Ectopic ACTH secretion, not of pituitary origin Ectopic CRH secretion Adrenaldependent CS (adrenal adenoma, adrenal autonomy) Etiology unknown 5. Subjects MUST have elevated mean 24hour UFC levels ≥1.5X ULN of assay based on a minimum of four measurements from adequately collected urine. Urine may be collected on sequential days. 6. In addition to elevated mean UFC, presence of abnormal values from one of the following tests: Abnormal DST: Elevated 8 AM serum cortisol ≥1.8 ug/dL (50 nmol/L) after 1 mg dexamethasone orally at 11 PM the evening prior (if not conducted already in the diagnostic workup of the subject within the previous 2 months before start of Screening Phase; in that case previous test results and details of conduct will need to be available by the Baseline visit) Elevated late night salivary cortisol concentrations (at least two measurements) &gt;ULN NOTE: For subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR as determined by Modified Diet in Renal Disease MDRD equation) &gt;40 and &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in addition to meeting the UFC criteria, late night salivary cortisol test results (≥2 measurements) MUST also demonstrate evidence of CS. 7. Previously irradiated subjects with CD or CS of other etiology will be allowed as long as the radiation treatment occurred &gt; 4 years ago and subjects have not exhibited evidence for improvement in their underlying Cushing's disease for 6 months. The total number of previously irradiated subjects enrolled in this study will not exceed 10. 8. Subjects with CD or CS of other etiology who are not candidates for surgery, refuse surgery, or in whom surgery will be delayed for &gt;6 months. Subjects may be allowed to participate in the trial while awaiting surgery, but must agree to complete this study prior to surgery. For subjects who have already undergone surgery, a minimum of 3 months should have elapsed before the subject can be deemed a surgical failure. 9. Subjects on treatment for CD or endogenous CS of other etiology for whom treatment has been inadequate or not well tolerated must agree to the following minimum washout periods prior to the Baseline Visit: Inhibitors of steroidogenesis (including ketoconazole): 2 weeks Dopamine agonists: bromocriptine (2 weeks), cabergoline (8 weeks) Octreotide acetate LAR and lanreotide Autogel®: 12 weeks Lanreotide SR/longacting pasireotide: 8 weeks Octreotide acetate (immediate release formulation) or shortacting pasireotide: 1 week Mifepristone (RU 486): 4 weeks 10.

A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is postmenopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Postmenopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age &gt; 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy. However in questionable cases, a blood sample with FSH &gt; 40MIU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory.
