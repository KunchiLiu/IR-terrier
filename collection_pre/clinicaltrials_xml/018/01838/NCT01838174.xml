	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that the novel melanocortin-mediated anti-inflammatory effects of Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) will reduce axonal loss following ON by limiting inflammatory optic nerve injury. We will compare the effect of ACTH and intravenous methylprednisolone therapy on axonal injury following ON using ocular coherence tomography (OCT), a sensitive, reproducible and noninvasive tool to measure retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. The primary outcome will be the average RNFL thickness at 6 months. Additional pre-specified statistical analyses will compare the difference in the mean RNFL thickness at 6 months in the affected eye between the IV methylprednisolone- and Acthar-treated groups, and the mean 6-month affected eye RNFL thicknesses adjusted for the baseline unaffected eye RNFL. The secondary outcome measure will examine the frequency of optic nerves with RNFL swelling between the IV methylprednisolone- and Acthar-treated groups at 1 and 3 months. The tertiary outcome will be changes in mfVEP amplitude and latency, ONHP detection, and pupillary diameter (UTSW only). A predefined exploratory outcome will compare the ganglion cell plus inner plexiform layer (GC+IPL) thickness at 6 months between treatment groups</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase IV Trial of Neuroprotection With ACTH in Acute Optic Neuritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with their first episode of unilateral acute optic neuritis (ON) will be treated with either 3 days of IV methylprednisolone followed by 11 days of oral prednisone or 15 days of intramuscular (IM) or sub-cutaneous corticotropin (SQ) Acthar, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This is a single blind, parallel active group, randomized controlled trial in which 60 people with clinically unilateral acute optic neuritis (≤ 2 weeks of vision loss; with or without a previous diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) will be treated with either ACTH or IV methylprednisolone/prednisone (IVMP) for 2 weeks. The primary, secondary, and tertiary outcomes will be as noted above. The assessing physicians will be blinded to treatment to minimize bias. We intend to recruit a target number of 3 participants per month and to complete recruitment within 10 months. This rate of recruitment is estimated on the incidence of optic neuritis among the visits to the Rocky Mountain MS Center and the University of Texas Southwestern (tertiary care MS centers with &gt; 6,000 patient visits/year). Participants will be assessed for inclusion/exclusion criteria by their treating neurologist at the Rocky Mountain MS Center (PI- Dr. Jeffrey Bennett) or University of Texas Southwestern (PI - Dr. Elliot Frohman), and following informed consent, will be randomized with gender, prior diagnosis of MS, disease modifying treatment (DMT) usage (interferons vs. Glatiramer Acetate vs. Tysabri/Gilenya/Aubagio/Tecfidera vs. no treatment), and time to randomization as binary minimization data. We expect to enroll 30 subjects per institution. Following informed consent and randomization, participants will receive treatment either high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg IV daily for 3 days followed by 60 mg oral prednisone daily for 11 days) or Acthar (80 U IM or SQ daily for 5 days followed by 40 U IM or SQ daily for 10 days). Clinical follow-up by the treating physician is planned at months 0, 1, 3, and 6. During each visit, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, low contrast acuity (2.5%), and color vision (Farnsworth D-15) will be assessed. OCT evaluations (ONH and macular cube) will be performed at months 0, 1, 3 and 6 months using spectral domain OCT (Cirrus OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA). Automated visual fields (Humphrey 30-2 SITA) will be performed at baseline and month 6. MfVEP, multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), fundus photography (to assess for pallor) and pupillometry will be performed at baseline, month 3 and month 6 in the cohort of patients recruited at the University of Texas Southwestern. The patient's treating neurologist will perform blood tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations to exclude other causes of optic neuropathy at the initial study visit as part of their routine care. RNFL edema will be defined as either average RNFL thickness greater than the 95th percentile of the age matched normal database or a ratio of RNFL thickness (affected/fellow eye) greater than 1.1 in any quadrant.11 The study sites will collect and report data on adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) per standard practice. A representative at UTSW will determine patient randomization accounting for the variables noted above.
