	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study on Effects of Obeticholic Acid (OCA) on Lipoprotein Metabolism in Subjects With Primary Biliary Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a phase 2, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the effects of OCA on lipoprotein metabolism in subjects with PBC; in particular, OCA's effects on high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was utilized to quantify the changes in lipoprotein particle sizes and concentrations. Components of reverse cholesterol transport were also assessed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Definite or probable primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) diagnosis as demonstrated by the presence of ≥ 2 of the following 3 diagnostic factors: History of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels for at least 6 months A positive antimicrobial antibody (AMA) titer or, if AMA negative or in low titer (&lt;1:80), PBC specific antibodies Liver biopsy consistent with PBC 2. Age ≥ 18 years 3. Taking UDCA for at least 12 months (stable dose for ≥ 3 months) prior to Day 0 or unable to tolerate UDCA (no UDCA for ≥ 3 months prior to Day 0) 4. Contraception: Female subjects must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or if premenopausal, be prepared to use ≥ 1 effective (≤ 1% failure rate) method of contraception during the trial and until at least 30 days after the last dose of Investigational Product. 5. Must provide written informed consent and agree to comply with the trial protocol. 1. Subjects with decompensated PBC (as determined by the Investigator) 2. Severe pruritus or systemic treatment for pruritus (e.g. treatment with bile acid sequestrants or rifampicin) within 2 months of Day 0 3. History or presence of other significant liver diseases including: Active or chronic Hepatitis B or C virus (HBV, HCV) infection Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) Alcoholic liver disease Definite autoimmune liver disease or overlap hepatitis Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) NOTE: Subjects with Gilbert's disease or those with a history of hepatitis B who are currently antigen negative and seroconverted should not be considered exclusionary 4. Uncontrolled diabetes or other uncontrolled or unstable medical condition that may interfere with trial results 5. Administration of any of the following medications as specified below: Prohibited 28 days prior to Day 0: bile acid sequestrants (BAS) including cholestyramine, colesevelam, colestipol or omega3 fatty acid containing dietary supplements Prohibited 3 months prior to Day 0 and throughout trial participation: serumlipid modifying agents including 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, fenofibrate or other fibrates, nicotinic acid and derivatives, ezetimibe, Vitamin E (other than as standard dietary supplement) Prohibited 6 months prior to Day 0 and throughout the trial participation: azathioprine, colchicine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, pentoxifylline; budesonide and other systemic corticosteroids; potentially hepatotoxic drugs (including αmethyldopa, sodium valproic acid, isoniazide, or nitrofurantoin) Prohibited 12 months prior to Day 0 and throughout the trial participation: antibodies or immunotherapy directed against interleukins or other cytokines or chemokines 6. Planned change in diet or exercise habits during participation in the trial 7. Presence or history of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias that may prohibit the subject from participating in the trial 8. If female: known pregnancy, or has a positive urine pregnancy test (confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test), or lactating 9. Recent (3 months prior to day 0) participation in another trial involving OCA or participation in another investigational trial (30 days prior to Day 0) and during the trial</criteria>
