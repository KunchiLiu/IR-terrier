	<brief_summary>It is hypothesized that excessive generation of free radicals involves in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced brain necrosis. This study therefore evaluated the effect of free radical scavenger, edaravone, on radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis (TLN) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Edaravone on Radiation-induced Temporal Lobe Necrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis (TLN) is the most serious sequelae of radiotherapy and impairs the patients' quality of life profoundly. Steroid is one of the conventional treatment methods for TLN. However, its response rate was still not so satisfactory (about 30%-35%).The mechanism of TLN is under exploring and not completely understood. It has been proposed recently that chronic oxidative stress and inflammation involve in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced late normal tissue injury. Edaravone(3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one), which is proved to be an excellent free radical scavenger, has been applied to a wide range of oxidative stress-related diseases.Thus, it may exert a therapeutic effect on radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis. To support this hypothesis, the investigators carried out a randomized study of combining edaravone with common fundamental management versus common fundamental therapy in patients with TLN, and analyzed the Late Effects of Normal Tissues -Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT/SOMA) scale before and after treatment.</detailed_description>
