	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to compare different ratios of explorative formulations, not similar to the proposed commercial formulation, of IDegAsp (co-formulation of insulin degludec/insulin aspart and insulin aspart) with separately injected, simultaneous doses of insulin degludec (insulin 454), and insulin aspart, compared with biphasic insulin aspart 30 in male subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Trial part 1 is a five-period cross-over trial with incomplete block-design in subjects with type 1 diabetes where each subject will be randomised to five out of the ten possible treatments. Each treatment consists of an injection of the insulin product followed by a euglycemic clamp with a washout period of 7-15 days between treatments. Trial part 2 is a three-period cross-over trial with complete blockdesign in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Each treatment consists of an injection of the insulin product followed by a euglycaemic clamp with a washout period of 7-15 days between treatments.</brief_summary>
