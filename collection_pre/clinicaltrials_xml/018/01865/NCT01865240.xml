	<brief_summary>This is a study investigating the effectiveness of renal denervation in lowering blood pressure in people whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled despite treatment with 3 or more blood pressure lowering drugs. The study is designed to compare the effects of renal denervation to a usual care group receiving additional blood pressure lowering drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Denervation for Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have shown that the renal denervation procedure is safe and effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. A total of 100 participants with uncontrolled blood pressure, treated with three or more blood pressure lowering medications will be recruited into the study. Patients will be assigned to one (1) of two (2) groups with the aim of attaining blood pressure control. Participants in group 1 will be assigned to renal denervation, participants in group 2 will receive additional antihypertensive medication according to current guidelines and best practice in an attempt to reach blood pressure targets.</detailed_description>
