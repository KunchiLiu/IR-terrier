	<brief_summary>Comparative, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centre, single-blind clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of providing additional DHA omega-3 fatty acids supplements to increase the levels of pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators and decrease the biological markers of chronic inflammation in obese patients following a weight-loss programme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of DHA on Pro-resolving Anti-inflammatory Mediators in Obese Patients Undergoing Weight-loss Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Will include obese patients (BMI between 30 and 35) who are following a standardized, multidisciplinary weight-loss programme (PronoKal® Method), which consists of a very-low-calorie diet based on protein packets and vegetables with a low glycemic index, into which natural foods are gradually reintroduced, accompanied by physical exercise and emotional support. Patients who are being treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticoids or thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drugs (glitazones); and patients with immune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, etc.) and/or inflammatory disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, etc.) who may alter the biological markers of inflammation,will be excluded. Treatment: In addition to the vitamin and oligoelement supplements which are part of the standard weight-loss programme, the patients will receive an additional 500 mg/day supplement of DHA omega-3 fatty acids in capsule form (study group) or a placebo capsule (control group). The follow up will be 6 months and patients will be monitored over the course of 6 control visits: baseline, 7 days, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days and 180 days. The main objective is to assess the effectiveness of providing additional DHA supplements to increase the levels of pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators and decrease the biological markers of chronic inflammation in obese patients following a weight-loss programme.</detailed_description>
