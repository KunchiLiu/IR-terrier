	<brief_summary>This is an observational proof of concept study investigating the safety and effectiveness of renal denervation to lower blood pressure in people whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled due to: - intolerance to antihypertensive medication - inability to take antihypertensive medication due to planned pregnancy - renal artery stenosis - chronic kidney disease - non-compliance to antihypertensive medication A total of 125 participants, 25 from each of the groups mentioned above will be recruited to the study. The duration of this study is 36 months.</brief_summary>
