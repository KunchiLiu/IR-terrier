	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate whether the addition of lenalidomide to rituximab-maintenance improves progression free survival (PFS) compared to standard rituximab maintenance after induction treatment consisting of R-CHOP + R-HAD vs R-CHOP alone in older patients (≥ 60 year old) with mantle cell lymphoma. The treatments consist of two phases: induction treatment (3 R-CHOP21 + 3 cycles of R-HAD28 alternating) vs 8 cycles of R-CHOP21) followed by maintenance treatment (13 cycles of rituximab + 26 cycles of lenalidomide vs 13 cycles of rituximab).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aims to evaluate whether the addition of lenalidomide to rituximab-maintenance improves progression free survival (PFS) compared to standard rituximab maintenance after induction treatment consisting of R-CHOP + R-HAD versus R-CHOP alone in older patients (≥ 60 year old) with mantle cell lymphoma. 643 patients will be randomized in induction phase and 433 in maintenance phase. The treatments consist of two phases: - induction treatment will be 3 cycles of R-CHOP21 + 3 cycles of R-HAD28(alternating) versus 8 cycles of R-CHOP21 alone - maintenance treatment will be 13 cycles of rituximab every 8 weeks + 26 cycles of lenalidomide every 4 weeks vs 13 cycles of rituximab every 8 weeks. Patients will be followed 2.5 years after the last patient randomized for maintenance for final analysis. All subjects who complete or discontinue the maintenance treatment for any reason will be followed for at least 3 years after his/her last study treatment administration in maintenance period for Second Primary Malignancies (SPM). A long term follow-up for progression/death will be done up to the end of period of SPM data collection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent form Biopsyproven MCL according to WHO classification ≥ 60 years of age and ineligible for autologous transplant Ann Arbor stage IIIV Previously untreated ECOG PS ≤ 2 Male subjects must: agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a woman of childbearing potential, even if they have had a vasectomy, throughout lenalidomide therapy agree to not donate semen during lenalidomide therapy. All subjects must: have an understanding that the lenalidomide could have a potential teratogenic risk. agree to abstain from donating blood while taking lenalidomide therapy agree not to share study medication with another person. be counselled about pregnancy precautions and risks of foetal exposure. Additional criteria for randomization in maintenance phase: CR, CRu or PR after induction treatment, determined as per Cheson 1999 criteria During the runin period of 6 months starting from the date of the first randomization in the trial: in case of direct randomization into maintenance phase, patient must have been treated in first line by 68 cycles of RCHOP.
