	<brief_summary>MRI, without any contrast injection, allows a non-invasive evaluation and quantification of hepatic overloads, especially iron (liver iron content LIC) and fat (steatosis) overloads, but in certain clinical circumstances, cases require to improve performances. The aim of the study is to add to MRI scans which currently must be performed innovative sequences appropriate for the clinical question to overall appreciate on a varied range of patients their quality, their robustness, their relative performance and, for patients having a biopsy, their accuracy.</brief_summary>
