	<brief_summary>The investigators would like to determine if there are patients with PPI responsive Eosinophilic Esophagitis Infiltration that have significant loss of esophageal distensibility suggestive of esophageal fibrosis typical of classic Eosniophilic Esophagitis. If this group of patients exists, the investigators would like to determine if they have the typical endoscopic features of EoE rather than those of GERD.</brief_summary>
