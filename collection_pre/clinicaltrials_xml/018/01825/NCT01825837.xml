	<brief_summary>This was an extension study consisting of 2 parts. In Part I, all participants received open-label treatment with BIA 2-093 900 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Part II followed a double-blind, parallel-group design in which participants were randomly assigned to treatment with BIA 2-093 300 mg, 900 mg, or 1800 mg once daily. Patients stable in remission continued double-blind therapy until approximately 6 months after the last patient entered Part II.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Eslicarbazepine Acetate in the Recurrence Prevention of Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The occurrence of a new manic/depressive episode was considered a treatment failure, and the patient was discontinued from the study. At the end of Part II, 6 months after last patient enrolled and after no longer than approximately 15 months, if patients were still in remission and the investigational product was well-tolerated, patients had the option to enter long-term open-label treatment at the same dosage as used in Part II until a new episode occurred, until marketing was authorized, or until clinical development of BIA 2-093 in the recurrence prevention indication was discontinued. If patients did not enter long-term treatment, an established recurrence prevention medication was prescribed, and BIA 2-093 was tapered off (patients assigned to 1800 mg had the daily dose decreased to 900 mg for 6 days; those assigned to 900 mg or 300 mg received placebo for 6 days).</detailed_description>
