	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of TissueGene-C Mixed With Fibrin-glue for the Patients With Degenerative Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TissueGene-C is a biological new drug which consists of non-transduced chondrocytes and transduced chondrocytes that express TGF-b1 to regenerate the damaged cartilage. During the clinical trial Phase 2, the investigators compare low dose or high dose TissueGene-C in 12 - months trial with 18 outpatients who have degenerative arthritis. The patients are randomized to two dose levels of TissueGene-C by 1:1 ratio, and they are monitored and recorded for alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee, and the presence of adverse events.</detailed_description>
