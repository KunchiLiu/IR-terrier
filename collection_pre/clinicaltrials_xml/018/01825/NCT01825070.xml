	<brief_summary>Cherries have been show to possess the ability to reduce uric acid concentrations and inflammation. Tart Montmorency cherries possess a higher concentration of the plant compounds than other cherries and hence makes the expectation possible that Montmorency cherries will lower uric acid and inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Montmorency Cherry Juice and Uric Acid Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plasma and urinary uric acid concentration, plasma phytochemical content and inflammatory biomarkers will be measured in order to elucidate the effects of an acute dose of tart cherry juice on indices related to the condition of gout. Participants will be required to attend the laboratory at a range of time points over two periods of 96 hours, separated by a 7 day washout period, to provide blood samples. In order to provide a baseline sample, participants will attend the laboratory in the morning following an overnight fast and voiding of any urine. Following this participants will be given 30mls (30 mls provides 323 mg/380 Âµmol of anthocyanins) of tart cherry juice or placebo, diluted with 60 mls of water to consume within 10 minutes. Participants will be required to consume identical dosages of the supplement immediately prior to evening meals and breakfasts (or same time each morning following blood sampling if non-breakfast eater) over the next 96 hours. Further blood and urine samples will be collected at 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 24, 26, 48, 50, 72, 74 and 96 hours and will require participants to return to the laboratory at each of these time points. Following the first period of supplementation participants will complete a 7 day washout period in which they will not be required to attend the laboratory. Following the washout period they will repeat the supplementation period consuming the supplement they did not receive during the first period.</detailed_description>
