	<brief_summary>The management of acute diverticulitis maybe better if we have prognostic markers of evolution. Hypothesis: C-reactive protein maybe a good prognostic marker of evolution of acute diverticulitis. The investigators need to know the values of C-reactive protein to predict evolution of acute diverticulitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Diverticulitis and C-Reactive Protein as a Prognostic Marker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective observational study. All the patients with TC-diagnosis of acute diverticulitis (AD) had a C-reactive protein (PCR) in the initial blood test. The investigators will predict evolution of AD with the PCR initial.</detailed_description>
