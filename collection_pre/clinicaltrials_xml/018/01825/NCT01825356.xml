	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients undergoing a dorsal cheilectomy procedure with implementation of amniotic membrane tissue results in improved clinical and functional outcomes compared to a standard dorsal cheilectomy procedure. Specific Aim 1: To compare American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores between patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy to patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of amniotic membrane tissue. Hypothesis 1: Clinical and functional outcomes, as measured by the AOFAS , in the patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of amniotic membrane tissue will be superior to those without. Specific Aim 2: To compare range of motion between patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy to patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of amniotic membrane tissue. Hypothesis 2: Patient to undergo dorsal cheilectomy and implantation of amniotic membrane tissue will demonstrate less postoperative stiffness as measured from the pre-and postoperative radiographs. Specific Aim 3: To compare Foot Function Index (FFI) scores between patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy to patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of amniotic membrane tissue. Hypothesis 3: Clinical and functional outcomes, as measured by the FFI, the patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of amniotic membrane tissue will be superior to those without.</brief_summary>
