	<brief_summary>To test the hypothesis that treatment with the inverse agonist nadolol will improve smoking cessation in patients with chronic cough associated with long-term smoking, with or without airflow obstruction, including those with established chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (chronic bronchitis dominant) or non-obstructive chronic bronchitis (NCB), compared to placebo and standard of care, while undergoing a validated smoking cessation program.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Potential study participants will be referred from approved smoking cessation programs or be willing to enter a smoking cessation program administered by the participating sites. Individuals who meet all of the following criteria at Visit 1 are eligible for enrollment as study participants: 1.

History of adverse reaction or allergy to nadolol 5. History of neurological, hepatic, renal, or other medical conditions that may interfere with the interpretation of data or the patient's participation in the study or may increase safety concerns 6.
