	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of a noninvasive cortical electrostimulation therapy known as "Reduced Impedance Noninvasive Cortical Electrostimulation" (RINCE) in the management of fibromyalgia. Patients who meet the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia will receive up to 24 RINCE treatments delivered by a medical device called "NeuroPoint". Approximately 45 fibromyalgia patients will be randomized into one of three study groups. One of these groups will receive sham treatment, meaning they will receive no treatment at all, while the remaining two groups will receive different amounts of RINCE therapy. The study's primary outcome measure will be the patient's change from baseline in self-reported 24-hour average pain intensity. The study's hypothesis is that there will be a difference between treatment groups in primary outcome measure.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must provide written informed consent and privacy authorization prior to participation in the study. Patient must have the ability to read and/or follow written and oral instructions, abide by the study restrictions, and agree to return for the required assessments. Patient is male or female, 2265 years of age (inclusive) at the time of consent. Patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of fibromyalgia meeting the ACR 1990 classification criteria for fibromyalgia. Patients must have a 24hour recall pain intensity score at both the screening and baseline visits between 40 and 90 inclusive on a 100 mm VAS scale. Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an acceptable method of birth control for the duration of their study participation. Acceptable birth control includes a vasectomized partner, contraceptives (oral, parenteral, or transdermal), intrauterine device, or double barrier method including condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream. Patients considered not of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile (total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or greater than one year postmenopausal, defined as a complete cessation of menstruation for at least one year. Patients must be willing to refrain from all excluded therapies for the duration of the study. In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient is willing and able to comply with all protocolspecified requirements. Patient has a current significant psychological or psychiatric disorder (e.g., severe, unstable or poorly controlled depression, severe anxiety or obsessivecompulsive disorder; history of suicide attempt within preceding 5 years or suicidal ideation within preceding 6 months; or any history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective or other psychotic disorder). Patient has a score of 2 or 3 on item 9 of the BDI, or, based on the investigator's judgment, the patient is at risk of suicidal ideation or behavior. Patient is currently using prohibited medications or treatments (see Prohibited Concomitant Therapy section of protocol) including FDAapproved fibromyalgia treatments, other centrally active analgesics, stimulants, anesthetic patches, CPAP and/or TENS therapy. Patient has an active diagnosis and is being treated for chronic infection or chronic condition such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis, polio, seizures, or cancer (other than basal or squamous cell skin cancer). Patient has any other chronic pain condition other than fibromyalgia that, in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with the assessment of fibromyalgia (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, post herpetic neuralgia, pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, severe pain due to degenerative joint disease, etc.) Patient has history of seizure disorder, dementia or epilepsy anytime during his or her life except pediatric febrile seizures. Female patient who is pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Patient has any other disease or medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of study device efficacy or safety, or would compromise the patient's ability to participate in or complete the study. Patient has a history of other cranial electrical stimulation device use, or electroconvulsive therapy. Patient has any metal implant, such as stents, aneurysm clips, shunts, pacemakers, defibrillators or neurostimulators. Longbone implants are not excluded. Any anticipated need for surgery that might confound results or interfere with patient's ability to comply with the protocol. Myocardial infarction during preceding 12 months, uncontrolled hypertension, active cardiac disease (American Heart Association Functional Class 2, 3 or 4 or Objective Class C or D), clinically significant cardiac rhythm or conduction abnormality, or anticipation of bypass or other cardiac surgery within the next 12 months. Current systemic infection (e.g., HIV, hepatitis). Patients receiving systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 5 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Patients receiving regular or frequent opioids, opiates or narcotics. Pending or current litigation or disability claim (including Workman's Compensation). Patients currently receiving disability benefits will require medical monitor approval on a casebycase basis. Patient has history of alcohol and/or drug abuse. Patient has participated in any investigational study within 30 days prior to Screening visit or is currently participating in another clinical trial. Patient has received any prior experimental treatment or therapy that, in the opinion of the medical monitor, would compromise the patient's ability to participate in the study. Patient is a staff member or relative of a staff member at either the investigative site or the Cerephex Corporation.</criteria>
