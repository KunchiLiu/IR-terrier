	<brief_summary>Life Enhancing Activities for Family Caregivers is a six-week program designed to increase positive affect in people who care for a family member with dementia. The intervention consists of 6 weekly one-hour sessions conducted one-on-one with a trained facilitator to teach simple skills that are practiced at home in a study-supplied workbook. The program is preceded and followed by a 30-45 minute questionnaire. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months post intervention. Primary hypothesis is that experimental subjects who participate in LEAF will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in psychological outcomes and will engage in more problem focused and positive appraisal forms of coping compared to the wait-list control condition.</brief_summary>
