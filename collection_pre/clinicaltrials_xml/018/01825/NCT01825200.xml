	<brief_summary>The hypothesis for this trial is that the incidence of a pre-defined composite of common systemic hypersensitivity adverse events for Flublok recipients is non-inferior to that reported for licensed IIV recipients. Another hypothesis is that the safety and reactogenicity of Flublok is clinically acceptable, i.e. consistent with the overall safety profiles previously observed with Flublok and with the licensed comparator.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Safety of Flublok® Versus Licensed IIV in Healthy, Medically Stable Adults ≥ 50 Years of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all people aged 6 months and older be immunized to prevent influenza. Currently the only approved influenza vaccine across the entire age group is inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). A Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) for Flublok was approved by the FDA for influenza immunization of adults 18-49 years of age. Additional safety and, ultimately efficacy, data is needed to support use in adults ≥50 years of age, an important age group as adults ≥65 years of age are among those at increased risk of influenza complications.</detailed_description>
