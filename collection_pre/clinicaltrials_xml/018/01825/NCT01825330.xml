	<brief_title>Effect of NeuroAD on the Cognitive Function of Alzheimer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NeuroAD system is a combined system of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and cognitive training and is a non-invasive therapeutic system for the improvement of Alzheimer patients' cognitive function. A potential participant will undergo screening procedures to confirm eligibility to participate in the study, followed by randomization procedure to one of the study groups - treatment or sham (placebo) Patient will attend the clinic 5 times a week for 6 weeks, approximately an hour every day for treatment/sham. The patient will be required to return to the clinic for follow-up. Up to 150 patients will be enrolled in up to 10 clinical sites in the US and Israel.</detailed_description>
