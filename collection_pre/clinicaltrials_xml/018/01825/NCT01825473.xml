	<brief_summary>To evaluate the relationship of reflux and apnea and to determine whether the administration of erythromycin improves the incidence of GER and GER-associated apnea, bradycardic and/or desaturation events in a prospective randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Erythromycin in GER-Associated Apnea of the Newborn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine whether erythromycin, a drug known to enhance gut motility, will improve the incidence of GER and GER-associated apnea, bradycardiac and/or hypoxic events. The investigators have two aims: 1) to examine the relationship between GER and apnea, bradycardia, and/or desaturation (ABD) events by simultaneously employing a unique computer algorithm developed at the University of Virginia to measure ABD events and an Multi-channel Intra-luminal Impedance (MII) pH monitoring to measure GER episodes. 2) In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, the investigators will study whether erythromycin decreases GER and GER-associated apnea, bradycardia and/or hypoxia in premature infants.</detailed_description>
