	<brief_summary>900 subjects having received dental implants 9-10 years ago are invited for a clinical and radiographic examination. The individuals were randomly selected from the National Health Insurance data register in Sweden. The clinical and radiographic examination of the 900 selected subjects will include assessments of implant loss, loss of prosthesis and technical / biological complications. Biological complications will be assessed from the findings in the clinical and radiographic examinations. Thus, signs of pathology in peri-implant tissues, probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding/pus on probing (BoP) will be recorded. Marginal bone loss and other findings in radiographs will also be evaluated. The prevalence, extent and severity of peri-implantitis will hereby be determined. Patient-centered outcomes will also be obtained.</brief_summary>
