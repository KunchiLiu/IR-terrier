	<brief_title>Multidisciplinary Therapy in the Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction in Patients With Fibromyalgia Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Randomized clinical trial. Objective: to compare the therapeutic effects of physical therapy, manual therapy and deontology therapy to improve pain, quality of life, physical function, quality of sleep, depression, anxiety, clinical severity, clinical improvement, and temporomandibular dysfunction in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome. Methods and measures: seventy patients will be randomly assigned to experimental or placebo control group. The experimental group will receive 30 sessions (twice a weeks) of physical therapy, manual therapy and deontology therapy. Pain intensity, impact of fibromyalgia symptoms, quality of sleep, depression, anxiety, clinical severity, clinical improvement and temporomandibular dysfunction will be collected in both groups al baseline, 15 weeks and 20 weeks after 48-hr the last intervention in the experimental and placebo control groups, by an assessor blinded to the treatment allocation of the patients. Baseline demographic and clinical variables will be examined between both groups with independent Student t-test for continuous data and chi-square tests of independence for categorical data. Separate 2x3 model ANOVA with time (baseline, 15 weeks and 20 weeks) as the within-subjects factor, group (experimental, placebo control) will be determine the effects of the multidisciplinary treatment.</detailed_description>
