	<criteria>Male or nonpregnant female &gt; 18 years of age; Documentation of heart failure and who are in NYHA class II or III; Documented history of symptomatic AF &lt; 6 months in duration at the time of presentation, currently in AF at the time of the external electrical cardioversion, and successfully restored to normal sinus rhythm; Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients who can be placed on anticoagulation with warfarin postcardioversion (and not on rivaroxaban or dabigatran); Demonstration of preserved ejection fraction (EF) by echocardiography; Echocardiographic evidence of impaired diastolic filling. Known history of permanent or longstanding AF (&gt; 6 months); Other acutely reversible causes of AF, including but not limited to: hyperthyroidism, pericarditis, myocarditis or pulmonary embolism; Known history of cirrhosis; NYHA Class IV; Myocardial Infarction, unstable angina, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within three months prior to screening; Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 4 weeks prior to screening, if these patients need to be placed on rivaroxaban or dabigatran postcardioversion; Clinically significant valvular disease; Clinically significant pulmonary disease; Stroke within 3 months prior to screening; Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min as calculated by CockcroftGault formula; Use of antiarrhythmic drugs (Class Ia or IIIc) within 3 months prior to screening; Concurrent use of drugs considered strong inhibitors of CYP3A; Concurrent use of drugs considered as CYP3A inducers; Prior treatment with ranolazine.</criteria>
