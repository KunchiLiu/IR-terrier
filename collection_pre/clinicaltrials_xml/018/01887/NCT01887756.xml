	<brief_summary>Telerehabilitation refers to the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to provide rehabilitation services to people remotely in their homes or other environments. By using ICT, patient access to care can be improved and the reach of clinicians can extend beyond the physical walls of a traditional healthcare facility, thus expanding continuity of care to persons with disabling conditions. The concept of telecare, when telerehabilitation is used to deliver services to patients in their homes or other living environments, empowers and enables individuals to take control of the management of their medical needs and interventions by enabling personalized care, choice and personal control Research Goal and Objectives 1. To investigate the clinical feasibility and usability of the Gertner Tele-Motion-Rehab system in post-stroke patients, in their homes. 2. To evaluate Gertner Tele-Motion-Rehab system clinical improvement within the patient's home in terms of: 1. function of the weak upper extremity 2. performance of ADL</brief_summary>
