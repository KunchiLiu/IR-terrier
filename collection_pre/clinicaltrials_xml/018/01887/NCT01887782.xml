	<brief_summary>This trial will compare a novel form of rTMS, intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation to the standard conventional high frequency left sided stimulation protocol. The Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be the site of stimulation in both treatment conditions. The site of stimulation will be targeted using MRI co-registration. The study seeks to determine if the two treatment protocols have similar effectiveness in treating major depression.</brief_summary>
