	<brief_summary>This study is conducted to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Anemia is a reduced number of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is important for the transport of oxygen in your blood. The purpose of the study is to see if Roxadustat is both effective and safe as a treatment for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.</brief_summary>

Subject has had a myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, seizure, or a thrombotic/thromboembolic event (e.g., pulmonary embolism) within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Uncontrolled hypertension or two or more blood pressure (BP) values of systolic BP (SBP) greater than or equal to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) greater than or equal to 95 mmHg confirmed by repeat measurement within 2 weeks prior to randomization. Subject has a diagnosis or suspicion (e.g., complex kidney cyst of Bosniak Category 2F or higher) of renal cell carcinoma on renal ultrasound within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Subject has a history of malignancy, except the following: cancers determined to be cured or in remission for greater than or equal to 5 years, curatively resected basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, cervical cancer in situ, or resected colonic polyps. Subject is positive for any of the following: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); or antihepatitis C virus antibody (antiHCV Ab). Subject has an active clinically significant infection manifested by White Blood Count (WBC) &gt; ULN, and/or fever, in conjunction with clinical signs or symptoms of infection within one week prior to randomization. Subject has a known untreated proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion. Subject has had any prior organ transplant (that has not been explanted) or a scheduled organ transplantation. Subject has participated in any interventional clinical study or has been treated with any investigational drugs within 30 days or 5 half lives or limit set by national law, whichever is longer, prior to the initiation of Screening. Subject has an anticipated use of dapsone in any dose amount or chronic use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) &gt; 2.0 g/day during the treatment or followup period of the study.
