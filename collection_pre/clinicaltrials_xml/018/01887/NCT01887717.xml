	<brief_summary>This is a two-arm, open-label, prospective, multi-center, randomized, active-controlled clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of TheraSphere in comparison to standard of care therapy (sorafenib) in the treatment of patients with inoperable liver cancer and blockage of the portal vein.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Evaluation of TheraSphere to Treat Inoperable Liver Cancer With Blockage of the Portal Vein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this phase III, prospective randomized trial is to determine whether TheraSphere provides a meaningful benefit in survival in comparison with the standard of care (sorafenib) in patients with good hepatic function and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with portal vein thrombosis (PVT). This is an open-label prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial that will evaluate the use of TheraSphere compared to standard-of-care sorafenib alone.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients over 18 years of age, regardless of race of gender Advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with branch portal vein thrombosis (confirmed by noninvasive criteria EASL/AASLD, mandatory by histology in noncirrhotic patients); can be naive or recurrent HCC after curative treatment (&gt; 6 months before randomization) Unilobar disease Child Pugh A Tumor volume ≤ 70% of liver volume (determined by visual estimation) At least one unidimensional HCC target lesion assessable by CT or MRI according to RECIST 1.1 ECOG Performance Status 01 Platelets ≥ 50 X 10³/µL WBC ≥ 1.5 X10³/µL AST/ALT ≤ 5 X upper limit of normal Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Life expectancy &gt; 3 months Signed informed consent Confirmed extra hepatic metastases. Patients with indeterminate hepatic hilar lymph nodes up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, or with indeterminate lung nodules (single lesion between 11.5 cm, or multiple smaller lesions with a total diameter ≤ 2 cm) may be included if metastatic disease is deemed unlikely Known contraindication to standardofcare sorafenib including allergic reaction, pill swallowing difficulty, uncontrolled hypertension or history of cardiac disease, significant GI bleed within 30 days, renal failure including dialysis Evidence of hepatic vein invasion or caval thrombosis Evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Indication for any possible curative treatment after multidisciplinary assessment (surgery, ablation, transplantation) Previous treatment with sorafenib for more than 4 weeks during the previous 2 months; prior sorafenibrelated toxicity Initiation of antitumor therapy including chemotherapy or investigational drug treatment within 30 days before beginning study Prior TACE &lt; 6 months prior to screening phase in case of patients progressing from an intermediate to an advanced stage due to occurrence of PVT Patients cannot be on a transplant list History of organ allograft Contraindications to angiography or selective visceral catheterization History of severe allergy or intolerance to contrast agents, narcotics, sedatives or atropine that cannot be managed medically Prior external beam radiation therapy to the liver Evidence of continuing adverse effect of prior therapy Active GI bleeding and any bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy that is not correctable by usual therapy or hemostatic agents Evidence of any disease or condition that would place the patient at undue risk and preclude safe use of TheraSphere treatment Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum test Participation in concurrent clinical trials</criteria>
