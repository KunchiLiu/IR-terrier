	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome is a condition characterized by excess body weight, large waist circumference, high cholesterol and glucose in the blood, and hypertension. People with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for heart diseases. Research shows benefits of regular fiber intake in metabolic syndrome. However, due to altered taste and texture of the high fiber foods, long term intake of fiber is a challenge for metabolic syndrome patients. This study is designed to find if blinded-substitution of regular wheat flour in domestic kitchen with wheat flour enriched by an adaptable type of fiber (resistant starch-4), minimizes metabolic syndrome symptoms. this special type of fiber is also obtained from wheat.</brief_summary>
