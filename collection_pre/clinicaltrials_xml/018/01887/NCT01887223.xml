	<brief_summary>When the glaucoma filtering surgery failures (intraocular pressure rises again), the options is start to use the hypotensive eye drops again (medical treatment). However, in some cases (encapsulated blebs), there is a simple surgical revision that can revival the primary failure surgery. It calls transconjunctival needling revision. In this study, the investigators compare the efficacy of this revision versus medical treatment in 12-month follow up in eyes with encapsulated blebs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transconjunctival Needling Revision Versus Medical Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the efficacy of transconjunctival needling revision (TNR) with 5-fluorouracil versus medical treatment (MT) in glaucomatous eyes with uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) due to encapsulated bleb after trabeculectomy Prospective, randomized, interventional study. A total of forty eyes of 39 patients with elevated IOP and encapsulated bleb diagnosed at maximum 5 months after primary trabeculectomy with mitomycin C were included. The eyes were randomized to either TNR with 5-fluorouracil or MT (hypotensive eyedrops). A maximum of two TNR per patient was allowed in the needling arm. All eyes were followed up for 12 months. Success of treatment was defined as IOP â‰¤ 18mmHg and 20% reduction from baseline at last follow up.</detailed_description>
