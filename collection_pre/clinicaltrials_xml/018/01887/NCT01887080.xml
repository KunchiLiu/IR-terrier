	<brief_title>Effects of Microcurrent in a Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Home-based Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in most industrialized countries. It is widely accepted that cardiac rehabilitation has a beneficial role in the control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. However, these cardiovascular rehabilitation programs are scarce and only a small fraction of the population who needs has access. So, it is pertinent to the displacement of these programs to the community context. Obesity has become a truly global epidemic among children and adults, as well as changing the metabolic profile: when occurs an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue (mainly central distribution) there are a set of changes / adjustments to the cardiac structure and function. The electrical stimulation of abdominal subcutaneous (electrolipolysis) is a procedure often used in physical therapy clinics to reduce waist circumference. However, the effectiveness of this intervention, the selection of parameters, and the duration of its effects in cardiac patients are not yet clarified in the literature.</detailed_description>
