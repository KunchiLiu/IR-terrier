	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, prospective, single-blinded six-week study in PD patients with freezing of gait (FOG). This study will involve 2 study groups: Group A - training group; Group B - no training group/controls. Both groups will complete a gait evaluation and neuropsychological testing. Group A will also practice an in-home visuospatial task for 30 minutes, 4-6 days per week for six weeks. Group B will not complete the in-home tasks. Participation in this study is expected to last 6-8 weeks.</detailed_description>
