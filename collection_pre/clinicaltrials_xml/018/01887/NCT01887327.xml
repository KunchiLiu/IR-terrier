	<brief_summary>Neonatal jaundice is the most common cause of hospital readmission for term- and near term infants and its management poses a significant burden on the healthcare system. Infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease, such as ABO or Rhesus (Rh) incompatibility, or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD deficiency), have an increased rate of red cell destruction and, thus, an increase in bilirubin production. Newborn infants have immature liver function and do not conjugate bilirubin well, which results in accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin. Thus, bilirubin levels may rise rapidly and intervention may be required. At present, phototherapy (PT) is the most frequently used treatment for hyperbilirubinemia; it converts unconjugated bilirubin to less toxic water soluble photoisomers that are then excreted in the urine without need for conjugation. Infants who do not respond to PT are treated by exchange transfusion (ET), considered a therapy of last resort because of associated morbidity and mortality. Both PT and ET enhance the elimination of, but have no impact on the production of bilirubin. Stannsoporfin is a heme oxygenase inhibitor that acts to reduce bilirubin production. It is being developed for the management of neonatal jaundice.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Term and near term infants ≥35 and ≤ 43 weeks GA, age 048 hours with ABO or Rh incompatibility (anti C, c, D, E or e) who are Coombs positive, or age 072 hours with G6PD deficiency 2. Parental or guardian consent 3. Birth weight ≥ 2500 grams 4. At or above the agespecific threshold for initiating PT per the AAP guidelines based on measurement of TSB 5. Parents agree to observe light precautions for 10 days post treatment 1. Elevated direct bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL, OR &gt; 20% of the total serum bilirubin 2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 3 times ULN 3. Abnormal renal function defined as creatinine and/or blood urea nitrogen &gt;2 times the ULN 4. Any other clinically significant abnormalities on screening laboratory evaluation (including ECG) that in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient unsuitable for the clinical trial 5. Apgar score ≤6 at age 5 minutes 6. An unexplained existing rash or skin erythema 7. Prior exposure to PT 8. Clinical suggestion of neonatal thyroid disease or current uncontrolled thyroid disease in the mother (maternal Hashimoto's disease is not exclusionary) 9. Cardiorespiratory distress, defined as a respiratory rate &gt;60 breaths per minute at time of enrollment 10. Any abnormal auditory or ophthalmologic findings on screening physical exam 11. Treatment or need for treatment in the neonate with medications that are photoreactive or may prolong the QT interval (erythromycin ointment for eye prophylaxis is permitted), or family history of Long QT syndrome QT syndrome (appendix C) 12. Known porphyrias or risk factors for porphyrias, including family history 13. A maternal history of systemic lupus erythematosus 14. Maternal use of phenobarbital 30 days before, or after delivery, if breastfeeding 15. Maternal current drug or alcohol abuse, or maternal history of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would not make the patient a suitable candidate for participation in the clinical trial 16. Significant congenital anomalies or infections 17. Risk of requiring surgery or exposure to operating room (OR) lights in the first 2 weeks of life 18. Persistent hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;40 mg/dL) 19. Temperature instability defined as temperature consistently (3 consecutive times) &lt;36ºC and/or &gt;37.5ºC axillary 20. Use of IVIG or albumin prior to study drug administration 21. Postdelivery treatment with medications that are known or suspected to displace bilirubin from albumin (e.g., ceftriaxone or sulfabased antibiotics) 22. Use of photosensitizing drugs or agents (appendix D) 23. Unwillingness for parents/guardians to adhere to recommendations regarding light precautions 24. Exposure to any investigational medications or devices after delivery, or participation in another clinical trial while participating in this trial 25. Any other concurrent medical condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the patient unsuitable for the clinical trial</criteria>
