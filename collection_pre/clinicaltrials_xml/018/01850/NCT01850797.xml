	<brief_summary>The registry of acute stroke under new oral anticoagulants (RASUNOA) is a German multicenter, prospective, observational registry performed at about 50 study centers covering about 50.000 acute ischemic strokes and 6000 acute intracranial hemorrhages per year. Study enrollment will be consecutive. The RASUNOA registry study center is the University Medical Center of the Principal Investigator (Heidelberg, Germany). The registry will focus on treatment decisions and concepts in patients being under treatment with a new oral anticoagulant and suffering from acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry of Acute Stroke Under New Oral Anticoagulants -Pilot (RASUNOA-Pilot)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of the study is to collect information from a large, prospectively enrolling multicentre stroke database regarding the optimal management of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke during anticoagulation with nOAC. Specifically, we aim to obtain critical information regarding the epidemiology, natural history, laboratory and neuroradiological aspects, clinical consequences, and the effects of treatment (i.e. thrombolysis/interventional recanalisation in ischemic stroke and hemostatic therapy in ICH, respectively) in stroke during nOAC. The Registry is not limited to a specific new OAC but intends to examine stroke during use of any of the approved nOAC. The study is not designed to perform comparisons among the different nOAC.</detailed_description>
