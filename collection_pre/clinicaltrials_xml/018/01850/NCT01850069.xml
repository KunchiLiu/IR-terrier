	<brief_title>The Use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to Estimate Intracranial Pressure (ICP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management of intracranial hypertension requires the presence of an intracranial pressure monitor. We are investigating whether the waveforms obtained from a near infrared spectroscopy device can predict what the intracranial pressure is non-invasively. - Patients with intracranial hypertension who are intubated and ventilated in the ICU will be recruited - we will record there intracranial pressure and systemic arterial pressure - recordings from the near infrared device will be recorded and analysed off-line - we will correlate the waveform tracings from near infrared spectroscopy and the arterial tracing</detailed_description>
