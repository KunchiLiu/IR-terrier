	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to establish a way to help the development of targeted treatments in autism spectrum disorders. This may also help in early diagnosis of autism and may possibly predict severity. The study will compare subject's ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase) signaling to age- and gender-matched neurotypical controls and Intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched developmental disabilities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism Spectrum Disorder Subject Criteria: Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, based upon a clinical interview utilizing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-V (DSM-V) - Age 3-25 years - Stable dosing of psychotropic drugs for greater than or equal to 5 half-lives Exclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of schizophrenia, another psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or alcohol or other substance abuse based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-V criteria - Use of lithium, riluzole or other known modulators of ERK activation Age-Matched Neurotypical Control Subjects: - Age matched to the age of an Autistic Disorder Subject - History of normal development IQ-Matched Control Subjects: - Those subjects who are included in the study based on having an IQ and age that matches the IQ and age of an Autistic Disorder Subject who has an IQ less than 70 - All IQ-Matched Control Subjects will then also have an IQ less than 70</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (ASD subjects): Diagnosis of autistic disorder as confirmed by a clinical interview, utilizing the DSMV Age 325 years Stable dosing of psychotropic drugs for 5 halflives or greater Exclusion Criteria (ASD subjects): Diagnosis of schizophrenia, another psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or alcohol or other substance abuse based on DSMV criteria Use of lithium, riluzole or other known modulators of ERK activation IQMatched Control Subjects: Those subjects who are included in the study based on having an IQ and age that matches the IQ and age of an Autistic Disorder Subject who has an IQ less than 70. All IQMatched Control Subjects will then also have an IQ less than 70. IQMatched Control Subjects participate in a Screen/Baseline visit only. AgeMatched Neurotypical Control Subjects: Those subjects who are included in the study based on having an age matched to the age of an Autistic Disorder Subject and a history of normal development. AgeMatched Neurotypical Subjects participate in a Screen/Baseline visit only. Shipped Biomarker Control Group Subjects: For these shipping control samples, blood samples will also be drawn from adult parent/guardians of participating subjects.</criteria>
