	<brief_summary>Female inability to conceive a child. The purpose of this randomized, two-arm and double-blind study is to demonstrate that the treatment of a daily dose of 3x10mg dydrogesterone orally is as effective and safe as the daily dose of 3x200 mg micronized progesterone capsules administered intravaginally for the luteal support in patients undergoing IVF. The treatment will start on the day of oocyte retrieval and continue until pregnancy is negative or until week 12 gestation.Patients will be followed during treatment until 30 days after delivery to record any safety and tolerability data of the patient and their newborn(s).</brief_summary>
