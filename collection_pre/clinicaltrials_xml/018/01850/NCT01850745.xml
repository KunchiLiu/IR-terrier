	<brief_summary>Adherence to antiviral treatment in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is an important factor to achieve sustained virological response (SVR). The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary support program (MSP) in adherence to and efficacy of pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin compared to the conventional approach. We assessed 447 patients with CHC receiving antiviral treatment distributed into 3 groups: control group (recruited 2002-2004, n= 147), MSP-pilot group (recruited 2005-2006, n=131), and MSP-validation group (recruited 2007-2009, n=169).</brief_summary>
