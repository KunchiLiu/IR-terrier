	<brief_title>Assessment of Coronary Artery Disease in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD) share common risk factors and pathological mechanisms. CAD is an important cause of death in patients with stroke. Currently, coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is very useful non-invasive tool for detection of CAD and plaque analysis. Therefore, the investigators aimed to evaluate the prevalence, plaque characteristics (plaque types, stenosis degree, remodeling) and predictors of CAD in stroke patients through follow-up (more than 5 years) using CCTA.</detailed_description>
