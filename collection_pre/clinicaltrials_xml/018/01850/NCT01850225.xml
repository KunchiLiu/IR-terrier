	<brief_summary>Current treatment options for bilateral profoundly deaf children, diagnosed with inner ear anatomical abnormalities are limited, and in the case of absent cochleas, non-existent. An auditory brainstem implant (ABI) places an electrode close to the auditory nucleus in the brainstem. Children aged 2 - 5 who are not candidates for a cochlear implant, or who did not demonstrate benefit from a cochlear implant, will be implanted with an ABI and followed for 1 year for safety and a total of 3 years for preliminary efficacy. This is a feasibility study to determine the safety of the ABI.</brief_summary>
