	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to prove that the use of Bupropion with counseling works better than counseling alone for patients to quit smoking. The belief is that overall, there is a small percentage of patients who quit smoking all together.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Conservative and Aggressive Smoking Cessation Treatment Strategies in a Vascular Surgery Office Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the current investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive verses conservative smoking cessation program in patients with peripheral arterial disease in an outpatient setting.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. All patients with confirmed peripheral arterial disease (PAD), defined as at least one of the following criteria, during the initial Vascular Surgery Office exam and review of the patient's medical record: 1. Anklebrachial index of &lt;.90 in at least 1 lower extremity. 2. Toebrachial index of &lt;.60 3. Objective evidence of arterial occlusive disease in 1 lower extremity by duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomographic angiography 4. prior leg arterial revascularization or amputation due to PAD 2. Patients have to smoke with a minimum of 10 cigarettes per day for a minimum of 5 years. 3. Patients must be able to give informed written consent and be at least 18 years of age. 1. Pregnant women: Smoking Cessation Program medication Chantix (varenicline), Zyban (bupropion) has been shown to cause decreased fertility and decrease fetal weight in animal study offspring. 2. Patients less than 18 years of age: Safe and effective use in children has not been established with Chantix (varenicline) and Zyban (bupropion). These medications are not approved for use in individuals less than 18 years of old. 3. Patients with a history of a seizure disorder. Zyban (bupropion) is contraindicated in patients with preexisting seizure disorder. 4. Patients with a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Patients with these eating disorders have been shown to have an increased incidence of seizures and Zyban (bupropion) is contraindicated in patients with a history or anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. 5. The use bupropion concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including drugs with MAOIlike activity is contraindicated. Studies with animals indicate that bupropioninduced adverse reaction and toxicity appear to be enhanced by these medications. 6. Patients with renal insufficiency;defined as having a Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) &lt;=50mL/min. Chantix is substantially excreted by the kidneys and the risk of toxic reactions are greater in patients with impaired renal function. Creatinine Clearance =[(140age(yr)]*weight(kg)]/[72*serumCr(mg/dL)]. 7. Patients with hepatic insufficiency; defined as having elevated liver function tests (serum aminotransferases) greater than 1.5 baseline. Zyban is metabolized in the liver. Halflives of bupropion and/or its major metabolites are prolonged in patients with liver disease. 8. Patients with vascular pathology other than PAD (Carotid atherosclerosis, abdominal aortic aneurysms, venous insufficiency). 9. Subjects with a history of psychiatric illness requiring current treatment with psychoactive medications, a history of dependence on alcohol or non nicotine substance in the past year or current use of tobacco products other than cigarettes.</criteria>
