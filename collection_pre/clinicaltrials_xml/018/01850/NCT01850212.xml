	<criteria>Must have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of any study procedures. HIV1 infected subjects regardless of race or ethnicity Use of one of the following taken as a stable, continuous, NRTIcontaining antiretroviral (ARV) regimen for ≥ 3 years are allowed (withinclass change of agents other than TDF within 3 years of study entry are permitted as specified): TDF plus PI/rcontaining regimen including subjects who switched from one TDF plus PI/r regimen to another TDF plus PI/r regimen a TDF plus nonPI/rcontaining regimen including subjects who switched from one TDF plus nonPI/r regimen to another TDF plus nonPI/r regimen a NonTDF NRTI plus a PI/rcontaining regimen including subjects who switched from one nonTDF NRTI plus PI/r regimen to another nonTDF NRTI regimen plus PI/r regimen a NonTDF NRTI plus a nonPI/r‑containing regimen including subjects who switched from one nonTDF NRTI plus nonPI/r regimen to another nonTDF NRTI regimen plus non‑PI/r regimen Of note, subjects in the nonTDF groups must have never taken a regimen that includes TDF (including previous exposure to TDF for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP)) Subjects included in the TDF groups must have always taken a regimen that includes TDF. NonPI/r agents include nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, triple nucleoside inhibitors and nonboosted protease inhibitors Male subjects must be ≥ 50 years of age Female subjects must be postmenopausal. Menopause can be assumed to have occurred in a woman when there is either appropriate medical documentation of prior complete bilateral oophorectomy or permanent cessation of previously occurring menses &gt; 12 months as a result of ovarian failure or bilateral oophorectomy with documentation of hormonal deficiency by a certified healthcare provided Adequate records available to evaluate medical history for the 3 years prior to study entry Subject has a contraindication to dualenergy Xray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans Subject has a history of osteoporosis before initiating Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART)</criteria>
