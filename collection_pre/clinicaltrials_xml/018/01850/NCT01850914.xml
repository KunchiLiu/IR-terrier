	<brief_summary>Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is a treatable and a common disease of the elderly. The overall objective of this work is to describe cardio- and cerebrovascular risk factors and vascular disease in shunted INPH-patients compared to an age- and sex matched elderly population, as well as the impact of vascular risk factors and vascular co-morbidity on clinical symptoms and outcome of surgery in INPH-patients. The hypothesis is that INPH-patients have a higher level of vascular risk factors and subclinical organ damage than a normal elderly population, and that the higher the level of existing vascular risk factors, the more severe the symptoms of the hydrocephalic disease.</brief_summary>
