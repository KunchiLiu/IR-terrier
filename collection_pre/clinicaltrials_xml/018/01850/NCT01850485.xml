	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is: In patients after an out of hospital cardiac arrest, treated with therapeutic hypothermia (33°C) will be found significantly more microcirculatory abnormalities, compared to the same group of patients treated with 36°C.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microcirculatory Perfusion in Patients With Coma After Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the (sublingual) microcirculation in patients after an out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The microcirculation is measured in this study by Sublingual Side Stream Darkfield (SDF) Imaging and Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) at admission and after 12 and 24 hours.</detailed_description>
