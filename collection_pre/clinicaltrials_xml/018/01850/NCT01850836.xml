	<brief_title>Dual Hemisphere rTMS for Rehabilitation of Post Stroke Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patients with subacute post-stroke non-fluent aphasia were randomly allocated with a ratio 2:1 to receive real (n = 20) or sham (n = 10) rTMS of the affected motor cortex. Each patient received 1000 rTMS pulses (1 Hertz at 110% of resting motor threshold) over the unaffected Broca's area and 1000 pulses (20 Hertz at 100% resting motor threshold) over affected left Broca's area for 10 consecutive days. LANGUAGE section of hemispheric stroke scale, Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire Hospital Version (SADQ-H) and NIH stroke scale were assessed before, post sessions, 1 and 2 months after the last session . Motor threshold was assessed before and after the end of last session.</detailed_description>
