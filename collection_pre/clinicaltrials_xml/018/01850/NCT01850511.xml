	<brief_summary>Nasal obstruction is a common complaint prompting presentation to an otolaryngologist. Many studies have been performed quantifying and describing the impact of a number of factors on symptoms of nasal obstruction, including anatomical, neoplastic, infectious, and inflammatory causes. Despite this scrutiny, no attention has been paid to the nasal vibrissae as a potential anatomical contributor to nasal obstruction. The proposed study intends to elucidate that contribution, if any exists.</brief_summary>
