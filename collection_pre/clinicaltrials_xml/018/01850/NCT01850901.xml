	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess whether renal denervation (RD) added to usual care compared to usual care alone reduces blood pressure (BP) as determined with ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) after 6 months in subjects with an average day-time systolic BP of at least 135 mmHg as determined with use of ABPM, despite use of three or more BP lowering agents or with documented intolerance or contraindication for to 2 or more of the 4 major classes of antihypertensive drugs (ACEi/ARB, calcium channel blockers, betablockers and diuretics) obstructing use of 3 antihypertensives Further aims are to assess the effect of renal denervation on the use of BP lowering agents, to explore the effect of renal denervation in strata of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (eGFR 20-60 mL/min per 1.73m2 and eGFR&gt;60 mL/min per 1.73m2) and according to baseline office BP. Randomization will be stratified by hospital and eGFR and will be at a 2:1 ratio.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Individual has a mean daytime SBP ≥ 135 mmHg, as determined with the use of ABPM, while using 3 or more antihypertensive agents for at least 3 months prior to inclusion or with documented intolerance to 2 or more of the 4 major classes antihypertensive drugs ( ACE/ARB, Calcium channel blocker, Beta Blocker, Diuretic) and no possibility to take 3 antihypertensive drugs. 2. Individual is ≥18 years of age. 1. Individual is unable or unwilling to sign informed consent. 2. Individual has a treatable secondary cause of hypertension. 3. Individual has an eGFR below 20 mL/min/1.73m2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) calculation. 4. Individual has renal artery anatomy that is ineligible for treatment 5. Individual has any serious medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may adversely affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the participant or the study. 6. Individual is pregnant, nursing or planning to be pregnant. 7. Individual has a known, unresolved history of drug use or alcohol dependency, lacks the ability to comprehend or follow instructions, or would be unlikely or unable to comply with study followup requirements. 8. Individual is currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial.</criteria>
