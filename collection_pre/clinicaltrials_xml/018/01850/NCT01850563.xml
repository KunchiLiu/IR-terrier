	<brief_summary>Patients with brain metastases who are candidates for treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are potential study participants. SRS delivers high-energy, precisely-focused radiation to each brain metastasis to shrink the tumor, and is the standard-of-care for patients with these tumors. Oxygen enhances the damaging effects of radiation on tumor cells. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy increases oxygen levels in all kinds of tissues, including tumors. The purpose of this trial is to study whether it is feasible to treat patients with HBO just prior to receiving SRS, given the timing constraints of treating sequentially with HBO and then SRS. Patients will undergo HBO treatment followed by the placement of a Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame then transported ,via stretcher, to receive SRS. The transfer and placement of the head frame needs to be completed within the 15minute time frame. The trial's secondary objectives are to determine whether it has any effects on outcomes and quality of life. As part of study participation patients will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires as well as mini mental status questionnaires. These will be done prior to treatment and at follow up appointments throughout the next 3 years while participating in the study. Patients will be given the option to participate in the optional bio marker blood draw study which would require patients to have blood drawn at three time points, pre-treatment, the day after treatment and at their first follow up visit.</brief_summary>
