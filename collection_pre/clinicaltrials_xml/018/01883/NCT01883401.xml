	<brief_summary>Berry anthocyanins have been shown to improve lipid profile in subjects with dyslipidemia while no such studies with whole strawberries have been reported in the US population. The investigators propose to examine the effects of low and high doses of freeze-dried strawberries on serum glucose, insulin, and lipid profile, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, in a 12-week randomized controlled trial. Subjects with abdominal adiposity and dyslipidemia (n=15/group) will be recruited at OUHSC and OSU, and randomly assigned to the low (25g/day) or high (50g/day) strawberry dose, or matched control (fiber and calories) group. The strawberry group will consume freeze-dried strawberry beverage (2 cups/day) and the controls will consume 2 cups beverage (fiber +calories) daily for 12 weeks. Blood draws, anthropometrics, blood pressure, and dietary data will be collected at screen, 6 and 12 weeks of the study to determine chronic and acute effects of strawberry intervention. Serum or plasma samples will be analyzed for fasting glucose, insulin, lipid profile including total cholesterol, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid particle size, and levels of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, oxidized LDL, myeloperoxidase), inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, adiponectin, interleukins) and adhesion molecules. Repeated measures ANOVA will be performed using a 5% significance level. We anticipate a dose response effect in decrease in lipids, oxidative stress or inflammation following strawberry intervention versus controls.</brief_summary>
