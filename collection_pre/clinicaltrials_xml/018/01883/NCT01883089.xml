	<brief_summary>The current study combines both clinical trial and daily process methodology to examine the dynamic longitudinal relationships between daily approach and avoidance inclinations (i.e., craving) and drinking behaviors in those diagnosed with an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) prior to, during, and after receiving a brief alcohol intervention. It is hypothesized that daily avoidance inclinations will significantly moderate the effect of daily approach inclinations on drinking behaviors, and that significant increases in avoidance inclinations will be observed prior to treatment entry, followed by significant decreases in approach inclinations during treatment.</brief_summary>
