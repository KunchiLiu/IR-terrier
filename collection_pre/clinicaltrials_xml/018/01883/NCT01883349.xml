	<brief_title>Cognitive Impairment and Imaging Correlates in End Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment is very common in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). It exact mechanisms are not clear, but patients with ESRD have more cerebral white matter changes. Several studies have shown that cognitive function improves post-transplant, indicating that there may be some reversibility in the process. This study will examine the correlation between cognitive impairment and structural brain changes before and after renal transplantation. We will also study the correlation of cognitive function with serum inflammatory markers before and after transplant. These results will be compared to aged matched healthy controls without kidney disease.</detailed_description>
