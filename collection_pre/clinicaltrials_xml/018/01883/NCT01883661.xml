	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of BMMNC in Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be an autoimmune disease that is caused by the immune system attacking the central nervous system (CNS) leading to myelin loss and axonal damage, resulting in long-term disability. The pathophysiology of MS is complex with involvement of genetic and environmental factors that define the susceptibility to generate the autoimmune attack. MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow down or stop.The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system. Currently, treatment of MS relays mainly on immunosuppression combined with monoclonal antibodies and steroid therapies.The most advanced application for MSCs in the neurological clinical arena is in multiple sclerosis.This clinical study time period is for 1 year. This study is carried out to see the role of BMMNC cell Therapy in Multiple sclerosis, and to control symptoms and help to maintain a normal quality of life of suffering patients.</detailed_description>
