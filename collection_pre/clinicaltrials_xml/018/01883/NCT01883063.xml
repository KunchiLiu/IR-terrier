	<brief_summary>This is a prospective multi-site study. Subjects with distal radius fractures will be enrolled. Subjects will be treated surgically with a Sonoma WRxâ„¢ device or managed non-operatively with a splint or cast. Subjects will be enrolled in each group according to physician's standard of care (either casting/splinting or surgery) for distal radius fractures. Subjects will be enrolled based on the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria with a final qualifying decision made by a group of three independent adjudicators. The final qualifying review should allow for similar patient groups within each arm of the study due to the variability that can arise in fracture classification. Review by the adjudicators should be completed within 1 week.</brief_summary>
