	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury is an extremely common disease, it counts 50.000 deaths and 235.000 hospitalizations every year. Functional consequences of an acquired brain injury have a considerable impact on quality of lives of patients and care-givers with direct effects on balance, mobility and on psycho-social functions. Attention deficits are one of the most frequent and disabling consequences of severe brain injury. Within the wide spectrum of attentive problems, patients with traumatic brain injury frequently have shown difficulties in divided attention. Patients, care-givers and professionals frequently refer difficulties also in selective attention and vigilance as consequence of the trauma. It has been shown how these difficulties are tightly related with the missed return to work after two years from the injury. The hypothesis of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a rehabilitative protocol on gaming using the console Xbox and its efficacy in improving balance, mobility, risk of falling, attentive functions (selective and divided attention) in subjects which have had a traumatic brain injury at least 12 months before.</brief_summary>
