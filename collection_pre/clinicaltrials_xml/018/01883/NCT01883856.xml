Diagnosis of intractable glaucoma in the study eye, with the exception of silicone oil endotamponade induced glaucoma, which has not responded to conventional medical and surgical therapy. Elevated intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mmHg in the study eye. Two consecutive measurements using Goldmann Applanation Tonometry will be obtained and the mean of those two measurements will be considered the subject's baseline intraocular pressure. Subject is a candidate for surgery in the study eye with a glaucoma drainage device. Subject is willing and able to sign the informed consent. Diagnosis of silicone oil endotamponade induced glaucoma in the study eye. History of prior drainage implant surgery in the study eye. History of cyclophotocoagulation of the study eye. Pregnancy.
