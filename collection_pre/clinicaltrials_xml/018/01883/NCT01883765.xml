	<brief_summary>Neurofeedback training (NFT) has been frequently investigated as an alternative treatment for ADHD mainly in children and adolescents. However, randomized double-blind trials that include a sham-neurofeedback control group are lacking, as well as studies examining the efficacy of NFT in adult ADHD populations. The inclusion of a sham-neurofeedback group is crucial to monitor and exclude unspecific effects. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of NFT as compared to a sham-feedback condition and a cognitive behavioral treatment in adults with persistent ADHD. Efficacy is assessed on several outcome parameters, such as symptom severity, neuropsychological variables (e.g., attention, memory), and EEG parameters.</brief_summary>
