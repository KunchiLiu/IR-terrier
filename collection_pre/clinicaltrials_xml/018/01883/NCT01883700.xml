	<brief_summary>This study examines the effects of carbohydrate type (high- or low-Glycemic Index (GI)) and amount (high- or low-Glycemic Load (GL)) have on blood glucose levels, blood pressure and arterial stiffness in healthy individuals. It will also determine whether subjective ratings such as test meal palatability and hunger are related to changes in blood glucose. The investigators hypothesize that: (1) High-GI meals, regardless of GL, will increase arterial stiffness; low-GI meals, regardless of GL, will have a neutral or lowering effect on arterial stiffness (augmentation index). (2) High-GI meals, regardless of GL, will have an elevating effect on both central and peripheral blood pressures. (3) The incremental area under the curve for blood glucose will show most significant differences between high-GI, high-GL and low-GI, low-GL meals at 30 and 90 min.</brief_summary>
