	<brief_summary>Two types of Presurgical Nasoalveolar Molding (NAM) coexist in Craniofacial Center in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The objective of this study is to compare the number of clinical visits, total prices, complications and nasal symmetry between these two NAM reconstruction methods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Nasoalveolar Molding Techniques in Complete Unilateral Cleft Lip Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Grayson's NAM reconstruction starts with alveolar molding first. The alveolar molding is made by gradual modification of the acrylic plate with periodic acrylic add on and grinding. After the alveolar cleft gap is less than 5 mm (usually at the end of second months), nasal molding was added to the alveolar molding plate. Figueroa's NAM reconstruction use labial tapes and acrylic relief to the palatal plate to approximate alveolar gap. The device starts with nasal and alveolar molding simultaneously.</detailed_description>
