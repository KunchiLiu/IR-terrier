	<brief_summary>Objectives: The aims of this study are (1) to define the effectiveness of functional nasal surgery during Le Fort I osteotomy on nasal obstruction through objective as well as subjective evaluations, (2) to determine guideline for concomitant functional nasal surgery with Le Fort I osteotomy, and (3) to explore possible mechanisms by which functional nasal surgery may reduce nasal obstruction severity. Design: A prospective, single-blnd, randomized trial. Setting: Chang Gung Craniofacial Center and Department of Otolaryngology (ENT). Patients: A total of 80 Taiwanese patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate and dentofacial deformity (age &gt;16 for females, &gt;18 for males; 40 in experimental and 40 in control groups) Interventions: In the experimental group, all patients will receive Le Fort I osteotomy and septoplasty. In the control group, all patients will receive Le Fort I osteotomy only. Measurements: All patients will undergo history taking, clinical examination, radioallergosorbent (RAST) examination (before surgery), standard questionnaire and image examination before surgery, one week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. To reduce radiation exposure, cone-beam CT will only be performed before surgery and one week, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Data Analysis: Independent t and chi-squared tests, correlation coefficients and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used. Statistical significance is assumed for a p value of less than 0.05. Key Words: cleft lip palate, nasal septum deviation, Le Fort I osteotomy, septoplasty, effectiveness</brief_summary>
