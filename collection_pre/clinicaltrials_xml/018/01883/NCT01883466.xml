	<brief_summary>Urban air pollution is a major contributor to greenhouse gases and has been shown to increase cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. This century has seen a rebirth of biofuel marketing and research, with biodiesel emerging as one of the strongest contenders within international markets. The pursuit of alternative renewable fuels is incredibly complex and has powered research in agriculture, biotechnology, production, transportation, feedstocks, ecology and biomass manufacturing. In spite of this, health effects have been an almost completely overlooked aspect. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether 100% biodiesel exhaust exposure in healthy volunteers leads to cardiovascular and inflammatory responses. Further investigations into the chemical composition of biodiesel exhaust will also be performed.</brief_summary>
