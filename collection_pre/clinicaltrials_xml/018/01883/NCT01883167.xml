	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the potential pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) interaction between the XO inhibitor febuxostat and the investigational URAT1 inhibitor RDEA3170 and provide information for potential future clinical studies using this combination. Combination treatment using 2 drugs with different mechanisms of action may achieve improved response and may allow the use of lower doses, resulting in fewer side effects than the use of either drug alone.</brief_summary>
