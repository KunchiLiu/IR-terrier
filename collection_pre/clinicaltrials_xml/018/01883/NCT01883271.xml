	<brief_summary>Study objectives: 1. To compare cardiovascular function in older compared to young healthy adults. 2. To compare the effect of 8 weeks of aerobic interval training vs. continuous moderate exercise on cardiovascular function in healthy older adults. Hypotheses: 1. Compared to young adults, older adults will have lower cardiovascular function. 2. Compared to continuous moderate intensity exercise training, interval training will be more effective in improving cardiovascular function in older adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Aerobic Interval Training on Cardiovascular Function in Aging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular function will be measured at baseline in older healthy adults and young healthy controls. Older adults will be randomized to the aerobic interval training group, continuous moderate exercise group or non-exercise control group. At the end of the 8-week exercise intervention, baseline measures will be repeated in the older adults.</detailed_description>
