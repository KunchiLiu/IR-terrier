	<brief_summary>Glucose oxidase is a hydrogen peroxide producing enzyme, which also is present in honey. Human rhinoviruses are sensitive to the action of hydrogen peroxide, which is documented in laboratory studies. In the present study we aim to investigate if a nasal spray with glucose oxidase could treat a common cold, when the treatment is started even after the onset of the symptoms. The study is randomized and placebo controlled.</brief_summary>
