	<brief_title>A Prospective Multi-center Study on Total Hip Arthroplasty With E1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, MULTI-CENTER Study to compare two different materials (CoCr and Delta ceramic) articulating against E1 Highly Crosslinked polyethylene in Hip Replacement. Patient population is 160 (80 each). Follow-up period is 10 year postoperatively. E1 liners with thickness of 4.8mm at 45 degrees position (load bearing direction) will be used in all cases. Randomization will occur via random number generator by 4 blocks randomization.</detailed_description>
