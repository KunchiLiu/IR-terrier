	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to pilot and feasibility test an innovative cognitive behavioral intervention to improve heart failure self-care among community dwelling older adults.The primary aim of this study is to test the effect of the intervention on improving heart failure self-care, knowledge and Health related quality of life at 1 month and 3 months. We will test three hypotheses comparing 60 older adults with heart failure randomly assigned to either the intervention or a control group: Hypothesis 1. Participants in the intervention group will have significantly improved heart failure self-care than control participants. Hypothesis 2. Participants in the intervention group will have significantly improved knowledge about heart failure and heart failure self-care than control participants. Hypothesis 3. Participants in the intervention group will have significantly better Health Related Quality of Life than control participants. A secondary exploratory aim is to assess and describe implementation feasibility of providing a heart failure self-care intervention in a community group setting.</brief_summary>
