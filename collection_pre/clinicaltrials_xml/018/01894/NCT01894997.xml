	<brief_summary>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a life threatening condition and a serious concern among hospitalized patients, with death occurring in approximately 6% of cases. It involves the formation of a clot where stagnant blood flow occurs, predominantly in the deep veins of the legs. Three mechanisms underlie DVT, venous stasis (slowing or stopping of the blood), hypercoagulability (increased clotting) and damage to blood vessel endothelium (damage to blood vessel wall), collectively known as Virchow's triad. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) have been shown to improve lower limb blood flow. However, few studies have directly compared the two methods and those that have, have used dated NMES techniques. The objective of this study is to compare the two methods in terms of blood flow, in both a young and an older population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a life threatening condition and a serious concern among hospitalized patients, with death occurring in approximately 6% of cases. It involves the formation of a clot where stagnant blood flow occurs, predominantly in the deep veins of the legs. Three mechanisms underlie DVT, venous stasis (slowing or stopping of the blood), hypercoagulability (increased clotting) and damage to blood vessel endothelium (damage to blood vessel wall), collectively known as Virchow's triad. Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) involves the use of an inflatable cuff placed around the limb. This cuff inflates and deflates intermittently in order to squeeze blood from the underlying veins. Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) leads to a contraction of muscles by delivering a series of controlled electrical pulses via skin surface electrodes placed over the motor points of the targeted muscle.</detailed_description>
