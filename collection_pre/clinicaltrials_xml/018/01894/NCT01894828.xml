	<brief_title>Nutritional Supplementation in Patients With no Signs of Malnutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previous psychological studies our team found high level psychological stress in over 60% of cancer patients. This may cause numerous problems including anorexia, which together with biological disturbances can initiate cancer related catabolism even when it can not yet be seen. In this study we want to answer the question if oral nutritional supplementation can help the patient overcome the catabolism in its initial phase and improve nutritional status, which would result in reduced number of postoperational complications</detailed_description>
