	<brief_summary>AIM To determine the value of trastuzumab in the early breast cancer setting in the Netherlands. RESEARCH QUESTIONS / OBJECTIVES 1. Is adjuvant trastuzumab in daily practice effectively used, that is, how and to whom is it given? 2. Is the introduction of trastuzumab in early breast cancer cost-effective for the Netherlands? To address the research questions (objectives), the following outcome measures will be determined: CLINICAL OUTCOME MEASURES 1. Actual trastuzumab administration as opposed to planned trastuzumab administration 2. Selection criteria for chemotherapy and trastuzumab in daily practice 3. Immediate and longterm toxicities due to adjuvant treatment, specifically cardiac 4. Disease-free, breast cancer specific, and overall survival in relation to trastuzumab ECONOMIC OUTCOME MEASURES 5. Volumes and costs of diagnostic tests and therapies including those for (distant) relapse 6. Cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab in clinical trials versus in real world</brief_summary>
