	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of FF, UMEC and VI administered from one inhaler (at two different strengths of UMEC (125 and 62.5microgram [mcg]) and FF/VI (ICS/LABA) and UMEC/VI (LAMA/LABA). Subjects will receive each of the four treatments once, separated by a wash-out period of 7-21 days between doses in a four way crossover design. There will be 4 treatment periods in total. During each treatment period, subjects will attend the clinical unit on Day -1 for standard safety assessments in addition to familiarization with the inhaler. Each subject will remain resident in the unit until at least 24 hours after the dose given on Day 1. Following completion of all four treatment periods, a follow up visit will take place 7 to 21 days following the final dose of study medication.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Safety Average Corrected QT Interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &lt;450 msec at screening. Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt;=80% predicted and a FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ratio &gt;=0.7 at screening. Alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5x Upper Limit Normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Population Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and lung function testing. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and GSK medical monitor consider the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and outcome. Subjects who are current nonsmokers who have not used any tobacco products in the 6month period preceding the screening visit and have a pack history of &lt;=10 pack years. [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day /20) x number of years smoked] Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. A female subject is eligible to participate as follows: Nonchildbearing potential, females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods and women of childbearing potential should have used one of the contraception methods. Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range 18.033.0 kg/m2 (inclusive). Safety Lactating or pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or Day 1. A supine mean heart rate outside the range 4090 beats per minute (bpm) at screening. Hepatic Disease Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or a history of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits. Concurrent Disease History of respiratory disease (i.e. history of asthmatic symptoms) in the last 10 years. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening or a positive test for HIV. Concurrent Medication Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Population A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen at screening and Day 1. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer), or has had exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated. The subject is unable to refrain from consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or any fruit juices containing these fruits from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication and for the duration of the study.</criteria>
