	<brief_summary>Background and purposes:Chloroquine (CLQ), an antimalarial drug, has a lysosomatrophic effect associate with increase the sensibility of Radiation through leakage of hidroliticenzimes, increase of apoptosis, autophagy mediated by lysosomalhidrolases and increase of oxidative stress "in vitro". In this phase II study we evaluated the efficacy and safety as radiosensitizing of the Chloroquine plus concomitant 30 Gray (Gy) of Whole-brain irradiation (WBI)in patients with brain metastases (BM) from solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Whole-brain Irradiation With Chloroquine for Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventy-three eligible patients were randomized. Thirty-nine patients received WBI (30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks) concomitant with 150 mg of CLQ for 4 weeks (the CLQ group). Thirty-four patients received the same schedule of WBI concomitant with a placebo for 4 weeks (the control arm). All the patients were evaluated for quality of life (QoL) using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (Mexican version) before beginning radiotherapy and one month later.</detailed_description>
