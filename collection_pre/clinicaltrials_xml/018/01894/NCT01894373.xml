	<criteria>Have ever had a physician's diagnosis of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and be a candidate for treatment with CIK Are being treated with or initiating CIK therapy at the time of enrollment Be able to provide written informed consent Be willing and able to fully to participate for the duration of patient followup (5 years) PUVA or Grenz ray therapy within 4 weeks prior to randomisation. UVB therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomisation. Systemic treatment with biological therapies (marketed or otherwise) with a possible effect on psoriasis (e.g., alefacept, efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab) within 3 months prior to randomisation. Systemic treatment other than biologicals with a possible effect on psoriasis (e.g., corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, retinoids, hydroxycarbamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, other immunosuppressants) within 4 weeks prior to randomisation. Any topical treatment of the scalp (except for medicated shampoos and emollients) within 2 weeks prior to randomisation (medicated shampoos/emollients are not allowed during the doubleblind phase). Shampoos containing corticosteroids, e.g. Clobex®, are not allowed within 2 weeks prior to randomisation. Planned use of topical treatment for psoriasis of the trunk or limbs, besides study medication, during the study with the exceptions of: • emollient • medications used to treat psoriasis of the skin folds and/or genitals (any medication may be used for this purpose apart from Class 15 corticosteroids. Topical treatment of the face with Class 15 corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to randomisation. Planned initiation of, or changes to, concomitant medication that could affect psoriasis (e.g., beta blockers, antimalaria drugs, lithium) during the doubleblind phase of the study. Treatment with any nonmarketed drug substance (i.e., an agent which has not yet been made available for clinical use following registration) within 4 weeks prior to randomisation. Planned use of chemical treatments of the hair (eg relaxers, 'perms', or colourings) during the doubleblind phase of the study. Current diagnosis of erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis. Patients with any of the following conditions also present on psoriatic areas of the scalp or trunk/limbs: viral (e.g. herpes or varicella) lesions of the skin, fungal or bacterial skin infections, parasitic infections, skin manifestations in relation to tuberculosis or syphilis, rosacea, acne rosacea, acne vulgaris, atrophic skin, striae atrophicae, fragility of skin veins, ichthyosis, ulcers or wounds. Other inflammatory skin diseases that may confound the evaluation of psoriasis of the scalp or trunk/limbs.</criteria>
