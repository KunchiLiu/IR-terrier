	<brief_summary>In the past decades frequency of cesarean section was increasing. Bonding or early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) starts ideally straight after birth. After vaginal delivery bonding/early SSC is already well-established. After cesarean section this important process starts after termination of operation. A Cochran review analyzed randomized studies and shows positive effects of early SSC. Possible concerns to adopt bonding in the operating room are beside organizational ones (change of established processes) also a different ambiance in the operating room (temperature, light, noise). In a prospective randomized trial, early SSC after cesarean section should be analyzed. Hypothesis Mothers, who have the chance to bond immediately after birth in the operating room, have lower cortisol, chromogranin A and alpha amylase levels as well as higher oxytocin levels. Adaptation of the newborn is within the normal range. Early bonding has a further positive effect on breast feeding, maternal pain processing and mental health.</brief_summary>
