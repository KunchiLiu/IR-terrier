	<detailed_description>The S8 PK study is an open label trial conducted at one clinical center in 5 adults with chronic sinusitis, who had prior endoscopic sinus surgery but experience nasal obstruction/congestion symptoms and bilateral ethmoid polyposis. The S8 PK study assessed the safety, implant delivery to the ethmoid sinus and systemic exposure to mometasone furoate by measuring plasma mometasone furoate and cortisol concentrations through 30 days post-procedure.</detailed_description>
