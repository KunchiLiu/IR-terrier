	<brief_summary>- 280 patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to methotrexate will be evaluated for improvement of disease activity (efficacy) when taking GLPG0634 as monotherapy (3 different doses - 50mg, 100mg and 200mg once daily) or matching placebo for 24 weeks. - During the course of the study, patients will also be examined for any side effects that may occur (safety and tolerability), and the amount of GLPG0634 present in the blood (Pharmacokinetics) as well as the effects of GLPG0634 on disease- and mechanism of action-related parameters in the blood (Pharmacodynamics) will be determined. Also, the effects of different doses of GLPG0634 administration on subjects' disability, fatigue and quality of life will be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Treatment duration will be 24 weeks in total. - However, at Week 12, all subjects on placebo and the subjects on the 50 mg dose who have not achieved 20% improvement in swollen joint count (SJC66) and tender joint count (TJC68) will be assigned (automatically via interactive web response system (IWRS)) to 100 mg q.d. in a blinded fashion and will continue treatment until Week 24. - Subjects in the other groups will maintain their randomized treatment until Week 24.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>male or female subjects who are ≥18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent, have a diagnosis of RA since at least 6 months and meeting the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria of RA and ACR functional class IIII, have ≥6 swollen joints (from a 66joint count) and ≥8 tender joints (from a 68joint count) at Screening and at Baseline, Screening serum creactive protein ≥ 0.7 x upper limit of laboratory normal range (ULN), have shown an inadequate response in terms of either lack of efficacy or toxicity to MTX, have agreed to be washed out from MTX for a period of at least 4 weeks before or during the Screening period. current therapy with any nonbiological disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), with the exception of antimalarials, which must be at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening, current or previous RA treatment with a biologic DMARD, with the exception of biologic DMARDs: administered in a single clinical study setting, and; more than 6 months prior to Screening (12 months for rituximab or other B cell depleting agents), and; where the biologic DMARD was effective, and if discontinued, this should not be due to lack of efficacy, previous treatment at any time with a cytotoxic agent, other than MTX, before Screening.</criteria>
