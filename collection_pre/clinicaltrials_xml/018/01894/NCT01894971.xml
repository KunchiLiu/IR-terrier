	<brief_summary>Single-center prospective randomized trial to evaluate the effect of thermal damage of Ligasure速 to destroy cornual portion of fallopian tube tisse. Right of Left side of fallpian tube is randomized and coagulated one more time than other side before cut off. The pathologist evaluate the amount of fallopian tube tissue left at both cornual portion of cut off specimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Ligasure速 to Destroy Cornual Portion of Fallopian Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When investigators perform salpingectomy, both side of cornual portion of the uterus are coagulated by Ligasure速. The randomized, the same word selected side of the fallopian tube is coagulated one more time at the cornual portion than unselected other side of fallopian tube. Hypothesis is that the side selected and coagulated twice would have less fallopian tube tisse left at fianl pathology than the side only once coagulated by Ligasure速.</detailed_description>
