	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine if using genetics can improve statin adherence in patients who should be taking statins but are not because of prior side effects. This study will assist physicians/providers in making a personalized health care plan for prevention of cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetically Guided Statin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors ("statins") are commonly prescribed to lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Long-term adherence to statins in the primary care environment is challenging; consequences of statin non-adherence include higher LDLc levels, hospitalizations, costs, and death due to CVD. Medication non-adherence is complex and multifactorial and can be associated with a number of factors including medication cost, complexity of medication regimen, poor provider-patient relationship / communication, and adverse side effects. For statins, side effects such as muscle aches, cramping, and pain (referred to broadly as statin-related myopathy) are a frequent cause of non-adherence. These symptoms are non-specific and are frequent reasons for stopping statin therapy, due to patient or provider concern about the possibility of statin-related myopathy. Many patients may be needlessly deprived of the cardiovascular benefits of long-term statin use. A genetic risk factor for statin myopathy and subsequent non-adherence has recently been identified. In a genome-wide association study, a genetic variant (named SLCO1B1*5) was a main contributor of statin myopathy. It was demonstrated that the SLCO1B1*5 variant is not only a predictor of myopathy, but also of premature statin discontinuation. The risk with the *5 allele is statin specific: greatest with simvastatin and atorvastatin use, the least with pravastatin or rosuvastatin. Therefore, the SLCO1B1*5 variant is common, can predict myopathy, subsequent non-adherence, and due to its statin-specific effects creates a novel research paradigm for personalizing statins to an individual's genetic profile. Carriers of the SLCO1B1*5 variant may do best on rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or fluvastatin whereas non-carriers may be treated with any statin. The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized trial comparing two strategies: 1. genetically guided statin therapy vs. 2. usual care (i.e., a strategy without genetics) on the effects of statin adherence and LDLc lowering. The overall hypothesis is that genetically guided statin therapy will lead to greater statin adherence and lower LDLc when compared to a non-guided strategy. The design of this trial will randomize primary care patients within Duke University Health System (DUHS) and travis Air Force Base (TAFB) clinics that are nonadherent to statins due to prior side-effects in an unblinded, 1:1 fashion, stratified by SLCO1B1*5 genotype.</detailed_description>
