	<brief_summary>Ticagrelor is one of 3 anti-platelet medications used in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to prevent further clot formation and further ischemic damage to myocardial tissue. Overall benefits of one drug over the other is neutral in this generally unstable population. In pre-clinical trials, ticagrelor showed secondary effects, involving the release of adenosine to heart muscle where the demand for blood was increased due to a stress condition. Blood flow was increased, potentially preventing potential damage. This study will compare ticagrelor, currently only approved for use in ACS patients, against clopidogrel by measuring the myocardial blood flow(MBF) during stress to validate this phenomenon. The effect on blood flow will be measurable by using two specific doses of adenosine as the pharmacologic stress and correlating with measurements of blood flow using positron emission tomography (PET) nuclear imaging. This study hypothesizes that the increase in MBF during intermediate dose adenosine infusion will be greater in ticagrelor treated subjects compared to clopidogrel treated subjects</brief_summary>
