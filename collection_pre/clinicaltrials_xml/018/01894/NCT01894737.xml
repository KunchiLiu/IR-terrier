	<brief_title>The Effect of Creatine on Muscle Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seven days of one-legged knee immobilisation in young subjects with creatine or Placebo supplementation. A randomly selected leg is immobilized for seven days. Muscle mass and strength will be determined and muscle biopsies will be collected before and immediately after immobilisation. A week after the cast is removed we will assess any differences in recovery between intervention groups.</detailed_description>
