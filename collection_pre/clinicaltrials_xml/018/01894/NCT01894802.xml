	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using two CRS Arrays (microelectrodes) for long-term recording of brain motor cortex activity and microstimulation of brain sensory cortex.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cortical Recording and Stimulating Array Brain-Machine Interface</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with tetraplegia (paralysis caused by illness or injury that results in partial or total loss of the use of the arms and legs) have intact brain function but are unable to move due to injury or disease affecting the spinal cord, nerves or muscles. Brain-machine interface (BMI) technology is based on the finding that with intact brain function, neural (nerve) signals are generated even though they do not reach the arms, hands and legs. By placing (implanting) sensors on the surface of the brain, individuals can be trained to send neural signals which are interpreted by a computer and translated to movement which can then be used to control a variety of devices or computer displays. Using neural activity to control an external device is referred to as a brain-machine interface (BMI) technology. In addition, areas of the brain that are involved in interpreting sensations from the arms, hands and legs remain functional after injury. It is therefore possible to send tiny electrical pulses through implanted arrays to mimic sensory input that would normally come from the arms, hands and legs. The investigators refer to this as "microstimulation."</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects must have limited or no ability to use both hands due to cervical spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke or spinal stroke. Individuals with tetraplegia must have less than grade 4 muscle strength in elbow extension and wrist extension and less than grade 2 strength in finger flexor and abduction on the contralateral side to the implant. We will include subjects with both complete and incomplete injuries. 2. Subjects must report that they are unable to perform functional activities with the hand contralateral to implantation. 3. Subjects must be over 1 year postinjury at time of implantation. In addition, subject must report no worsening in neurologic status (strength, sensation) for the previous 6 months. 4. Subjects must be between the ages of 2270 years old. Participants outside this age range may be at an increased surgical risk and increased risk of fatigue during BMI training. 5. Subjects must live within 1 hour of the University of Pittsburgh during the study or be willing to travel to the University of Pittsburgh at least once per week for BMI training. 6. If subjects do not live in the Pittsburgh area, they are expected to stay somewhere within 1 hour of the University of Pittsburgh for at least 18 months after enrollment. 7. Subjects must be able to communicate with the investigators in English because of the need to follow the instructions of the study team. 8. Subjects must show an understanding of the study goals and have the ability to follow simple directions as judged by the investigators 9. Subjects must have results that are within normal limits on neuropsychological and psychosocial assessment; psychosocial health and support will be assessed by interview with the psychologist. 10. Subjects must be able to activate distinct cortical areas during imagined or attempted movement tasks (i.e. hand movement and speaking or moving the mouth); this will be evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as part of screening. 11. Subjects must have a stable psychosocial support and caregivers who are able to perform the necessary daily care of the participant's skin and pedestal site. This requires that the subject identify a caregiver and a backup who have been in place for greater than 6 months and are able to provide needed physical and psychosocial support. This will be assessed by the sponsorinvestigator and study neurosurgeon. 12. Subjects must have a life expectancy greater than 18 months as assessed by the study investigator and neurosurgeon subinvestigator 13. Documentation of informed consent must be obtained from the participant or their legal representative. 1. Visual impairment such that extended viewing of a computer monitor would be difficult even with ordinary corrective lenses 2. Another serious disease(s) or disorder(s) that could affect ability to participate in this study (verified during preop anesthesia evaluation to determine surgical risk status) 3. Recent history of pressure sores that could be exacerbated by 12 days of bed rest 4. Metallic implant(s) that would prohibit the subject from having an fMRI scan; spinal fixators are generally nonferrous and would not exclude someone from participating in the study 5. Any type of implantable generator such as a pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator, cochlear implant, deep brain stimulator (DBS), DBS leads, vagus nerve stimulator, or defibrillator 6. Women of childbearing age who are pregnant, lactating, or plan to become pregnant during the next 25 months 7. Allergy to contrast medium or kidney failure that could be exacerbated by contrast agent (for MRI) 8. Subjects receiving medications (such as sedatives) chronically that may retard motor coordination and cognitive ability 9. Individuals who require routine MRI, therapeutic ultrasound, or diathermy 10. Individuals with osteomyelitis 11. Severe skin disorder that causes excessive skin sloughing, lesions or breakdown of the scalp 12. History of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest or with intractable cardiac arrhythmias 13. Individuals with an implanted hydrocephalus shunt 14. Individuals who have had a stroke caused by a surgical procedure 15. Active infection(s) or unexplained fever (verified during preop anesthesia evaluation to determine surgical risk status) 16. Consumption of more than 1 alcoholic beverage per day on average 17. Receiving chronic oral or intravenous steroids or immunosuppressive therapy 18. Active cancer within the past year (other than adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer) or require chemotherapy 19. Uncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus 20. Uncontrolled autonomic dysreflexia within the past 3 months (for those with spinal cord injury) 21. Individuals with seizure disorders currently being treated with antiepileptic medications and individuals with a familial history of seizure disorders 22. Individuals who have attempted suicide in the past 12 months 23. Individuals who are immunosuppressed or who have conditions that typically result in immunocompromise (including, but not limited to: ataxiatelangiectasia, cancer, ChediakHigashi syndrome, combined immunodeficiency disease, complement deficiencies, DiGeorge syndrome, HIV/AIDS, hypogammaglobulinemia, Job syndrome, leukocyte adhesion defects, malnutrition, panhypogammaglobulinemia, Bruton disease, congenital agammaglobulinemia, selective deficiency of IgA and WiscottAldrich syndrome) 24. Individuals who have had previous neurosurgical intervention involving the frontal lobes (especially the motor cortex) and/or parietal lobe (especially the somatosensory cortex) that is likely to impact the viability of an intracortical electrode 25. Individuals with active psychiatric concerns, including but not limited to major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder 26. Individuals with substance abuse within 6 months of study participation</criteria>
