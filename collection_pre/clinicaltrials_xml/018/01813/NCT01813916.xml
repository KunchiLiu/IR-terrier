	<brief_title>Identification and Characterization of the Biomarker in Synovial Fluid for Hyaluronic Acid Therapy in Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intra-articular injection with HA is an accepted therapy for OA. However, the exact regulation of HA treatment is unclear. Compared the expression SF proteome from OA patients who received HA/800 treatment or not (post and pre-HA treatment) may be possible to identify the protein that response to the HA treatment and apply this to prognosis of OA. We used two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of light mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) to determine the differentially displayed proteins in human SF. Finally, we used Western blotting and ELISA analysis to validate the potential biomarkers.</detailed_description>
