	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of ARGX-110, an antibody that binds CD70, in patients with advanced malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b Study of ARGX-110 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 study conducted in patients whose tumors express the target of interest. PK, PD, biomarkers will be determined to support dose selection.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age ≥18 years. Written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedure, willing and able to comply with protocolspecified procedures and scheduled evaluations. Histological diagnosis of CD70 antigen positive malignancies refractory to, or relapsing after standard therapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1. Adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.0 x 109/L; haemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L; platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal [ULN]; alanine transaminase [ALT] ≤ 3 x ULN or ≤ 5 x ULN for patients with liver metastases; serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the ULN). Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. History or clinical evidence of neoplastic central nervous system (CNS) involvement. History of another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 1 year. Systemic glucocorticoid administration at doses greater than physiological replacement within 4 weeks of ARGX110 first dose administration. Major surgery within 4 weeks of ARGX110 first dose administration. Prior chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy with curative intent, or any experimental therapy within 4 weeks of ARGX110 first dose administration. Unresolved grade 3 or 4 toxicity from prior therapy, including experimental therapy. Active, untreated viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, persistent hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Any clinical finding, including psychiatric and behavioral problems, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes the patient from safely participating in the study. Childbearing potential unless using an adequate measure of contraception. Pregnancy or lactation. History of hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins.</criteria>
