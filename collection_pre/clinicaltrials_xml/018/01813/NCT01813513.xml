	<brief_summary>The purpose of this 3-part study is to evaluate the potential impact of simeprevir and food on pharmacokinetics (PK) of IDX719 in healthy participants. Part 1 will evaluate potential PK interactions between IDX719 and simeprevir. Part 2 will evaluate the effect of food on the PK of IDX719 in combination with simeprevir. Part 3 will evaluate the impact of high- versus low-fat meals on the PK of IDX719.</brief_summary>
