	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if testing for genes related to pain and pain management before surgery affects how patients are treated for pain after surgery. The investigators want to know if this information will be used to effectively treat patients for pain after surgery if the clinical staff have a chance to review it before the surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preemptive Genotyping and Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: To determine the feasibility of preemptive (preoperative) cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP2D6) testing and the variability of clinical measures (postoperative) in children whose opioid selection and dosing is influenced by preemptive CYP2D6 testing compared to children whose pain management does not include CYP2D6 preemptive testing. Results from this pilot study will inform a future study investigating the utility of preemptive pharmacogenomic testing in children at risk for requiring inpatient acute pain management with opioids.</detailed_description>
