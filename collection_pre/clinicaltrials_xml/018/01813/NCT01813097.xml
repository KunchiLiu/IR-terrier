	<brief_summary>Patients with prostate cancer should have the following examination including biopsy, serum PSA volume, prostate CT scan or MRI, bone scan, abdomen ultrasound, chest X ray, blood biochemistry, blood rout, ECG and testosterone. Two groups: First group:30 cases should be treated with iodine 125 seed implants 0.5 mc transperineal prostate implant +Zoladex 3.6mg im 1/28d (LHRH agonist, 3.6mg subcutaneous injection 1/4weeks). Second group: 30 cases should be treated with Zoladex 3.6mg im 1/28d (LHRH agonist, 3.6mg subcutaneous injection 1/4weeks). PFS and PSA level will be the primary variables.</brief_summary>
