	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate whether low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) lowering with Evolocumab (AMG 145) results in greater change from baseline in percent atheroma volume (PAV) at week 78 than placebo in subjects with coronary artery disease taking lipid lowering therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical indication for coronary angiography Subjects already taking statin therapy, niacin or ezetimibe at screening must have been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening LDLC. Subjects not taking lipidregulating therapy must enter the study via a lipid stabilization period. Subjects who are intolerant to statins must meet statin intolerance entry criteria Fasting LDLC ≥ 80 mg/dL (2.07 mmol/L) with or without additional risk factors, or, LDLC ≥ 60 &lt;80 mg/dL (1.552.07 mmol/L) in the presence of one major or three minor risk factors Subjects must meet the following criteria at the qualifying coronary catheterization procedure: Evidence of coronary heart disease (at least one lesion in a native coronary artery that has &gt;20% reduction in lumen diameter) or prior PCI Left main coronary artery &lt;50% reduction in lumen diameter by visual estimation Target Coronary Artery for IVUS must be accessible to the IVUS catheter, must not have a &gt;50% reduction in lumen diameter within the target segment (and at least 40mm in length); cannot have undergone prior PCI or CABG and is not a candidate for intervention over the next 18 months. It may not be a bypass graft, bypassed vessel or culprit vessel for previous MI. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery &lt; 6 weeks prior to the qualifying IVUS NYHA III or IV heart failure, or last known left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30% Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia that is not controlled by medications in the 3 months prior to randomization Known hemorrhagic stroke Uncontrolled hypertension at randomization Fasting Triglycerides ≥ 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) at screening Type 1 diabetes or poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 9%) at screening. Moderate to severe renal dysfunction (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2) at screening.</criteria>
