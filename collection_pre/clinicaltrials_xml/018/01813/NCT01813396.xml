	<brief_summary>First, the purpose of the first year study will examine the joint capsule/muscular and shoulder physical activity hypotheses related to ROM deficits as well as functional disability in subjects with Stiff shoulders. Second, the purpose of the second and third year study will investigate the long-term effect of 12-week joint mobilization, 12-week joint mobilization plus soft tissue mobilization/massage, and 12-week joint mobilization plus soft tissue mobilization/massage with appropriate shoulder physical activity guide on subjects with Stiff shoulders. Subjects: First year: thirty subjects with Stiff shoulders will be recruited. Second and third years: forty-five subjects with Stiff shoulders for one year follow-up. Methods: For the measurement outcomes; functional disability, rotation range of motion, joint mobility, muscle stiffness, and shoulder physical activity will be measured by self-reported Flexi-level Scale of Shoulder Function or performance-based motion analysis, goniometer, uni-axis load cell and electromagnetic tracking sensor, myotonometer, and accelerometers, respectively.</brief_summary>
