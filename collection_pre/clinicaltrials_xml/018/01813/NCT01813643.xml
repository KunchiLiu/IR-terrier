	<brief_summary>Methamphetamine-associated psychosis (MAP) has been considered a pharmacological or environmental pathogen model of schizophrenia (SCZ) due in part to similarities in clinical presentation (i.e. paranoia, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms), response to treatment (e.g.neuroleptics),and pathologic mechanisms (e.g. central dopaminergic neurotransmission) of both conditions. Both risperidone and aripiprazole are second generation antipsychoticsï¼Œbut have different pharmacological effects of antipsychotic treatment.This study was designed to examine the acute efficacy, safety, and tolerability of risperidone and aripiprazole for patients with MAP.</brief_summary>
