	<brief_summary>Recent pharmacotherapy research in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has successfully focused on treatment of co-occurring symptoms, including inattention, hyperactivity, and irritability that commonly occur in persons with ASD. Despite over two decades of significant pharmacotherapy research, to date no medication has been shown in controlled trials to enhance the core social deficits of ASD. Based upon findings describing the neurobiology of ASD combined with our preliminary results, we believe the novel drug acamprosate will show evidence of reducing social skills deficits associated with ASD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Acamprosate in Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject with ASD will receive 10 weeks of blinded treatment with acamprosate or matching placebo. After completion of the double-blind phase, all subjects will have an opportunity to receive acamprosate as part of the study procedures for 16 weeks.</detailed_description>
