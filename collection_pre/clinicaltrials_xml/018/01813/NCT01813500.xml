	<brief_summary>The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic conditions affecting approximately 1.4 million Americans. The burden of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), a frequent cause of infectious diarrhea is mediated by toxins A and B and is increasing faster in IBD patients, than the general population. Clinically, CDI in patients with IBD leads to a range of clinical syndromes from symptomless carriage, to severe life threatening colitis, colectomy and death. This pilot study will look at the relationship between IBD and this variable host immune response. Clostridium difficile colonization (asymptomatic carrier state) is lower in the IBD population than in the general population. In the general population, high antitoxin titers have been linked with colonization and low antitoxin titers with recurrent disease. The investigators hypothesize that patients with IBD will have a lower Clostridium difficile colonization and will have lower antibody titers than the control group. Additionally those with lower titers will have an increased risk of developing CDI. In Aim 1 the investigators will determine Clostridium colonization in IBD subjects by stool study (including CD, UC and UC patients after IPAA) compared to non-IBD subjects (controls). In Aim 2 the investigators will compare antitoxin titers in these IBD subjects compared to controls. In Aim 3 the investigators will follow these subjects for 12 months and calculate the incidence of CDI in patients with IBD compared to controls and associations with anti-toxin titers.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. All subjects must be 18 years of age or older, able to provide written informed consent, and able to comply with the requirements of the study. 2. All subjects must speak English. NonEnglish subjects are not included because of lack of funding for interpreter services and clinical resources could not be used for research purposes. 3. For Control Group only: NonIBD subject seen in CDD during routine visit or on inpatient consult service 4. For IBD Group Only: Chart history of IBD (either UC or CD) confirmed by colonoscopy, pathology or gastroenterology clinical judgment 1. Any subject planning on moving out of the area in the next year 2. Any patient not able to give informed consent 3. Any subject unwilling or not able to give stool sample upon enrollment</criteria>
