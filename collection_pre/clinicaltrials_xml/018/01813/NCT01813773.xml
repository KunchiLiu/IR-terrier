Prior treatment with triamcinolone in the study eye within 180 days of baseline. Prior treatment with dexamethasone in the study eye within 30 days prior to baseline. Intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) in the study eye within 60 days preceding baseline History of vitrectomy surgery in the study eye. Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the study eye Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either eye Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as IOP â‰¥ 25 mmHg despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication) History of cerebral vascular accident, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks within 180 days of study enrollment. History of allergy to fluorescein, topical antibiotic, povidone iodine (Betadine) or aflibercept. Presence of vitreous hemorrhage that completely obstructs the view of the optic nerve (amount of vitreous hemorrhage will also be gated by 20/320 criteria) Presence of TRD in the study eye. Presence of preretinal fibrosis (not including epiretinal membrane) Unwilling to discontinue sperm bank donation for any period of time after IAI treatment</criteria>
