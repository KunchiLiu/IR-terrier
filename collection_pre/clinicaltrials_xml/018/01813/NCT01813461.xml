The subject has had nuclear medicine procedures, computed tomography scans, or significant xrays (other than dental) within the past 12 months, has had significant occupational radiation exposure, or participated in a radiolabeled study within the last 6 months or participated in more than one radiolabeled study within the last 12 months. The subject has a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibodies at Screening or is known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The subject has/had a symptomatic, viral, bacterial (including upper respiratory infection), or fungal (noncutaneous) infection within 1 week prior to clinic admission on Day 1. The subject has received a vaccination within the last 30 days prior to study drug administration. The subject has a known or suspected allergy to any of the azole class of compounds, or a history of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods (as judged by the Investigator), or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions. The subject has used tobacco or nicotine containing products in the last 6 months. The subject has had treatment with prescription drugs or complementary and alternative medicines within 14 days prior to Day 1, or overthecounter medication within 1 week prior to Day 1, with the exception of occasional use of acetaminophen up to 2 g/day. The subject has participated in any interventional clinical study or has received any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to the initiation of Screening. The subject has had any significant blood loss, donated one unit (450 mL) of blood or more, or received a transfusion of any blood or blood products within 60 days or donated plasma within 7 days prior to clinic admission on Day 1. The subject has taken part in strenuous exercise within 3 days prior to dosing on Day 1. The subject anticipates an inability to abstain from caffeine or alcohol use for 48 hours prior to clinic admission on Day 1 and throughout the duration of the study; or from grapefruit, grapefruit juice, star fruit, or Seville oranges or any products containing these items from 72 hours prior to clinic admission on Day 1 and throughout the duration of the study. The subject has a recent history (within the last 2 years) of drug or alcohol abuse or a positive drug screen.</criteria>
