	<brief_summary>Evidence suggests that a diet rich in plant phenolic compounds may induce beneficial vascular effects. Coffee is a good source of phenolic compounds called chlorogenic acids (CGA), however the level of CGA is reduced during the roasting process. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of coffee roasting on vascular response. The investigators hypothesize that coffee roasted to a lesser extent will exert a favourable vascular response over more heavily roasted coffee due to the higher levels of CGA.</brief_summary>
