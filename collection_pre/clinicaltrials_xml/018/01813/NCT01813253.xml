	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study of Nimotuzumab and Irinotecan as Second Line With Advanced or Recurrect Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, open-label, Japan, Korea and Taiwan collaborative, phase 3 study will evaluate overall survival of nimotuzumab in combination with irinotecan compared to irinotecan alone in subjects with EGFR overexpressed advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive irinotecan (control group) or nimotuzumab and irinotecan (combination group). Nimotuzumab and/or irinotecan should be continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Nimotuzumab is administered at 400 mg once weekly as an intravenous infusion and irinotecan is administered at 150 mg/m2 once every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion.</detailed_description>
