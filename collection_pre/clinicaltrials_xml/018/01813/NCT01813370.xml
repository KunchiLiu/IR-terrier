	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to continue follow-up on patients who were treated on the study called TAX 3505 (MSK IRB #07-101). The sponsor of this study, has decided to end the study early, before all patients have completed all planned follow-up tests. As a result, the investigators do not yet know whether hormonal therapy alone, or in combination with docetaxel, is better at preventing prostate cancer recurrence in patients who had a rising PSA after prostatectomy. This study will continue following patients according to a schedule that is similar to that found in the TAX 3503 (MSK IRB #07-101) study in order to answer that question. This study is known as a registry study. The patients' will not receive any treatment as part of this study. Instead, they will be asked to have a blood test performed once every 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
