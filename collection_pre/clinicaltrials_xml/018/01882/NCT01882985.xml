	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with lycopene works in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer not previously treated with chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs, such as lycopene, to keep cancer from forming. Giving docetaxel together with lycopene may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Plus Lycopene in Castration Resistant, Chemotherapy-Na√Øve Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To define the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate according to the criteria of Bubley, et al., in subjects treated with a combination of docetaxel and lycopene. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients with measurable disease, following treatment with docetaxel and lycopene. II. To define the time to PSA progression, according to the response criteria of Scher, et al., in subjects treated with docetaxel and lycopene. III. To determine the safety and tolerability of lycopene in combination with docetaxel. IV. To determine the effects of docetaxel + lycopene therapy on the functioning of the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFRI), selected biomarkers, and docetaxel blood levels in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (correlative studies). OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 2 and lycopene orally (PO) once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
