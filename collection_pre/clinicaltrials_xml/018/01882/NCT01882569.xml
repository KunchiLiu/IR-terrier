	<brief_summary>Surgical trauma triggers a massive inflammatory response. Over time, both the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system are affected by surgical trauma. The purpose of this study is to use a single cell flow cytometry approach to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the inflammatory response to surgical trauma.</brief_summary>
