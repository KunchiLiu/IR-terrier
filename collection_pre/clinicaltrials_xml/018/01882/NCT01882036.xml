	<brief_title>Bariatric Surgery And Adipose Inflammation Dysfunction and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the effects of bariatric surgery on Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Type 2 diabetes is the improvement in fasting glucose and insulin levels following the Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) independent of weight loss. Changes in glucose metabolism are seen within days after surgery, prior to any significant weight loss--raising the question of a difference between dietary restriction and early food intake after the RYGB as it relates to insulin resistance. A major factor in the development of insulin resistance is obesity. It has been noted that by 3 months following Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery in obese patients with (T2DM), fasting glucose and insulin levels are improved independent of weight loss, insulin resistance in muscle is lowered, and that the pro-inflammatory profile of resident microphages is lowered improving insulin sensitivity. The focus of this proposal is to define the mechanism by which bariatric surgery improves glucose homeostasis in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Our long-term goal is to correlate these changes with direct measures of adipose tissue insulin resistance to develop novel immunotherapies towards reducing insulin resistance without surgery. Our central hypothesis is that drastically reduced caloric intake early after RYGP improves the pro-inflammatory profile of macrophages improving insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1. Recruit a patient population and measure insulin sensitivity using homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) to measure insulin resistance (IR), cytokines, incretins, and serum adipokines in morbidly obese patients • prior to and 7-10 days following RYGB surgery while on a hypocaloric diet (surgery group) and •prior to and 7-10 days while following hypocaloric diet similar to RYGB (diet group). Subjects will be randomly assigned to the two arms; subjects assigned to the hypocaloric diet will be offered RYGB after completion of the diet. Specific Aim 2. - Profile inflammatory macrophages, T cells and secreted factors (incretins ?) in subcutaneous adipose tissue of patients prior to and following RYGB and hypocaloric diet treatments. • prior to and 7-10 days following RYGB (surgery group?) - prior to and 7-10 days following hypocaloric diet similar to RYGB group (diet group?) Specific Aim 3. Assess the effects of RYGB on ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, expression of transcription factors and enzymes of mitochondrial biogenesis, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and protein carbonylation in patients prior to and following RYGB surgery and in diet subjects maintained on hypocaloric diet. Specific Aim 4. Determine the impact of bariatric surgery on lipolysis and the role of TLQP-21 (a genetically derived peptide that increases energy expenditure and prevents the early phase of diet-induced obesity). Rationale: Lipolysis is a central feature of adipocyte biology. It is currently unclear if bariatric surgery can modulate basal and stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes. Additionally, Bartlomucci had demonstrated that the murine (mouse) version of TLQP-21 enhances lipolysis in adipocytes. Batolomucci has shown that the human version of TLQP-21 shows a lower biological activity on its human receptor compared to the mouse version.</detailed_description>
