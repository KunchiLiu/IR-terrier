	<brief_summary>A prospective, opened, multicentric, randomised, phase III trial with two arms: - Arm A: curative gastrectomy with D1-D2 lymph node dissection + HIPEC with oxaliplatin - Arm B: curative gastrectomy with D1-D2 lymph node dissection Main objective: Compare overall 5-year survival rates in patients surgically treated for advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (T3, T4 and/or N+ and/or with positive peritoneal cytology), treated either with curative gastrectomy and adjuvant HIPEC, or with curative gastrectomy alone.</brief_summary>
