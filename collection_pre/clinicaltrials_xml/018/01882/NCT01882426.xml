	<brief_title>Care Path for the Management of Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Step-care based on symptomatic response remains the overwhelming algorithm of choice in clinical practice. Many subjects receive infliximab only as a last resort, when the subject is very ill and has failed repeated attempts of corticosteroid induction therapy. Although this situation is far from ideal, to change such entrenched physician behavior will require compelling evidence that Step-care results in inferior outcomes to earlier introduction of effective therapy. Based on these considerations, we will perform a cluster randomization trial in which 40 gastroenterology practices will be randomly assigned to a treatment algorithm featuring the early use of combination therapy, treatment intensification guided by objective assessments of inflammation and the use of remission as a therapeutic goal or a conventional Step-care approach.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Females of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to randomization, and must use a hormonal (oral, implantable or injectable) or barrier method of birth control throughout the study. Females unable to bear children must have documentation of such in the source records Documented diagnosis of UC with a Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) â‰¥6 and a baseline Mayo Endoscopy Score &gt;2. Either an elevated serum Creactive protein (CRP) (above the Upper Level of Normal (ULN) according to local laboratory results) or elevated fecal calprotectin (&gt; 250 mg/kg) concentration. Requires sigmoidoscopic evaluation at baseline (standard of care) Written informed consent must be obtained and documented. Ability of subject to participate fully in all aspects of this clinical trial in the opinion of the investigator. Previous failure of TNF antagonist therapy Received any investigational drug in the past 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer. Pregnant or lactating women. Any conditions (e.g., history of alcohol or substance abuse) which in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with study procedures.</criteria>
