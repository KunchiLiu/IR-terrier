	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess efficacy aflibercept + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/levofolinate/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) by objective response rate (ORR). Secondary Objective: To assess the following: - safety profile; - progression free survival (PFS); - overall survival (OS); - pharmacokinetics (PK); - immunogenicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Aflibercept in Combination With FOLFIRI in Patients With Second-Line Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening was up to 24 days. Treatment period was continued until DP, unacceptable toxicity, or participant's refusal. Follow up period was continued until death, participant's refusal, or end of study, whichever came first. This trial was conducted in Japan, where the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) designation for the study molecule is "aflibercept" and this term is therefore used throughout the synopsis. In the US, the US proper name is "ziv-aflibercept".</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. Metastatic disease that was not amenable to potentially curative treatment.

Less than 28 days elapsed from prior radiotherapy, prior surgery, or prior chemotherapy to the time of registration. Unresolved toxicity (grade &gt;1) from prior anticancer therapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &gt;1. Brain metastases, uncontrolled spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis. Other prior malignancy. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Uncontrolled hypertension. Inadequate bone marrow function, liver function, or renal function.
