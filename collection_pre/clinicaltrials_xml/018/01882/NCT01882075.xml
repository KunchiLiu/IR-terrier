	<brief_title>Closed-loop Fluid Administration System: Pilot Study to Evaluate Feasibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimization of the cardiac output is an important goal during anesthesia to decrease the postoperative morbidity, mortality and the care costs. We want to test if the closed-loop fluid administration is feasible. Two groups will be compared. In all cases: - anesthesia will be provided by a closed-loop which aim is to maintain bispectral index between 40 and 60 using propofol and remifentanil. This method permits to have similar depths of anesthesia in all cases. - cardiac output will be continuously monitored by LidCO. In one group, fluid replacement is decided by the physician; in the other, fluid replacement is automated using a closed-loop system.</detailed_description>
