	<brief_summary>The high incidence of burn injuries and mortality and morbidity as well as the high economic impact associated with this type of injury justifying the need to develop new technologies for the treatment of burn patients. Electrical stimulation for wound healing is a resource that has been increasingly used in routine physical therapists, but has the disadvantage of needing means of wet contact between the electrode and injury. The other resource used for therapeutic healing is conventional electrical stimulation of low intensity for capacitive field, a technique of physical therapy intervention not commercially available in Brazil. This new technology seems to have significant physiological effects in tissue repair and has been used for the treatment of chronic wounds which healed with difficulty. The objective is to analyze the effects of electrical stimulation of low intensity for capacitive field in healing skin burns. Patients from both genders aged over 18 years who have burns, will be evaluated and treated at the Emergency Unit of the Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo. The stimulation will be initiated within 24 hours after surgery to perform the graft and will be held daily for 60 minutes during the patient's stay or until complete healing of the skin. The electromagnetic field will be placed on the care of the burned area and / or the donor skin graft, not interfering with departmental procedures. Will be performed photographic record standardized wound by a digital camera, and then quantified by a computer program. Expected to reduce the period of hospitalization and thus lowering the cost of treatment, and the possibility of improving the quality of life of patients.</brief_summary>
