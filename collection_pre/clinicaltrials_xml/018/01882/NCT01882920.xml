	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess whether in cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) the use of a protocol of intravenous fluid therapy combined with goal directed fluid therapy (GDT) is associated with a significant change in morbidity, length of hospital stay and mortality compared to a standard fluid therapy. Patients undergoing CRS and hipec are randomly divided into two treatment groups. The GDT group receive fluid intravenous therapy according to a specific treatment protocol guided by monitored hemodynamic parameters assessed using the arterial pressure signal monitoring to assess stroke volume and cardiac output via an automated pulse contour analysis (Flotrac/VigileoÂ®); the control group receive the standard fluid therapy (crystalloid and colloid). Fluid therapy regimen is free in the control group and targeted in the GDT group. In both groups, the investigators evaluate the incidence of major abdominal and systemic complications, the total duration of hospital stay, mortality, the total amount of fluids administered, their breakdown (crystalloid/colloid) and the total number of colloid boluses administered.</brief_summary>
