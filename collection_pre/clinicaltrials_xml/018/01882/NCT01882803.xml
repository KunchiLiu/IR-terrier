	<brief_summary>Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IPI-145 as a monotherapy in subjects with iNHL (Follicular Lymphoma, Marginal Zone Lymphoma, or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma) that is refractory to rituximab and to either chemotherapy or RIT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study of Duvelisib in Subjects With Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (DYNAMO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single arm safety and efficacy study of IPI-145 administered orally to subjects who have been diagnosed with iNHL (Follicular Lymphoma, Marginal Zone Lymphoma, or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma) whose disease is refractory to rituximab and to either chemotherapy or RIT. Approximately 120 subjects will receive 25 mg IPI-145 BID over the course of 28-day treatment cycles for up to 13 cycles. After completing 13 treatment cycles of IPI-145, subjects may continue to receive additional cycles of IPI-145 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However, to receive additional cycles of IPI-145 beyond 13 cycles, subjects must have evidence of response (CR or PR) according to the IWG criteria1 by the end of Cycle 13.</detailed_description>
