	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years old Able to provide informed consent Patients with unifocal or multifocal BE with HGD or IMCA who have failed at least 2 serial RFA therapy. Patients who refused esophagectomy or deemed inoperable or whose BE dysplasia is not amenable to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) treatment alone due to: (1) extensive multifocal lesions (2) severe coagulopathy or any medical condition deemed high risk for EMR (3) patient refuses EMR Patients with a nodular BE lesions may undergo clinicallyindicated EMR and still be eligible for enrollment as long as they have BEHGD lesion/s that are still candidate for ablative treatment Age younger than 18 years old Life expectancy less than 12 months Pregnancy Presence of esophageal varices Esophageal stricture precluding passage of an endoscope and suction tubing Any procedure that has impeded normal gastric emptying or limited gastric volume distention, including but not limited to gastric bypass, stomach stapling, gastrojejunostomy or any disease state has significantly reduced the elasticity in the GI tract (e.g. Marfan's syndrome, Scleroderma or any Connective Tissue Disease) Esophageal cancer (T2 and above)</criteria>
