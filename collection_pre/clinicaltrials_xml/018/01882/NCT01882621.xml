	<brief_title>Monosialoganglioside(GM1) Preventing Neurotoxicity Induced by Cisplatin Contained Chemotherapy in NSCLC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NSCLC patients received a cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy are included in this trial. Patients are randomly assigned into the experimental group and control group based on segmented block randomized method. After enrollment, patients should complete four or six chemotherapy and GM1/placebo injection. During the 3w per cycle chemotherapy, cisplatin injection is conducted in D1/D1-3, GM1/placebo (80mg+250ml N.S) is injected from D0 to D3. Neurotoxicity evaluation and quality of life (FACT-NTX and EROTC scale) assessment will be conducted every cycle and 3w/11w/19w after the chemotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cytological and histological confirmation of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis, single sputum cytology diagnosis is not accepted Expected survival period is more than 3 months Enough blood function reservation: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 2 x 10E9/L or higher;platelet count 100 x 109 /L or higher;hemoglobin 9 g/dL or higher. Enough liver function reservation:the total bilirubin less than upper limit of normal;AST and ALT acuities were less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN);Alkaline phosphatase 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or less. Clinical doctors identify patients suitable for standard doses of ganglioside drug therapy, and expected time of medication is at least six weeks Within 4 weeks before treatment, did not receive other adverse reaction of drugs may cause similar neurotoxicity; 18 weeks before, did not received platinumbased drugs chemical treatment. No more than 1 degree of the peripheral nervous system diseases exists before enrollment, also no other symptom or disease could affect the adverse reactions of neurotoxicity pathological. Can't accept other adverse reactions may prevent neurotoxicity treatment or care after enrollment. Sign the informed consent form. Patients with poor general condition, PS score more than 2 points Women in pregnancy or lactation Patients (male or female) have fertility possibility but not willing to or not to adopt effective contraception With other neurological dysfunction which can cause inaccurate record of the occurrence of neurotoxicity and severity Known or assignment of any of these products to test drugs allergic agent composition Doctors think inappropriate for patients with ganglioside medication or estimated time of less than 6 weeks Active infection (determined by the researcher) According to the researcher's judgment, there is serious disease to endanger the safety of patients, or may prevent the patients from completing the study Have a clear history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy or dementia</criteria>
