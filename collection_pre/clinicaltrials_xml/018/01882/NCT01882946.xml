	<brief_summary>The study comprises a Phase I component during which the optimal dose of DCVax-Direct for the treatment of solid tissue tumors will be identified, followed by a Phase II component to determine if the injection of DCVax-Direct into selected solid tissue tumors has the ability to reduce tumor growth.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (summary): Age between 18 and 75 years (inclusive) at screening. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of 70 or higher or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 01 at screening. Subjects with a histological or cytopathological confirmed diagnosis of a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancy for which primary treatment is no longer effective or does not offer curative or lifeprolonging potential per clinician judgment, with the understanding that DCVaxDirect is not intended as a treatment of last resort. Not eligible for complete resection due to either tumor location, physician's assessment or subject's choice. Must have completed at least one recent treatment regimen in the metastatic or advanced setting in the disease currently under treatment to reduce tumor burden. Any steroid therapy &gt;2 mg dexamethasone or equivalent dose should be stopped or have been tapered down 2 weeks prior to the leukapheresis. At least one measurable tumor mass, i.e. a lesion that can accurately be measured by CT/MRI in at least one dimension with longest diameter ≥ 1 cm, that is accessible for injection either with or without imaging (CT/ultrasound) guidance. Adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal function, Adequate blood coagulation parameters Life expectation of &gt;3 months. Exclusion Criteria (Summary): Positive HIV1, HIV2, or Human Tlymphotropic virus (HTLVI/II) tests. History of current or prior (within the last two years) active clinically significant malignancy other than the tumor type for which DCVaxDirect treatment is considered, and except for primary tumor in the case of metastases and adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer. Heavily pretreated (HP) subjects are not eligible for this study, unless treatments have occurred more than 1 year in the past. Presence of brain metastases, unless treated surgically and/or irradiated and clinically stable off steroids or on low dose (&lt; 2 mg per day) steroids for ≥ 14 days, or presence of leptomeningeal disease. History of immunodeficiency or unresolved autoimmune disease. Requirement for ongoing immunosuppressants. Prior active immunotherapy for cancer within the past 2 years. Ongoing medical need for continuous anticoagulation or antiplatelet medication. Known genetic cancersusceptibility syndromes. Acute or active uncontrolled infection Ongoing fever ≥ 101.5 degrees F/38.6 degrees C at screening. Unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as unstable angina, uncontrolled arrhythmias, Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis etc. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant or lactating or who are not using adequate contraception (surgical, hormonal or double barrier, i.e. condom and diaphragm). Allergy or anaphylaxis to any of the reagents used in this study. Inability to obtain informed consent because of psychiatric or complicating medical problems. Inability or unwillingness to return for required visits and followup exams.</criteria>
