	<brief_summary>A study with an 8 week open label phase study followed by a year long placebo controlled maintenance phase in subjects with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC), with a modified Mayo Score 4-10 and an endoscopy subscore of 2-3, taking mesalamine (or equivalent) as a concomitant medication. Subjects are required to be in clinical remission or clinical response to enter the year long maintenance phase. This study will help evaluate if HMPL-004 is effective in subjects maintaining clinical remission following successful induction therapy achieving clinical remission or clinical response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Maintenance Placebo Controlled Maintenance Trial Of HMPL-004 in Subjects With Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A two-phase multi-center study with an open label 8-week induction phase and a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled maintenance phase to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HMPL-004 for a 52-week maintenance therapy in adults with mild to moderate UC and who have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to mesalamine treatment. The study participants will consist of subjects who have completed either the HMPL-004-03 or HMPL-004-05 induction study, complemented by the enrollment of additional subjects in the open label induction phase who meet the entry criteria of this study. . Subjects entering this maintenance study from one of the HMPL-004 induction studies will have their modified Mayo baseline score from that study as their baseline score for this study. All subjects enrolled in the open label induction phase of the study will be re-evaluated for clinical response and remission after the 8-week open label 2400 mg HMPL-004 treatment period. Clinical responders and remitters will be randomized 2:1 (HMPL-004: placebo) to HMPL-004 1800 mg/day or placebo group for the 52-week maintenance phase of the study.</detailed_description>

Subjects must be currently receiving mesalamine ≥ 2.4 g/day (or the equivalent) for at least 6 weeks prior to randomization and on a stable dosage for at least 2 weeks prior to entering the screening phase of the study to ensure a stable dose is established at least 2 weeks prior to the endoscopic procedures. 3.

Subjects with intolerance to mesalamine (or equivalent medications). 2. Diagnosed with Crohn's disease or with lesions such as fistulas or granulomas on biopsy noted either in history or at baseline endoscope, which would be suspicious for Crohn's disease, or with a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis. 3.

Use of Inflammatory Bowel Disease related herbal supplements including supplements containing andrographis or the use of probiotics two weeks prior to study entry or during the study. 7. Toxic megacolon or toxic colitis. 8. Probable requirement for intestinal surgery within 12 weeks after the start of investigational product. 9. Receiving oral or rectal steroids within 1 month prior to study entry. 10. Receiving rectal mesalamine within 1 week prior to study entry. 11. Receiving azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine, methotrexate, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, or other immunosuppressive therapy at the time of screening or within the preceding 6 weeks. 12. Receiving antiTNFα agents such as infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, or certolizumab pegol at the time of screening or within the preceding 8 weeks. 13. Receiving other investigational drugs or biologics within 1 month or five halflives, whichever is longer. 14. Receiving antibiotics within 2 weeks of study entry. 15.
