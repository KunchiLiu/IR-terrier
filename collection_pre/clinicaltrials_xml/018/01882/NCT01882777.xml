	<brief_summary>DelAgua Health and Development, Manna Energy and the Rwanda Ministry of Health are collaborating on a project financed by carbon credits that will distribute household-based water filters and high-efficiency cook stoves to approximately 700,000 households in Rwanda. Prior to the full roll out of the campaign, the implementers are conducting a pilot project among 2000 households in western Rwanda. The objectives of this pilot evaluation are to document the delivery of the intervention to the intervention population, assess coverage and uptake of the intervention target households and conduct a 5-month randomised controlled trial among 500 households to assess the impact of the intervention on drinking water quality and indoor air quality.</brief_summary>
