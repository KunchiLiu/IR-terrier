	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the individual and combined effects of dark chocolate/cocoa and almonds on lipids, lipoproteins, antioxidant defense, lipid peroxidation, phenolic acids, inflammatory status, blood pressure and arterial health. It is hypothesized that dark chocolate/cocoa and/or almonds will favorably affect lipids, lipoproteins, antioxidants, inflammatory status, blood pressure and arterial health compared to a healthy American control diet; however, the effects will be greater when dark chocolate/cocoa and almonds are consumed together versus consumption of each food individually.</brief_summary>
