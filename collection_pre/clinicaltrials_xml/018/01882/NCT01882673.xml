	<brief_summary>The long-term goal of this program of research is to disseminate an effective, brief computer-based intervention that can be readily integrated into Substance Use Disorders (SUD) treatment programs to motivate tobacco quitline use in patients who smoke. The overall objective of this application, which is the first step in the attainment of this long-term goal, is to fully develop this computer-based intervention, modify it based on initial piloting and feedback to insure its feasibility and acceptability, and obtain preliminary data supporting the efficacy of the intervention. This will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to develop and conduct preliminary pilot testing (n=20) of a brief, computer-based intervention intended to motivate tobacco quitline use among cigarette smokers in SUD treatment (TIME-TQ; Tablet computer Intervention to Motivate Engagement in Tobacco Quitline use) and to develop and pilot test a computer-based, time matched control intervention (CON), 2) to conduct a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 60 smokers in SUD treatment, comparing TIME-TQ vs. CON, with predictions that TIME-TQ relative to CON will result in increased readiness, higher rates of tobacco treatment engagement, more quit smoking attempts and higher rates of 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Substance use outcomes over the course of the 3-month follow-up period will also be examined, and 3) to examine TIME-TQ's effects on key mechanisms during the computer session and their associations with tobacco treatment engagement and smoking outcomes at 1- and 3-month follow-ups.</brief_summary>
