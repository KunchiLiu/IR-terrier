	<detailed_description>This study will include pregnant women in either 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy. All consecutive pregnant patients in 2nd or 3rd trimester who will attend our unit for routine ultrasound exam will be asked to participate.

Accuracy would be defind as the delta of cervical length between abdominal and vaginal routs. BMI would be calculated prior to the ultrasound exam (by weighing and measuring all patients).</detailed_description>
