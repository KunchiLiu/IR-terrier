	<brief_summary>The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) combining with High-dose Dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), compared to conventional high-dose dexamethasone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) Combining Dexamethasone Versus High-dose Dexamethasone for Initial Treatment of Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, randomised controlled trial of 80 primary ITP adult patients from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. One part of the participants are randomly selected to receive All-Trans Retinoic Acid(10mg tablet by mouth every 8 hours a day for 12 consecutive weeks, combining with dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4 days, the others are selected to receive high-dose of dexamethasone treatment (given orally at a dose of 40 mg daily for 4 days). Patients were monitored every 1 to 3 days at the first two weeks and every 1 to 4 weeks afterwards for platelet counts, and were monitored every 1 month for transaminitis and other side effects</detailed_description>
