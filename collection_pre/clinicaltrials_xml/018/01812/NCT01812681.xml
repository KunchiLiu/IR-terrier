	<brief_summary>Experimental and observational studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk for non-bone diseases and/or abnormal development for the other systems of fetus. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between cord blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) concentrations and the subsequent risk of morbidities including RDS, PDA, NEC, BPD AND ROP in preterm infants.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It was shown that vitamin D play important role in the pathogenesis of long term morbidities of newborn. Experimental and observational studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk for non-bone diseases and/or abnormal development for the other systems of fetus. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between cord blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) concentrations and the subsequent risk of morbidities including RDS, PDA, NEC, BPD AND ROP in preterm infants.</detailed_description>
