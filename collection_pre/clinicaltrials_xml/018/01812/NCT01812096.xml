	<brief_summary>Intravenous injection is the standard administration route of bortezomib; however, subcutaneous administration is an important alternative. We want to compared the pharmacokinetic of subcutaneous versus intravenous bortezomib at the approved 1â€¢3 mg/m2 dose and twice per week,on days1, 4, 8 and 11 of 21-day cycles, schedule in newly diagnosed patients of multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Subcutaneous Versus Intravenous Administration of Bortezomib in Patients With Multiple Myeloma in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new diagnosed multiple myeloma patients are randomized to receive bortezomib by standard intravenous bolus (n=10) or subcutaneous injection (n=10) at the recommended dose and schedule (1.3 mg/m2), days 1, 4, 8, 11;eight 21-day cycles). Patients discontinued treatment due to progressive disease, insufficient efficacy, unacceptable toxicity, or serious protocol violation. Dose modifications are specified for unexpected pharmacokinetic observations or toxicity. Bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral sensory neuropathy were managed using established dose-modification guidelines. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis are collected on days 1 and 11, cycle 1:before bortezomib administration, and at 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, and 2, 4, 6, 10, 24, 32, 48, and 72 hours post-dosing. Pharmacodynamic analyses were performed using a whole-blood 20S proteasome specific activity inhibition assay.</detailed_description>
