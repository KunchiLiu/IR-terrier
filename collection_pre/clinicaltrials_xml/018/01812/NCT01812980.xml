	<criteria>(i) Documented to be HIV1 infected on one assay used in the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT)/ other program undertaken within 12 weeks of study enrolment. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures. Provides written informed consent prior to initiation of study. Not pregnant at time of enrolment (confirmed by urine testing). If pregnant in past year, participant must be at least 6 months post delivery at time of enrolment. Women age ≥ 18 years to &lt; 39 years. Receipt of TIV, other than through the study, during the current and previous two influenza seasons, documented by medical history or record. Receipt of any live licensed vaccine ≤ 28 days or any other vaccine (except for tetanus toxoid vaccine) ≤ 14 days prior to studyvaccine. Receipt of a nonlicensed agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) ≤ 28 days prior to vaccination in this study, unless study approval is obtained. Any significant (in the opinion of the site investigator) acute illness and/or oral temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C ≤ 24 hours prior to study entry. Use of anticancer systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy ≤ 48 weeks of study enrollment, or has immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment. Long term use of glucocorticoids, including oral or parenteral prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks (or 2 weeks total) ≤ 12 weeks of study entry, or highdose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) ≤ 12 weeks before study entry (nasal and topical steroids are allowed). Receipt of immunoglobulin or other blood products (with exception of Rho D immune globulin) ≤ 12 weeks prior to enrollment in this study or is scheduled to receive immunoglobulin or other blood products. Receipt of Interleukin 2, IFN, GMCSF or other immune mediators ≤ 12 weeks before enrollment. Uncontrolled major psychiatric disorder. History of a severe adverse reaction to previous TIV. Any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.</criteria>
