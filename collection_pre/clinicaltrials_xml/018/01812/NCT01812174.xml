	<brief_summary>This study examines the hemodynamic and hemolytic properties of two additional smaller size valves to the On-X line of valves already approved by FDA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>On-X Heart Valve - 17mm Aortic and 23mm Mitral</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the 17mm On-X Aortic Prosthetic Heart Valve and the 23mm On-X Mitral Prosthetic Heart Valve when used to replace diseased mitral valves in human subjects. The On-X 17mm aortic and 23mm mitral valves will be implanted in approximately 20 and at least 15 patients per size and each will be followed for at least 1 year. Patients will be any age and will require these size valves as determined in surgery but will be recruited prior to surgery based on results of preoperative screening tests.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients of any age, assent of the patient and consent of parent or authorized legal representative is required if a patient is under the age of majority and not legally emancipated. 2. Patients who are sufficiently ill to warrant replacement of their diseased natural or prosthetic valve, based on standard cardiovascular diagnostic workups. 3. Patients who are in sufficient satisfactory condition, based on the physical exam and investigator's experience, to be an average or better operative risk, (i.e., likely to survive one year postoperatively). 4. Patients who require an isolated aortic valve replacement size 17 mm or isolated mitral valve replacement size 23mm. 5. Patients who are geographically stable and willing to return to the implanting center for followup visits. 6. Patients who are adequately informed of their participation in the clinical study and what will be required of them in order to comply with the protocol. 7. Patients requiring concomitant cardiovascular surgery, such as coronary bypass may be included in the study. 1. Patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or are lactating. 2 Patients who have a noncardiac progressive disease, which in the investigator's experience produces an unacceptable increased risk to the patient. 3 Patients who have a documented history of substance (drug or alcohol) abuser or are prison inmates. 4. Patients with a previous prosthetic valve, where it is not being replaced by a study valve, or patients requiring multiple valve replacement. 5. Patients with active endocarditis or active myocarditis. 6 Patients who require tricuspid or pulmonic valve replacement. 7. Patients who have not agreed to return for the required number of followup visits or who are geographically unavailable for followup. 8. Patients who cannot be maintained on longterm anticoagulant therapy. 9. Patients with noncardiac illness resulting in a life expectancy of less than 1year. 10. Patients previously enrolled and implanted in this trial may not reenter after withdrawal. 11. Patients already enrolled in another investigational device or drug study (nor can enrolled patients be enrolled in other studies). 12. Patients with acute preoperative neurological deficit, myocardial infarction, or cardiac event who have not returned to baseline for at least 30days prior to enrollment. 13. Patients with aortic aneurysm or other medical condition that creates a higher than usual risk of surgical complication. 14. Patients who are prisoners or mentally ill, and pediatric patients who are incapable of understanding their assent as judged by the principal investigator.</criteria>
