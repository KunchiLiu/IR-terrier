	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to analyze the differences of blood sugar level and glycemic variability between sulfonylurea and DPP-4 inhibitor groups applying CGMS for a chosen number of type 2 DM patients. The investigators also reveal influences of each drugs on cardiovascular risk factors by measuring related biomarkers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Vildagliptine and Glimepiride on Glucose Variability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enroll patients with type 2 DM with uncontrolled glucose level on Metformin monotherapy over 1000mg /day (HbA1C over 7%). Before drug administration, we conduct basal lab study including CGMS. After 3 month of random administration of vildagliptin or glimepiride, we check CGMS, glucose levels, CV biomarkers, and estimate hypoglycemic index. We replace with the other drug for 3 months, and then conduct the same measurements. No wash-out period is necessary since result variables are measured after the 3 months of administration for a different drug.</detailed_description>

Provided that the tolerance for metformin is poor, enrollment of patients with lower dose of metfomrin is open. who have never been prescribed with test drugs, sulfonylurea or DPP4 inhibitor/GLP1 analogue in 3 months who can be applied with CGMS who has liver function abnormality or renal function abnormality who has any kind of diseases, operations, medical treatments that can affect glucose levels</criteria>
