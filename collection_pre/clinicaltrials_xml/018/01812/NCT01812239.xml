	<brief_title>Vaginal Progesterone in Twins With Short Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of asymptomatic women with twin pregnancy and a cervix length 10 mm to 25 mm discovered on a routine screening transvaginal sonogram between 20w0d to 24w0d gestational age. Women will be randomized in either the in-patient or out-patient setting (1:1) to a daily vaginal application of micronized progesterone cream(200 mg)vs. placebo to determine if daily vaginal progesterone administration reduces the risk of preterm birth prior to 34w0d of gestation.</detailed_description>
