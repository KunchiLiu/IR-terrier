	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to evaluate the level of mitochondrial dysfunction several patient populations: Burn, trauma, and control group of healthy volunteers. Study hypothesis: Increased plasma concentrations of a newly discovered inflammatory mediated, called mtDNA DAMPS associated with the occurrence of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome in severly injured patients. As the severity of a burn injury or trauma injury increase, so will systemic mitochondrial dysfunction.</brief_summary>
