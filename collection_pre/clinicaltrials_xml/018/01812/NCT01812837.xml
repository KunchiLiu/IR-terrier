	<brief_summary>The global aim of this study is to investigate how microneedles can facilitate the penetration and efficacy of photodynamic therapy in the treatment of actinic keratoses The specific aims are as follows: 1. Investigate whether pretreatment with microneedles enhances penetration of topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA) that is marketed as LevulanÂ® Kerasticks by DUSA pharmaceuticals Inc. 2. Investigate whether pretreatment with microneedles can decrease the required incubation times of the topical ALA prior to exposure to blue light photodynamic therapy.</brief_summary>
