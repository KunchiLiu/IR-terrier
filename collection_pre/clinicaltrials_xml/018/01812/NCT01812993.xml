	<brief_summary>Although the negative impact of sleep apnea on the clinical course of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is well known, data regarding non-invasive ventilation in acute patients are scarce. Several studies showed its tolerability, safety and signals-of-efficacy, yet no controlled randomized sequential phase studies currently exist that aim to establish the efficacy of early non-invasive ventilation in AIS patients. The main hypothesis for this study is that early non-invasive ventilation with automated bilevel positive airway pressure (auto-BPAP) positively affects short-term clinical outcomes in AIS patients. This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, third rater-blinded, parallel-group trial. Patients with AIS with proximal arterial obstruction and clinically suspected sleep apnea will be randomized to standard or standard stroke care plus auto-BPAP. Auto-BPAP will be initiated within 24 hours from stroke onset and performed for a maximum of 48 hours during diurnal and nocturnal sleep. Patients will undergo cardiorespiratory polygraphy between day 3 and 5 to assess sleep apnea. The primary endpoint is any early neurological improvement on the NIHSS at 72 hours from randomization. Safety, tolerability, short-term and 3 months functional outcomes are assessed as secondary endpoints by un-blinded and blinded observers respectively. This study will provide data to power a subsequent phase III study.</brief_summary>
