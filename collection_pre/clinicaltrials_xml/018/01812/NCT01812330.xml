	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Ticagrelor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>180 elective percutaneous coronary intervention patients with clopidogrel resistance were randomized to three groups, Group 1:received clopidogrel 75mg qd ;Group 2:received clopidogrel 150mg qd ; Group 3:received ticagrelor 90mg bid after PCI.Platelet funtion were tested by flowcytometric vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein(VASP) analysis before PCI,and 3days,7days and 1 month after PCI,respectively.The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor with clopidogrel</detailed_description>
