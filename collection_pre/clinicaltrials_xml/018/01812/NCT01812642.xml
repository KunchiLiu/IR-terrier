	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to the drug) of JNJ-37822681 in participants with stable schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetics Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of JNJ-37822681 in Participants With Stable Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), multi-center (conducted in more than one center), randomized (treatment group assigned by chance), and multiple-dose titration study of JNJ-37822681 in participants with stable schizophrenia. The total study duration will be approximately of 8 weeks per participant, consists of 4 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study commences on Day 1); Double-blind treatment (14 days); Follow-up (7 to 14 days after last dose administration). Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with ascending dose levels of JNJ-37822681 once daily and twice daily. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale. Safety will be Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and Simpson Angus Rating Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
