	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if local anesthetic, either a subtenons injection (an injection just beneath the surface tissue of the eye) or a topical ophthalmic gel (applied directly on the surface of the eye) given at the end of strabismus surgery reduces postoperative pain. Some surgeons routinely use either the subtenon and/or topical anesthetic for pain at the end of strabismus surgery.</brief_summary>
