	<brief_summary>Alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Primary Objective of the study: To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison with placebo in participants with LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.59 mmol/L) on ongoing stable atorvastatin therapy. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid levels after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison with placebo - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab - To evaluate the development of anti-alirocumab antibodies - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of alirocumab</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration of study participation depended on the status of the participant at screening: 21 to 27 weeks including a screening/run-in period of 1 to 7 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 12 weeks, followed by an 8-week follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Participants with primary hypercholesterolemia treated with atorvastatin at stable dose of 520 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to screening and likely to have LDLC ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.59 mmol/L) at the screening visit. OR Participants with primary hypercholesterolemia who were receiving a lipidlowering treatment other than atorvastatin, or who were not at stable dose of atorvastatin 520 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to screening if they were likely to have LDLC ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.59 mmol/L) after a 6week runin treatment period on atorvastatin therapy. Exclusion criteria: 1. LDLC &lt;100 mg/dL (&lt;2.59 mmol/L) at screening visit for participants who were being treated with stable dose of atorvastatin 520 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to screening OR at the end of the 6week runin period on atorvastatin for participants receiving a lipid lowering treatment other than atorvastatin, or not at stable dose of atorvastatin 520 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to screening 2. Participants with type 1 diabetes 3. Participants with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, or without, and considered poorly controlled at screening.
