	<brief_summary>EMPROVE is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and long-term effectiveness of the Spiration Valve System in patients with emphysema. Patients appropriate for the EMPROVE study are those who are currently on medical treatment but still symptomatic. EMPROVE also accepts α-1 antitrypsin deficiency patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Spiration® Valve System for Emphysema to Improve Lung Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Spiration Valve is a small, one-way valve that is used to block air from entering diseased portions of the lung. This helps to reduce the volume in diseased lung due to hyperinflation. Volume reduction of diseased lung has been shown to improve lung function and other quality of life measures for people living with emphysema. The Spiration Valve is placed in the diseased section of the lungs using a tool called a bronchoscope. A bronchoscope is a small tube that has a camera on the end. The bronchoscope enters the lungs through the mouth. The Spiration Valve is delivered and placed in the targeted airways via another thin tube called a catheter that travels through the bronchoscope. - Once in place, the Spiration Valve expands and contracts with breathing, creating a complete seal around the airway - The seal blocks air from entering the target lobe while at the same time allowing trapped air and fluids to escape. - This causes the diseased (hyper-inflated) lung to reduce in volume or collapse - Studies have shown volume reduction may allow healthier lung to function better - More information and a description of the Spiration Valve System can be found on the EMPROVE clinical trial website, www.EmphysemaTrial.com Safety and outcomes of the Spiration Valve System in emphysema have been published in several peer-reviewed journals. The articles listed below represent a summary of existing literature regarding the use of the Spiration Valve System for the treatment of emphysema.
