	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Ovarian Cystectomy of Endometrioma vs Deroofing and Ovarian Reserve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the major concerns about excision of endometriomas is their negative effect on ovarian reserve because of follicle loss, removal of endometriomas has been associated with poorer performance in IVF procedures, and decreased ovarian volumes have also been reported after surgery.Ovarian reserve is defined as the functional potential of the ovary which reflects the number and quality of the follicles left in the ovary, and is well-correlated with the response to ovarian stimulation using exogenous gonadotrophin. Over the years, various tests and markers of ovarian reserve have been reported; the static tests include serum markers, such as basal FSH, inhibin-B and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and ultrasonographic markers, such as ovarian volume and antral follicle count.This study will include 122 patients aged between 18 and 35 years who have been diagnosed with endometrioma (unilateral or bilateral) and they are candidates for laparoscopic surgery. They will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.they will be randomized into two study groups, one study group will undergo laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, the other study group will undergo laparoscopic cyst deroofing.AMH,AFC and ovarian volume will be measured pre-operative and post-operative.</detailed_description>
