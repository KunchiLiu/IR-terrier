	<brief_summary>This is a 3-part study where Parts A, B (single-blind - investigator and subject blind) will enrol healthy volunteers and Part C (open-label) will enrol RRMS patients. Parts A (single ascending dose) and B (repeat ascending dose) will assess safety, tolerability, PK and PD of GSK2618960. Part C (repeat doses) will assess safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, paraclinical (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] lesion counts) disease activity and markers of Th1 and Th17 mechanisms. Part A: Each of the 24 healthy volunteers (divided in 5 groups), will take part in only 2 of the planned 8 dosing sessions (A-active, P-placebo). Subjects in each group of Part A will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of the following sequences: AA, AP or PA such that in each dosing session they will receive study treatment in a 3:1 ratio of active: placebo respectively. Part B: Dosing levels and regimen are dependent upon safety tolerability and PK/receptor occupancy (RO) data from Part A. In Cohort 1, 12 subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to A or P. Each subject will receive the same study treatment for repeated doses. If the duration of full RO from highest dose in Part A is less than 4 weeks, a second cohort of 12 subjects in Part B may be recruited, based on Dose Escalation Committee (DEC) decision Part C: The 20 RRMS patients will be assigned to active treatments for 2 to 4 repeated doses. Safety/tolerability and PK data monitoring and the decision to proceed to the next dose level of GSK2618960, and the decisions to proceed to Part B and Part C of the study will be made by a dose escalation committee.</brief_summary>

Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate as follows: Nonchildbearing potential, females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods and women of childbearing potential should have used one of the contraception methods. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods. Subjects with history of current vaccination status for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps and rubella (or who consent to vaccination at screening). Subjects with expected study participation during Flu season (October April) only, with history of current vaccination status for influenza or consent to receive influenza vaccine at screening. Body weight &gt;=50 kg. On ECG, QTcF interval &lt;450 msec; or QTcF &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch block. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form, and authorisation of the release and use of protected health information (PHI). Healthy Volunteers A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. A positive test for HIV antibody. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. History of smoking within 6 months of screening. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males.
