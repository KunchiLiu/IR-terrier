	<brief_title>HPTN 073 Black Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open label demonstration study with PrEP and Client Centered Care Coordination (C4) to assess the initiation, acceptability, safety, and feasibility of PrEP for Black MSM (BMSM) in three US Cities. A subset of participants will also be recruited to participate in qualitative interviews about facilitators and barriers regarding PrEP. The study will recruit HIV-uninfected BMSM at risk for HIV infection in three US Cities. Enrollment will include those aged 18 and over with an effort to recruit an equal number of BMSM under age 25 and over age 25 with a total of 225 participants (75 per site).</detailed_description>
