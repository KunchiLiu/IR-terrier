	<detailed_description>The European prospective observational multi-center cohort study aims to collect real-world outcomes of consecutive patients scheduled for VATS lobectomy for histologically confirmed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or scheduled for VATS wedge resection for undiagnosed pulmonary nodule or metastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC) in accordance with their institution's Standard-of-care (SOC).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed NSCLC (up to and including Stage II) for patients undergoing VATS lobectomy. For patients undergoing wedge resection for undiagnosed pulmonary nodule or metastasis from CRC, a malignant diagnosis may be confirmed postoperatively. Scheduled for lung resection surgery (lobectomy or wedge resection) involving only one lobe of the lung Willing to give consent and comply with evaluation and treatment schedule At least 18 years of age Active bacterial infection or fungal infection Systemic administration (intravenous or oral) of steroids (within 30 days prior to study procedure) Chemotherapy or radiation therapy for lung cancer may not be performed for 30 days prior to the procedure Scheduled concurrent surgical procedure other than wedge resection or lobectomy (central venous access e.g. port placement, mediastinoscopy with lymph node sampling, and VATS lymphadenectomy are allowed); Prior history of VATS or open lung surgery</criteria>
