	<brief_title>Safety and Performance Study of the Edwards CENTERA Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, prospective, multi-center safety and device success study. 34 patients have been enrolled at 4 participating investigational centers in Europe. Patient participation will last for a minimum of 5 years. Patients will be assessed at the following intervals: baseline, discharge, 30 days, 6 months, 1 year and annually thereafter through 5 years</detailed_description>
