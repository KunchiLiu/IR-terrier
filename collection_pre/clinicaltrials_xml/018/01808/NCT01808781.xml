	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study will be to find out the effect of two different interventions on muscle strength, ability to produce muscle force quickly (power), daily function, and number of steps and physical activity an individual with total knee replacement do daily. The research hypotheses for this study will be as follows: - For individuals who are at least 6 months post-total knee replacement, home-based high-velocity training exercises will result in significantly greater improvements in muscle strength and power compared to those who receive a walking program only. - For individuals who are at least 6 months post-total knee replacement, home based high-velocity training exercises will result in significantly greater improvements of daily function(eg. sit to stand, climb a set of stairs)than those who receive a walking program only. - For individuals who are at least 6 months post-total knee replacement, home based high-velocity training exercises will result in significantly greater improvements in physical activity behavior (eg. number of steps per day)compared to those who receive a walking program only.</brief_summary>
