	<brief_title>Assessment of the BodyGuardian Remote Monitoring Platform in Elderly Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The elderly are facing an increasing prevalence of chronic disease and rapidly escalating healthcare costs threatening independent living. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a growing health epidemic and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and cost. Mayo Clinic and Preventice have developed a non-invasive, minimally obtrusive, interactive remote monitoring platform. It enables on-body monitoring and integration of ECG, heart rate, breathing, and activity, with measures of weight and blood pressure. It is designed as a platform for physician directed patient self-management. This technology may be useful in monitoring CHF patients. Our overall objective is to adapt, refine, test and validate this technology in subjects in an independent living center, with wireless transmission of data to a central data analysis hub.</detailed_description>
