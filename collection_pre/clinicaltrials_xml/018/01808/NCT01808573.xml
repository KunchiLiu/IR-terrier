	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, multi-center, multinational, open-label, active-controlled, parallel design study of the combination of neratinib plus capecitabine versus the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine in HER2+ MBC patients who have received two or more prior HER2 directed regimens in the metastatic setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Neratinib Plus Capecitabine Versus Lapatinib Plus Capecitabine in Patients With HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Received Two or More Prior HER2 Directed Regimens in the Metastatic Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, multi-center, multinational, open-label, active-controlled, parallel design study of the combination of neratinib plus capecitabine versus the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine in HER2+ MBC patients who have received two or more prior HER2 directed regimens in the metastatic setting. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: - Arm A: neratinib (240 mg once daily) + capecitabine (1500 mg/m^2 daily, 750 mg/m^2 twice daily [BID]) - Arm B: lapatinib (1250 mg once daily) + capecitabine (2000 mg/m^2 daily, 1000 mg/m^2 BID) Patients will receive either neratinib plus capecitabine combination or lapatinib plus capecitabine combination until the occurrence of death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other specified withdrawal criterion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged â‰¥18 years at signing of informed consent. Histologically confirmed MBC, current stage IV. Documented HER2 overexpression or geneamplified tumor (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC 2+ with confirmatory fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]+). Prior treatment with at least two (2) HER2directed regimens for metastatic breast cancer. Received previous therapy with capecitabine, neratinib, lapatinib, or any other HER2 directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Note: There are additional inclusion and exclusion criteria.
