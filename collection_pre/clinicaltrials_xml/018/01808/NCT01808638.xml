	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate a new treatment strategy for advanced pancreatic cancer disease by combining the new investigational medicinal product Atu027 with the standard chemotherapeutic gemcitabine. This combination aims at enhancing gemcitabine´s anti-tumor activity with Atu027. The objectives of this clinical trial are to evaluate safety and activity of two Atu027 schedules in combination with standard gemcitabine treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</brief_summary>

Lowdose aspirin is permitted (≤100 mg daily). Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline. Women of childbearing potential and men must be willing to use highly effective contraceptive methods during the course of the study and 6 months after. Subjects must be willing and able (in the opinion of the investigator) to understand the subject information and informed consent form and to comply with the study protocol and procedures. Subjects must be willing and able to give written informed consent.
