	<brief_title>Oral Health Intervention Pilot Study for Individuals With Memory Problems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will involve two phases. The main purpose of Phase 1 is to conduct a focus group with 6 individuals with mild dementia (IMDs) and their live-in partners (usually spouse) and conduct in-depth interviews with staff at community organizations (e.g., dementia caregiver support group staff) to develop the protocol. Information from Phase 1 will provide input to refine the proposed pilot intervention that will be Phase 2 of this project. The pilot oral health intervention will last 6 months and will be conducted with up to ten IMDs and their live-in partners.</detailed_description>
