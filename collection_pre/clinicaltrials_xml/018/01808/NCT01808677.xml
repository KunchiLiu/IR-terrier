	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to learn more about the safety of treating NSCLC with reirradiation using standard methods and to look for ways to lessen side effects and improve therapy. Reirradiation is when radiation is given to an area of the body that has previously received a full dose of radiation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, data will be recorded during your therapy. The data to be recorded will include your medical history, the disease, treatments you have received and how you have responded to any treatments, as well as any side effects you may have had. The data will be stored on a password-protected computer at MD Anderson for use in future research related to cancer. Your data will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked to your data. Only the researcher in charge of this study will have access to the code numbers and be able to link the data to you. This is to allow medical information related to your data to be updated as needed. Other researchers using your data will not be able to link this data to you. Length of Study: After you sign this consent form, your active participation on this study will be over. This is an investigational study. Up to 120 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
