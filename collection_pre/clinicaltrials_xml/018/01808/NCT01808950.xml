	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Trial of Topical Resiquimod Gel (0.06%) in Patients With Nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>efficacy assessments: - Histopathological findings based on the biopsies of the primary tumor location and the tissue excision at the end of trial (histological cure). - Description of the clinical-therapeutic effect of resiquimod on nBCC (nodular-basal cell carcinoma) by visual inspection (clinical evaluation of treatment area and assessment of complete clinical clearance) - RNA-analysis (analysis of gene expressions for cytokines, cytotoxic and apoptotic signals) - Investigator's global judgment of efficacy by means of a 7-point scale Safety assessments: - Evaluation of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - Evaluation of local tolerability (local skin reactions as erythema, edema, erosion/ulceration, exsudate, dryness, encrustation) by means of symptom scoring scales (0 = absent, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe). - Evaluation of systemic tolerability [hematology (erythrocytes, leucocytes including neutrophils, hemoglobin, hematocrit, thrombocytes), blood chemistry (alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (ASAT), alanine transaminase (ALAT), serum creatinine), vital signs]. The thresholds concerning laboratory abnormalities that determine patient's discontinuation from trial were predefined upfront. - Evaluation of the number of patients withdrawn from the trial - Investigator's global judgment of tolerability by means of a 6-point scale - Photographic documentation of the treatment area Exploratory parameter: - C-reactive protein (CRP) - Interferon-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha (up-regulation of gene expression) - Immunohistochemistry and characterization of cell types (CD8, T-cells, macrophages, dendritic cells) - In addition, blood serum samples will be preserved and frozen for later tests that will be specified to the patients. The preserved material will be stored for a maximum of 2 years.</detailed_description>

Known autoimmune disorder (especially psoriasis), impaired immune system (e.g. HIV), known thyroid abnormalities, known depression. An open wound or an infection in treatment area. Dermatological disease or condition (e.g. rosacea, atopic dermatitis, eczema) in the treatment or surrounding area that might impair trial assessments. Evidence of an active infection or systemic cancer. Flu or flulike symptoms (including general indisposition, fever, nausea, muscle pain, chills) within a week before start of the trial.
