	<brief_summary>To explore whether obese adolescents with insulin resistance and relative low leptin levels exhibit functional alterations of the neuronal circuits involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and food seeking behaviors. We here propose to test the hypothesis that the reward circuitry is dysregulated in obese adolescents and is related to the degree of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides a non-invasive method to assess the functional pathways affected by nutrient ingestion and therefore can help answer important questions regarding potential differences in the response of brain regions involved in feeding.</detailed_description>
