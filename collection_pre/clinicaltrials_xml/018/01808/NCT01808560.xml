	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot feasibility study is to assess whether treating meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) prior to cataract surgery helps promote meibomian gland function, visual quality and ocular comfort after cataract surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction Prior to Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a post-market, prospective, non-significant risk, open-label, randomized multi-center clinical trial evaluating treatment with the LipiFlow System in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction prior to planned bilateral cataract surgery. All subjects undergo examination to determine study eligibility and to capture the Baseline status prior to surgery. Subjects are randomized to receive LipiFlow treatment (Pre-treatment group) one month before cataract surgery or no LipiFlow treatment (Untreated Control group). Cataract surgery is performed on both eyes of each subject with the second eye surgery completed within two months of the first eye. All subjects are evaluated at one month and three months after cataract surgery on the second eye with comparison of the study endpoints between the Pre-treatment and Untreated groups. To facilitate subject recruitment, the Untreated Control group receives crossover LipiFlow treatment for MGD (Post-treatment group) three months after cataract surgery on the second eye.</detailed_description>
