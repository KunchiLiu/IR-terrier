	<brief_title>Gene Analysis in Studying Susceptibility to Wilms Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To use a genome-wide association analysis to identify novel genetic variants that confer susceptibility to Wilms tumor. II. To improve our understanding of the genetic architecture and etiology of Wilms tumor. III. To facilitate the identification of genetic markers that are associated with an increased risk of developing of Wilms tumor and/or those at risk of aggressive disease, relapse, additional tumors and/or cancer in their offspring. OUTLINE: Samples are analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiling using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).</detailed_description>
