	<brief_summary>Older adults are at increased risk of high blood pressure and cognitive decline. High blood pressure itself also increases risk of cognitive decline. A particular type of blood pressure lowering drug (a calcium channel blocker(CCB)) may lower risk of dementia in younger adults but there is no clear evidence of it's impact in those &gt;=80. It is important that we know whether CCB use impacts on cognitive function in this age group. This study will compare change in cognitive function in those taking CCBs to those not taking CCBs.</brief_summary>
