	<brief_summary>Psychological mindedness(PM) is a meta cognitive process in which the person uses his cognitive and affective abilities to better understand his thoughts, feelings, and his behaviors as they interact with his internal experiences and his external experiences in the world, and dynamically modifies his behavior to move towards self actualization, in a manner positive to himself and the world. We investigate whether assessment of PM can distinguish depressed patients who benefit from CBT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Depression Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) was found to be the most effective psychotherapy for depression. Yet, it is effective only for 40% of the depressed people who receive this treatment. Until this day there is no method of predicting whom can be helped among depressed patients by CBT. In this study we examine whether level of psychological mindedness can predict who may benefit from CBT among depressed patients. Subjects who are found to be clinically depressed are given 14 sessions of CBT. The screening procedure for this study includes a 20-30 minute telephone or in-person interview. Clinical staff members trained in diagnostic interviewing will conduct an initial phone interview to determine likely diagnostic suitability. If the subject is deemed preliminarily eligible for participation, meaning he or she is clinically depressed, they will then be invited for an in-person psychiatric evaluation conducted at the Depression Evaluation Services at New York State Psychiatric Institute. Upon arrival the subject will read the Depression Evaluation Services consent form for evaluation.Questions will be answered and the consent will be offered to read and sign,if agreeable. The evaluation will include a clinical interview, a structured clinical interview (the SCID-IV), collection of blood samples for routine medical tests, including thyroid function tests, and a urine sample [for urine analysis and toxicology screen]. Important to note: subjects who enroll in the study need to not take any psychiatric medications or they must be on the same medications for 3 months and the same dose for 4 weeks. During the psychotherapy, the patients will continue to see their own physician for medications. Medication management will NOT be within the province of this protocol. During the study there will be an ongoing consultation with the outside physician, particularly with regard to changes in medication and/or dosage. Should the MD or patient decide to make alternations in use of medication, this will not affect the patient's participation in psychotherapy or in this study. Subjects who were found to be eligible for the study will return within two weeks after the evaluation visit. An evaluator will rate the HDRS-17 and CG I-Severity.If they are still eligible, they will be asked to sign the study consent form, have the study explained, including its risks and possible benefits, as well as alternatives and its voluntary nature. Once they sign the consent form, patients will complete a battery of self-report instrument. Also they will be interviewed by a clinician with a structured clinical interview of PM. After that they will schedule their weekly CBT sessions with the study therapist. During 14 weeks they will be clinically monitored by Beck Depression Inventory at the beginning of every session and HDRS-17 every four weeks. They will complete study measures at week 8 and after the the 14 weeks sessions. Study participants who do not remit (end treatment HDRS-17 &gt; 7) at the end of CBT trial will be offered medication for three months or will receive referral for alternative psychotherapy, per patient's preference.</detailed_description>
