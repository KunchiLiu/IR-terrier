	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether or not the 4 Pillars Toolkit increases adult Influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV), tetanus, adult diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap/Td) vaccination rates. The vaccines are all FDA licensed vaccines and to be used according to national guidelines. The investigators will conduct a randomized cluster trial of this toolkit in diverse primary care practice with electronic medical records (EMRs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SOP Toolkit in Diverse Practices Implemented &amp; Tested With RE-AIM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This intervention is a two-region, two-year, stratified randomized cluster trial in 24 primary care practices with EMRs. These practices will be randomly assigned to be intervention or control sites to test this 4 Pillars Toolkit intervention package of evidence-based techniques tailored to their practice structure and culture; one set of practices randomized to intervention in year 1 and the other to control. In year 2, the other set of practices will receive the intervention and community controls may be sought. These diverse practices consist of: 18 diverse practices from UPMC in western Pennsylvania and 6 diverse practices from large community health centers in a PBRN in Texas.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Practice staff and adults in enrolled clinical sites Site inclusion criteria: 1) an appropriate adult population: e.g., adults aged 50 years and older; 2) currently using an EMR that has prompt ability, such as EpicCare; 3) having and keeping immunization data within this EMR Patientlevel inclusion criteria: 1) Adults (18 years and above) who are active patients of the enrolled practices (e.g., active patients are those with a visit within the last 12 months) 2) All unvaccinated adults without a contraindication are eligible to receive Td/Tdap and influenza, regardless of age and at age 65 years or older are eligible for PPSV. Site exclusion criteria: 1) consistent SOP use for the 3 vaccines being studied or high vaccination rates (e.g., 80%) Patientlevel exclusion criteria: 1) those with a true contraindication, following the CDC's Guide to Contraindications (attached with the US Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule), such as prior vaccine anaphylaxis.</criteria>
