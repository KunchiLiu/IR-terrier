	<brief_summary>The location of the catheter tip in radiographic planes 1 and 2, is a protection factor for the mechanical performance of peritoneal Dialysis. Instead radiographic planes 3 and 4 are risk factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Assessment of Peritoneal Dialysis Failure Based on Catheter Tip Location.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiolucency of the peritoneal dialysis catheter, allow to classify the location of the tip into 4 radiographic planes. Plane 1: below the zone of a line on the head of the femur. Plane 2: is the area above the plane 1 and below a line connecting the two iliac spines. Plane 3: is the area that is above the plane 2 and below a line connecting the upper edge of the two iliac crests. Plane 4: is the area located above the plane 3.</detailed_description>
