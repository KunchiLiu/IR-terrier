	<brief_summary>Subjects who have not used the ELLIPTA™ inhaler nor the DISKUS™ inhaler in the past 6 months will be screened to participate in the study. Subjects will have an equal chance of being in any of the following two groups (1:1 allocation). One group will be dispensed the ELLIPTA inhaler at Visit 1 to use during the first period (once daily for 5 to9 days), and the DISKUS inhaler at Visit 2 to use during the second period (twice daily for 5 to 9 days). The other group will be dispensed the DISKUS inhaler at Visit 1 to use during the first period (twice daily for 5 to 9 days), and the ELLIPTA inhaler at Visit 2 to use during the second period (once daily for 5 to9 days). At the end of the second period, subjects will complete the study by answering 7 questions to assess their preference of device attributes and dosing regimens between the two inhalers. The null hypothesis for device preference for a specific attribute is that 50% subjects express a preference in that attribute for ELLIPTA and 50% do NOT express a preference in that attribute for ELLIPTA, i.e., the odds for preferring ELLIPTA to not preferring ELLIPTA is unity. The null hypothesis for dosing regimen preference is that 50% subjects express a preference of once daily dosing and 50% do not express a preference of once daily dosing (prefer twice daily dosing or have no preference).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Informed consent Subject must give their signed and dated written informed consent to participate. Subject understands and is willing, able, and likely to comply with study procedures and restrictions. Subject must be able to read, comprehend, and record information in English. 2. Age: &gt;=40 years of age at Visit 1 3. Gender: Male or female subjects 4. COPD diagnosis subjects with a clinical history of COPD in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society 5. Severity of disease: Subject with a measured postalbuterol Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/ Forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of &lt;=0.70 at Visit 1 Subjects with a measured postalbuterol FEV1 &lt;=70% of predicted normal values calculated using Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reference equations at Visit 1. Postbronchodilator spirometry will be performed approximately 1015 minutes after the subject has selfadministered 4 inhalations (i.e., total 400 micrograms) of albuterol via a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a valvedholding chamber. The FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1 percent predicted values will be calculated by the investigator site. Documented spirometry measurements that meet this criterion in the last 12 months preceding Visit 1 is acceptable. 6. Tobacco use: current or former smokers Smokers are defined as those who smoke 10 packyears of cigarette. Note: Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate packyear history. Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked 1. Previous experience with the DISKUS inhaler Subjects who used any DISKUS inhaler (e.g., ADVAIR DISKUS, FLOVENT DISKUS®; participated in a clinical study of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol, or any component of them, or placebo) within 6 months (i.e., 180 days) prior to Visit 1. 2. Previous experience with the ELLIPTA inhaler Subjects who used any ELLIPTA inhaler (e.g., participated in a clinical study of FF/VI or GSK573719/GW642444 [umeclidinium/vilanterol], or any component of them, or placebo) within 6 months (i.e., 180 days) prior to Visit 1. 3. Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. Subjects with a prior history of asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD. 4. Poorly controlled COPD: Subjects with symptoms of poorly controlled COPD such as: Acute worsening of COPD that is managed by the subject with corticosteroids or antibiotics or that requires treatment prescribed by a physician, in the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Hospitalization due to acute worsening of COPD within 4 weeks of Visit 1. Use of a total of 8 puffs/day or more of shortacting symptom relief medications such as albuterol and ipratropium for 2 consecutive days or any 3 days within 7 days immediately preceding Visit 1. Changes in COPD symptoms and signs, suggesting worsening COPD health status at Visit 1. 5. Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with current evidence of uncontrolled or clinically significant disease. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. Subjects with suspected or evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis will be excluded from the study. Note: subjects who develop oropharyngeal candidiasis during the study will be treated at the discretion of the investigator. 6. Drug/food allergy: Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the inhalation powder (e.g., lactose, magnesium stearate). In addition, subjects with a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates the subject's participation will also be excluded. 7. Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse at Visit 1 which in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the subject's proper completion of the protocol requirement 8. Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable or unwilling to withhold their COPD medications prior to spirometry testing at Visit 1. Subjects, who have documented spirometry measurements that meet the specified Inclusion Criterion in the last 12 months preceding Visit 1, do not have to undergo repeat spirometry at Visit 1. 9. Investigational drug or device: Subjects who participated in an interventional study or used any investigational drug or device within 30 days or 5 half lives, whichever is longer, prior to Visit 1 10. Affiliation with investigator site: Study investigators, subinvestigators, study coordinators, employees of a participating investigator or immediate family members of the aforementioned are excluded from participating in this study.</criteria>
