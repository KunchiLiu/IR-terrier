	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to compare insulin degludec and insulin aspart (IDegAsp) co-formulations with separately injected, simultaneous doses of insulin degludec (insulin 454) and insulin aspart, compared with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (NovoMixÂ® 30) in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Each subject will be randomised to four out of nine possible treatment arms. IDegAsp 40, IDegAsp 45, IDegAsp 55 and IDeg high concentration were explorative formulations, not similar to the proposed commercial formulation.</brief_summary>
