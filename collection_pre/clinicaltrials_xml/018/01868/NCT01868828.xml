	<brief_title>A Study of PAD Versus Velcade, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone (VCD) Treatment in Subjects With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening At the screening visit, informed consent will be obtained from all subjects who are deemed potentially eligible for enrollment in the study, according to the protocol-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Treatment Eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive either treatment PAD or VCD. All eligible subjects will be evaluated after 4 cycles treatment. According to the assessment of researchers and the willingness of patients to decide whether to autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Suitable for transplant patients will accept hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Not suitable for transplant patients will continue accept treatment for 8 cycles. The patients who accept more than 4 cycles treatment will receive efficacy evaluation. Follow-up All patients will receive 12 months of follow-up after the treatment period. Follow-up at 4, 6, 8 and 12 month after the treatment period respectively. Subjects who have disease progression or accept other resistance myeloma therapy during the 12 months of follow-up phase will stop assessed about the study and start followed up only for survival status every 6 months through telephone interviews or to research center follow-up. All patients will accept the follow-up for survival until last case patient who complete follow-up. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study by assessment of adverse events (AEs), physical examination, vital signs and clinical laboratory findings.</detailed_description>
