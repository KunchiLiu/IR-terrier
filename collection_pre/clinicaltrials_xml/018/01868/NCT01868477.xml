	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to assess the effect of treatment with deferasirox combined with erythropoietin vs. erythropoietin alone on erythropoiesis in patients with low- and int-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. The addition of deferasirox to erythropoietin could lead to a potential synergism with the reduction of reactive oxygen species, through both the NF-kB pathway and the control of free toxic iron. This may create a better environment in the bone marrow for a better response with erythropoietin. This study is designed to test in a prospective way the combination of deferasirox with erythropoietin in term of their effect on hematopoiesis.</brief_summary>
