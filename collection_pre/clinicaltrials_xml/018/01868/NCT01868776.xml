	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of buffered lidocaine (a numbing solution) on the ability to numb patients with toothaches. Buffered anesthetic (numbing) solutions have shown promise in some medical and dental research. Patients presenting with toothaches will be given either a buffered numbing solution or a nonbuffered numbing solution. Neither the patient nor the operator will know which solution they will receive. Root canal treatment will be performed on the tooth and the ability of the buffered versus non-buffered numbing solutions will be compared.</brief_summary>
