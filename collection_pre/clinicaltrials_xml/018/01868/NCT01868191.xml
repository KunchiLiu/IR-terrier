Neuropathy by other origin than diabetes. Other severe pain that might impair the assessment of neuropathic pain. Treatment with more than one of following: tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, class I antiarrhythmics with Nachannel inhibition (mexiletine, flecainid, propafenon and others) or neuroleptics in patients receiving these drugs for neuropathic pain.</criteria>
