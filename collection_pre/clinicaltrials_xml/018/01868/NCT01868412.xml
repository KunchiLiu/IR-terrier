	<brief_summary>In recent years, salve prepared from Norway spruce (Picea abies) resin and refined honey from manuka myrtle (Leptospermum scoparium), has successfully been used in medical context to treat both acute and chronic surgical wounds. The objective of this prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial is to investigate healing rate and healing time of surgical wounds in patients, who have undergone peripheral vascular surgery, and whose complicated wounds are candidate for topical treatment with the resin or honey. In addition, factors contributing with delayed wound healing, antimicrobial properties, safety and cost-effectiveness of the resin salve and medical honey will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
