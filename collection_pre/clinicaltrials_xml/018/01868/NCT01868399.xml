In addition to Malaria and pulmonary tuberculosis, the investigators also found dengue virus, Japanese Encephalitis virus, Chikungunya virus infections and intestinal parasitic infections might be the existing but overlooked and neglected medical issues in Solomon Islands. These infections show similarity in clinical manifestations and usually difficulty in clinical diagnosis, instead these infections rely on the laboratory identification with good laboratory quality and facility.</brief_summary>
