	<brief_title>Impact Advanced Recovery® for Radical Cystectomy (RC) Patients: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radical cystectomy (RC) is the removal of the entire bladder and nearby organs that may contain cancer cells. It is a major surgery that can lead to breakdown of proteins in the body and a decreased immune response, both of which increase the risk of illness and death. Poor nutrition status before RC surgery is linked to a higher rate of death after surgery. Therefore, it is important to eat a balanced diet before and after RC surgery to avoid negative outcomes. Studies show that patients who drink a nutritional supplement that may enhance the immune system before and after gastro-intestinal surgery may have fewer infections and shorter hospital stays after surgery. Patients with cancer of the colon/rectum, stomach, and pancreas who drank a similar immune-enhancing nutritional supplement before and after surgery also had fewer infections. The purpose of this study is to attain pilot data for a larger trial.</detailed_description>
