	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes across the 4 different treatment groups. The investigators hope that this treatment will improve the ability to cure more patients with HL and also limit the long-term side effects from the treatment. Although eliminating radiation in cohort 4 will eliminate the risk for long-term side effects from radiation, it is also possible that with BV+AVD chemotherapy alone there may be an increased risk of the Hodgkin lymphoma coming back after initial treatment.</brief_summary>
