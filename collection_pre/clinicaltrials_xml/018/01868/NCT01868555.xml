	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this trial is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of two insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) preparations and two insulin degludec (insulin 454) preparations in healthy Japanese male subjects. IDegAsp 45 (B) and insulin degludec (B) are explorative formulations, not similar to the proposed commercial formulations.</brief_summary>
