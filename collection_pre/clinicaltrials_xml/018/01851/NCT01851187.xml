	<brief_summary>Pregnancy or childbirth is a kind of persistent and strong source of stress for pregnant women. Prenatal and intrapartum negative emotions not only damage the mental health of pregnant women, but also have a negative impact on the mode of delivery, labor, postpartum complications and neonatal outcomes . Due to considerations for the effect on the fetus, there is concern of the use of drug treatment for depression during pregnancy. Therefore, psychological interventions have an important role. According to the WHO global survey in Asia 2007-08, China had the highest overall rate of caesarean section (46.2%), and also had the highest rate of caesarean section without indication (11.7%). The embarrassing "first in the world" of caesarean section rate was causing widespread concern in China. Recently, the Chinese government has launched a project named "promoting the rate of natural childbirth and protecting the health of mother and child", trying to reduce the cesarean section rate especially that without medical indication. Therefore, examining if emotional management is effective in reducing negative emotions of pregnant women as well as decreasing the rate of cesarean section is an important research question. Our study aims to help the pregnant women control their anxiety, depressive feelings and other negative emotions by "emotional self-management group training" and we examine if this can reduce the incidence of depression and improve delivery outcomes.</brief_summary>
