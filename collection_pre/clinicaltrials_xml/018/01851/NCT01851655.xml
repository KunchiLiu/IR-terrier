	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind (subject/evaluator)study. Enrolled patients had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and met criteria for advanced rehabilitation. The study included 8 weeks of advanced rehabilitation consisting of low- or high-intensity plyometric exercise. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of plyometric exercise intensity on knee function and knee cartilage in patients with ACL reconstruction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As part of the study, investigators will insure patients meet the criteria for advanced rehabilitation based on knee motion, pain levels and quadriceps strength. Participants will be asked to review the informed consent and consent to the study prior to any study procedures. The study will consist of 2 testing sessions and an 8 week intervention (2 visits per week) at the UF&amp;Shands Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine Institute. The testing sessions will include clinical measures of knee impairments, questionnaires, biomechanical analysis and functional performance testing.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. time from injury to ACL reconstruction is no greater than 6 months, 2. preinjury activity level includes participation in highdemand activities, and 3. meet the criteria for advanced rehabilitation including full active knee extension, active knee flexion within 5 degrees of the contralateral side, pain rating no greater or equal to 1/10 with activities of daily living, and involved side knee extensor strength at least 60% of the contralateral side. 1. bilateral knee injury, 2. prior knee ligament injury and/or surgery, 3. concomitant other ligamentous injury &gt; Grade I, 4. meniscal repair performed in conjunction with ACL reconstruction, 5. cartilage repair procedure performed in conjunction with ACL reconstruction, 6. complications during surgery requiring protocol modification, and 7. renal disease.</criteria>
