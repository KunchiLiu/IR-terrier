	<brief_title>A New Surgical Approach to Treat Medial or Low Condylar Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty patients (72 sides) with medial or low condylar fractures were treated with surgical intervention. Thirty-six patients (42 sides) were treated with minor parotid anterior approach, and the other 24 patients (30 sides) were treated with retromandibular approach. The data about the operations and complications were recorded. The follow-up periods were 3-12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(1)clinical and imaging diagnosis of medial or low condylar fractures (2)bone fragments that were obviously dislocated, that affected patients appearance and function, requiring surgical intervention (3)no previous surgical treatment (1)medial or low condylar fractures without obvious displacement (2)patients who had previously undergone unsuccessful surgery (3)the surgical site had traumatic scar, so the approach could be carried out on the original incision</criteria>
