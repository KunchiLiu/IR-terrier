	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, 3-period, fixed-sequence study will evaluate the effect of multiple doses of vemurafenib on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of acenocoumarol in participants with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic malignancies. Participants will receive a single dose of acenocoumarol 4 mg orally on Day 1 and Day 23, vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily on Days 4-26. After completion of pharmacokinetic assessments on Day 26, eligible participants will have the option to continue treatment with vemurafenib as part of an extension study (GO28399 [NCT01739764]).</brief_summary>
