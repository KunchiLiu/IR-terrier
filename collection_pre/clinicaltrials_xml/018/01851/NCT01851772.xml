	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, performance and usability of the Xoft Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy System and Cervical Applicator as incorporated into the physician's current standard treatment practice and in replacement of high-dose-rate after-loaders using Iridium-192 or low-dose-rate Cesium treatments. Data will be collected on treatment delivery, safety, and acute toxicity. Our hypothesis is that the treatment is safe as incorporated into the physician's current standard of practice.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Brachytherapy is indicated after EBRT for all cases of locally advanced disease (Stages Ib2 IVA) Inoperable Stage Ia1 and Stage Ia2 may be treated with tandembased brachytherapy alone Inoperable Stage Ib1 should be treated radically with brachytherapy in conjunction with EBRT. Concurrent chemotherapy may be considered at the physician's discretion and based on the presence of high risk features. Subjects can be treated with brachytherapy regardless of lymph node status, grade, and presence of lymphovascular invasion, tumor size, age, or histology. Medically fit for general or spinal anesthesia, or conscious sedation, for the insertion process Subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening inclusion Criteria: EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Medical Contraindications to Brachytherapy (scleroderma, collagen vascular disease, active lupus ) Prior pelvic radiotherapy with brachytherapy Hemoglobin level at screening &lt; 8 Life expectancy &lt; 6 months</criteria>
