	<brief_title>Compliance With Antidepressant Medication in Treatment of Functional Dyspepsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antidepressive agents have been proved to be effective in the treatment of functional dyspepsia (FD) patients. However, one of the factors that limit therapeutic benefit is the poor compliance with prescribed drugs. The possible reasons for lack of compliance include the patient's health beliefs (e.g., that people who took such agents is possibly considered insane in China), lack of knowledge about antidepressants (that they are addictive or can be stopped on recovery), and aversion to side effects. The investigators propose to examine whether different clinician-patient communication methods could affect adherence to antidepressant drugs in functional dyspepsia patients.</detailed_description>
