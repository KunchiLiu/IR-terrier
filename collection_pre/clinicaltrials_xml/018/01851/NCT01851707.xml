	<brief_title>A Double-Blind Study Evaluating Duvelisib in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis and an Inadequate Response to Methotrexate Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of multiple dose levels of IPI-145 in subjects with active moderate-to-severe Rheumatoid Arthritis receiving a background stable dose of methotrexate. The study will employ a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design. Approximately 316 adult subjects who meet all eligibility criteria at Screening will be randomized at Baseline in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of 4 dose groups. All treatments will be administered twice a day (BID). After randomization, subjects will enter a 12-week Treatment Period, where study drug (IPI-145 or placebo) will be self-administered BID as an outpatient. During the Treatment Period, subjects will return to the clinic for efficacy and safety assessments every 2 weeks. Following Treatment Period completion at Week 12, subjects will enter a 3-week Follow-up Period which includes one clinic visit approximately 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>
