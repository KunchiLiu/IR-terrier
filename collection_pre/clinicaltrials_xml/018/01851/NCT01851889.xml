	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to identify factors which can be used as guidance when optimizing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) settings. The hypothesis of the study is that pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) will change independently of left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) when increasing pump speed ie ΔPCWP/RPM ≠ ΔLVEDD/RPM. The primary combined endpoint of the study is correlation between ΔPCWP and LVEDD slope under ramp testing in a cohort of "continuous-flow left ventricular assist device" heart failure patients.</brief_summary>
