	<brief_summary>Urgency Incontinence (where the bladder muscles contract suddenly, causing an immediate urge to urinate that is difficult to prevent) is commonly experienced in patients with overactive bladder. New findings have discovered that urgency incontinence may be connected to the interactions of certain regions of the brain and the bladder. Although this is a common problem, researched still do not know how these interactions impact the process of urgency incontinence. Furthermore, there is preliminary data to suggest that interventions such as Mindful-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) can potentially be used as therapy for UI. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact MBSR training on UI symptoms, quality of life, and anxiety measures.</brief_summary>
