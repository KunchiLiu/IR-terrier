	<brief_summary>We want to examine the effect of multidisciplinary interventions in asthma patients who had experienced acute exacerbation of asthma. In our previous observational studies, elderly asthma patients had a some distinct features such as impairment of cognitive function, deficiency of micronutrient and absence of caregiver compared with young adult asthmatics. We wanted to evaluate whether the long-term course of asthma could be modified by intervening deficienies which were found in elderly patiensts. So, we designed a interventional study to correct above risk factors in elderly asthma patients, which could be aggravating their asthma. Followings are our specific multidiciplinary items that we want to correct. 1. popularize and educate the asthma action plan 2. run a emergency call system for acute exacerbation 3. educate the proper techniques using inhalers 4. correct the deficiency of magnesium (magnesium 500 mg per day) After 1 years, we will measure the numbers of acute exacerbations, lung function including FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, health-related quality of life and level of serum magnesium in study patients.</brief_summary>
