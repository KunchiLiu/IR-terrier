	<brief_summary>X-ray computed tomography imaging (CT) is routinely used in follow-up after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been shown to give accurate information about endoleak after EVAR. Benefits of CEUS over CT include less radiation exposure, avoidance of renal function deterioration due to repeated X-ray contrast agent application and decrease in the cost of EVAR follow-up. This study is designed to investigate if results from literature are reproducible in St Olavs Hospital in Trondheim (Norway), to gain experience with the technique and to introduce CEUS as an alternative for detection of endoleak in this hospital.</brief_summary>
