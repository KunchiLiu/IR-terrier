	<brief_summary>This is an open label Phase 1 study of the Ad-PfCA vaccine designed to 1) provide reagents for the development and refinement of cell-mediated immunoassays for measuring the human immune response to candidate malaria vaccines (especially protective malaria vaccines such as DNA/Ad-PfCA where better assays are needed to identify the correlates of protective immunity) and 2) to provide a repository of antigen-specific PBMCs that can be used as positive and negative controls in cell mediated immunoassays.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an open label Phase 1 study of the Ad-PfCA vaccine designed to 1) provide reagents for the development and refinement of cell-mediated immunoassays for measuring the human immune response to candidate malaria vaccines (especially protective malaria vaccines such as DNA/Ad-PfCA where better assays are needed to identify the correlates of protective immunity) and 2) to provide a repository of antigen-specific PBMCs that can be used as positive and negative controls in cell mediated immunoassays. The study group will consist of up to 35 healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years who have been screened to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will be eligible for participation regardless of baseline adenovirus 5 serostatus. At least 6 subjects will be "malaria naïve", meaning that 1) they have not been the recipient of a malaria vaccine, 2) they have no history of malaria infection or travel to a malaria endemic region within 6 months of first leukapheresis procedure or 60mL blood draw, 3) they have no history of long-term residence (&gt;5 years) in an area known to have significant transmission of P. falciparum, and 4) they have a negative P. falciparum circumsporozoite (PfCSP) ELISpot assay at baseline. (From herein, for simplicity, we refer to PfCSP simply as CSP). The remaining subjects will have no restrictions regarding receipt of malaria vaccines, travel history or baseline CSP ELISpot results. Although it is more difficult to recruit "malaria-naïve" subjects, the inclusion of at least 6 such subjects should provide a more varied array of immune responses; this may be helpful for assay development. Eligible subjects will receive a single administration of the Ad-PfCA malaria candidate vaccine at a dose of 2 x 1010 pu by intramuscular injection. Approximately 1 month pre-immunization, study subjects will either have a large number of PBMCs collected by means of leukapheresis, or a simple 60 mL blood draw, dependent upon initial pre-screening. Pre-immunization samples designated for the repository do not require large volume sampling of PBMCs. Rather, a 60 mL whole blood draw is sufficient for repository purposes. Thus, subjects will be separated into sub-groups, dependent upon initial pre-screening. Subjects whose samples are designated for the repository will undergo a simple, 60 mL blood draw in lieu of leukapheresis #1 (sub-group A). Samples assigned for assay development will be obtained from sub-group B. Approximately 1 month post-immunization, study subjects in both sub-groups will have PBMCs collected by means of leukapheresis. Consultation with immunology experts after post-immunization screening will assist to identify those subjects whose samples do not meet assay development or repository needs. In an effort to eliminate unnecessary procedures for subjects, these individuals will not undergo a second leukapheresis, but will return for their safety visit on day 84. Prior to each leukapheresis/60 mL blood draw, a sample will be tested by CSP-ELISpot and AMA1 ELISpot; the results will be used to categorize samples (see below). Follow up visits will occur 2, 7, 14, 21, and 84 days following immunization. Depending on guidance from the FDA, subjects will then be followed annually by phone, email, or mailings up to five years from the time of immunization per FDA recommendation.</detailed_description>

Female subjects unable to bear children must have a note from a Primary Care Provider as proof of her documentation (e.g. tubal ligation or hysterectomy) or must be postmenopausal as appropriate by age with at least one year of amenorrhea. Men must agree to use of effective means of birth control. If a male subject has had a vasectomy this will be considered an adequate means of birth control. Agree to refrain from blood donation for one year after immunization Agree not to travel to a malaria endemic region during the active phase of the study Good peripheral venous access Females who are pregnant (positive urine βHCG) or nursing at screening or plan on becoming pregnant or plan to nurse from time of screening through the duration of the active phase of the study (3 months following immunization) Positive HIV, HBsAg or HCV serology An abnormal EKG, defined as one showing pathologic Q waves and significant STT wave changes; left ventricular hypertrophy; any nonsinus rhythm excluding isolated premature atrial contractions; right or left bundle branch block; or advanced (secondary or tertiary) AV heart block. Weight less than 110 pounds Use of systemic immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy (inhaled and topical steroids are allowed) within 60 days of scheduled leukapheresis/60 mL blood draw or immunization Current significant medical condition (cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, or hematological) or evidence of any other serious underlying medical condition identified by medical history, physical examination, or laboratory examination (includes bleeding disorders) Plan for surgery between screening visit and second (final) leukapheresis Known allergy to any component of the vaccine formulation Participation in any study involving another investigational vaccine or drug within 30 days prior to the first scheduled leukapheresis/60 mL blood draw or plan to participate in another investigational vaccine/drug research study during participation in the active phase of this study Receipt of immunoglobulin and/or any blood products within 90 days of scheduled leukapheresis/60 mL blood draw or immunization Any other significant finding which, in the investigator's judgment, may substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in the study or compromise the scientific objectives Risk factors for HIV exposure: unsafe sex and injectable drug use</criteria>
