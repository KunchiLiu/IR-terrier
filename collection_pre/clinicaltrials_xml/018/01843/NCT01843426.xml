	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate contrast media volume, safety and 30-day outcome of patients after a computed tomography (CT) scan. The results of this study will help to determine the minimum volume of contrast material that can be used to ensure patient safety while not compromising diagnostic image quality in high-risk patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aortic Stenosis Pre-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) Procedure CT Scan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The scholarly rationale for the study is to determine the feasibility of restricting the contrast media volume to 60ml of 270mg Iodine (mgI)/ml iodixanol or less to accomplish sufficient intravascular attenuation for comprehensive CT assessment prior to TAVR. The study will also evaluate the effects of contrast media administration on our subjects' kidney function by performing serum creatinine measurements at baseline, as well as at three days and thirty days after contrast media administration.</detailed_description>
