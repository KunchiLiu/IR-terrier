	<brief_summary>The investigators wish to study the effects of three forms of bariatric surgery: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and lap banding. The surgery is not part of the clinical trial. If insurance does not cover the procedure, then the patient is responsible for payment of the surgical process. The investigators are doing pre- and post-surgery testing to provide a better understanding of the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on 1) alcohol absorption, distribution and elimination from the body; 2) the effects of alcohol on blood sugar; and 3) the effects of alcohol on mood.</brief_summary>
