	<brief_title>Therapeutic Efficacy of Topical Sirolimus in Early Stage Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, non-randomized, open label study of topical sirolimus for the treatment of CTCL recurrent or refractory to at least one previous skin directed treatment. The purpose will be evaluation of safety and anti-tumor response as evaluated by serial skin examinations. Study duration: For subjects with at least partial remission, treatment will be continued for a maximum of 6 months. All subjects will be followed for 6 months from the time of discontinuation of the study drug or until progression of disease or until a new treatment for CTCL will be started.</detailed_description>
