	<brief_summary>Objectives: The aims were to measure caloric compensation (CC) and eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) in 2 to 7 year-old French children in their regular eating context and to link these measurements with individual characteristics (adiposity, age, gender) and parental feeding practices. Design: Three consecutive weeks an identical lunch was served in four preschool canteens reaching 236 children. The first lunch was a control session. For the CC situation (week 2), thirty minutes before the lunch children were offered a preload (137 kcal). For the EAH situation (week 3), ten minutes after lunch children were exposed to palatable foods (430 kcal). Food intake was measured at the individual level. Parental eating behaviour and feeding practices were measured by questionnaires. Child's height and weight were measured by a medical doctor.</brief_summary>
