	<brief_summary>The FIRST project is a national fertility preservation registry for young women facing cancer treatments. The investigators will examine how different cancers and treatments affect the reproductive health of young survivors. This prospective cohort study seeks to recruit young women close to time of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Participants will answer a yearly questionnaire on their current health. A subset of participants will provide dried blood spots to measure reproductive hormones. The primary goal of the study is to determine the risk of infertility and time to pregnancy in young female cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
