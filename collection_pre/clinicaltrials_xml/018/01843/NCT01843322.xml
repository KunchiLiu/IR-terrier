	<brief_summary>The study is aimed at investigating whether repair of endoleak type II can be improved by adding navigation technology. Can this technology increase precision by guiding the needle that punctures through the skin as used during the repair procedure? Can the procedure logistics be improved by using navigation technology instead of computed tomography (CT) guidance of the needle puncture? Parameters logged during the procedure: - was the needle placement successful? - number of needle punctures? - time used on guidance procedure - X-ray exposure dose</brief_summary>
