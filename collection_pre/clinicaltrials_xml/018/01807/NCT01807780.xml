	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if multiple vaccination in military personnel may be correlated with the appearance of poorly defined diseases as symptomatic multisyndrome, autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disorders. At the same time, considering possible interference between different vaccines, proteins and polysaccharides, living and inactivated, the study aims to assess the immunogenicity and efficacy also in relation to the specific Human Leucocyte Antigens (HLA) genetic structure.</brief_summary>
