	<brief_title>Oleogel-S10 in Wound Healing of Skin Graft Donor Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oleogel-S10 has shown efficacy and was well tolerated in previous clinical trials in patients with skin lesions. Especially the results in a previous study with split-thickness skin graft donor site suggest that Oleogel-S10 should be efficacious and safe in the treatment of superficial wounds. The present phase III clinical trial again in grade split-thickness skin graft donor sites is initiated in order to demonstrate the measure of wound healing progress applying objective methods, i.e., the time to healing and the grade of epithelialization of the wound. In this study, split-thickness skin graft donor sites are separated into two wound halves. Randomly assigned, one wound half receives Oleogel-S10 ointment, the other wound half standard of care treatment. Wound healing progress is documented by photos which are assessed by expert reviewers blinded to the treatment of the wound halves.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients at least 18 years old who have provided written informed consent Presenting a splitthickness skin graft donor site wound with a minimum size of 15 cm2 and with a minimum width of 3 cm. Patient is able to understand the ICF provided and is prepared to comply with all study requirements, including the following: Visiting the trial site for wound dressing change and photo documentation every third or fourth day until both wound halves are closed (but no longer than 28 days after surgery). Willing to perform all necessary wound dressing changes at the trial site. Also the patient needs to agree to return to site for 3 and 12 months followup visits. Women of childbearing potential who are in the period between menarche and menopause must apply highly effective method of birth control (failure rate less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (e.g., implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner)). Birth control method must have been applied for at least 1 monthly cycle prior to first administration of study drug, be maintained during the study treatment phase and continued for at least 30 days after the last administration of study drug. Sexually active, nonvasectomized men must use a barrier method (condoms) during the treatment phase of this clinical trial. Diseases or conditions that could, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with the assessment of safety or efficacy. A skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or involves the areas to be examined in this trial. A history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to any of the drugs, surgical dressings or excipients to be used in this trial. Known multiple allergic disorders. Taking, or have taken, any investigational drugs within 3 months prior to the screening visit. Pregnant or breast feeding women are not allowed to participate in the study. Inappropriate to participate in the study, for any reason, in the opinion of the investigator. Mental incapacity or language barriers precluding adequate understanding the Informed consent form or cooperation or willingness to follow study procedures. Previous participation in this study. Employee at the investigational site, relative or spouse of the investigator.</criteria>
