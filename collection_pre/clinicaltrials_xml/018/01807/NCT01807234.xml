	<brief_title>Comparison of Ketorolac Nasal Spray to Sumatriptan Nasal Spray and Placebo for Acute Treatment of Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants are randomized to Ketorolac NS 31.5 mg, Sumatriptan NS 20 mg or placebo to treat three moderate to severe migraine attacks and switched treatments with each attack so that they received each treatment only once. For each treated attack (moderate to severe migraine attack), participants utilized two study treatments (A and B). Study treatment A administered as one spray in each nostril, and study treatment B administered as one spray in one nostril. Randomized to Ketorolac, A=Ketorolac, B=Placebo Randomized to Sumatriptan, A=Placebo, B=Sumatriptan Randomized to Placebo, A=Placebo, B=Placebo</detailed_description>
