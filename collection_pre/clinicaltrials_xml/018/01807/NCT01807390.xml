	<brief_summary>This study will examine the perspectives of patients' undergoing surgery for lung or esophageal cancer. It will examine both pre-op and post-op patient perspectives and opinions regarding pain and surgical complications. This study will also assess a general health related quality of life pre-op and post-op. Additionally, it will examine the importance of receiving care close to home and their support system. Hypotheses: 1. The data will allow investigators to better understand the willingness of patients to participate in prospective, randomized studies comparing minimally invasive and open thoracic surgery. Patients will not be willing to undergo randomization to an open versus minimally invasive surgical procedure. 2. The pain associated with Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) will be perceived and documented as lesser than open surgery. 3. Patients may be willing to accept a higher risk of complications or more post-operative pain if they were given the option to be cared for closer to their home.</brief_summary>
