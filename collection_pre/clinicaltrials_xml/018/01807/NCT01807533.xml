	<brief_summary>Four hypotheses will be tested in this study: 1. The intervention group performs better in child, parent and transactions outcomes than the control group throughout the follow-up period. 2. The intervention group shows greater changes in early neurophysiological brain functions and transactions within the family that lead to better neurodevelopmental outcomes than the control group. 3. Certain polymorphisms of the dopamine-related genes are associated with the neurodevelopmental outcomes in VLBW preterm infants. 4. Very low birth weight preterm infants carrying more genetic plasticity in the dopamine-related genes may benefit more from the interventions than those carrying less genetic plasticity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Family-Centered Intervention Program for Preterm Infants: Effects and Their Biosocial Pathways</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 250 VLBW preterm infants will be prospectively recruited at three medical centers in northern and southern Taiwan and will be randomly assigned to the FCIP or UCP group. Outcome assessments will include primary (child medical, growth and development) and secondary measures (parent and transactions within the family). The neurophysiological and transactions data will be examined for whether they mediate intervention effects on child development. In addition, these infants and 153 VLBW preterm infants in our prior intervention study will be collected buccal cells for assessment of the polymorphisms of dopamine-related genes, which are involved in the neurotransmission of cognitive, sensori-motor and behavioral-emotional systems and postulated to be associated with several developmental and psychiatric illnesses. The polymorphisms of dopamine-related genes will be examined for potential moderating influence on the effects of the intervention for child development.</detailed_description>
