	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin in Treating Patients With Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis or Mast Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the response rate to SGN-35 (brentuximab vedotin) in patients with tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8 (CD30+) advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM) (ASM or mast cell leukemia [MCL] with or without an associated hematological clonal non-mast cell lineage disease [AHNMD]). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of SGN-35 in patients with SM. II. To evaluate expression of CD30 on neoplastic mast cells before and during therapy with SGN-35. III. To evaluate changes in mastocytosis related symptom scores and quality of life (QOL) using a modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPNSAF). IV. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) and time to response (TTR). V. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). OUTLINE: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 1 year and then every 12 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>
