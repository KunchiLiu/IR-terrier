	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) after combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with melanoma that has spread to other places in the body. Biological therapies, such as TIL, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving TIL after combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes After Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Examine the anti-tumor efficacy of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma patients using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), and followed by adjuvant high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 (aldesleukin). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the in vivo persistence of transferred tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. II. Examine the safety of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in melanoma patients using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, preceded by a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and followed by adjuvant high-dose IL-2. III. Evaluate for molecular tumor markers and immunohistochemical features that correlate with in vivo persistence and anti-tumor efficacy. OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -7 to -6 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -5 to -1. Patients undergo TIL infusion over 30-60 minutes on day 0 and receive aldesleukin IV every 8 hours on days 1-5 for up to a maximum of 14 doses. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.</detailed_description>

if new lesions are present, principal investigator (PI) or designee should make final determination regarding enrollment Patients must have a site of metastatic disease that can be safely resected or biopsied for tissue sufficient for TIL harvest Step II Patients must have measurable metastatic melanoma Able to tolerate highdose cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and highdose IL2 ECOG performance status of 01 Patients must have brain imaging by MRI, CT or PET within 30 days prior to lymphodepletion; patients may have asymptomatic brain lesions that are =&lt; 1 cm each, lesions that are &gt; 1 cm that have been irradiated and in the opinion of the investigator no longer represents active disease will also be allowed A functional cardiac test (e.g., stress treadmill, stress thallium, multigated acquisition scan (MUGA), dobutamine echocardiogram) to rule out cardiac ischemia within 4 months prior to lymphodepletion is required for all patients Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are required of all patients within 4 months prior to lymphodepletion;
