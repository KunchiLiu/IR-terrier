	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of having induction chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. Patients with acute leukemia (AML) or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), at least 18 years of age will be examined. Treating eligible patients with induction chemotherapy in an outpatient setting may save in healthcare cost and improve a patients' quality of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the feasibility of outpatient induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by examining whether &gt; 50% of patients treated as outpatients can complete chemotherapy without being admitted to hospital or &lt; 5% of patients die within 14 days of beginning outpatient chemotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive outpatient induction chemotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed written informed consent The signed informed consent The benefits/risks of the induction chemotherapy regimen will be reviewed, and a second consent may be necessary if the regimen will be administered according to a separate protocol AML (acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL] excepted) or highrisk MDS (1019% blasts in marrow by morphology or flow cytometry or blood) Treatmentrelated mortality (TRM) score &lt; 9.21 corresponding to a TRM rate of 3% when chemotherapy of similar intensity as proposed here is administered to inpatients Blast count =&lt; 10,000 Fibrinogen &gt; 200 Afebrile with clear chest imaging and no signs of active viral, bacterial, fungal infection unless determined to be, at the discretion of the investigator, not clinically significant in the context of this study Adequate cardiac function as demonstrated by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% or greater, by multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiogram; no ongoing cardiac issues such as uncontrolled arrhythmias or unstable angina or congestive heart failure Patient must have an outpatient caregiver available Patient must live within 30 minutes of the treating physician's office during outpatient treatment Patient must be willing to return to the treating physician's office for outpatient followup once outpatient treatment is completed Logistical requirements: Space available in infusion room Outpatient infusion pump available if continuous infusion required Case discussed with infusion room nursing staff</criteria>
