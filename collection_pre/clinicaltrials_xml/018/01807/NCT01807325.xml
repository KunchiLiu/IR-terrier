	<brief_summary>The nature of cysts and solid masses in the pancreas can be difficult to diagnose. They may be benign, precancerous, or cancer. Current tests such as cytology (looking under a microscope) and tumor markers do not always give us the answer. The investigators are looking for genetic markers on biopsy specimens from the pancreas that will give us a better test for diagnosis. This study is only for diagnosing these lesions. The investigators are not treating any patients.</brief_summary>
