	<brief_summary>This is a randomized control trial comparing VenaSeal Sapheon Closure System with Radiofrequency Ablation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VenaSeal Sapheon Closure System Pivotal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the VenaSeal SCS as being both non-inferior to RF ablation therapy in achieving anatomical closure of lower extremity superficial truncal veins in patients with venous reflux through endovascular transcatheter embolization with coaptation of the great saphenous vein (GSV) and in the reduction of intraprocedural and post procedural pain and symptoms. The study will demonstrate safety of the VenaSeal SCS by follow-up visits that will evaluate via duplex ultrasound and physical exam the presence of deep vein thrombosis and or pulmonary embolus.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Age ≥21 years and ≤ 70 years of age at the time of screening 2. Reflux in the great saphenous vein (GSV) greater than 0.5 sec reflux 3. One or more of the following symptoms related to the target vein: aching, throbbing, heaviness, fatigue, pruritis, night cramps, restlessness, generalized pain or discomfort, swelling 4. GSV diameter while standing of 312 mm throughout the target vein as measured by Duplex ultrasound. 5. CEAP classification of C2 (if symptomatic) C4b 6. Ability to walk unassisted 7. Ability to attend followup visits 8. Ability to understand the requirements of the study and to provide informed consent. 1. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year 2. Active treatment for malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer 3. Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease with ABI &lt;0.89 4. Daily use of narcotic or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory pain medications to control pain associated with GSV reflux. 5. Current, regular use of systemic anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin, heparin) 6. Previous or suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolus (PE). 7. Previous superficial thrombophlebitis in GSV. 8. Previous treatment of venous disease in target limb, other than spider vein treatment. 9. Known hypercoagulable disorder. 10. Conditions which prevent vein treatment 11. Immobilization or inability to ambulate 12. Pregnant prior to enrollment 13. Tortuous GSV, which, in the opinion of the investigator, will limit catheter placement or require more than one primary access site. 14. Aneurysm of the target vein with local diameter &gt;12 mm 15. Significant, incompetent, ipsilateral small saphenous, intersaphenous or anterior accessory great saphenous vein(s). 16. Known sensitivity to cyanoacrylate (CA) adhesives. 17. Current participation in another clinical study involving an investigational agent or treatment, or within the 30 days prior to enrollment. 18. Patients who require bilateral treatment during the next 3 months 19. Patients who require additional ipsilateral treatments on the same leg within 3 months following treatment.</criteria>
