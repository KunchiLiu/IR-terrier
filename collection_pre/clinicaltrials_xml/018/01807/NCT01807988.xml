	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is to test whether Internet-based relapse prevention plus medication has a better protective effect compared to medication only, for persons with residual depressive symptoms who are currently in paid employment or in education. We hypothesise that during the two years following the intervention: - The persons in the group receiving Internet-based relapse prevention plus medication will be absent from work for fewer days due to sick-leave compared to those in the medication-only group. - Fewer persons in the group receiving Internet-based relapse prevention + medication will experience long term sick-leave (60 days or more) compared to those in the medication-only group. - The persons in the group receiving Internet-based relapse prevention plus medication will suffer fewer depressive relapses compared to those in the medication-only group. - At follow-up, the persons in the group receiving Internet-based relapse prevention plus medication will have higher health related quality of life and lower levels of depressive symptoms compared to those in the medication-only group.</brief_summary>
