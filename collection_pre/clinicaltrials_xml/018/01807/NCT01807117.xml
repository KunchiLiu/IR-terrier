	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET-computed tomography (CT) as diagnostic imaging in patients with colon and/or rectal cancer. New diagnostic imaging procedures, such as PET-MRI, may help find and diagnose rectal cancer or recurrence of colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET-MRI in Diagnosing Patients With Colon or Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To test the diagnostic performance of PET- MRI in the staging of preoperative high-grade rectal cancer patients, defined by T3 stage or higher or N1 stage or higher or presence of metastasis, that are referred to PET-CT and MRI. II. To test the diagnostic performance of PET-MRI the follow up of colorectal cancer patients that are referred to PET-CT with or without a diagnostic MRI request by their physicians. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To test different attenuation correction MR sequences and novel diagnostic MR sequences. OUTLINE: Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET-CT and PET-MRI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Either having a T3 (the cancer has grown through the muscularis propria and into the outermost layers of the colon or rectum but not through them) or higher, node positivity or metastatic lesion in the context of rectal cancer or being studied for colorectal cancer follow up, independent of the renal function PETCT should be requested by a referring physician; in the case of having an MR requested as well, it will be reported from the MRI images generated in the PETMRI Stable physical medical conditions to undergo a MRI Informed consent must be given and signed prior to study enrollment Refuse to give and/or sign the informed consent Subjects who do not meet the above mentioned inclusion criteria Subjects who have a pacemaker Subjects who have a metallic prostheses either in the pelvis or in the abdomen that will interfere with the MR imaging of that anatomical area Subjects who suffer from claustrophobia Pregnant women Cognitive impairment that affects the subject's ability to give consent</criteria>
