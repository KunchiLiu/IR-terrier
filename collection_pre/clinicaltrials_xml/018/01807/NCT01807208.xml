	<brief_summary>The goals of this study are two fold: 1) To learn whether a personalized patient health goal and reminder tool helps patients to learn more about their condition and to make changes in behavior and medication taking to reduce the risk of another heart attack. 2) To examine a blood sample to learn how patients are responding to their medications. The study team will enroll approximately 220 patients in the hospital recovering from a heart attack. Half of the patients will receive the educational tools and a copy will be sent to their outpatient provider.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PLATFORM to Maximize Patient Knowledge of Health Goals After Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of this study are two fold: 1) To evaluate the impact of a personalized patient health goal education and reminder tool on patient adherence to evidence based therapies and subsequent cardiovascular risk factor modification after acute myocardial infarction (AMI); 2) To assess age-related heterogeneity in antiplatelet response among AMI patients. This is a prospective study of ~220 AMI patients, with at least half over age 65 years. Patients will be surveyed with questionnaires (at baseline and 6 months post discharge) and biomarkers (baseline only) to assess the status of their physical function, depression, nutrition, inflammation, and response to antiplatelet therapies. Patients will also be administered a walking test and a grip strength test at baseline. About 1 week after hospital discharge, and again about 3 months after hospital discharge, about half of the patients and their outpatient providers will receive the personalized post-AMI health goal education and reminder tool on patient adherence to evidence-based secondary prevention therapies. Data will be analyzed in aggregate using descriptive statistics. The primary endpoint of interest is a composite measure of adherence at six months to secondary prevention therapies described as the sum of measures received divided by the sum of available opportunities. The secondary endpoint will be analyzed to describe platelet response profiles as a function of age. The study team anticipates the risks for this study to be minimal, since the patient does not receive any investigational therapies.</detailed_description>
