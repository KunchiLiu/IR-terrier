	<brief_summary>Proximal femoral fractures are most frequent traumatologic and orthopedic diagnoses undergoing surgery. It affect most seniors and accompanied by a series of complications. The aim of our retrospective clinical trial is to establish a thirty-day mortality rate after surgical solutions, mortality during hospitalization and compare the types of anesthesia chosen during the performance (general vs. subarachnoid anesthesia).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We evaluate relationship between the monitored parameters and 30 day survival. Observed parameters: - age of the patient - sex of the patient - 90 days mortality rate - American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score - time since injury and surgery (hours) - whether surgery was initiated during the day (7:00 - 20:00) or at night (20:00-07:00) - type of administered anesthesia (GA, epidural anaesthesia, Subarachnoid (spinal) block) - hemoglobin level prior to surgery - haemotransfusion administration during surgery - perioperative administration of vasopressors - anesthetist erudition (with / without accomplished residency) - surgeon erudition (with / without accomplished residency)</detailed_description>
