	<brief_title>Evaluating Ultrasound, Elastometry, Minilaparoscopy and Histology for the Diagnosis of Compensated Liver Cirrhosis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to now the gold standard for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis is to perform liver biopsy. This invasive methode is not undisputed. Therefore there is constant effort to improve, develop and apply better diagnostic tools. This study is designed to evaluate the in our eyes now a days most promising examinations: (1) high frequency ultrasound, (2) elastometry and (3) minilaparoscopy. Patients for whom the clinical decision to perform mini laparoscopic guided liver biopsy was taken should be recruited. Successive at three time points the examiner has to decide for or against cirrhosis: (1) after conventional and high frequency ultrasound (2) after elastometry and (3) after laparoscopy.</detailed_description>
