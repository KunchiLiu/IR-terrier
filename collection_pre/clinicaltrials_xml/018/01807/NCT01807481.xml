	<brief_summary>The primary objective of study is to evaluate the no of patients which maintain the Hb level between 9.0 ~ 12.0 g/dl during the evaluation period</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IV Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Mircera in PD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objective of study is - No of patients with mean Hb level of +/-1.0g/dl difference from the baseline Hb - Incidence of RBC transfusion during the titration and evaluation periods - Mean Hb during the total study period - Intrapatient Hb variability (mean within-patient standard deviation for Hb) - Frequency of Micera dose level - safety</detailed_description>
