	<brief_summary>This project is a partnership between Soar Technology, the University of Southern California (USC) Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families (CIR) and the USC Creative Media and Behavioral Health Center (CM&amp;BHC) to conduct a Safety and Effectiveness Study (SES) for an educational role-playing game developed by Soar Technology, Inc. The purpose of the intervention to be delivered by Soar Technology is to educate families and friends with the ultimate goal of empowering them to have a conversation with the veteran/service member about readjustment issues. The study will assess the safety and effectiveness of the provided game using personal interviews, play testing, and surveys. The game playing experience is hypothesized to be safe and effective with respect to having conversations with veterans/service members following deployment.</brief_summary>
