	<detailed_description>86 patients with an episode of major depression associated with bipolar disorder, type I will be recruited by two sites for the study over fifteen months. Medication will be administered in a double-blind manner. Patients will receive asenapine (or placebo) beginning on day 0 at 5 mg bid. Dose may be increased to 10 mg bid and adjusted based on clinical response. Patients will be evaluated by a blinded (to treatment status) rater. Patients will be seen and ratings obtained at baseline (day 0) and on days 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56 (or termination from the study). Adverse events will be evaluated as well.</detailed_description>
