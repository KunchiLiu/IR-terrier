	<brief_title>Biomarker Expression in Tissue Samples From Patients With Bone Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY SUBTYPE: Ancillary/Correlative OBSERVATIONAL STUDY MODEL: Case-only TIME PERSPECTIVE: Retrospective BIOSPECIMEN RETENTION: Samples without DNA BIOSPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Tissue samples obtained from Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) STUDY POPULATION DESCRIPTION: Patients enrolled on P9754 and AOST0121 clinical trials SAMPLING METHOD: Non-probability sample PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if there is differential expression of tumor factor (TF) among patients with osteosarcoma. II. To determine if there is an association between overall survival and disease free survival and the extent of TF expression. III. To determine if TF expression correlates with presence of gross metastatic disease at presentation, and development of subsequent metastases. OUTLINE: Tissue samples are analyzed for tumor factor expression levels by immunohistochemistry.</detailed_description>
