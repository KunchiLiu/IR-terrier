	<brief_summary>The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine factors associated with frequency and type of internet and mobile technology use among illegal drug users, specifically use of internet and text-messaging to obtain health care information and engage in health care utilization, specifically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment services. We will target high drug activity neighborhoods in New York City and enroll participants recruited through targeted street outreach. All participants (n=336) will undergo an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) that will assess sociodemographics, health care access and utilization, sex/drug use behavior, health status, and characteristics of general and health-related internet/mobile technology use including factors that promote or hinder use. Participants identified as using the internet â‰¥1/month (n=151) will return for a 4-week ACASI to report on use of the pilot website (which will largely display information currently available in the community in print/ pamphlet/ video form).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At the enrollment visit participants deemed eligible after screening will be consented, and given a 30 minute baseline ACASI survey. At the end of the baseline visit, those participants who reported internet use at least 1x/month (in the past month) will be offered participation in the Pilot Website Evaluation Component. For this component, participants will be instructed on how to use an educational website with health resources. Their use of the website will be tracked. They will be given an appointment to return in 4-weeks for a follow up survey at the pharmacy and a 2-week locator call.</detailed_description>
