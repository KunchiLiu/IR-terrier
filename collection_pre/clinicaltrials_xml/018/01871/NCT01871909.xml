	<brief_summary>Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is a laboratory model used to study hemorrhage in humans. The investigators hypothesize that the physiologic changes that occur with application of LBNP mimic those observed in bleeding and hemodynamically unstable trauma patients, and that LBNP is a truly valid model of human hemorrhage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) Model of Human Hemorrhage in Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific aims: 1. Compare physiologic waveform data obtained from bleeding and hemodynamically unstable trauma patients to existing data collected from LBNP subjects. 2. Determine the accuracy of LBNP in approximating the physiologic changes that occur in bleeding and hemodynamically unstable trauma patients.</detailed_description>
