	<brief_summary>To study the effects of early exercise training in hospitalized patients for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation (COPD). Interventions are randomized. In one group, early exercise training (aerobic and strength) during hospitalization for COPD exacerbation followed by exercise training at home until 90 days to discharge and in the other the intervention is usual care. In both group, usual respiratory physiotherapy techniques during hospitalization and adequate physical activity recommendations have been included. The main variable is the presence of a new COPD exacerbation according to Global Initiative for COPD (GOLD guidelines) with a minimum of 12 months-follow up.</brief_summary>
