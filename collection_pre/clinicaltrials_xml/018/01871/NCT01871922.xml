	<brief_summary>Remifentanil is a widely used potent intravenous opioid with the advantage of having a short time of action. Compared to other opiates however remifentanil generates more intense hemodynamic side-effects. In ophthalmic surgery the specific anesthesiological challenges necessitate the administration of a combination of relatively high doses of analgesics on the one hand and a short time for postoperative recovery from anesthesia on the other. For these reasons, anesthetic management often consists of a combination of relatively high doses of propofol and remifentanil. A primary concern during this deep propofol/remifentanil anesthesia is preserving hemodynamic stability and adequate tissue oxygenation. Previous research of the investigators group has revealed that atropine has an exceptionally beneficial effect on hemodynamics as well as on tissue oxygenation. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that administration of intravenous atropine during induction of propofol/remifentanil may have a positive effect on the hemodynamic profile and peripheral and cerebral tissue oxygenation during and after induction of anesthesia.</brief_summary>
