	<brief_summary>Systems for blood glucose monitoring with glucose oxidase enzyme reaction on test strips can be affected by the partial pressure of oxygen of the blood sample. In this study, we investigate the influence of different partial pressure of oxygen in blood samples on measurement results. Systems with labelled oxygen-dependency as well as systems without labelled oxygen-dependency are evaluated.</brief_summary>
