	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Effect of Food Intake on the Plasma Concentration Changes of Quetiapine After Oral Administration of FK949E in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 3-way cross-over study.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Quetiapine Fumarate</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Body weight : ≥50.0 kg, &lt;85.0 kg Body Mass Index : ≥17.6, &lt;26.4 Healthy, as judged by the investigator/subinvestigator based on the results of physical examinations (subjective symptoms and objective findings) and all tests obtained at screening and during the period from hospital admission in Period 1 to immediately before study medication Subjects with the following history. 1. Hepatic disease (e.g. viral hepatitis, druginduced liver injury). 2. Heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, arrhythmia requiring treatment). 3. Respiratory disease (e.g. serious bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis) 4. Gastrointestinal disease (e.g. serious peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux esophagitis; diseases requiring several selections except for appendicitis) 5. Renal disease (e.g. acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis). 6. Cerebrovascular disorder (e.g. cerebral infarction). 7. Malignant tumor. 8. Drug allergies. Allergic disorders (except for hay fever) 9. Any use of drugs abuse. Alcohol abuse Any concurrent illness (except for caries) A deviation from the normal reference range of blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, or 12lead ECG at screening or upon admission in Period 1 (day preceding the day of study medication). Any deviation of the following criteria for clinical laboratory tests at screening or upon admission in Period 1 (day preceding the day of study medication). The normal reference ranges specified at the study site will be used as the normal reference ranges in the present study. 1. Hematology: A deviation of ±20% from the upper or lower limit of the normal range 2. Blood biochemistry: A deviation from the normal range for AST, ALT, creatinine (Cre), or serum electrolytes. A deviation of ±20% from the upper or lower limit of the normal range for other items than the above. However, the lower limit of the normal range will not be established for items for which a deviation from the lower limit is not considered clinically significant[AST, ALT, total bilirubin (TBil), ALP, γGTP, LDH, CK, Cre, uric acid (UA)and total cholesterol (TCho)]. 3. Urinalysis: UGlu, UPro ≥+1 UUro ≥+2 4. Urinary drug test: A positive result for phencyclidine, benzodiazepine, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis, opiates, barbiturates or tricyclic antidepressants 5. Immunological test: A positive result for HBs antigen, HCV antibody, syphilis, or HIV antigen/antibody Received medication within 14 days before hospital admission in Period 1 or is scheduled to receive medication Received any investigational drugs in other clinical or postmarketing studies within 120 days before the screening assessment Previous treatment with FK949E Donated more than 400 mL of whole blood within 90 days, more than 200 mL of whole blood within 30 days, or blood components within 14 days before the screening assessment Excessive smoking or drinking habit (measure of "excessive": alcohol: 45 g/day [a 633 mL bottle of beer contains 25 g of alcohol, and 180 mL of Japanese sake contains 22 g of alcohol], smoking: 20 cigarettes/day).
