	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of E7777 (improved purity ONTAK) in patients with persistent and recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A lead-in dose-finding part will be used to determine the dose of E7777 that should be used to test efficacy and safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of E7777 in Persistent and Recurrent Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of E7777 in participants with recurrent or persistent Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL). The study will consist of an initial lead-in phase (in which a dose of E7777 will be selected), followed by the Main Study. Participants will move through three phases while on study: Pretreatment Phase, Treatment Phase, and Extension Phase and a Follow-up Period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study: 1. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. 2. Histopathologic diagnosis of CTCL (mycosis fungoides [MF] or Sezary Syndrome [SS]), confirmed by skin biopsy, or lymph node, or blood assessment, of current disease. 3. CD25 assaypositive tumor, defined as detectable CD25 on greater than or equal to 20% of total lymphoid infiltrate in biopsied skin lesions by immunohistochemistry. 4. CTCL disease stage at study entry as follows, according to ISCL/EORTC (Olsen 2011). LeadIn Phase: Stage IA IV, except participants with CNS involvement. Main Study: Stage IA IVA1 (excludes IVA2 and IVB), as follows: However, only N0 and N1 are allowed; Excludes known CTCL involvement of the bone marrow 5. History of prior therapies for CTCL as follows: must have had prior therapy, any number of prior therapies allowed. Topical treatments (except topical chemotherapy) and steroids are not considered as prior therapies. 6. A minimum washout period of 4 weeks after previous CTCL therapy is recommended before the first dose of E7777. 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2 in the LeadIn Phase and performance status of 0 or 1 in the Main Study. 8. Life expectancy greater than or equal to 3 months in the LeadIn Phase and greater than or equal to 12 months in the Main Study. 9. Adequate bone marrow reserves as evidenced by: platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3 (100 x 10^9/L) clinically stable hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL (90 g/L) and hematocrit greater than or equal to 27% without transfusion support 10. Normal hepatic function as evidenced by: bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 1 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 75 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 100 U/L. albumin greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL (30 g/L). 11. Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.8 mg/dL (158 umol/L) OR calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/min (per the CockcroftGault formula) with less than 2+ protein OR 24 hour urine creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/minute with 24 hour urine protein less than 1g. 12. Provide written informed consent prior to any studyspecific screening procedures. Exclusion Criteria Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 1. CTCL disease with CNS involvement 2. Prior denileukin diftitox therapy 3. Use of topical steroids within 14 days of Day 1 of initial therapy is not allowed, 4. Prior malignancy other than CTCL within past 5 years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) 5. Major surgery within 2 weeks of study enrollment 6. Significant or uncontrolled infections requiring specific antiinfective therapy 7. Females who are pregnant (positive urine test) or breastfeeding 8. Any history of a medical condition or a concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the participant's ability to safely complete the study.</criteria>
