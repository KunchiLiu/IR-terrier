	<brief_summary>Vitamin D deficiency is common after bariatric surgery. This study is designed to determine if a high dose monthly supplement of vitamin D 3 will be effective in helping improve vitamin D status after surgery such as gastric bypass. Bariatric surgery subjects taking monthly high dose cholecalciferol supplements in addition to the standard vitamin D protocol will have a significant rise in serum vitamin D levels compared to the subjects taking only the usual vitamin D protocol.</brief_summary>
