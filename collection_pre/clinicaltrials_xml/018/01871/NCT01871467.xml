	<brief_summary>Previous studies have demonstrated a deficiency of blood dendritic cells in patients with kidney disease that is associated with the development of viral infections after kidney transplantation. We plan to test the ability of sargramostim to increase blood dendritic cell levels in patients with kidney disease in the hopes of developing new therapies to prevent viral infections after kidney transplantation.</brief_summary>
