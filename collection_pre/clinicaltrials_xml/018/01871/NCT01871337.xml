	<brief_summary>This study will examine whether the Paula method is an effective treatment for UI and the correlating LUTD symptoms. We assume that the Paula method, a simple, non-aerobic exercise method that significantly decreased urinary incontinence in women with MIX in two randomized controlled trials, would also be effective in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients with UI. The secondary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness in terms of MS general physical functioning, quality of life and sexual function and to detect adherence and continuity six months post intervention.</brief_summary>
