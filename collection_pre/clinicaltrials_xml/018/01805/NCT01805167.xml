	<brief_summary>Differences in speech-understanding and the quality of the subjective perception among cochlear implant patients (Digisonic SP) depends on numerous factors. The electrical field distribution (interaction between electrodes) could also explain the disparity of the performances? The objective of our study was to quantify the influence of the electrical field interactions between the channels of stimulation according to the vocal performances of the implanted subjects, for various subjective levels of electric stimulation.</brief_summary>
