	<brief_summary>Prior to surgery, gynecologists and urogynecologists have routinely prescribed preoperative mechanical bowel preparations in attempts to decrease the risk of infection, while also providing easier bowel manipulation and better visualization during surgery. However, many of these proposed benefits have never been proven, and usage of bowel preparations amongst surgeons remains highly variable. In both the general surgery and gynecology literature, researchers have begun to question the need for the vigorous preparations. Aside from surgical visualization, urogynecologists have additional concerns about how bowel preparations may impact postoperative bowel function given up to half of women with pelvic floor disorders have baseline constipation and straining is known to impact surgical recovery. Many studies have addressed various postoperative fiber and laxative preparations in attempts to improve postoperative bowel-related symptomatology, but none have specifically looked at preoperative bowel preparations. This study aims to determine if mechanical bowel preparation prior to minimally invasive sacral colpopexy affects patients' postoperative recovery, specifically related to bowel symptomatology; operative or post-operative complications; surgeons' perceptions of surgical difficulty directly attributed to the bowel; and post-operative return of normal bowel function.</brief_summary>
