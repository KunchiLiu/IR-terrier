	<brief_title>Qing'E Formula Therapy on Menopausal Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether a Chinese medicine formula (Qing'E, composed of eucommia, psoralen, walnuts and garlic) is effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms. 240 Chinese women with menopausal symptoms will be recruited and randomized into two groups. One is treatment group with 12 weeks of Qing'E pills (well-controlled), the other is controlled group with 12 weeks of placebo. The treatment outcome measures include: 1) the severity of menopausal symptoms: self-recording of daily frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes), the Kupperman index. 2) NEI network indices. 3) Urine metabolomics. All measures are conducted at baseline and endpoint except the self-recoding of vasomotor symptoms, Kupperman index and urine metabolomics. Tyhe investigators expect this research will provide an effective and safe therapy for menopausal symptoms.</detailed_description>
