	<brief_title>Misoprostol Administration Before Operative Hysteroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The route of administration of misoprostol for cervical dilatation prior to operative hysteroscopy can be oral, vaginal, or sublingual. However, it is still unclear which route is more effective and less harmful for cervical dilation prior to operative hysteroscopy in premenopausal women. Furthermore, there have been no studies comparing among oral, sublingual, and vaginal misoprostol, no medication (control) in these women. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral, sublingual, vaginal, and no misoprostol prior to operative hysteroscopy in premenopausal women.</detailed_description>
