	<brief_title>Advance Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who are implanted CRT devices will be enrolled in the study. Once implanted, all patients will be followed at every 3 months for the first 12 months from the implant. The responder/non-responder evaluation will occur at 6 months from the implant date. The criteria used for determining the response to CRT will be captured. During the office follow-up visits, arrhythmic episode diagnoses, device data and stored electrogram will be collected. All clinical events such as hospitalization for HF, all-cause hospitalizations, and all-cause death will also be collected. For patients who are non-responders to CRT, any re-optimization of the device, i.e., AV/VV interval optimization, LV lead repositioning and pacing vector reconfiguration as well as modified/new clinical therapies administered in an attempt to improve HF condition will be collected.</detailed_description>
