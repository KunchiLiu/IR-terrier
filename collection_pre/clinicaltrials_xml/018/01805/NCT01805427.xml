	<brief_summary>The concentration of the third agent in antiretroviral therapy [Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), or boosted Protease inhibitor (PI) ] is different according to the body weight or body composition and therapeutic monitoring may be necessary in overweight HIV patients. The investigators aim at measuring the individual trough concentrations of interest [at steady state for NNRTI and boosted PI] in overweight and normal weight HIV+ patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antiretroviral Therapy and Extreme Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our primary endpoint is the individual trough concentrations of interest at steady state for NNRTI or boosted PI; Principal outcome measure: comparison of the concentrations between patients &lt;25kg/m2 and patients&lt;25kg/m2 Secondary endpoints: - Occurrence of virologic failure - Occurrence of clinical/biological adverse events - Percentage of patients with concentration within the therapeutic range - Body composition Secondary outcome measures: comparison of the occurrence of virologic failure, occurrence or adverse event, patients with concentration within the therapeutic range between groups. Correlation between body composition and concentration. Methodology, study design: open-labelled monocentric study. Sample size: It will be a descriptive experimental study involving 120 overweight subjects, 120 normal weight subjects Inclusion criteria : - Patients with HIV+ - Patients aged more than 18 years old. - Patient giving its well-informed and free consent. Study design : Plasma concentration was performed during the usual clinical follow-up. Study duration: 12 months Duration for a patient: 1 day Investigating center and participating units: one center enrolling the patients and the lab performing drug dosages.</detailed_description>
