	<brief_summary>Transabdominal ultrasound guidance is the golden standard for embryo transfers. Transvaginal ultrasound guidance was proposed recently to provide better visualization and reduce patient discomfort as embryo transfer can be performed with an empty bladder in this case. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are any differences between transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound-guided embryo transfer in terms of ease of use, patient satisfaction, and treatment outcome.</brief_summary>
