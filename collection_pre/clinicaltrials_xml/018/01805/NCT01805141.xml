	<brief_summary>The investigators hope to learn whether perfusion CT is a useful way to assess primary cervical tumor microenvironment and whether there is a relationship between pretreatment perfusion CT measurements and primary cervical tumor size, lymph node involvement (as assessed by standard of care pretreatment fludeoxyglucose Positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT)), and treatment response (as assessed by standard of care 3-month post-therapy FDG-PET/CT).</brief_summary>
