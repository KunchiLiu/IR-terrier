	<brief_title>Aflibercept Injection for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who need Pars Plana Vitrectomy surgery, and agree to participate in this study will receive an injection of 2.0mg aflibercept 4 to 6 days before Vitrectomy surgery. Half of these patients will be randomized to receive another injection of 2.0mg aflibercept immediately after their surgery. Postoperative patient visits in this study will be at 1 day, and at weeks 1, 4, 16 and 24, and at any other times as deemed necessary by the Investigator.</detailed_description>
