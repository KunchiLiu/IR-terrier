	<brief_summary>Among the risk factors for lower limb osteoarthritis, if obesity is probably the most studied, digital osteoarthritis received increasing interest in recent years. Recent publications have highlighted a link between obesity and digital osteoarthritis, but also a very probable link between digital osteoarthritis and structural progression of knee osteoarthritis. Few data including hip exist and need to be confirmed on larger scale studies. We have with "Khoala" a national multiregional cohort of symptomatic gonarthrosis and coxarthrosis representative of the general population (which is rarely the case in the literature) including X ray, clinical and biological follow-up (hips and / or knees).</brief_summary>
