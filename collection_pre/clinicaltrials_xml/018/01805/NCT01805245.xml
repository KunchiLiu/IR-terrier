	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of stress reduction on physiological and psychological variables in adults with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who have moderate to severe levels of diabetes-related emotional distress. Subjects will be randomized to one of two interventions. We will evaluate the impact of the interventions on glucose metabolism, blood pressure, diabetes-related distress and quality of life. Additionally, we will investigate the role of neuroendocrine dysfunction, systemic inflammation and diabetes self-care practices as mediators in the relationship between increased stress, adverse glucose metabolism and elevated blood pressure in those subjects with T2DM.</brief_summary>
