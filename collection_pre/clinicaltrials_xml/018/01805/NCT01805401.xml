	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators aim to assess whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; a safe and non-invasive method for modulating the activity of specific brain regions) when applied over the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is able to modulate decision-making and impulse control in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>tDCS Applied to the OFC: Effects on Decision-Making and Impulse Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this single-blind, three-arm and sham-controlled study, we will assess whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; a safe and non-invasive method for modulating the activity of specific brain regions) when applied over the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is able to modulate decision-making and impulse control in healthy volunteers. We hypothesize that tDCS applied to the OFC, in comparison to sham tDCS, will significantly enhance decision-making and impulse control. For this study we will enroll 45 healthy individuals aged 18-60 years. These individuals will be assessed with a battery of computerized tasks as well as clinician-administered and self-reported questionnaires on depression and anxiety. Assessments will be carried out before and after a single 30-minute tDCS session.</detailed_description>
