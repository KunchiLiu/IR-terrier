	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Spectra Optia PMN Cell Collection Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare the procedures for the collection of granulocyte/ polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells on Terumo BCT's Spectra Optia® and COBE® Spectra Apheresis Systems and to establish the non-inferiority of the Spectra Optia Apheresis System with respect to the primary study endpoint, granulocyte/PMN cell collection efficiency.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Acceptable health status and vital signs per the AABB blood donation guidelines to permit blood donation, including: 1. Blood pressure ≥ 90/50 and ≤ 200/120 mmHg, 2. Pulse &gt; 40 and &lt; 100 beats/min, and 3. Temperature &lt; 99.5ºFahrenheit (F). Able to read, understand, and sign an English informed consent form. Age ≥ 18 years. Weight ≥ 50kg and &lt; 227kg. Male or nonpregnant, nonnursing female (a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to each mobilization). Acceptable screening laboratory test results prior to the first PMN cell mobilization, including: 1. WBC count in the range: 3,50010,800/uL, 2. Hematocrit in the range: 3865%, 3. Platelet count in the range: 150,000400,000/uL, 4. Coagulation tests: PT not greater than 1.1 times the upper limit of the local laboratory reference range; PTT not greater than 1.2 times the upper limit of the local laboratory reference range, 5. Serum electrolyte concentrations: potassium in the range 3.65.1 mmol/L; calcium in the range 8.510.3 mg/dL, 6. Serum creatinine not greater than 1.5mg/dL, and 7. ALT not greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the local laboratory reference range. *** Up to two (2) of the above screening laboratory test results may fall outside of these ranges, if in the judgment of the principal investigator or designee, they do not constitute a significant risk to the subject. Any excused deviations from the above will be listed and summarized with the final report.*** Adequate dual peripheral venous access to allow collection of granulocytes (PMN cells) and return of remaining cells, platelets and plasma. If male, willing to use a condom during sexual relations with a female partner of child bearing potential until 48 hours following each GCSF injection. If female, willing to use a medicallyacceptable contraceptive until 48 hours following each GCSF injection. Positive screening for any of the following: HIV, HBV (except isolated HB core Ab reactivity), HCV, HTLV, Syphilis or West Nile Virus. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding. Collection or loss of specific volumes of whole blood or blood components during specified timeframes: 1. more than 550mL of whole blood within the prior 56 days, or 2. more than 3L of whole blood or 1.5L of red blood cells within the prior 12 months, or 3. more than 12L of plasma within the prior 12 months, or 4. a leukapheresis within the prior six weeks, or 5. a plateletpheresis within the prior 48 hours or two within the prior 7 days or twentyfour within the last 12 months, or 6. a plasmapheresis within the prior 48 hours or two within the prior 7 days. History of congestive heart failure. History of uncontrolled hypertension (SBP/DBP &gt;200/120 mmHg). History or suspicion of active, peptic ulcer disease. History of diabetes mellitus. History of hematologic malignancy or chronic hematologic disorder. Family history (parents, siblings, children) of hematologic malignancy. History of deep vein thrombosis or venous thromboembolism, or bleeding disorder. History of sickle cell disease or a positive SickleDex screen. History of iritis or episcleritis. History of autoimmune condition or disorder, unless approved by principal investigator. Presence of psychological traits, or physiological or medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unlikely to tolerate the procedures or complete the study. History of use/anticipated need for lithium. Received a GCSF injection in the prior 4 months. Known hypersensitivity to ethylene oxide. Known hypersensitivity to GCSF or hypersensitivity to any E. coliderived products. Known hypersensitivity to HES or corn. Concurrent participation in another clinical trial or participation in a clinical trial within the past 30 days. Subject is being treated with calcium channel blockers and/or antiepileptic medications. Note: This applies only to Subjects at Bonfils Blood Center whose collected product will undergo neutrophil function testing.</criteria>
