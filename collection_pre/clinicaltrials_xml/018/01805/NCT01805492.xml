	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize changes in gene and protein expression in peripheral blood in patients with, or at risk for, heart disease during an intensive lifestyle modification program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Global Profiling of Gene and Protein Expression Associated With Coronary Heart Disease Reversal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will use an integrated approach that examines DNA variation and the functional products of genes at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels to provide a global view of molecular changes associated with drastic lifestyle modifications designed to reverse coronary heart disease (CHD). DNA variants and/or changes in gene and protein expression associated with CHD reversal may provide important clues to understanding molecular mechanisms of subclinical CHD development and progression.</detailed_description>
