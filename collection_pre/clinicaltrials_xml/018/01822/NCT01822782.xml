For this, the primary endpoint will be the proportion of vaginal lesions according to the presence or absence of abnormal vaginal flora. A more precise qualitative and quantitative study of vaginal flora isolated from pregnant women and its association with vaginal lesions will also be conducted.</brief_summary>
