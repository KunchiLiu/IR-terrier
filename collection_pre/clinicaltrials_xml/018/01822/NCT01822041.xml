	<brief_title>14C-ARN-509 Microtracer Label AME and Absolute BA Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two cohorts of 6 healthy volunteers will be enrolled for the AME and absolute BA parts, respectively. The dose for both cohorts is 240 mg. The expected exposure of the dose is 7-fold lower than the steady state reached in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.</detailed_description>
