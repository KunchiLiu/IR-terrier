	<brief_summary>Human Adenovirus-specific T-cells can persist and augment impaired adenovirus immune response post allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant, and reduce the requirement for antiviral therapy without toxicity or increasing the occurrence of Graft Versus Host Disease. This is a Phase I/IIa open-label safety study, assessing the effects of administering adenovirus-specific T-cells (Cytovir ADV) to paediatric patients post haematopoietic stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
