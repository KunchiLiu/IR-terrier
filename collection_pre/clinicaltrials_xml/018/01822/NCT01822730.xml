	<brief_summary>Methamphetamine-associated psychosis (MAP) has been considered a pharmacological or environmental pathogen model of schizophrenia (SCZ) due in part to similarities in clinical presentation (i.e. paranoia, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms), response to treatment (e.g.neuroleptics),and pathologic mechanisms (e.g. central dopaminergic neurotransmission) of both conditions. Both paliperidone and risperidone are second generation antipsychoticsï¼Œbut have same pharmacological effects of antipsychotic treatment and paliperidone may have more efficacy and safty.This study was designed to examine the acute efficacy, safety, and tolerability of paliperidone and risperidone for patients with MAP.</brief_summary>
