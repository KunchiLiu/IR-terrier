	<brief_summary>Obesity is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialised world. Evidence is growing that early life nutrition can play a role in behavioural and cognitive problems in children and adolescents and is well documented that being overweight and obese during childhood can have short- and long-term physical and psycho-social health implications. This is an individually randomised trial to evaluate the efficacy of a family pediatrician-lead counselling intervention in reducing the BMI of over-weight children aged 4-7 years old. As secondary objectives the investigators evaluate the effect of the counselling on dietary behaviours and physical activity. The investigators targeted the intervention to overweight children, while obese children were referred to specialised care. The counselling targeted diet, physical activity, and sedentary behaviours.</brief_summary>
