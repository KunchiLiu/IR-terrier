	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: The primary objective is to validate previously identified predictive/prognostic genomic DNA and expression biomarkers of response to combination bvz treatments in K-ras mutant advanced CRC (a CRC) or metastatic CRC (mCRC). Secondary Objective: 1. To test the efficacy of bvz in combination with FOLFOX in patients with newly diagnosed advanced or metastatic K-ras mutant CRC and 2. To determine the progression free and overall survival of patients under first line FOLFOX + bvz in aCRC or mCRC.</brief_summary>
