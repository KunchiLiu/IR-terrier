	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to find out whether a method of nonvisual foot inspection, using the senses of touch and smell, helps people with diabetes and visual impairment to find new foot problems when they are in early, easily-treated stages. All people in the study had regular foot inspections by podiatrists. The results include how people feel about the method, whether they actually did check their feet it, and whether the method helped them to discover foot problems themselves.</brief_summary>
