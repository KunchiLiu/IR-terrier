	<brief_summary>Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects female children. Rett syndrome is characterized by significant elevation in blood markers of oxidative stress. EPI-743 is a novel therapeutic with demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of disorders characterized by oxidative stress. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of EPI-743 in a population of children with Rett syndrome.</brief_summary>
