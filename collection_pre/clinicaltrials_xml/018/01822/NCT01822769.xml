	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that participation in a formal cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program improves aerobic exercise capacity and quality of life over the medium term for patients with congenital heart disease with reduced exercise capacity. To test this hypothesis, subjects will be randomized to either receive a 12-week cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program or standard of care, with interval testing of aerobic capacity and other physiologic markers improved fitness, as well as assessment of quality of life.</brief_summary>
