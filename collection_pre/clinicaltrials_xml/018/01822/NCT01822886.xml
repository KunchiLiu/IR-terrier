	<brief_summary>Pilot clinical trial - Phase 2a, multicenter, single arm, open label trial - to evaluate efficacy and safety of concomitant combination treatment with Gemcitabine and Romidepsin (GEMRO) regimen as salvage treatment in relapsed/refractory PTCL in a selected population of patients. Objectives will be focused on preliminary dose-response, type of patients, frequency of dosing, and safety and tolerability profile.</brief_summary>
