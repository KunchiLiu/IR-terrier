	<brief_summary>The research evaluates the use of online versions of delivering an effective psychological treatment for children clinically referred for serious oppositional, aggressive, and antisocial behavior. The goal is to develop models of delivery that reach families in need that are not being served by in-person treatment. The project has immediate implications for the treatment of children but more generally addresses several issues critical to treatments that are based on Internet, telepsychiatry, and related technologies.</brief_summary>
