	<brief_title>Treating Cocaine Abuse: A Behavioral Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment development for cocaine dependence often proceeds without effort to adapt treatment parameters to patient characteristics. Such a one-size-fits-all approach is problematic because of the heterogeneity of the clinical population. Additionally, the approach is often subject to opposing biases either towards constraining costs or maximizing efficacy. This project includes two sequential clinical trails examining variations of the CRA + Vouchers treatment for cocaine dependence that are designed to explore matching treatment parameters to patient baseline characteristics known to moderate treatment response among cocaine-dependent outpatients. In Trial 1, all patients were randomly assigned to receive 24 weeks of CRA therapy but randomly assigned to one of three voucher-based incentive conditions: (a) 6 weeks of vouchers contingent on abstinence and incentive monetary value at usual level; (b) 6 weeks of vouchers contingent on abstinence but incentive value set at usual level for low-severity patients (intranasal cocaine users or married patients) and at twice the usual value for high severity patients (i.e., unmarried cocaine smokers/injectors), or to (c) a control condition where incentives were provided independent of recent cocaine use. In Trial 2, all patients receive 12 weeks of abstinence-contingent incentives, but randomly assigned to also receive (a) 24 weeks of CRA therapy or (b) 4 weeks of CRA therapy. The overarching goal of the two trials is to strike a balance between the aforementioned biases towards constraining costs or maximizing efficacy and thereby facilitate cost containment without compromising efficacy, especially among more severe patients.</detailed_description>
