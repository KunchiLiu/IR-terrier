	<brief_summary>The main objective is to evaluate an osteopathic compression of pterygopalatine node in healthy subjects and patients suffering from obstructive apnea syndrome (OSA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osteopathy and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteopathic compression will be compared to a sham manoeuvre in a cross over design on apnea hypopnea index, pharyngeal collapsibility and symptoms in patients suffering from OSA, and on symptoms and pharyngeal collapsibility in healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
