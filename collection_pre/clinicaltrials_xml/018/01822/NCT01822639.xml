	<brief_summary>The study is designed to estimate the bioavailability of amlodipine and enalapril maleate fixed dose combination (FDC) relative to co-administration of amlodipine and enalapril maleate tablets. The rational for this study is to provide a more convenient dosing regimen for patients. This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study, in which 16 healthy adult male and female subjects will be enrolled and dosed under fasting conditions. Each subject will participate in two treatment periods of 7 days each. There will be at least 14 days of wash out period between the two dosing periods and a follow-up period of up to 21 days after treatment period 2. The total duration of study will be approximately 35 days from the start of the first treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Male or female aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator, in consultation with the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor if required, agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) and Body Mass Index within the range 19 to 32 kg/meter squared (m^2) (inclusive). A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy [for this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt; 40 milli international unit (MlU)/ milliliter (mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/mL (&lt;147 picomoles/liter) is confirmatory]. OR Childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human chorionic gonadotropin test at screening or prior to dosing. Agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until the followup contact visit. OR has only samesex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until the followup contact visit. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35 percent). Based on single or averaged QT duration corrected for heart rate (QTc) values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs)obtained over a brief recording period: QTc by Fridericia's formula &lt;450 millisecond (msec). Exclusion Criteria Based Upon Medical Histories Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (With the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as An average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. In Australia one unit (=standard drink) is equivalent to 10 grams of alcohol: 270 mL of full strength beer (4.8 percent), 375 mL of mid strength beer (3.5 percent), 470mL of light beer (2.7 percent), 250 mL premix full strength spirit (5 percent), 100 mL of wine (13.5 percent) and 30 mL of spirit (40 percent). History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Exclusion Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for human immuno virus antibody. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test at screening or at any other time points. Any subject with a systolic blood pressure &lt;95 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) or with a recent history of postural symptoms. Orthostatic event at screening, defined as a symptomatic event (i.e. dizziness or any pre syncope or syncope) and a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 20mmHg or more and/or a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more for standing versus supine measurement. Other Exclusion Criteria Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Lactating females. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated. Positive carbon monoxide on admission to the Unit. Unable to refrain from consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice (and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices) from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication.</criteria>
