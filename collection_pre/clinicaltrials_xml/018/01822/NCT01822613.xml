	<criteria>Histologically confirmed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) No more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for recurrent or metastatic ESCC (for Phase II only). Progression during or after platinumbased therapy for recurrent or metastatic ESCC, or recurrence within 6 months of platinumbased chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for localized disease. Patients who received prior phosphoinositide3kinase (PI3K) inhibitor or antireceptor tyrosineprotein kinase erbB3 (ERBB3 or HER3) antibody treatment, including bispecific antibodies with HER3 as one of the targets (patients with prior exposure to pertuzumab or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)targeted agents are eligible) Patients who do not have an archival or fresh tumor sample (or sections of it) available or readily obtainable. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastatic involvement. Patients who have received prior systemic anticancer treatment, such as cyclical chemotherapy or biological therapy within a period of time that is shorter than the cycle length used for that treatment (e.g. 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycinC) prior to starting study treatment. Patients who have received definitive radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy and/or from whom ≥ 30% of the bone marrow was irradiated. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
