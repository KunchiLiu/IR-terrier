	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is the global risk-benefit assessment of Cerebrolysin as compared to donepezil in patients with mild to moderate dementia of Alzheimer's Type (DAT). In addition, a traditional approach will be taken based on the evaluation of the separate risk and benefit domains in comparison with donepezil. Global risk-benefit as compared to donepezil will be analyzed by determining whether the Cerebrolysin group shows a statistically significant non-inferiority with regard to the combined primary safety and efficacy endpoints (weighted multivariate ensemble). The endpoints will be combined by a global multivariate non-parametric procedure, weighting the safety and efficacy part 50:50.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebrolysin Compared to Donepezil in Patients With Mild to Moderate Dementia of Alzheimer's Type (DAT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase IIIb/IV trial involves patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease in Europe, Canada and Latin America and is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, double-dummy trial. The study endpoint is after 24 weeks. In total, five visits are scheduled in this trial and a follow-up phone call is performed 4 weeks after Visit 5 (Week 24). The first visit (Screening Visit, Visit 1) identifies participants who are eligible for and interested in this trial.Efficacy and safety parameters are assessed at the Baseline Visit (Visit 2), in Week 6-7 (Visit 3), Week 14-15 (Visit 4) and Week 24 (Visit 5).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female patients ≥50 years of age Diagnosis of probable mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease according to DSMIVTR and NINCDSADRDA criteria (see section 18.2.1) Screening MMSE score between 15 and 24, both inclusive Modified Hachinski Ischemic score of ≤4 Hamilton Depression Scale score ≤10 Brain computerized tomography (CT) or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans within 12 months prior to screening without evidence of infection, infarction, or other focal lesions and without clinical symptoms suggestive of intervening neurological disease. If no brain CT or brain MRI is available, a brain MRI shall be performed to exclude other causes of dementialike syndromes. Sufficient language skills to complete all testing without assistance of a language interpreter Ability to perform all sections of the ADAScog Good general health without additional diseases expected to interfere with the study Normal B12, folic acid, VDRL, and TSH or without any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that would be expected to interfere with the study. ECG and chest xray (if available) without clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that would be expected to interfere with the study. Patient is not of childbearing potential (i.e., women must be two years postmenopausal or surgically sterile) Responsible caregiver (individual who continuously attends to the needs of the person or dependent adult), who agrees to be present during study conduct. Written informed consent obtained from the patient and caregiver (and legally authorized representative or guardian if different from caregiver) prior to entry into the study (Screening Visit) Any abnormalities associated with significant central nervous disease other than Alzheimer's Disease Severe psychotic features, confusion, agitation or behavioral problems within the last three months that could lead to difficulties complying with the protocol Delusional symptoms are often characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, but patients with symptoms so pronounced that they warrant an alternative psychiatric diagnosis are excluded History of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within the past two years (DSMIVTR criteria, see also sections 18.3.1 and 18.3.2) History of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder (DSMIVTR criteria) History of newly identified major depressive disorder within eight weeks before Screening Visit (DSMIVTR) (see also exclusion criteria 11 and inclusion criteria 5) Any significant systemic illness or unstable medical condition that could lead to difficulties complying with the protocol. Patients with a history of systemic cancer within the past two years are excluded History of myocardial infarction in the past year or unstable or severe cardiovascular disease, including uncontrolled hypertension Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities on the battery of screening tests (hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, ECG, chest xray (if available)) Uncontrolled insulinrequiring diabetes or noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt;10.0) Use of any concomitant medication that could affect functioning of the CNS or interfere with efficacy assessment. Patients who in the Investigator's opinion would not comply with study procedures Patients with fragile or thin veins who may not be able to receive many i.v. infusions Patients who in the past have not tolerated treatment with 10 mg donepezil or treatment with a corresponding dose of another cholinesterase inhibitor Patients with history of any epileptic seizure Patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to Cerebrolysin, donepezil hydrochloride, piperidine derivates or any of the IMPs' excipients</criteria>
