	<brief_summary>Menopausal syndromes includes somatic symptom, psychosomatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction and even urinary symptoms. Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms. Common HT for menopausal syndrome with intact uterus includes tibolone, estradiol valerate (E2V) 1mg &amp; medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg, and conjugated equine estrogens &amp; MPA. However, only a few literatures mentioned about the therapeutic effect of tibolone, but lack of comparison research about their therapeutic effect on somatic symptoms, psychosomatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction and even urinary symptoms. The knowledge of the above therapeutic effects should be important for choosing a suitable medication. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the therapeutic effect on somatic symptoms, psychosomatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction and even urinary symptoms between tibolone and E2V/MPA.</brief_summary>
