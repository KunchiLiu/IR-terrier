	<brief_summary>- BACKGROUND: Medical therapeutic options for the treatment of emphysema remain limited. Lung volume reduction surgery is infrequently used because of its high morbi-mortality. Endobronchial lung volume reduction coil (LVRC(®), PneumRx, Mountain View, CA) treatment has been recently developed and has been shown to be feasible and associated with an acceptable safety profile, while resulting in improvements in dyspnea, exercise capacity and lung function. The objective of this study is to analyze the cost effectiveness of LVRC treatment in severe emphysema. - METHODS:This prospective, multicenter study, randomized with a 1:1 ratio (LVRC vs conventional treatment) will include 100 patients who will be followed up for 1year. The primary outcome measure is the 6-month improvement of the 6-minute walk test: the percentage of patients showing an improvement of at least 54m will be compared between groups. A cost-effectiveness study will estimate the cost of LVRC treatment, the global cost of this therapeutic option and will compare the cost between patients treated by LVRC and by medical treatment alone. - EXPECTED RESULTS:This study should allow validating the clinical efficacy of LVRC in severe emphysema. The cost-effectiveness study will assess the medical-economic impact of the LVRC therapeutic option.</brief_summary>
