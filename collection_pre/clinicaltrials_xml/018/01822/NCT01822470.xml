	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in patients who will be undergoing an enteroscopy as an outpatient procedure with symptoms of functional dyspepsia. In addition, the investigators would like to identify the types of bacteria that are present in the small intestines in patients with SIBO and compare two different diagnostic tools: microbiologic culture and DNA sequencing of bacteria. The aim is to compare the microbiota between patients with and without the clinical complications of SIBO</brief_summary>
