	<brief_summary>Circulating anti-beta2-glycoprotein antibodies have been associated with coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease. This auto-antibodies could activate endothelial cells leading to the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and increasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the other hand, endothelial dysfunction of atherosclerotic patients acts as a primary pathogenic event, as it occur before structural changes are evident on angiogram or ultrasound scan. Loss of endothelial normal function causes vasoconstriction, local coagulation alterations and an increase arterial wall proliferation. This situation s been attributed to a reduction in nitric oxide bioactivity, and to an increase oxygen-free radical formation in the context of the pro-inflammatory status found in atherosclerosis. Hypothesis: Circulating Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies could be associated with endothelial dysfunction and nitric oxide metabolism disruption en patients with peripheral arterial disease.</brief_summary>
