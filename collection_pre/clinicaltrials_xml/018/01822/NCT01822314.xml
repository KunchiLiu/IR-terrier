	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant weekly nab-paclitaxel followed by Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide (AC) or Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide (EC) or Fluorouracil,Epirubicin,Cyclophosphamide (FEC)compared with neoadjuvant weekly solvent-based paclitaxel followed by AC or EC or FEC in terms of rate of pathological complete remissions at surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Nab-paclitaxel in Women With HER2-negative High-risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, eligible and consenting patients will be randomized to receive either 4 cycles of weekly abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) followed by 4 cycles of an anthracycline-containing regimen or 4 cycles of weekly paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles of an anthracycline-containing regimen.The anthracycline regimen (AC, EC or FEC) will be chosen by the investigator at the participating sites. Before randomization patients will be stratified according to Disease stage [operable (tumor stage: T2N0-1; T3N0) and locally advanced (T3N1;T4, any N2-3)] and Tumor subtype [luminal B intermediate (HER2 negative, ER or PGR positive, Ki67 from 14% to 20%) vs luminal B high (HER2 negative, ER or PGR positive, Ki67 &gt;20%) vs triple negative tumors (HER2 negative, ER negative and PgR negative, Ki67 any value)]. Tumor subtype will be confirmed at two selected referral laboratories. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be followed by definite surgery and irradiation as per international and local guidelines. During neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients will be assessed for safety and efficacy as detailed in the protocol. After definite surgery patients will be followed for approximately 10 years according to local procedures</detailed_description>

Exception: contralateral insitu ductal cancer Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry. Exceptions: 1) Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of an axillary node is permitted for any patient, and 2) although not recommended, a preneoadjuvant therapy sentinel lymph node biopsy for patients with clinically negative axillary nodes is permitted Pregnant or lactating women. Women with childbearing potential unless (1) surgically sterile or (2) using adequate measures of contraception, for example abstinence, an intrauterine device, or double barrier method of contraception Treatment including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to study entry Previous investigational treatment for any condition within 4 weeks of randomization date Patients on therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and on therapy with Warfarin (Coumadin) Previous or concomitant malignancy of any other type that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results. Patients with curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervix cancer are generally eligible. Preexisting motor or sensory neuropathy of grade &gt; 1 for any reason Patients with a history of hypersensitivity due to drugs containing polyoxyethylene castor oil (Cremophor EL) (e.g., ciclosporin), or hardened castor oil (e.g., vitamin preparations for injection, etc.) Other serious illness or medical condition including: history of documented congestive cardiac failure; angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication; evidence of transmural infarction on ECG; poorly controlled hypertension (e.g. systolic &gt;180 mm Hg or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg; however, patients with hypertension which is well controlled on medication are eligible); clinically significant valvular heart disease; highrisk uncontrolled arrhythmias Patients with a history of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant and precluding informed consent or adversely affecting compliance with study drugs Serious uncontrolled infections (bacterial or viral) or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus Hematology and biochemistry tests within normla limits Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% by echocardiography or multigated scintigraphic scan (MUGA)</criteria>
