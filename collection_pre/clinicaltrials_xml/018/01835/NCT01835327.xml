	<brief_summary>The current study proposes to address the question of whether patients' cerebral oxygen saturation levels are predictive of their recovery from thoracic surgery. Further, the study poses the hypothesis that a patient's poor recovery status goes on to increase a patient's risk of developing post-operative morbidities such as pneumonia, arrhythmias and delirium. The aim of this study is to address the observation that some patients struggle more than others in their recovery and that 1) this may be a result of intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturations and 2) that this may affect their post-operative morbidity. If a potential means of predicting poor outcomes is identified this will lead to further research into how to adjust the associated variables, such as cerebral oxygenation, to improve patient post-operative outcome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite advances in the field of thoracic surgery, post-operative morbidity continues to be a significant problem with limited understanding of the connection between the insult of surgery and anesthesia and the pathophysiology of the development of these morbidities. Surgeons in the thoracic department have noted that some patients seem to recover less vigorously than other patients. What accounts for these different recovery trajectories is unclear. Researchers have developed a Post-Operative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS) which assesses six domains (physiologic, nociceptive, emotive, activities of daily living, cognitive, and overall patient experience) and has been suggested to serve as a means of tracking patients' recovery from surgery.</detailed_description>
