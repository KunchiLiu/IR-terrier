	<brief_summary>The Cambodia Integrated HIV and Drug Prevention Implementation Program project will implement and evaluate an integrated combination HIV prevention intervention: SMARTgirl Plus for Cambodian female entertainment and sex workers where non-injection use of amphetamine type stimulant (ATS) is high and significantly contributing to HIV risk. SMARTgirl Plus will add demonstrated approaches to ATS and HIV prevention (conditional cash transfer (CCT) and microfinance (MF) opportunities) into an existing widely disseminated program (SMARTgirl), using a stepped wedge randomized cluster design, and assess impacts on HIV related risk behavior. Adding CCT and MF to existing HIV prevention programs will broaden the scope of the current prevention model which focuses principally on reducing sexual risk through condom use and STI care, and uptake of reproductive health services.</brief_summary>
