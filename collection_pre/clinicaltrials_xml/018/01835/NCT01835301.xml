	<brief_summary>This study aims to test the hypothesis that plaque composition differs within a stent between bare metal stents and drug eluting stents (DES). It is possible that a difference in plaque composition seen within a stent may be contributory to the late thrombotic events seen more frequently with DES.</brief_summary>
