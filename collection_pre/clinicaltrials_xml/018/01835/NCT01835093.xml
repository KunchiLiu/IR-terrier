	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence suggests a role of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel in the pathology of excitement of nerve, and the medicine with the action (like the Tipepidine Hibenzate) is expected as a new curative medicine of Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD). The purpose of this research is to confirm the effect by carrying out the additional dosage of the Tipepidine Hibenzate to the AD/HD patients. If suggestion is obtained by this research about the effect on AD/HD of Tipepidine Hibenzate, it can contribute to development of the medical treatment of AD/HD.</brief_summary>
