	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate works compared to sunitinib malate in treating patients with previously untreated kidney cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or to other places in the body. Cabozantinib-s-malate and sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether cabozantinib-s-malate is more effective than sunitinib malate in treating patients with kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-s-malate or Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if patients with renal cancer treated with cabozantinib (cabozantinib-s-malate) will have improved progression-free survival compared to patients treated with sunitinib (sunitinib malate). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the response rate of patients with renal cancer treated with cabozantinib will be higher when compared with patients treated with sunitinib. II. To determine whether patients with renal cancer treated with cabozantinib will have an improved overall survival when compared with patients treated with sunitinib. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether renal cancer patients with high MET expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) have improvement in progression-free survival compared to patients with low MET expression on both arms of this study. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive sunitinib malate PO QD for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Renal cell carcinoma with some component of clear cell histology; histologic documentation of metastatic disease is not required Locally advanced (defined as disease not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy) or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (equivalent to stage IV RCC, according to American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging) Eligible patients must be intermediate/poor risk, per the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) Database Consortium (Heng) criteria; patients must therefore have as one or more of the following six factors: Time from diagnosis of RCC to systemic treatment &lt; 1 year Note: systemic treatment refers to the initiation of A031203 protocol treatment Hemoglobin &lt;

supportive therapies such as bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid) or denosumab are permitted Patients must not have had a major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 6 weeks prior to study registration, and must have fully recovered from any such procedure; however, patients who have had a nephrectomy may be enrolled 4 weeks after surgery, providing there are no woundhealing complications; the following are not considered to be major procedures: thoracentesis, paracentesis, port placement, laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, bronchoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonographic procedures, mediastinoscopy, skin biopsies, incisional biopsies, imagingguided biopsy for diagnostic purposes, and routine dental procedures Radiation: To the brain, thoracic cavity, abdomen, or pelvis must be completed at least 90 days before registration; To bone must be completed at least 14 days before registration; and To any other sites must be completed at least 28 days before registration In all cases, there must be complete recovery and no ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy No chronic concomitant treatment of strong cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) inducers or inhibitors; patients may not have received a strong CYP3A4 inducer within 12 days prior to registration nor a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor within 7 days prior to registration Patients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria; lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 2 cm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 1 cm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan No active brain metastases; patients with treated, stable brain metastases for at least three months are eligible as long as they meet the following criteria: Treated brain metastases are defined as having no ongoing requirement for steroids and no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment for at least 3 months, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or CT); (stable dose of anticonvulsants are allowed); treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, linear accelerator [LINAC], or equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician; patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to registration are not eligible Baseline brain imaging (MRI/CT) is required No serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture requiring intervention within 28 days prior to registration No arterial thrombotic events within 6 months prior to registration, including transient ischemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), peripheral arterial thrombus, unstable angina or angina requiring surgical or medical intervention in the 6 months prior to registration, or myocardial infarction (MI);
