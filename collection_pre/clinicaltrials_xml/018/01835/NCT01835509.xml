	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the impact and feasibility of a prolonged physical activity intervention in school-aged childhood cancer survivors who self-report sedentary lifestyles. The study will test the hypothesis that childhood cancer survivors participating in a physical activity intervention guided by Social Cognitive Theory will increase the amount of time spent daily in moderate to vigorous physical activity, and improve exercise self-efficacy compared to children randomized to usual care. A secondary aim is to assess the impact of the intervention on cardiovascular risk factors including fitness and body composition.</brief_summary>
