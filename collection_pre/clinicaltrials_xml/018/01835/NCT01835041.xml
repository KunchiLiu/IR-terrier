	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPI-613 when given together with combination chemotherapy in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, CPI-613, leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPI-613 and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic acid), when used in combination with modified leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX), in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety of CPI-613/mFOLFIRINOX combination in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. II. To collect tissue for future genomic analyses. III. To obtain preliminary data on efficacy of treatment with CPI-613/mFOLFIRINOX. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid. Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 3. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
