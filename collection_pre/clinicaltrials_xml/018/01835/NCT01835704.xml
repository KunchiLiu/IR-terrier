	<brief_summary>To establish the cost per QALY (Quality Adjusted life Years) gained all patients that are referred to a specialized interventional pain clinic are assessed by Euroqol EQ-5D to measure the health-related quality of life at the first visit and then during the following year. Quality of life is calculated from EQ-5D by using hte TTO-validated UK-value set. With this and calculations of the cost we will be able to calculate the cost per QALY-gained which makes it possible to compare interventional pain managment to other treatments for pain patients.</brief_summary>
