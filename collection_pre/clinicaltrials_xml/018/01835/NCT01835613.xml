	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Signed informed consent form; Patients aged 18 75 years; RA classified in compliance with the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria; Patients that have to suspend a previous treatment with DMARDs for total ineffectiveness or intolerance to drugs and/or patients that have not responded adequately to firstline combination DMARDs / biological treatment; Patients for which is indicated to start a treatment with an inhibitor of IL6R for high values indicative of systemic inflammation (ESR&gt;=28 mm/hour, PCR&gt;5 mg/l , Fibrinogen &gt;400 mg/dl and or Albumin &lt;3.5 g/dl) and high disease activity (DAS&gt;2.4), or contraindications to DMARDs use which make it necessary to take biological drug in monotherapy. Corticosteroids therapy stable (&lt; = 7.5 mg)for at least four weeks; Joint symptoms for at least three but no more than 24 months from the screening visit; DAS44 &gt;2.4 and/or SDAI &gt;11 Willing and able to comply with study procedures and timing. Exclusion criteria: On going pregnancy or lactation; Severe active infections; Patients with other clinically significant concomitant diseases whose treatment or outcome could interfere with the expected evaluations of the study protocol. Blood AST or ALT levels &gt;5 times the upper normal limit; ANC count &lt;0.5 x 109/L Platelet count &lt;50 x103 /μL Patients with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, in addition to AR (for example systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], scleroderma, polymyositis, ecc…) Medical history or concomitant joint diseases in additions to AR (for example tophaceous gout, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis).</criteria>
