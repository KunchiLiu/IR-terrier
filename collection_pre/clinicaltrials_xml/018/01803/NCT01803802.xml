	<brief_summary>This study is designed to help us better understand the factors that affect the sexual lives of women who have been sexually mistreated during childhood. With this study we hope to learn about factors that may be promising targets for future treatments of sexual problems related to past sexual experiences. The investigators hypothesize that women who have experienced early sexual abuse are more likely to have sexual problems in adulthood than women who were not abuse in childhood.</brief_summary>
