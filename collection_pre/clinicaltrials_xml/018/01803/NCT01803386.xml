	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to test a new Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) device and study its reliability and ability to differentiate ALS patients from healthy controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease Using Electrical Impedance Myography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will study 10 ALS patients and at least 10 age-matched healthy controls between the ages of 21 and 85 years old. For all subjects, EIM measurements will be performed on four muscles: two in the upper and two in the lower extremities, using 8 different EIM sensors. Measurements will be repeated one time.</detailed_description>
