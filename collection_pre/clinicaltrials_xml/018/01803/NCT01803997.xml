This after school extracurricular program increases the students' confidence, knowledge, and skills for cooking as one of the first steps for dietary improvement. In addition to the life lessons students learn during this class, they gain self-confidence and become self-sufficient culinary experts that are capable of educating their siblings, parents, and social circles. This research project will test the impact this program has on nutritional knowledge, culinary efficacy, and nutritional choices made in and out of the home.
