	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Antimicrobial Catheters to Avoid Urinary Infections in Spinal Cord Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiseptic Silver Alloy-Coated Silicone Urinary Catheters seems to be a promising intervention to reduce urinary tract infections; however, research evidence cannot be extrapolated to spinal cord injured patients. The study is an open, randomized, multicentric, and parallel clinical trial with blinded assessment. The study includes spinal cord injured patients who require at least seven days of urethral catheterization as a method of bladder voiding. Participants are on-line centrally randomized and allocated to one of the two interventions (Antiseptic Urinary Catheters or Conventional Catheters). Catheters are used for a maximum period of 30 days or removed earlier at the clinician criteria. The main outcome is the incidence of urinary tract infections by the time of catheter removal or at day 30 after catheterization, the event that occurs first. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, as well as a primary analysis of all patients. The aim of this study is to assess whether silver alloy-coated silicone urinary catheters reduce urinary infections in spinal cord injured patients.</detailed_description>

Patients who are willing to participate in the study and give their written informed consent (If a patient is unable to give written consent because of physical or mental disability, an affirmation of consent will be taken in his presence from his relative or legal guardian). Patients who can benefit from other method of bladder drainage such as intermittent catheterization, suprapubic drainage, reflex voiding or use of an external collector. Patients with urinary tract infection at the moment of inclusion Current antibiotic use or use within 7 days prior to inclusion Outpatients with sporadic medical examinations (less than one per month) Known allergy to latex, silver salts or hydrogels. Patients with surgical interventions in the urinary tract that may interfere, at the investigator criteria, with the study results. Pregnant or breastfeeding woman.</criteria>
