	<brief_title>Determine How Consumption of Dairy Fat as Cheese Influences Inflammation-Phase 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 2 is a randomized crossover study designed to determine how consumption of cheese compared with a non-dairy cheese substitute influences postprandial inflammation in participants who have 2 or more risk factors of metabolic syndrome or BMI â‰¥ 30. Eligible participants will arrive to the Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC) at the University of California (UC) Davis campus on the morning of each test day after a 10-12-hr overnight fast. Upon arrival participants will fill out a questionnaire about their dietary and medication intakes and physical activity for the past 72 hours to ensure compliance. Compliant participants' weight and blood pressure will be measured and a fasting blood draw will be taken before participants consume their test meal (cheese or non-dairy cheese substitute). Participants will only consume this test meal and water freely for the duration of the test day. Blood will be drawn serially at 1, 3 and 6 hours postprandially. Participants will be tested on a second test day two weeks after the first test. On the second test day, participants' body composition and bone mineral density will be measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry.</detailed_description>
