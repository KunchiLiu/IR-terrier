	<detailed_description>The study population is a population sample of 512 children from the city of Kuopio, Finland. The children will be recruited at the age of 6-8 years and allocated into the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group will undergo intensive, individualized and family-based physical activity and diet intervention that also includes exercise and cooking clubs. All children will be examined after the 2-year follow-up. The intervention group will continues with a less intensive exercise and diet intervention until adulthood. All children will be re-examined in adolescence and in early adulthood. The results of the PANIC Study will help in improving children's health by increased physical activity and improved nutrition, in identifying high-risk children who would benefit most from exercise and diet intervention, and in targeting the high-risk children for more careful health examinations, exercise and diet intervention and health follow-up and in preventing chronic diseases and their societal consequences in adulthood.</detailed_description>
