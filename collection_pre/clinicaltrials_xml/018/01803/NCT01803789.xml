	<brief_summary>Metacarpal V fractures are injuries of the upper extremities. They occur frequently, primarily in young adults.These fractures are caused by falling on the fist, sports accidents and direct or indirect forces. Surgical intervention is necessary for fractures with a strong palmar angulation of the metacarpal bone or rotational deformity of the small finger. Due to the absence of guideline recommendations decisions about therapy are made taking into account logistical aspects, available hardware, individual expertise and preferences. The objective of the study is to compare the advantages and disadvantages of single versus double Kirschner wires for intramedullary fixation of metacarpal V fractures in order to standardize national therapy procedures. Primary hypothesis: In the surgical therapy of the dislocated and/or rotational deformed metacarpal V neck fracture, osteosynthesis with a single Kirschner wire is not inferior to osteosynthesis with a double Kirschner wire with regard to the functional outcome after 6 month, as measured with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hands Score (DASH).</brief_summary>
