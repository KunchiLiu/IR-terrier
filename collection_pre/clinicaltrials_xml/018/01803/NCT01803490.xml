	<brief_summary>Closed suction drains are commonly used following surgery, if the wound is expected to discharge significant amounts of fluid. To this date, no evidence base exists as to the exact post operative time period or discharge volume necessitating presence of a drain. In orthopedic common practice, drains are removed on the second post operative day, fearing the drain will serve as a point of entry for nosocomial infection. In this study, drains will be left in place as long as daily discharge volume exceeds 50cc, regardless of the amount of days following surgery. Daily cultures and antibiotic levels will be taken from the drains receptacle, to determine if and when the drains is colonized by aerobic bacteria.</brief_summary>
