	<criteria>Informed consent/assent: For adult patients, written informed consent signed and dated by the patient before conducting any study related procedures; for minor patients, written informed consent signed and dated by the parent/legal guardian and written assent signed and dated by the patient before conducting any study related procedure. Male or female patients 12 years and older as of the screening visit. Male or female patients 18 years and older, as of the screening visit, in countries where local regulations or the regulatory status of study medication permit enrollment of adult patients only. General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk during the study. Asthma Diagnosis: The asthma diagnosis must be in accordance with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Other criteria apply. History of lifethreatening asthma, defined for this protocol as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures. Culturedocumented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus, or middle ear that is not resolved within 2 weeks before the screening visit. In addition, the patient must be excluded if such infection occurs between the screening visit and the baseline visit. Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within one month of the screening visit. A patient must not have been hospitalized for asthma within 6 months before the screening visit. Presence of glaucoma, cataracts, ocular herpes simplex, or malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma. Historical or current evidence of a clinically significant disease including, but not limited to: cardiovascular conditions (eg, congestive heart failure, known aortic aneurysm, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or coronary heart disease), hepatic, renal, hematological, neuropsychological, endocrine conditions (eg, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled thyroid disorder, Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome), gastrointestinal conditions (eg, poorlycontrolled peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]), or pulmonary conditions (eg, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis with the need for treatment, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the patient at risk through participation, or which could affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition became exacerbated during the study. Other criteria apply.</criteria>
