	<brief_title>Post-marketing Safety Study of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Synflorix™ Vaccine, in Healthy Infants and Children in Sri Lanka</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participating physicians (investigators) will be asked to enrol only those subjects to whom they administer Synflorix™ in the course of their normal clinical practice according to the locally approved Prescribing Information. Since there is lack of clarity regarding the PMS study requirement (both from Regulatory agency and Ethics Committee), it was decided that GSK will submit Local PSURs on a regular basis as desired by Local regulatory agency. The same is communicated to Regulatory agency and if they want something more they are requested to revert back with specific requirements.</detailed_description>
