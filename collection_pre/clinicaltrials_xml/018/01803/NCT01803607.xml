	<criteria>Postmenopausal for ≥5 years (defined as no menses for at least 5 years or at least 5 years post bilateral oophorectomy). Prior or current treatment with oral bisphosphonate therapy (i.e., alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate) for postmenopausal osteoporosis for ≥3 years. BMD Tscore at any hip site (femoral neck, trochanter, or total hip) ≤2.5 and &gt;3.5 as assessed by dualenergy Xray absorptiometry (DXA) without a history of a prior fragility fracture. For participants with a history of a prior fragility fracture (except hip fracture), BMD Tscore can be ≤1.5 and &gt;3.5 at any hip site. Serum 25hydroxyvitamin D level of ≥20 and ≤60 ng/mL within 90 days of the time of randomization. Evidence of a metabolic bone disorder other than osteopenia or osteoporosis History or current evidence of hip fracture. History of malignancy ≤5 years prior to signing informed consent, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer. Active parathyroid disease. Participant with a documented history of parathyroid disease can be considered for inclusion if she has normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) at screening. History of thyroid disease not adequately controlled by medication. Current treatment with antiseizure medication, with indices of calcium metabolism not within normal limits. Prior treatment with strontiumcontaining products; intravenous bisphosphonates; cathepsin K inhibitors; RANK ligand inhibitors; fluoride treatment at a dose greater than 1 mg/day for more than 2 weeks. Use of following medications within the 6 months prior to the screening visit: activated vitamin D; estrogen, with or without progestin, at a dose high enough to have systemic effects; raloxifene or other selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), tibolone or any aromatase inhibitor; subcutaneous calcitonin (Note: use of intranasal calcitonin is allowed at any time); anabolic steroid; PTH (134 or 184); growth hormone; systemic glucocorticoids (≥5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for more than 2 weeks; cyclosporine for more than 2 weeks. Concurrent use of cancer chemotherapy or heparin; protease inhibitors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment; and vitamin A (excluding beta carotene) &gt;10,000 IU daily, unless willing to discontinue this dose during the study. Current treatment with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers or treatment with CYP3A4 inducer within 4 weeks of screening.</criteria>
