	<brief_title>A Multiple Ascending Dose Phase I Study of SB 9200 in Treatment Naïve Adults With Chronic Hepatitis C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a First-in-human, Two-stage, Multi-centre study. Part A is an open-label, single ascending dose study in fed or fasted subjects and Part B is a randomized, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose study. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of SB 9200 given as monotherapy for up to 14 days to subjects with chronic Hepatitis C infection, and to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship over this dose range.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must provide written informed consent before any assessment is performed. Must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Males or females of nonchildbearing potential between the ages of 18 and 60 years, inclusive. Must have HCV and laboratory evidence of HCV infection for at least six months before the Screening Visit. Must have HCV1 (1a or 1b or nonsubtypeable HCV1), HCV2 or HCV3, as applicable for a given cohort. Subjects must have a plasma HCV RNA &gt;5 log10 IU/mL (100,000 IU/mL). Must have fibrosis of Stage 2 or lower by Ishak or Metavir scoring system or equivalent as evidenced by a recent (within two years of screening) liver biopsy (i.e. no more than moderate fibrosis). If a recent liver biopsy is not available, Fibroscan of &lt; 8.5 kilopascals at screening. Must have negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B screening test results. Must have a body mass index (BMI) of 1832 kg/m2 (inclusive). Must have screening laboratory values within the reference ranges or if outside the normal range, not clinically significant as judged by the Investigator. ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be within 2x the upper limit of normal. Must not consume grapefruit or grapefruitrelated citrus fruits or juice from seven days prior to the first dose of study drug until collection of the final PK blood sample at 14 days after the last dose of study drug. Must be able to communicate with site personnel and understand instructions. Any previous treatment with an investigational or approved drug or drug regimen for the treatment of HCV. Note: SB 9200 is excluded from this criterion, i.e. subjects who complete Part A of the study will be eligible to participate in Part B of the study. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical classes. Use of nonprescription drugs, vitamins and dietary supplements within 14 days or five halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the trial dose medication. Changes to prescription medication within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication (i.e. only stable prescription medications are permitted whilst on study). History of intercurrent illness (e.g., upper respiratory illness with fever) within five days prior to the first dose of study drug. History of illicit or controlled substance abuse or alcohol abuse within one year before the Screening Visit (with the exception of cannabinoids). Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy). Long QT syndrome or QTc &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for females at screening or baseline. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past five years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases. Women of childbearing potential. Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring unless the subject and partner of child bearing potential agree to comply with acceptable contraception and the female partner is not lactating. Prior liver biopsy (at any time in the past), indicating Stage 3 or higher fibrosis by Ishak or Metavir scoring system or equivalent (i.e. greater than moderate fibrosis). Any other cause of significant liver disease in addition to HCV, which may include, but is not limited to, malignancy with hepatic involvement, hepatitis B, drug or alcohol related cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or primary biliary cirrhosis. Evidence or history or clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing). Blood donation of approximately 500 mL or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing. Any other medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality which, in the view of the Investigator, is likely to interfere with the study or put the subject at risk. Concurrent participation in another clinical trial.</criteria>
