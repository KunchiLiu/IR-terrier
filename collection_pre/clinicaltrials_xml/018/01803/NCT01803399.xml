	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, partially-blinded, placebo and moxifloxacin-controlled, single dose, 4-period, balanced crossover study. The primary objective of this study is to separately assess the effects of a therapeutic and supratherapeutic dose of GSK1322322 on the cardiac conduction (corrected QT interval [QTc]) compared with placebo in eligible healthy male and female subjects. Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) will be used as an open-label positive control in order to validate the sensitivity of the study in detecting QTc change. Approximately 56 healthy subjects will participate in the study for approximately 9 weeks i.e. 30 day Screening period, 4-week Treatment period, and a 7-10 day Follow-up period. There will be 4 treatment periods separated by at least 1 week. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 of each dosing period. Each subject will receive each of the four treatment sequences (GSK1322322 1200 milligram [mg] intravenous [IV] over 60 minutes x 1 dose, GSK1322322 3000 mg IV over 60 minutes x 1 dose, GSK1322322 Placebo IV over 60 minutes x 1 dose, moxifloxacin 400 mg administered orally x 1 dose) on Day 1 of each Treatment period in a randomized fashion. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), continuous Holter monitoring, laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, and serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected for up to 24 hours following each treatment. If no clinically significant abnormalities are noted, subjects will be discharged from the clinical research unit after the completion of all assessments on Day 2 in each period and return approximately one week later for the next dosing period. Each individual subject will follow the same dosing schedule at every period. A Follow-up visit will be conducted 7-10 days after administration of the last dose of study medication in treatment period 4.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator feels that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures Male or female (of non childbearing potential) between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt;40 milli international units [mIU]/millilitre [mL] and estradiol &lt;40 picograms [pg]/mL or &lt;147 picomole [pmol]/litre [L] is confirmatory) Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the following contraception methods from the time of the first dose of study medication until the final follow up visit Condom plus partner use of a highly effective contraceptive; Abstinence, defined as sexual inactivity consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) for men and &gt;=45 kg for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.531.0 kg/(square metre) m^2 (inclusive) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x Upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%) at screening and checkin (repeat allowed at checkin only) Serum Potassium, Calcium and Magnesium lab parameters within normal limits at screening and checkin (repeat allowed at checkin only) QTcB &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) at screening and checkin Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form History/evidence of any arrhythmia (for example, first, second or third degree heart block, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, junctional rhythm) or clinically significant cardiac disease or procedure(mitral valve regurgitation, heart murmur, angina/ischemia, congenital heart abnormalities, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA). Personal or family history of long QT syndrome Subjects with a preexisting condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs.
