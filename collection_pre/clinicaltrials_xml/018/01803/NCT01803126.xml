	<brief_summary>Biofilm has been identified as the major bacterial phenotype contributing to atherosclerosis. It has become very important to evaluate atherosclerosis and the role of biofilm using advanced technologies. It is also important to understand wound biofilm at a genetic and a molecular level.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Proposed Study of Atherosclerotic Plaques in Leg Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High throughput pyrosequencing is opening new doors in nucleic acid analysis. 454 Roche has developed sequencing instrumentation which has the ability to sequence not only genomic DNA (gDNA) but also derivatives of messenger RNA (mRNA) and 16s ribosomal DNA (rDNA). This technology has the potential to survey the nucleic acids involved within a mixed population of species, such as atherosclerotic biofilm. In addition to transcriptome science; proteome, metabolome, and other -omic sciences are advancing rapidly. Examining atherosclerotic plaque using transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and other -omic approaches may provide valuable insight into the wound's microecology.</detailed_description>
