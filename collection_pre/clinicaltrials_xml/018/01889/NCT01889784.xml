	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the phototherapy may be adjuvant to exercise to improve muscular efficiency and increase aerobic capacity. We hypothesized that phototherapy adjuvant with physical exercise may be benefit to populations with Diabetes mellitus that have impairment in cardiopulmonary fitness and low oxygen uptake peak values (VO2peak) in exercise tests. Two doses will be tested 150J and 300J. Additionally, this study aims to evaluate the effect of phototherapy previously applied to the exercise on the cardiovascular coupling. We hypothesize that phototherapy previously applied to the exercise will result in the increase baroreflex sensitivity (increased coherence and gain and decreased phase), promoting the improvement of the cardiovascular autonomic control and cardiovascular coupling in diabetic subjects. Two doses will be tested 150J and 300J.</brief_summary>
