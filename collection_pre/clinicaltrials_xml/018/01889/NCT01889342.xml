	<brief_summary>Comorbidity is normal in clinical practice. Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) is a transdiagnostic model and could therefore be well suited when it comes to treating patients with high rates of comorbidity. So far, no studies have examined MCT in comparison with the best documented and evidence based treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment(CBT), in a randomized controlled trial consisting of mixed anxiety disorder sample with high degree of comorbidity. The main aim of this study is to 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of metacognitive therapy in a sample of mixed anxiety disorders as compared to a group receiving existing evidence-based single diagnosis CBT- treatment protocols 2) Investigate patterns and mechanisms of change in the two treatments.</brief_summary>
