	<brief_summary>The study is to understand whether distribution of two different supplies of nicotine patches through a telephone quitline has an effect on quit rates. The two different supplies are four vs. eight (in two separate four-week mailings) weeks of nicotine patches. The hypothesis is that eight weeks will be slightly more efficacious but four weeks will be more cost-effective.</brief_summary>
