	<brief_summary>Sildenafil is a selective pulmonary vasodilator; in patients with a special kind of pulmonary hypertension it is approved for treatment. The trial seeks to find out, whether the acute response to this treatment (= vasoreactivity testing) given intravenously is effective and allows prediction of therapy success during a following oral treatment.</brief_summary>
