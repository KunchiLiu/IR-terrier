	<brief_summary>Very low dose (VLD) cyclobenzaprine at bedtime has shown promise as a treatment for fibromyalgia, but the chemistry of cyclobenzaprine requires new formulation technology for bedtime use. The present trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of 3 different formulations of TNX-102 2.8 mg SL Tablets (a new formulation of cyclobenzaprine designed to result in increased dosage precision and decreased potential for morning grogginess) and to compare the bio-availability of 3 different formulations of TNX-102 2.8 mg SL Tablets (TNX-102 with potassium phosphate, TNX-102-B with sodium phosphate, and TNX-102-C with trisodium citrate) to that of cyclobenzaprine (5 mg tablets).</brief_summary>
