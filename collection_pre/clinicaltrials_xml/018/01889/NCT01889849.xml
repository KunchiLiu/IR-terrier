	<brief_summary>This research protocol "Comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of peginterferon Bacterial Intravenous Protein 48 kilodaltons (BIP48) and 40 kilodaltons (40kDa) in healthy volunteers." This is a Phase I clinical trial which will compare pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and safety of two products: peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS ®) and BIP48. It will be a double-blind, randomized crossover with a rest period (wash-out) of 4 weeks. The study population will be 32 healthy male volunteers to whom will be administered a single dose of 180 microgram of each product, subcutaneously. The study will have a total duration of 14 days in each treatment step. The serum concentration of PEG-interferon for both products, measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and by antiviral activity of PEG-interferon, is the main variable.For this purpose 15 samples of each volunteers will be needed. Clinical and laboratory variables, useful as pharmacodynamics parameters Beta-2 microglobulin (β2M) - 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase - oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)- and neopterin) and safety evaluation, will be measured.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Double-blind study, ie, the volunteers and the study team will not be aware of the product administered. As the presentations of the two products are different, only the professional who will administer the injections will not be blinded, and will not have contact with volunteers or members of the study team after applying the medication.</detailed_description>
