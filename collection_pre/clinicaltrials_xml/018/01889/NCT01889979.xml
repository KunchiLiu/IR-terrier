	<brief_summary>Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. It has been previously evaluated as a method to reduce pain during labour, but there is always some fear related to its effects (neonatal respiratory depression). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous tramadol in regards to pain during labour, duration of labour and neonatal outcomes.</brief_summary>
