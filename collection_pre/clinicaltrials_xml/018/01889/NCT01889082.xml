	<detailed_description>A randomized pilot study will be conducted, the goal of which is to determine which format represents the most viable approach to behavioral weight loss treatment with 18-25 year olds. Specifically, participants will be randomized to one of three arms; all arms will receive a 12-week behavioral weight loss intervention, including identical dietary, physical activity, and weight loss prescriptions. Behavioral goals / prescriptions will be the same, and basic content delivered will also be the same; only the format by which the intervention is delivered will differ among the treatment arms. A total of 45-55 participants, 18-25 years of age, with a BMI between 25 and 45 kg/m2 will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) Face-to-face brief behavioral weight loss (FBWL), 2) Web-based brief behavioral weight loss (WBWL), or 3) Web-based brief behavioral weight loss PLUS optional group sessions (WBWL Plus). Assessments will take place at 0 (baseline), 3 (post-treatment), and 6 months (follow-up).</detailed_description>
