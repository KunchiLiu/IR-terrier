	<brief_summary>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival and disease-free survival according to Intergroup Trial 0116 in patients with gastric cancer after surgical resection. However,there are still many patients experiencing local recurrence or distant metastasis after adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer after resection. The optimal and standard regimen for adjuvant treatment has not been established in locally advanced gastric cancer yet.The investigators designed the trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen compared with classical FOLFOX6 regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and 5-FU/CF as chemoradiotherapy in patients of locally advanced gastric cancer after D2 radical resection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of DC Versus 5-FU/CF as Chemotherapy and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Intergroup 0116 trial, 5-FU plus CF regimen was used as adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with resected gastric cancer.But 33 percent of those in the chemoradiotherapy group had distant relapses. Docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer has been proofed Safe and Effective in many clinical trials about gastric cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen compared with classical FOLFOX6 regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and 5-FU/CF as chemoradiotherapy in patients of locally advanced gastric cancer after D2 radical surgery. The investigators hope the new interventions can reduce the rate of distant metastasis and have more clinical benefit.</detailed_description>
