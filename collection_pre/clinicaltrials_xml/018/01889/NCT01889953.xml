	<brief_title>EUS-Guided Biliary Drainage in Patients With Inoperable Malignant Distal Biliary Obstruction and Failed ERCP: a Prospective Feasibility Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our central hypothesis is that EGBD is equally effective and safe to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) but is associated with better quality of life than PTBD in patients with inoperable malignant distal biliary obstruction who have failed prior ERCP. Furthermore, EGBD may be associated with decreased procedure-related costs. Patients who undergo PTBD usually require multiple procedures for stent exchange/upsize. Our initial study will be a prospective multicenter feasibility study that will include patients with inoperable distal biliary obstruction who have failed ERCP. If feasibility is demonstrated, our goal will be to compare EGBD and PTBD in a randomized multicenter international trial with a crossover design.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Consecutive adult patients (1880 years of age) with jaundice due to inoperable (by EUS and/or CT criteria or due to health status) malignant distal (more than 2cm distal to hilum) biliary obstruction and who have failed prior ERCP attempt. Failure is considered to be 2 unsuccessful attempts, according to each institution's definition of "failed" procedure (patients may be consented for EGBD prior to repeat ERCP due to higher likelihood of failure). One failure at outside institution and one failure at your institution can be considered as total of two failures. Ability to give informed consent Unable to give informed consent Life expectancy &lt; 1month Pregnant or breastfeeding women Acute gastrointestinal bleeding Coagulopathy defined by prothrombin time &lt; 50% of control; PTT &gt; 50 sec, or INR &gt; 1.5), or on chronic anticoagulation Inability to tolerate sedated upper endoscopy due to cardiopulmonary instability or other contraindication to endoscopy. Prior total gastrectomy, RouxenY gastric bypass, esophagectomy and sleeve gastrectomy ESLD with portal hypertension, varices, and/or ascites Liver metastases burden &gt; 30%</criteria>
