	<brief_summary>The blood hormone Erythropoietin (Epo) is not only produced by the kidneys but also by the brain, especially under hypoxic conditions. It has been shown in animal studies and human studies that Epo has neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, there is scientific evidence for central modulatory effects of Epo in the brain but high dose of Epo is needed to overcome the blood brain barrier. In a double blind placebo controlled crossover study we will investigate the effects of a single high dose of Epo on cognitive function and exercise capacity in healthy subjects. The subjects will receive a single high dose of Epo (60.000 IU) and will perform a computerized cognitive test battery, a breathing test, a maximal exercise capacity test (VO2max), and a time trial (TT) 24 hours after the treatment. The primary outcome of the study will be the cognitive function. - Trial with medicinal product</brief_summary>
