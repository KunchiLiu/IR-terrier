	<brief_summary>Previous analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey have suggested that the mortality rate associated with obesity has decreased over calendar time in the U.S. population, potentially due to improvements in the medical care of obesity and its associated diseases. The primary aim of this project is to evaluate whether this reduction in the detrimental association of obesity with mortality rate over calendar time is supported by other data from U.S. prospective studies.</brief_summary>
