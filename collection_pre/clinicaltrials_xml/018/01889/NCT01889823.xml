	<brief_summary>It has been shown in in vitro and animal models that hypoxia can have pro-inflammatory effects and hyperoxia can have anti-inflammatory effects. The pro-inflammatory effect could be the result of activation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor, a transcription factor that is known to activate many cell systems aimed at cell survival, including the inflammatory response. The anti-inflammatory effects of hyperoxia could be the annihilation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor, but also a decrease in inflammation due to oxygen toxicity resulting in a decrease in clearance of pathogens. These effects have been sparsely studied in humans. Therefore, we hypothesize that hypoxia results in an increase in Hypoxia Inducible Factor in circulating leukocytes and increases inflammatory reactions, whereas hyperoxia decreases these reactions.</brief_summary>
