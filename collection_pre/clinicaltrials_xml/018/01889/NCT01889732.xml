	<brief_summary>Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is reliable point of care management of coagulation disorder undergoing surgery. Recently, there are some reports about prediction of perioperative bleeding using ROTEM. But, the effectiveness of ROTEM for predict bleeding and improve outcomes is still debate. In this retrospective study, the investigators will compare immediate postoperative bleeding with ROTEM parameters using a Gray zone approach, and access the reliability of ROTEM for prediction of bleeding after cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
