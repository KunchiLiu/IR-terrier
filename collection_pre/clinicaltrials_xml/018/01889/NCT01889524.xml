	<brief_summary>In vivo deposition studies of aerosol administration during noninvasive ventilation are scarce in the current literature. We assessed 10 normal subjects in a crossover study evaluated by pulmonary scintigraphy aiming to compare radiaoaerosol pulmonary index and radioaerosol mass balance in the different compartments (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) of radiotagged aerosol administered using vibrating mesh nebulizers (VMN) and conventional jet nebulizer (JN) during noninvasive ventilation (NIV).</brief_summary>
