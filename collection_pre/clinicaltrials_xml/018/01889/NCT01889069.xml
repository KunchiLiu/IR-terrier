	<brief_summary>This single arm, multicenter study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous (SC) MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) in previously untreated patients with CD20+ diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL). Patients will receive in addition to standard chemotherapy, in the induction phase of the study subcutaneous doses of 1400 mg MabThera/Rituxan once a month for at least 4 cycles, and in the maintenance phase subcutaneous doses of 1400 mg MabThera/Rituxan once every two months for at least 6 cycles.</brief_summary>
