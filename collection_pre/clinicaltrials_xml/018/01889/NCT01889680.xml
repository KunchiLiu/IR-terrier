	<brief_summary>FC-8 is a Phase II, multi-center randomized study of a continuation regimen of 5-FU/LV with ziv-aflibercept or 5-FU/LV alone (control arm) following the induction regimen of mFOLFOX6 and ziv-aflibercept as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary aim of the study is to determine the value of adding ziv-aflibercept to the continuation regimen of 5-FU/LV in improving progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have achieved at least stable disease after induction therapy. The secondary aim is to determine the overall objective response rate (complete, partial or stable responses) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness Study of Chemotherapy and Ziv-aflibercept to Treat Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will receive an induction regimen with mFOLFOX6 (5-FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus Day 1 + leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV Day 1 + oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV Day 1 followed by 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 by continuous intravenous infusion (CIV infusion) over 46 hours [Day 1 and 2]) + ziv-aflibercept (4 mg/kg on Day 1) every 14 days for 6 cycles. Patients attaining stable disease or better after 6 cycles of induction therapy will be randomized to receive a continuation regimen of either 5-FU/LV + ziv-aflibercept IV [4 mg/kg Day 1]) every 14 days, as the investigational arm; or 5-FU/LV alone every 14 days, as the control arm, until disease progression. Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Submission of archived primary tumor tissue and blood samples for FC-8 correlative science studies will be a study requirement for all patients. Submissions will include primary tumor specimens from the diagnostic biopsy sample or another previous surgery and blood samples collected before the start of study therapy, prior to starting each even numbered cycle of therapy, (i.e., Cycles 2, 4, and 6) and at the time of disease progression or end of study therapy. The total study accrual will be up to 120 patients over a period of 24 months in order to provide 90 patients for randomization to the continuation regimen. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive the continuation regimen of 5-FU/LV + ziv-aflibercept (Arm 2, 60 patients) or 5-FU/LV alone (Arm 1, 30 patients). In both arms, clinical response will be assessed by radiological examination every eight weeks during the continuation regimen course.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1. There must be histologic confirmation of a diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma. There must be documentation by PET/CT scan, CT scan, or MRI, that the patient has evidence of measurable metastatic disease per RECIST 1.1. Prior adjuvant therapy is allowed if the last administration was greater than or equal to 6 months prior to randomization into this study including prior adjuvant oxaliplatin. Patients who have received prior oxaliplatin therapy must have neuropathy recovery greater than or equal to grade 1 according to CTCAE v4.0 At the time of study entry, blood counts performed within 4 weeks prior to study entry must meet the following criteria: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1200/mm3; Platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3; and Hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 9 g/dL. The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function performed within 4 weeks prior to study entry must be met: Total bilirubin must be less than or equal to 1.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab or less than or equal to 5 x ULN if liver metastasis; Alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 3 x ULN for the lab or less than or equal to 5 x ULN if liver metastasis Serum creatinine performed within 4 weeks prior to study entry must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. (If creatinine 1.01.5 x ULN, the creatinine clearance should be 60 mL/mn per CockcroftGault formula.) A urine sample must be tested for proteinuria by dipstick method. Eligibility must be based on the most recent test result performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Urine dipstick must indicate 01+ protein and negative blood. If dipstick reading is greater than or equal to 1+ protein and greater than or equal to trace hematuria or greater than or equal to 2+ protein, a 24 hour urine specimen must be collected and must demonstrate less than or equal to 500 mg of protein. Patients with reproductive potential (male/female) must agree to use accepted and effective methods of contraception while receiving study therapy, and for at least 6 months after the completion of study therapy. (The definition of effective method of contraception will be based on the investigator's judgment.) Exclusion Criteria Diagnosis of anal or small bowel carcinoma. Colorectal cancer other than adenocarcinoma, e.g., sarcoma, lymphoma, carcinoid. Previous therapy with zivaflibercept or other angiogenesis inhibitors for any malignancy.

Uncontrolled high blood pressure defined as systolic BP greater than or equal to 150 mmHg or diastolic BP greater than or equal to 100 mmHg with or without antihypertensive medication.
