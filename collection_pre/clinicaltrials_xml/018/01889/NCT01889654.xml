	<brief_summary>Lupus disease is characterized by the production of pathogenic autoantibodies, which participate in end-organ damages. The phenotype of B cells producing the pathogenic autoantibodies in lupus patients is today unknown. Antinucleosome antibodies are characteristic of lupus disease.This project proposes to detect antinucleosome B cells in lupus patients and to analyse their phenotype and their frequency.</brief_summary>
