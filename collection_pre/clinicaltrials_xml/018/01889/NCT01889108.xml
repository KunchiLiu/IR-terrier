	<brief_summary>The proposed feasibility study will evaluate the investigators ability to conduct a clinical trial of a novel intervention (SPEEDI) which addresses a striking gap in the literature. Supporting Play, Exploration, and Early Development Intervention (SPEEDI) differs from current early intervention practices in 2 important ways. First it bridges the traditional gap in services from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to home providing ongoing and intensive support for developmental activities when parents are establishing care giving routines. Second, in contrast to wide-ranging intervention provided by current early intervention models, SPEEDI uses an action perception model to target specific behaviors which lead to improved early motor abilities and provide a foundation for learning.[6] The purpose of this feasibility study is to extend the investigators preliminary data and evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of SPEEDI.</brief_summary>
