	<brief_summary>Treatment of multisystemic forms of lupus displays severe side effects and limited efficacy, underscoring the need to better dissection of the pathogenic mechanisms. Concordant with preliminary data, IL26 signaling could be impaired in systemic lupus. Moreover, IL 26 could be a marker of the disease activity and then a potential therapeutic target. In the present study, serum IL 26 level in lupus patients and control will be measured.</brief_summary>
