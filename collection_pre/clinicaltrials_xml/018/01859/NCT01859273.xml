	<brief_summary>Despite significant advances in the care of kidney transplant recipients, long term graft survival after renal transplantation remains suboptimal. Medication nonadherence and clinical inertia are key contributors to graft loss. The purpose of the proposed RCT feasibility study is to evaluate impact of a "bundled" wireless real time medication reminder system and blood pressure monitoring system in combination with a cognitive behavioral adherence skills enhancement program upon medication adherence, therapeutic drug concentration, and blood pressure, in nonadherent kidney transplant recipients with hypertension. We propose to recruit 60 kidney transplant recipients in phase 1 with 20 non-adherent continuing to phase 2 for a 5-month feasibility RCT.</brief_summary>
