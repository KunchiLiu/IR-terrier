	<brief_summary>The study will examine whether the provision of psychosocial support services for cancer patients in acute care can be optimized by the use of a structured combination of screening procedures with physician interviews and structured patient pathways. There is strong evidence that a third of all cancer patients in acute care are suffering from mental health conditions and that a third expresses the need for professional psycho-oncological support. However, physicians and nurses do not always identify these patients in need for support. Screening questionnaires are significantly better to identify distressed patients however the use of screenings alone does not necessarily improve the patients' emotional well-being. Purpose of this study is to evaluate a psychosocial stepped care model which aims to decrease the patients' distress.</brief_summary>
