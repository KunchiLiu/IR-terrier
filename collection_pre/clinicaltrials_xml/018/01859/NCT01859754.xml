	<brief_title>Octagam 5% Versus Comparator Post Marketing Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Post Marketing Study is a prospective, 2-armed, multicenter, non-interventional study. Patients will either be administered the brand of IGIV therapy ordered by their prescribing physician, or for patients issued unspecified or generic prescriptions of IGIV therapy, octagam® 5% or another brand of IGIV therapy will be provided by the Investigator according to federal, state and local regulations and good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines. The primary objective is to assess and evaluate the safety profile of octagam® 5% during or after administration under routine clinical use for all labeled indications, with a special emphasis on the occurrence of TEEs. The incidence of TEEs in patients receiving octagam® 5% will be compared with the incidence rate in a matching concurrent control group of patients receiving other IGIVs for routine clinical use.</detailed_description>
