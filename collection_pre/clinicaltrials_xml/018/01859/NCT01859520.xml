	<brief_summary>Sperms are prepared by sperm washing techniques before used in assisted reproductive technologies. Most commonly used sperm preparation methods are the swim up and the density gradient. Recent studies shows that the DNA integrity status of the spermatozoa is related to the success in assisted reproduction techniques. Sperm preparation methods may theoretically cause damage to sperm DNA. Therefore it is important to select the optimum method of sperm preparation causing least sperm DNA damage. Aim of our study is to investigate and compare the effect two different sperm preparation techniques on DNA fragmentation.</brief_summary>
