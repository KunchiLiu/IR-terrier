	<detailed_description>This study will serve as a component of a larger program investigating the benefits of stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with metastatic disease. This particular study will serve as a benchmark analysis. All patients will receive stereotactic radiotherapy directed at metastatic tumors. If primary prostate cancer is active and has not previously been treated with radiation therapy, conventional radiation therapy (6-8 weeks of daily treatment) may be recommended. The metastatic tumor will be treated at the same time. Hormone therapy will be recommended for all patients. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at regular intervals.</detailed_description>
