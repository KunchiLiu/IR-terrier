	<brief_summary>The study objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a radiofrequency (RF) source, the TriActive+ RF handpiece, for treatment of wrinkles and rhytides after multiple treatments. The primary endpoint is observation of changes to the surface by visual and photographic analysis. Secondary endpoints: measurement of patient satisfaction and comfort of the treatment and the measurement of adverse events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TriActive+ Radiofrequency (RF) for Non-Invasive Treatment of Wrinkles and Rhytides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Collagen varies genetically and structurally. Collagen breakdown increases with chronological age and photoaging. While fibroblasts normally replace damaged collagen fibers with new ones, the ability of fibroblasts to replace collagen is compromised by natural aging and environmental stress. Although collagen fibers form a loose interlacing network that is deformable, increased collagen breakdown leads to thinning and loss of the elastic fiber network in the dermis. This breakdown results in the formation of wrinkles, especially in areas of the skin exposed to the sun, which are most prone to wrinkles and imperfections. Nonablative dermal remodeling has gained tremendous popularity among patients and practitioners, offering a low incidence of adverse effects and modest improvement in the various signs of cutaneous photoaging, including rhytides, dyschromias and telangiectasias. Controlled thermal skin injury has been shown to effect a conformational change in the structure and length of collagen and may also induce fibroblast response for long-term collagen remodeling. Interest in utilizing radiofrequency energy to enhance deep tissue tightening and thus improve skin laxity has grown, as radiofrequency energy has been shown in multiple studies to tighten tissue, producing a noticeable skin lifting. This study is intended to evaluate the clinical performance of a radiofrequency (RF) source as engendered in the TriActive+ RF for the non-invasive treatment of wrinkles and rhytides. Eligible subjects who have signed an ICF will receive up to 8 treatments on at least two facial sub areas (left peri-orbital, right peri-orbital and peri-oral). Up to 25 subjects will be enrolled in the study at two sites. Treatments will start at a low power and then gradually increase, based on tolerability and tissue reaction. The goal is to progressively reach and maintain an epidermal temperature end-point. The site will use an IR thermometer to ensure the rise in temperature does not exceed 43Â° C. Treatments will be once a week with follow-up visits at one week, one month, and three months following the final treatment. Clinical assessments by the investigator and digital photographs will be taken prior to the baseline treatment, immediately prior to the 5th treatment, and at the 1 week, 1 month and 3 month follow-up visits.</detailed_description>

Having ever received fat injections or other methods of augmentation with injected or implanted material in the treated area or planning to during the study. History of keloid scarring or of abnormal wound healing. Suffering from current or history of significant skin conditions in the treated area or inflammatory skin conditions prior to treatment (duration of resolution as per the Investigator's discretion) or during the treatment course.
