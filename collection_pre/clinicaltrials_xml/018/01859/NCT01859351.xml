	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of escalating doses of the novel PI3K inhibitor WX-037 and to explore its effectiveness in combination with WX-554 which targets mitogen activated protein kinase (MEK1 and MEK2). Preclinical evidence indicates that these two novel compounds could provide targeted inhibition of both pathways to block tumour growth.</brief_summary>
