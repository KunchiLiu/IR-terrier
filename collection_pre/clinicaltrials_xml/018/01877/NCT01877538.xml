	<brief_summary>AIM: To validate the tracer [11C]donepezil for use in the parasympathetic nervous system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Investigators will include 7 healthy males aged 45-75 in our study. The participants will receive a careful medical examination, including a neurological examination, as part of the inclusion process. The subjects also have an MRI scan of the brain. PET/CT scans with [11C]donepezil are conducted. Six subjects will receive two PET/CT scans - once for the upper abdominal region and once for the head region two evaluate dynamic binding characteristics of the tracer in internal organ. Additionally, one single subject will receive 5 consecutive whole body PET scans to estimate radioactive dosimetry of this tracer. PERSPECTIVES: The study will potentially result in the development of a PET ligand for imaging the parasympathetic nervous system. This will have applications for research in Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease and other disorders, in which the autonomic nervous system is involved</brief_summary>
