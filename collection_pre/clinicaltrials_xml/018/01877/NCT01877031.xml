	<brief_summary>We aim to compare the use of ultrasound guidance alone versus a magnetically tracked needle to look at the time taken to place a central line, or specifically the time taken to place a needle in the internal jugular vein prior to utilizing the Seldinger technique to insert a central line.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Reality With Ultrasound Versus Ultrasound For Central Line Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine the incremental benefit of a innovative, robust, intuitive and portable, virtual reality(VR) imaging platform capable of displaying a tracked virtual needle tip with path trajectory along with the real time ultrasound(US) image of an internal jugular vein compared to US imaging of the internal jugular vein alone to reduce the complications associated with insertion of central lines. The studies primary outcome is the difference in time to insert a central line, from needle insertion to placement and confirmation of the wire in the internal jugular vein, compared to standard insertions using ultrasound guidance alone. Secondary outcomes will include the number of needle withdrawals, the incidence of carotid puncture and the incidence of pneumothorax. Finally, a subjective VAS rating of 1 to 10 for ease of insertion will be collected from participating anesthesiologists.</detailed_description>
