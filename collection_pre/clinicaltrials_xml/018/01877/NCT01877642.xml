	<brief_title>ADASUVE-Lorazepam Drug-Drug Interaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to compare the safety and pharmacodynamic profiles of concomitant administration of a single dose of ADASUVE and lorazepam (IM) compared to that of each agent administered alone. Respiratory pharmacodynamics will be monitored through recordings of respirations/minute and pulse oximetry. Other pharmacodynamic safety measures will include effects on blood pressure, heart rate, sedation and psychomotor measures of attention, information processing speed, reaction time, and coordination. Initially, 4 subjects will receive lorazepam 1 mg IM + ADASUVE 10 mg open label to validate the dose regimen. After the safety data are reviewed and the dose regimen confirmed, 18 non-obese, healthy male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50 will be enrolled in this double-blinded, double-dummy, randomized, 3-period cross-over drug interaction study.</detailed_description>

Subjects who have taken prescription or nonprescription medication within 7 days of Visit 2. Subjects who have had an acute illness within the last 7 days of Visit 2. Subjects who have a history of HIV positivity. Subjects who test positive for alcohol or have a positive urine drug screen. Subjects who have a history of allergy or intolerance to loxapine or amoxapine. Subjects who have a history of allergy or intolerance to lorazepam or any other benzodiazepine. Subjects who have a history of allergy or intolerance to polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or benzyl alcohol Female subjects who have a positive pregnancy test at screening or at admission to Visit 2, or are breastfeeding. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. Subjects who have any other disease(s), by history, physical examination, or laboratory abnormalities that, in the investigator's opinion, presents undue risk to the subject or may confound the interpretation of study results. Subjects who are considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable candidate for receiving lorazepam or ADASUVE.</criteria>
