	<brief_summary>Introduction: Pressure ulcers (PU) are the most common chronic wounds in all levels of care in health centers. The chronic wound care by skilled personnel is key to healing and management of these injuries. An inter-clinical telematic program for PU in Primary Care (PC) can improve the effectiveness of interventions and cost savings. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and costs reduction after the implementation in PC setting of a chronic wounds reference nurse and a teleconsultation program aimed to nurses for the management of PU in patients in home care setting. Methodology: A prospective pilot clinical trial in which 46 primary care nurses in Osakidetza will be randomly assigned to two parallel groups: experimental group and control group. Each nurse will recruit at least 1 new patient in home care with PU in stage II-III. The intervention will consist of a telematic advice from the reference nurse regarding chronic wound management in relation to a specific PU. Patients will be monitored for 8 weeks with a minimum of 4 repeated measurements of the Resvech Index 2.0. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, multilevel models or linear mixed models to take into account the auto-correlation at the individual level and nurse, will be used</brief_summary>
