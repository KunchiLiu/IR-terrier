	<brief_title>Samsung Medical Center-Lymphoma Cohort Study-II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the cure rate of lymphoma has been increased due to the development of newer effective drugs, a substantial portion of patients is still suffered from relapse. Furthermore, the treatment-related morbidity is another factor which can make the treatment outcome worse in patients with lymphoma, especially elderly patients. Thus, this study is going to assess factors which may affect the treatment outcome and the risk of treatment-related morbidity. 1.Biologic factors associated with the aggressiveness of lymphoma - molecular markers in serum, cytogenetic markers 2.Factors associated with the risk of treatment-related morbidity - comorbidity, nutrition status, performance status, quality of life at diagnosis</detailed_description>
