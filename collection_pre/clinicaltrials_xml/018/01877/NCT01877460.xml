	<brief_summary>This study compares the effects of isovolumetric (325 ml) preloads of chocolate milk supplemented with sodium alginates at incremental doses on inter-meal glucose levels, appetite scores and food intake in healthy adult men. The findings of this study will illustrate whether the addition of sodium alginate to chocolate milk will improve the glycemic properties of chocolate milk and will potentiate its satiating characteristics. This study will also elucidate whether sodium alginates, incorporated into chocolate milk, will influence glycemia, appetite sensations and food intake in a dose-dependent manner. It is hypothesized that there will be a synergy between milk and sodium alginate beyond either alone. When combined with milk components, sodium alginate is expected to improve glycemia and induce satiety more than does either milk alone or alginate alone.</brief_summary>
