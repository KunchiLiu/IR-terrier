	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted in up to 10 hospitals in Europe, up to 75 patients will be enrolled. The purpose of the study is to evaluate any debris that may be captured in the inline filter of the MICHI(TM) Neuroprotection System with Filter (NPS+f) during its use in a transcarotid stenting procedure. The MICHI NPS+f is an embolic protection device that uses reverse flow to protect the brain during stenting of the Internal Carotid Artery. It is CE marked and is used in routine practice for the purpose of this study.</brief_summary>
