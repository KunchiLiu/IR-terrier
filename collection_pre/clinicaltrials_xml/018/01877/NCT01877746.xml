	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effect of combined immunosuppressive therapy given on the top standard medical therapy of chronic heart failure according to current guidelines with standard medical therapy of chronic heart failure alone in patients with infammatory cardiomyopathy (ICM). Suitable subjects are characterized by EMB established presence of myocardial inflammation / negative polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) findings of cardiotropic infectious agents and with varying duration of heart failure symptoms and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (phase A). Further, to compare the effect of two regimens of combined immunosuppressive therapy in these patients with ICM (phase B).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males and females aged 18 to 65 years at the time of signing the informed consent 2. Signing of the informed consent. 3. LV systolic dysfunction defined by ejection fraction less than/or equal 40% as assessed by echocardiography and symptoms of heart failure (minimum NYHA class II) lasting for at least 2 weeks at the time of randomization. This criterion also determines the inclusion of the study subjects in one of two substudies (CZECHICIT 1 or CZECHICIT 2). LV systolic dysfunction (defined by ejection fraction less than/or equal 40%) and symptoms of heart failure (minimum NYHA class II) lasting 2 weeks to 6 months, with standard medical therapy of chronic heart failure given for at least 2 weeks the subject fulfills criterion for inclusion in CZECHICIT 1 substudy LV systolic dysfunction (defined by ejection fraction less than/or equal 40%) and symptoms of heart failure (minimum NYHA class II) lasting more than 6 months, with standard medical therapy of chronic heart failure given for at least 2 weeks the subject fulfills criterion for inclusion in CZECHICIT 2 substudy 4. Positive immunohistochemistry finding of myocardial inflammation in endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). EMB must have been be performed no more than 6 weeks prior to the inclusion in the study. Positive immunohistochemistry EMB finding demonstrating myocardial inflammation is defined by the presence of at least 7/mm2 cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) positive lymphocytes and/or at least 14 infiltrating leucocytes (LCA+ cells)/mm2 in the specimen. 5. The absence of infectious agent in EMB is defined by negative results of PCR testing of EMB specimens. PCR testing will be aimed to exclude the presence of enteroviruses (ECHO, coxsackie), adenoviruses, herpes viruses (herpes simplex virus (HSV1), EpsteinBarr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpes virus (HHV6)), Borrelia burgdorferi and parvovirus B19. In the case of parvovirus B19, a negative PCR result will be considered when less than 500 viral copies/ug genomic DNA are detected. EMB must have been performed no more than 6 weeks prior to the inclusion in the study. 6. Negative blood pregnancy test in fertile females. 7. Usage of the effective method of contraception (hormonal or 2 barrier method of contraception) 1. The presence of coronary artery disease, defined by angiographic findings of one or more coronary artery stenosis &gt; 50%, history of previous myocardial infarction and/or percutaneous or surgical myocardial revascularization. Coronary angiography must not have been performed more than 2 years before randomization into the study. 2. Permanent pacemaker including cardiac resynchronization therapy. 3. The presence of uncontrolled, persistent supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, with ventricular rate &gt; 120/min, lasting more than 1 week before EMB. 4. The presence of uncontrolled arterial hypertension, defined by blood pressure values &gt; 180mmHg (for systolic pressure) and/or 110mmHg (for diastolic pressure) lasting more than 3 months. 5. The presence of at least moderately hemodynamically significant primary valvulopathy or congenital heart disease (apart from patent foramen ovale and nonsignificant atrial septal defect). 6. Previous heart valve surgery (replacement or reconstruction) or surgical correction of congenital heart disease. adu. 7. A history of cytostatic therapy or radiotherapy. 8. Alcoholism defined as ethanol intake &gt;90 g/day. 9. The presence of uncontrolled endocrine of metabolic disorder. 10. Gravidity and lactation. 11. Known hypersensitivity to investigational drugs. 12. All contraindications of immunosuppressive therapy according to Summary of product characteristics (SmPC) of both investigational medicinal products: untreated systemic infection, poorly manageable diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, florid gastric or duodenal ulcer, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, history of malignant disease with oncological treatment finished less than 5 years, proven immunodeficiency, renal of hepatic insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 200 Âµmol/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity greater than three times the standard), leukocytopenia (leucocytes less than 4 x 10 9/l), thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100 x 10 9/l), anemia (hemoglobin concentration less than 100 g/l).</criteria>
