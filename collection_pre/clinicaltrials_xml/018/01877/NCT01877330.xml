	<brief_summary>This is a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine where is the optimal location for local anesthetic injection for ultrasound guided interscalene nerve blocks. The investigators are investigating if local anesthetic deposited between the nerve roots is more effective than local anesthetic deposited in the interscalene groove.</brief_summary>
