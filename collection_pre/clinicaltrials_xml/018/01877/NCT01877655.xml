	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ASP0113 compared with placebo as measured by a primary composite endpoint of overall mortality and CMV end organ disease (EOD) through 1 year post-transplant. Safety of ASP0113 in subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
