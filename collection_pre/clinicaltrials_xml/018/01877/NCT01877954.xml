	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study was to compare the absolute and relative effectiveness of asthma management in paediatric patients in the UK on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) maintenance therapy as extra-fine HFA-BDP (QvarÂ®) pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) compared with fluticasone propionate (FP) pMDI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Comparison of asthma control with extrafine-particle hydrofluoroalkane-beclometasone (EF HFA-BDP) vs fluticasone propionate (FP) in paediatric patients (5-11year olds). Patients identified from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and the Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD). Two analyses were conducted: 1. Comparison of outcomes achieved by EF HFA-BDP and FP in 5-6year old patients with those achieved in 7-11yr old patients. 2. Comparison of outcomes achieved by EF HFA-BDP used with or without a spacer to those achieved by standard particle fluticasone propionate (FP) used with a spacer.</detailed_description>
