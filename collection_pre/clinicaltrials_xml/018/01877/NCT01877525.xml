	<brief_summary>Resect and discard (RD) is a new paradigm for management of diminutive colorectal polyps wherein histology is determined by real-time endoscopic imaging; polyps are then resected and discarded rather than sent for histopathological review. The aims of this study were to compare the surveillance recommendations between RD and the standard of care where polyps are sent for histopathological review in a mixed setting of academic and community gastroenterologists and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an RD program for management of diminutive polyps.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resect and Discard Approach to Diminutive Colonic Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Diminutive (≤5 mm) colorectal polyps are prevalent in the screening population but have low risk for harboring advanced villous or dysplastic components and for developing into colorectal cancer. "Resect and discard" (RD) is a new paradigm for management of these diminutive polyps wherein histology is determined by real-time endoscopic imaging; polyps are then resected and discarded rather than sent for histopathological review. Aim: The aim of this study were to compare the surveillance recommendations between RD and the standard of care where polyps are sent for histopathological review in a mixed setting of academic and community gastroenterologists and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an RD program for management of diminutive polyps. Methods: This is a prospective, observational study conducted in a single outpatient endoscopy center over 12 months. Screening and surveillance colonoscopies were performed by four academic and two community gastroenterologists. All diminutive polyps (defined as ≤5 mm) were endoscopically imaged and histology predictions (adenoma vs. non-adenomatous polyp) were made using high-definition white light (HDWL) with/without narrow band imaging (NBI) at the discretion of the endoscopist. Diagnostic performance and accordance of recommended surveillance intervals from endoscopic imaging were compared to histopathological review of the polyps.</detailed_description>
