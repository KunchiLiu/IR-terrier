	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular complications account for the highest mortality in type 2 diabetic patients, mainly due to coronary artery disease (CAD). Most of the attention in treating CAD in type 2 diabetes is understandably directed toward treating coronary artery conditions. However there are other treatable culprits in these patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD, even in the absence of hypertension. It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Regression of LVH has been associated with an improved prognosis, independent of change in blood pressure (BP). Therefore, cardiovascular events and mortality in type 2 diabetes with CAD might will be reduced if the investigators can find novel therapies to regress LVH. Alpha-lipoic acid reduces oxidative stress which then regresses LVH. Alpha-lipoic acid can improve endothelial function in diabetic conditions. Hence, the main aim of this study was to assess whether alpha-lipoic acid could regress LVM in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD.</brief_summary>
