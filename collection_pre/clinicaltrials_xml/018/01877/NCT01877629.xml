	<brief_summary>To explore the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of two different formulations of ACT-129968, i.e., tablet versus capsule and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of two different formulations of ACT-129968, i.e., tablet versus capsule.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study in Healthy Subjects to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Two Formulations of ACT-129968</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 10 female and 10 male healthy subjects will be enrolled and will attend two treatment periods, separated by a 7-9 day washout. Over these two periods, two formulations of ACT-129968 (Treatment A: two capsules, 250 mg each; Treatment B: one tablet, 500 mg) will be administered in the sequence A/B or B/A to 10 subjects (5 females and 5 males) per sequence as determined by randomization.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Signed informed consent in the local language prior to any studymandated procedure. Women must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test predose on Day1 of each treatment period. Women of childbearing potential must consistently and correctly use (from screening, during the entire study, and for at least 28 days after last study drug intake) a reliable method of contraception with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year, be sexually inactive, or have a vasectomized partner. Women not of childbearing potential are defined as postmenopausal (i.e., spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 1 year without an alternative medical cause) or surgically or naturally sterile. No clinically significant findings on the physical examination at screening. Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 28.0 kg/m^2 (inclusive) at screening. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 100145 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 5090 mmHg, and pulse rate (PR) 4590 bpm (inclusive), measured on the dominant arm (dominant arm = writing arm) after 5 minutes in the supine position at screening. 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically relevant abnormalities, measured after 5 minutes in the supine position at screening. Hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis test results not deviating from the normal range to a clinically relevant extent at screening. Negative results from urine drug screen and breath alcohol test at screening and on admission to the unit (Day1) in Period 1 and Period 2. Ability to communicate well with the investigator, in the local language, and to understand and comply with the requirements of the study. Pregnant or lactating women. Known allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to any excipient of the drug formulation(s). History or clinical evidence of any disease and/or existence of any surgical or medical condition which might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug (appendectomy and herniotomy allowed, cholecystectomy not allowed). Previous history of fainting, collapse, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, or vasovagal reactions. History or clinical evidence of allergic rhinitis or asthma. Veins unsuitable for intravenous puncture on either arm (e.g., veins that are difficult to locate, access, or puncture, veins with a tendency to rupture during or after puncture). Previous exposure to the study medication. Treatment with another investigational drug within 3 months prior to screening or participation in more than four investigational drug studies within 1 year prior to screening. History or clinical evidence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the 3year period prior to screening. Excessive caffeine consumption, defined as 800 mg per day at screening. Alcohol consumption of &gt; 21 units/week or &gt; 3 units/day. Smoking within 3 months prior to screening. Previous treatment with any prescribed or overthecounter medications (including herbal medicines such as St John's Wort) within 2 weeks prior to first study drug administration. Loss of 250 mL or more of blood within 3 months prior to screening. Positive results from the hepatitis serology (Hepatitis B surface antigen and antihepatitis C virus), except for vaccinated subjects or subjects with past but resolved hepatitis (defined as positive finding for antibodies but negative findings for antigens), at screening. Positive results from the human immunodeficiency virus serology at screening. Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol. Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity at screening.</criteria>
