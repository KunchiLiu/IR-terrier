	<brief_summary>Cirrhosis is caused by sustained liver damage over several years either by alcohol, viral infection (Hepatitis B, C), a toxic substance (for eg. drugs, excess copper or iron in the liver), or by blockage of biliary system such that the liver undergoes progressive scarring that slowly replaces all of normal liver cells.(LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. For this condition of disease the liver transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available ,but due to lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it`s serious problems. Presently stem cells are used to be a one of the treatment for the same. So our approach is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell in condition of liver cirrhosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Liver Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the patients with liver cirrhosis will undergo administration of human Mesenchymal stem cell MSCs intravenously for these patients.To observe the results Liver function will be monitored by serum analysis.The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT), prealbumin(PA) and albumin (ALB) will be examined at pre-transfusion, and 6th days to 1 years post-transfusion.Also the to see Improvement evaluation by MELD score ,Quality of life ,Child-Pugh score will be done .</detailed_description>
