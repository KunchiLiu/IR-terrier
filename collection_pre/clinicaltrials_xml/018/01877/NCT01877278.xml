	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a wearable device using pulse electromagnetic fields on pain intensity reduction, measured by visual analogue score (VAS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), in patients affected by osteoarthritis Secondary aim is the evaluate the effect on knee effusion reduction, when present and to evaluate pain intensity changes corrected by pain threshold measured by pressure algometry.</brief_summary>
