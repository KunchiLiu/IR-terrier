Difficult" diabetic patient, i.e. those with very high HbA1c, patients &gt; 75y, those with diabetic foot ulcers, or those with a recent cardiovascular event have a high rate of readmission when discharged at home after an initial hospitalization related to diabetes or its complications.

	<brief_title>Coaching of Diabetic Patients After Hospital Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) hospitalized (&gt;24h) and presenting at least a risk factor for readmission after discharge at home, will be randomized, at time of discharge, between 2 groups: an "intervention" group and a control group (usual management). Intervention will consist in optimized organization of discharge at home followed by a ambulatory individualized coaching by a nurse including an initial situation assessment, a consultation meeting with the patient's GP in order to propose a Health Personalized Plan, then a follow up program with a face to face session each trimester in order to remind the objectives, to assess compliance to the plan, to evaluate difficulties encountered and to help to find solutions. Final data collection will be done in both groups by questioning the patient's general practitioner (GP) and by collecting data on potential hospitalization. Expected duration : 3 years. Readmission rate, duration and causes of hospitalization will be compared between both groups. Impact of the results : Reduction of costs, improved use of hospital specialized resources.</detailed_description>
