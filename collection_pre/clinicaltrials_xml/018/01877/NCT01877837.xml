	<brief_summary>This protocol will be investigating the use of stem cell transplantation, in related donors, to cure sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a recessive disorder caused by a point mutation that results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth position in the B-chain of hemoglobin. This leads to sickling of the red blood cells under many conditions, such as hypoxia, dehydration, and hyperthermia. The sickling leads to vaso-occlusion, which causes irreversible damage in almost all systems in the body, including the central nervous system (CNS), lungs, heart, bones, eyes, liver, and kidneys.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: 1) To determine disease free survival (DFS) at one year after matched sibling transplant using either bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), or umbilical cord blood (UCB) after a conditioning regimen consisting of Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, and Melphalan in patients 2-30 y/o Secondary objectives: 1. Overall survival 2. Rate of neutrophil and platelet engraftment for BM vs. UCB 3. Incidence of graft failure 4. Incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) 5. Incidence of chronic GVHD 6. Incidence of other transplant complications, such as veno-occlusive disease, central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) 7. Incidence of reactivation of CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BK/JC virus 8. Incidence of invasive fungal disease 9. Time to immune reconstitution via monitoring of lymphocyte subpopulations and immunoglobulin levels</detailed_description>
