	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of maximal strength training (MST) compared to standard rehabilitation in patients operated with total knee arthroplasty. Previous studies report reduced physical function and muscle strength despite successful surgery inserting an artificial implant. Furthermore, great loss of muscle strength has been found in these patients in the early postoperative phase. The study is a randomized controlled trial. The investigators hypothesize that MST will increase muscle strength and physical function more than standard rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
