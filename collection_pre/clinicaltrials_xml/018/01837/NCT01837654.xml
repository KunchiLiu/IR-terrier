	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether plantarflexion has an effect on the degree of urinary urgency and on the amplitude of detrusor contraction during filling cystometry in patients with detrusor overactivity (DO).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plantarflexion Reduces Urgency and Peak Detrusor Pressure in Patients With Detrusor Overactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with urodynamic DO will be included in this study. During urodynamics, the mean peak detrusor pressures of each contraction will be documented and compared. At the beginning of the 2nd wave, patients will be asked to perform continuous plantarflexion. Following each wave, patients will be asked to grade the severity of the urgency by a visual analogue scale (VAS).</detailed_description>
