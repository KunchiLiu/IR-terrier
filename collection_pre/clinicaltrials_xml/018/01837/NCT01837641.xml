	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the safety of LY3002813 by looking at adverse events. The study will also look at the effect the body has on LY3002813. Study participants will be healthy or will have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild to moderate AD. There will be seven groups of study participants. Five groups will receive a single dose of LY3002813 or placebo (no drug), followed by up to 4 multiple doses of LY3002813 or placebo given as an injection into a vein. Approximately 12 weeks will pass between the single dose and the first multiple dose. One group of participants will receive a single dose of LY3002813 given as an injection under the skin. One group of participants will receive a single dose of LY3002813 given as an injection into a vein.</brief_summary>
