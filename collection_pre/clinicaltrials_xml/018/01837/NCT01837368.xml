	<detailed_description>Validation of PRISM (Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self Measure). Assessment of quality of life and suffering in patients with tinnitus in an observational study using different questionnaires. (THI, TF, TBF-12, BDI, BAI, SF-36). THI - Tinnitus Handicap Inventory TF - Tinnitus Questionnaire after Goebel and Hiller TBF-12 - Tinnitus Impairment Questionnaire BDI - Beck Depression Inventory BAI - Beck Anxiety Inventory SF-36 - Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire Association between experiencing, verbalizing and regulating emotions and perceived tinnitus using the TAS-20 (20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale) and the above mentioned questionnaires. EEG-studies on the spontaneous brain activity of individuals affected by tinnitus consistently report differences in the composition of the EEG-frequency spectrum between individuals with tinnitus and healthy controls. Furthermore it has been shown that not only the auditory cortex but other regions of the brain are involved in the perception of the chronic ear noise as well. Among them is the limbic system which is associated with the emotional processing of the human brain. Correlation analysis are used to search for connections between the subjective behavioral outcomes mentioned above and the objective EEG-patterns. Aim of the current study is to provide conclusive models of associated assessments of the psychological strain end emotional stress of individuals suffering from tinnitus and objective EEG-analysis.</detailed_description>
