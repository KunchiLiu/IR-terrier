	<brief_summary>Compartment syndrome (CS) is a condition resulting from increased pressure within a compartment, which compromises circulation and can lead to critical limb ischemia. CS is one of the biggest medical challenges that our soldiers face after battlefield related injuries. Chronic or exercise-induced compartment syndrome (CS)rarely requires treatment; acute compartment syndrome is a medical emergency requiring surgery. Treatment of compartment syndrome is limited to fasciotomy, which relieves the pressure.The study purpose is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the administration of marrow-derived autologous bone marrow concentrate and PRP gel generated by a point of care marrow separation system for the treatment of compartment syndrome. And to show this treatment possibly enhances wound healing, bone healing, perfusion, infection control, and the return of limb function in patients with CS. Stem Cell and regenerative medicine development efforts for therapeutic angiogenesis and wound healing have predominantly focused on the mechanism of action of a single stem cell population to achieve neovascularization and improve tissue perfusion. It is well documented that other cells, including platelets, are efficient carriers of growth factors (VEGF-PDGF, bFGF, and SDF-1) and play active roles in angiogenesis and wound healing. Arteriocyte's development efforts focus on concentration of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells and platelets for delivery to the site of injury in a concentration sufficient to effect local tissue revascularization and repair. These products provide for the rapid, bedside preparation of autologous PRP and bone marrow stem cell concentrate. This clinical trial with the MagellanÂ® System is for the preparation of autologous cell concentrate for the treatment of wound, tissue and bone healing, improved perfusion, infection control, and the return of limb function in patients at risk of amputation.</brief_summary>
