	<brief_summary>Guidelines recommend measuring end organ damage and in particular arterial stiffness in patients with hypertension. However, until now it was not possible to measure arterial stiffness with the use of simple methods. Recently, novel and innovative devices offering determination of arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics from simple and non-invasive arm cuff measurements have now become available. This study therefore evaluates the value of non-invasively measured arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics for guiding antihypertensive treatment in selected patient populations (i.e. elderly patients, patients with diabetes mellitus, patients with heart failure, and patients with resistant hypertension).</brief_summary>
