	<brief_title>A Comparison of Recombinant Human Brain Natriuretic Peptide and Dobutamine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) whose left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) was &lt;40%, were assigned to a high BNP group (BNP â‰¤ 3000 pg/mL) or an extra-high BNP group (BNP &gt; 3000 pg/mL) , depending on their admission plasma BNP levels. Each group was then subdivided into rhBNP or dobutamine subgroups according to intravenous administration with either rhBNP or dobutamine for 24-72h. The effects of rhBNP and dobutamine on patients in the high and extra-high BNP groups were compared.</detailed_description>
