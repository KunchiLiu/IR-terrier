	<brief_summary>Randomized trial of grocery-store based nutrition counseling visits for weight management vs. in-office visits. The investigators will test pre- and post-intervention individual-level dietary quality, knowledge, self-efficacy around dietary choice, and cost of shopping, measuring difference between intervention and control arms. At the study's end, the investigators will also conduct focus groups with a subset of 20 patients (10 from each arm) and do a structured interview with the dietitian to better understand the feasibility, strengths and shortcomings of this approach. Patients who complete the main portion of the trial will be randomly selected for recruitment into a focus group and consented separately for that focus group at the end of the study. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to office-based visits, the KP Personal Shopper visits will result in higher member diet quality scores, better nutritional knowledge scores, higher self-efficacy and confidence around food purchasing decisions, and more favorable perception of the visit by both dietician and member. The KP Personal Shopper approach may also result in increased grocery store costs for some members. Long-term, the investigators hypothesize that improvements in member perception, knowledge and dietary quality will lead to improved health outcomes.</brief_summary>
