	<brief_title>Empyema Following Pneumonectomy for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development of an empyema following pneumonectomy is a devastating complication, especially if associated with an underlying fistula. Whilst the perioperative mortality of pneumonectomy overall is now less than 5%, this rises to around 25% when complicated by empyema, and about 50% when associated with fistula. In addition, there is the morbidity and social cost of long-term drainage, chronic sepsis and often multiple operations.</detailed_description>
