	<brief_title>Transarterial Ethanol Ablation(TEA) for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transarterial therapy has been playing an important role in the treatment algorithm for patients with multifocal or large intrahepatic lesions not eligible for surgical resection, transplantation, or local ablative therapy. Among the various options of transarterial therapy including chemoembolization (TACE), bland embolization, radioembolization, and TEA, chemoembolization is the only one that has been proven to be of survival benefits versus best supportive care in randomized controlled trials. TEA is a hybrid of bland embolization and chemical ablation. Utilizing a liquid agent of Lipiodol-ethanol mixture consisting of 33% ethanol by volume, TEA offers complete and long lasting embolization of both the arterioles and portal venules supplying the tumor and could possibly be more effective than particulate embolic agents in tumor vessel embolization. The component of ethanol very likely offers synergistic effect to embolization and causes tumor ablation.</detailed_description>
