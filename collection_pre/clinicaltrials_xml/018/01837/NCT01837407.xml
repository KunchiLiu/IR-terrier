	<brief_summary>Complex digital injuries involving soft tissue loss and digital nerve defect pose challenging problems for hand surgeons. This study uses the heterodigital arterialized nerve pedicle flap including the dorsal branch of the digital nerve for reconstructing a digital neurocutaneous defect of the proximal phalanx.</brief_summary>
