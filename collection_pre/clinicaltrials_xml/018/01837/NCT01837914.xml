	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a serious medical condition affecting an estimated 1-5% of children. The disease is believed to have several overlapping causes including large tonsils and small or narrow jaws. This prospective, randomized cross-over study will evaluate the effectiveness of orthodontic treatment of narrow upper teeth and jaws compared to the current standard of care which is surgical removal of the adenoids and tonsils. Patients will be evaluated by both an orthodontist and ENT physician, complete a series of questionnaires and undergo an overnight sleep study, both initially and after undergoing the randomized treatment. Patients who on reassessment have residual symptoms of sleep apnea will then be crossed over and receive the other form of treatment. The levels of improvement to both subjective (questionnaire) and objective (overnight sleep study) measures of sleep apnea will then be compared. The null hypothesis is there is no significant difference in improvement between maxillary expansion and adenotonsillectomy in the objective and subjective outcome measures in children with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Ages 6.0 to 10.0 years at the time of screening; Diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea defined as AHI&gt;2, confirmed on overnight, laboratorybased PSG; Parental report of witnessed apneas or habitual snoring (on average more than 3 nights per week); Deemed to be a candidate for ME by orthodontic evaluation; Deemed to be a candidate for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy by otolaryngologic evaluation. Severe OSA or significant hypoxemia in the presence of tonsillar or adenoid hypertrophy requiring surgical intervention defined as AHI&gt;25 or SpO2 &lt;90% for &gt;2% sleep time. An associated craniofacial syndrome or anomaly, including cleft lip and/or palate, or any anatomic or systemic condition that would otherwise exclude the patient from orthodontic treatment. Recurrent tonsillitis that meets American Academy of Otolaryngology â€” Head and Neck Surgery clinical practice guidelines for surgery. Extremely overweight defined as a body mass index zscore &gt; 2.99 for age group and sex. Severe health problems that could be exacerbated by delayed treatment for OSA, including: severe cardiopulmonary disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease); sickle cell disease; poorly controlled asthma (with &gt; 1 hospitalization in last year); epilepsy requiring medication; diabetes (type 1 or type 2) requiring medication; doctordiagnosed heart disease; or a history of stage II hypertension (HTN) defined as &gt; 99% percentile and/or requiring medication. Psychiatric or behavioral disorders that would otherwise exclude the patient from receiving orthodontic treatment</criteria>
