	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of death in most countries. It is well known that the reduction of cholesterol levels by statin therapy is associated with significant decreases in plaque burden. REVERSAL, ASTEROID, and more recently the SATURN II trial showed that in patients with CAD, lipid lowering with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin respectively reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis, even causing plaque regression of some lesions. CAD clinical events are related to plaque instability due to lipid content and activity within the atherosclerotic plaque. The investigators recently completed the YELLOW I study, and identified that intensive statin therapy (rosuvastatin 40mg) was associated with a reduction in the amount of lipid in obstructive coronary plaques, as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The YELLOW II study is designed to expand and build upon these results, and to provide mechanistic insights into the potential benefits of intensive statin therapy on atherosclerotic plaques.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>YELLOW II Study: Reduction in Coronary Yellow Plaque, Lipids and Vascular Inflammation by Aggressive Lipid Lowering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>YELLOW II is a single site study and will assess the regression of plaque lipid content and changes in plaque morphology from atherosclerotic lesions after high-dose statin therapy by utilizing NIRS, IVUS and optical coherency tomography (OCT) imaging modalities in the coronary arteries. We propose to image non-culprit coronary lesions using these modalities in patients with two or three diseased coronary vessels deemed to warrant intervention on clinical grounds. Thus, at the time of enrolment patients will undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) of a non-study culprit lesion, and triple-modality imaging of the potential non-culprit ('YELLOW') lesion. If there is high baseline lipid content in the non-culprit YELLOW lesion (max 4mm LCBI &gt; 150), patients will be formally entered into this study. Following this, all enrolled subjects will receive high-dose lipid lowering therapy (rosuvastatin 40mg daily). The non-culprit YELLOW lesion will undergo staged intervention 8-12 weeks following study enrolment and baseline imaging. At this time the YELLOW lesion will be reimaged to determine whether high-dose statin therapy caused a reduction in lipid content as assessed by NIRS, and other altered plaque morphology as assessed by OCT and IVUS. In addition, both at baseline and at the time of final non-culprit YELLOW lesion PCI, blood samples will be drawn during baseline and follow-up procedure to characterize reverse cholesterol transport by ability of patient HDL to accept cholesterol from cholesterol-laden (mouse J774) macrophage (cholesterol efflux) and the effect of patient HDL and apolipoprotein A1 on macrophage gene expression and migration.</detailed_description>
