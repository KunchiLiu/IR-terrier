	<brief_title>Educational Program for Hearing Aid Users With Internet Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aural rehabilitation aims to improve communication for people with hearing impairment. Education is widely regarded as an integral part of rehabilitation, but the effect of the delivery method of an educational program on the experience of hearing problems has rarely been investigated in controlled trials. Internet as a complement to aural rehabilitation has been tested in different studies with promising results. Though, until now not applied clinically as a part of an aural rehabilitation, focusing on hearing aid users with persistent self- reported hearing problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an internet-based aural rehabilitation for hearing aid users from a clinical population. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention group followed a five-week program that consisted of reading material, home training assignments, online and telephone interaction with an audiologist, and participation in a discussion forum. The control group only had access to reading material. The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Communication Strategies Scale (CSS) were used to measure the outcomes of this study; and were recorded before and directly after the intervention as well as 6 months post-intervention.</detailed_description>
