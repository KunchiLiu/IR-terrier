	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the long term effects of transcorneal electrostimulation (TES) in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In a prior study (NCT00804102) the results of short term stimulation pointed to a positive effect on the visual field and other parameters. In this study, the patients will be stimulated with either 0%, 150% or 200% of the individually determined phosphene threshold.</brief_summary>
