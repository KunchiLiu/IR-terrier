	<brief_summary>Low Level Light therapy (LLLT) has been used for tissue healing in many mucosal diseases that involve wounds, ulcers and inflammation, oral chemotherapy-induced mucositis in particular. Likewise IBD is characterized by chronic tissue inflammation, tissue damage and ulcerations in various extents. Therefore we hypothesize that LLLT might be effective in treating IBD and the Photopill capsule was developed for this purpose. An open-label, interventional, clinical trial was designed for assessment of the safety and feasibilty of the Photopill capsule treatment in patients with mild to moderate Ulcerative Proctitis. Primary endpoints being: safety reflected by the number and severity of adverse events and mucosal appearance at sigmoidoscopies day 14, day 28, day 42 compared to baseline condition. Furthermore clinical and biochemical parameters are monitored during the study.</brief_summary>
