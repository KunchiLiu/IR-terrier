	<brief_summary>Evidence have shown benefits of gut flora modulation in treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but few reports are available on the effects of multistrain probiotics and there are few reports available in this regard from our society. Thus, we investigated if probiotics are effective in our patients as well. We hypothesize that the multistrain probiotic Balance containing seven bacteria species including Lactobacillus strains, Bifidobacterium strains, and Streptococcus thermophiles reduces the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.</brief_summary>
