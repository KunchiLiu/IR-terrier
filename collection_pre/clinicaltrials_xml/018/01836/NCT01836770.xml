	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the contrast flow patterns in the epidural space using the inferior-anterior approach with continuous fluoroscopic guidance, and determine how well this approach correlates with appropriate contrast flow patterns and with analgesia at follow up. This knowledge may prove useful in guiding physician practice patterns in the non-surgical management of low back pain. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be suitable (ventral/anterior) epidural contrast spread based on inferior-anterior needle-tip position, particularly with appropriate needle tip position.</brief_summary>
