	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, and clarithromycin on how much LY2409021 is found in the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. The study is split into two parts, Part A and Part B. Participants in Part A are divided into two cohorts (groups). Each cohort will participate in two study periods. Period one involves a single dose of LY2409021. Period two involves either gemfibrozil or ketoconazole for 21 days with LY2409021 given once on Day 4. Part A will last for 51 days and will also involve screening within 27 days of the start of the study. Part B is only open to participants who successfully completed Part A of the study. Participants in Part B will receive one single dose of LY2409021 on Day 4 and clarithromycin for 21 days. Part B will last for 29 days and will also involve screening within 27 days of the start of the study.</brief_summary>
