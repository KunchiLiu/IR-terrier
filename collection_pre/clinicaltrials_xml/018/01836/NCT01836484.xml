	<brief_summary>This is a prospective diagnostic performance study which compares three new imaging methods with the current standard imaging method for the diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Accuracy of MRI, DWI MRI, FDG-PET/CT and FEC PET/CT in the Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Surgically Staged Endometrial and Cervical Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim is to demonstrate whether leading edge molecular imaging technologies (FDG-PET/CT, DW-MRI and Fluoro-ethyl-choline (FEC) PET/CT) can identify lymph node metastases with sufficient accuracy to allow non-invasive lymph node staging in patients with endometrial and cervical carcinoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Females 18 years or older; (no upper limit). 2. Patients with histologically confirmed cancer of the cervix or endometrium. 1. In patient with cervix cancer, there must be confirmation of invasive disease; FIGO stage 1B1 or higher FIGO stage demonstrated clinically and/or on MRI. In patients with advanced disease being considered for chemoradiotherapy treatment, patients may be considered for entry if nodal lymphadenectomy is being used to inform radiotherapy planning; 2. In patients with endometrial cancer, a) stage 1A with myometrial invasion or any higher stage and grade 3 b) stage 1A with myometrial invasion or any other higher stage and serous papillary or clear cell subtypes 3. stage II disease or above and any histology grade The MDT decision may be based on the combination of tumour characteristics on histology, clinical and imaging findings. 3. No contraindication to FDGPET/CT, FECPET/CT or MRI. 4. Fit for surgical lymphadenectomy, as determined by the local MDT. The patient should also be considered fit for extended field radiotherapy in cases where lymphadenectomy is being undertaken to inform radiotherapy planning. The extent of lymph node dissection will be made by the local multidisciplinary team, based on the presence of risk factors for lymph node metastases, according to the protocol. Patients must be considered fit to undergo lymph node dissection. 5. Able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with the study protocol procedures 1. Known contraindication to MRI or PET/CT scan. 2. Known allergy to FDG or FEC. 3. Not considered fit for lymphadenectomy (open or laparoscopic) or, where appropriate, radiotherapy, as determined by the local MDT. 4. If the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. 5. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) from the time consent is signed until 6 weeks after the last PET/CT scan unless undergoing hysterectomy. Note: subjects are not considered of childbearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal 6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within three weeks prior to being registered for the study. 7. Participation in another Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP). If patient's have recently completed a CTIMP trial they must have had their last dose(s) of study drug prior to their first imaging procedure on the MAPPING study. 8. Participation in another clinical trial (CTIMP or nonCTIMP) where the protocol contains imaging procedures that would occur during the MAPPING study. 9. Medical or psychiatric illness, which makes the patient unsuitable or unable to give informed consent.</criteria>
