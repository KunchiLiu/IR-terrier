	<brief_summary>- The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of an evaluation strategy based on utilization of high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hscTnT), followed by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in patients with low-intermediate risk chest pain consistent with a possible acute coronary syndrome compared to a standard of care (SOC) strategy. - Unicentric, randomized, controlled, open label clinical trial that will compare a fast strategy (hscTnT followed by CCTA) with a SOC strategy (serial ECG and cardiac biomarkers followed by stress/rest imaging study).</brief_summary>
