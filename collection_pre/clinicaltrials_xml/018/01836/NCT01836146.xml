	<criteria>Subject is ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years of age at time of consent Subject must be able and willing to provide written informed consent Subject must be able and willing to comply with the required followup schedule Subject has office Systolic Blood Pressure ≥ 160 mmHg at confirmatory visit Subject has a daytime mean Systolic Ambulatory Blood Pressure &gt; 135 mmHg during the two week screening period Subject has an office Systolic Blood Pressure that remains ≥160 mmHg despite the stable use of ≥3 antihypertensive medications concurrently at maximally tolerated doses, of which one is a diuretic or subject was previously on diuretic but documented to be diuretic intolerant, for a minimum of 14 days prior to the procedure and with an expectation to maintain for a minimum of 180 days post procedure. Subject has significant renovascular abnormalities such as renal artery stenosis &gt; 30% in either renal artery Subject has undergone prior renal angioplasty, renal denervation, indwelling renal stents, and/or abdominal aortic stent grafts Subject has hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease as determined by the Study Investigator Subject has a life expectancy less than 12 months, as determined by a Study Investigator Subject is participating in another clinical study which has the potential to impact their hypertension management (pharmaceutical/device/homeopathic) Subject is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential and is not using adequate contraceptive methods Subject has active systemic infection Subject has renal arteries with diameter(s) &lt; 4 mm in diameter or &lt;20 mm in length Subject has an estimated Glomerular Filtrate Rate (eGFR) &lt;45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 using the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula Subject has Diabetes Mellitus Type I Subject has multiple main renal arteries in either kidney Subject has an identified secondary cause of hypertension (for example, including, but not limited to, Polycystic kidney disease, Cushing's syndrome, Aldosteronism) Subject has evidence of significant abdominal aortic aneurysm (defined as maximum diameter of &gt;4 cm) Subject has had a myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris or cerebrovascular accident less than 180 days prior to enrollment Subject is expected to have cardiovascular intervention within the next 180 days Subject has a condition which would interfere with the accurate interpretation of the study objectives including but not limited to a large arm diameter that is unable to accommodate the blood pressure cuff or arrhythmia that interferes with automatic pulse sensing.</criteria>
