	<brief_summary>The study will compare the density and strength of regenerated bone in extraction sockets after being grafted with two different materials: Bone Allograft and Bone Allograft with Amnion. The investigators hypothesize that sockets grafted with the Amnion graft will exhibit enhanced healing patterns and will accelerate the formation of regenerated bone in the grafted areas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The amniotic allograft is a cryopreserved allograft tissue matrix derived from human placental tissues recovered from live healthy donors. Amniotic tissue is an abundant source of collagen which provides an extracellular matrix to act as a natural scaffold for cellular attachment in the body; collagen provides a structural tissue matrix that facilitates cellular migration and proliferation in-vivo. The product is developed using proprietory techniques by BioDlogics, LLC. The amniotic allograft growth factors are thought to enhance formation of a supportive scaffold for regeneration, to facilitate interactions between cell types, and to influence anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and immuno-privilege activities. Atraumatic extractions and socket grafts will be performed. Dental implants will be inserted into the grafted areas 8 weeks post-graft. The implants will be restored and followed for 24 months post-insertion.</detailed_description>
