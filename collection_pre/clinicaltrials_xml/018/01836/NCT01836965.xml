	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to validate a social skills training program manual for adolescents (ages 13-17) with Asperger's Syndrome or high functioning autism. Approximately 150 adolescents with autism spectrum disorders will participate in this study, in groups consisting of 6 adolescents and 6 peer volunteers. Participants will participate in both group therapy and peer generalization sessions (in the form of a photography class) once a week over the course of twelve weeks. Participants and their parents will complete paper and pencil, online, or phone measures and video-recordings to assess the participant's social skills prior to the intervention, at completion of the intervention and three months later.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a pre-test, post-test single group design with post test measures at one week after completion of intervention and follow-up at three months. Approximately 300 adolescents will participate in this study. The study will be conducted in ten cohorts of 12. Each cohort will have 6 participants and 6 adolescent volunteers (peers). Cohorts will be run in a time sequential manner with up to four cohorts running at a time. Participants and their parents will complete pre-test measures including both paper and pencil, online, or phone measures and a video-recording to assess the participant's social interaction skills and fluency. These adolescents will participate in both group therapy and peer generalization sessions once a week over the course of twelve weeks. Upon completion of the intervention, participants and parents will complete paper and pencil, online, or phone measures and video post-test measures. Participants will be encouraged to participate in a follow-up session where the paper and pencil and video measures will be completed again.</detailed_description>
