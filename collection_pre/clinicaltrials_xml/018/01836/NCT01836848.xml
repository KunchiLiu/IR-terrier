	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show if it is possible to detect secondary ischemic events in patients with severe brain injury or cerebral haemorrhage with the help of non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) by using the indocyanine green measuring of cerebral perfusion.</brief_summary>
