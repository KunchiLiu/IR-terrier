	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, 2-period, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and absolute bioavailability study in 6 healthy adult male subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IPI-145 ADME and Absolute Bioavailability Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Period 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 25 mg IPI-145, followed by a 15-minute IV infusion of approximately 2.8 Î¼g 14C-IPI-145 containing 14.8 kBq of radioactivity. In Period 2, the same subjects will receive a single dose of 25 mg 14C-IPI-145 as an oral suspension, containing approximately 3.15 MBq of radioactivity. There will be a washout period of at least 14 days between Period 1 and Period 2.</detailed_description>
