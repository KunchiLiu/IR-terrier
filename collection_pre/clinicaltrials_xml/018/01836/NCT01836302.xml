	<brief_summary>Delirium in the ICU is a prevalent problem occurring in up to 80% of ICU patients. A potential cause of delirium in ICU patients could be cerebral hypoxia. Septic shock is associated with high rates of delirium. The aim of this pilot study is two fold. First, to determine the feasibility and potential challenges of measuring cerebral oxygenation in ICU patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. And second, to see if the incidence and magnitude of cerebral desaturations correlated with ICU acquired delirium as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) scores.</brief_summary>
