	<brief_title>A Study to Find the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of KAE609 in Adult Male Patients With P. Falciparum Monoinfection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There will be a total of approximately 45 patients recruited into this study and six doses of KAE609 and will be investigated.The dose groups will run in sequence. Patient will be given a single dose of KAE609 and be followed up for 42 days.</detailed_description>
