	<detailed_description>This was a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, 3-arm study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of a once daily dose of QAW039 with placebo in non-atopic and atopic asthmatics both inadequately controlled despite receiving a low dose ICS background therapy, over a 12 week treatment period. Efficacy and safety of a once daily dose of QAW039 was also compared with an increased dose of ICS in atopic asthmatics taking low dose ICS as background therapy.</detailed_description>
