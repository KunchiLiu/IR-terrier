	<brief_summary>The development of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has improved the safety and diagnostic accuracy of the mediastinal lymph node (MLN) sampling. Still, in some diseases routine cytological specimens are considered insufficient and histological sampling is preferred. The aim of the study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNA and two other, more invasive procedures to obtain histological samples from MLN in patients with clinical and radiological features of sarcoidosis. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), EBUS-TBNA, EBUS guided transbronchial forceps biopsy (EBUS-TBFB), large bore (19G) histology TBNA as well as endobronchial forceps biopsy will be performed in 90 consecutive patients with mediastinal lymph node enlargement and clinical and radiological features of sarcoidosis. Diagnostic accuracy of each sampling technique will be calculated and compared to other techniques. Diagnostic yield of different technique combinations will also be calculated and the most efficient diagnostic approach will be defined.</brief_summary>
