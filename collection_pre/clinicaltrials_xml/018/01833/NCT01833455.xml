	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if reduction in premature ventricular contraction (PVC) burden results in a decrease in blood pressure, sympathetic outflow, plasma catecholamines and an improvement in baroreflex gain. Flecainide will be used for PVC suppression in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover fashion.</brief_summary>
