	<brief_summary>The study will seek to enroll 100 sickle cell or thalassemia patients who are age 12 or older who have access to a smartphone or tablet with Internet access daily. The study will evaluate patient-reported comfort level with using a mobile device to record their pain levels, as well as adherence to recording these levels daily. The study will track patients' assessment of their pain, actions taken, and outcomes related to pain management and provider involvement. This study will attempt to collect information about differences in the use of two traditional pain assessment modes (verbal scale and paper) versus the use of a pain assessment tool on a mobile device in the form of a smartphone, tablet, or iPad with an Android or iOS operating system.</brief_summary>
