	<brief_summary>Tendinopathy is a clinical syndrome of chronic pain and tendon degeneration that impairs a person's ability to perform daily activities and recreation. Traditional conservative treatments include activity modification, exercises, ice/heat, and medications and corticosteroid injection. A newer treatment is percutaneous needle tenotomy (PNT), in which the affected area is repetitively needled to disrupt pathological tissue and induce bleeding. This turns a nonhealing chronic injury into an acute injury with enhanced healing capability. Another is Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), whereby patients' own platelets are injected into the affected area, also activating growth factors. There has been promising research in these tendinopathy treatments but more research is needed. The investigators plan to expand on prior studies to identify a reproducible and efficacious treatment for chronic tendinopathy to reduce pain and improve function and quality of life. Our goal in this study is to assess the efficacy of ultrasound guided (USG) PNT versus PNT with peritendinous PRP as a treatment for chronic tendinopathy.</brief_summary>
