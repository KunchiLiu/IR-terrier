	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether using computerized screening questions can improve how well we manage symptoms related to cancer and cancer treatments. Advance care planning is a process in which teams of experts assist in with treatment plans, managing pain and other symptoms, emotional issues, and end of life issues. With advances in technology, it is now possible to get the patient's feedback directly and more often. It is thought that repeated questionnaires completed by the patient will provide a better and more accurate measure of the patient's needs and experiences but this has not been tested. This study is designed to learn if using a computerized assessment repeatedly is better than standard planning techniques.</brief_summary>
