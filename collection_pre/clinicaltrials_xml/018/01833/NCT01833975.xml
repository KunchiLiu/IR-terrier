	<brief_title>Study the Safety and Efficacy of Bone Marrow Derived Autologous Cells for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A spinal cord injury (SCI) refers to any injury to the spinal cord that is caused by trauma instead of disease.[1] Depending on where the spinal cord and nerve roots are damaged, the symptoms can vary widely, from pain to paralysis to incontinence.[2][3] Spinal cord injuries are described at various levels of "incomplete", which can vary from having no effect on the patient to a "complete" injury which means a total loss of function.Injuries at any level can cause:Increased muscle tone (spasticity),Loss of normal bowel and bladder control (may include constipation, incontinence, bladder spasms),Numbness,Sensory changes Pain,Weakness, paralysis. This Study is a single arm,Phase I/II , single centre trial to check active comparing the safety and efficacy of Bone marrow derived autologous cell(100 million per dose) trial to be conducted for 36 months.</detailed_description>
