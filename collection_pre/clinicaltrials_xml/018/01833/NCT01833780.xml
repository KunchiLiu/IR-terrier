	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: Intrapartum polimeraze chain reaction (PCR)of group B streptoccocus (GBS) test is more accurate than Culture of GBS at 35-37 weeks gestation for GBS carriage. The investigators will compare GBS culture and PCR results taken at 35-37 weeks gestation to intrapartum PCR GBS and GBS cultures status. The larger perspective of this trial is to check the possibility of replacing the GBS culture screening program at 35-37 weeks gestation with a more accurate examination (PCR), avoiding the changing GBS carriage status from the time of culture at 35-37 weeks to delivery.</brief_summary>
