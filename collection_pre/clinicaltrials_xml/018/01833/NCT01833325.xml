	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to determine if proton radiation therapy can provide effective and safe treatment for subfoveal neovascularization membrane (SNVM). The study will include adult patients over the age of 50 with macular degeneration, who have subfoveal neovascularization membrane (SNVM) and have had prior treatment with Avastin or Lucentis. Additional purposes of this study are to see if the growth of neovascular membranes can be stopped and overall vision improved with the use of protons and assess the side effects associated with this treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As part of this study, participants will have had a standard of care comprehensive eye exam by an Ophthalmologist to include visual acuity, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography prior to treatment. Participants will receive radiation using protons for 2 consecutive days. Each treatment will take 30 minutes. They will receive a total dose of 24 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) in 2 treatments. A total of 10 participants will be enrolled on this study. A comprehensive eye exam by an Ophthalmologist will be performed 30 days after radiation treatment with protons. Additionally, a physical examination per a Radiation Oncologist including a toxicity evaluation and comprehensive eye exam by an Ophthalmologist will be performed every 3 months for 1 year following radiation treatment.</detailed_description>
