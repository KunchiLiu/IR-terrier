	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory (lung) disease that makes it harder to breathe over time. To date, there is no cure for COPD, but it can be managed when diagnosed and proper medical care is provided. The purpose of this study is to determine if diagnosis and guided therapy with the use of spirometry is related to better patient outcomes (the condition of a patient's health) compared to usual care which may or may not include the use of spirometry. Spirometry is a standardized test used in medical practice that measures how much air your lungs can hold and how forcefully you can breathe out. For this study, the investigators will compare two groups: 1) intervention (treatment) group and 2) usual care group (control). The intervention group will have a spirometry test and the results will be provided to the primary care physician. The usual care group will not initially have a spirometry test. Both groups will be followed for outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COPD Assessment and Management Bundle Versus Usual Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if diagnosis and guided therapy with the use of spirometry is related to better patient associated outcomes compared to usual care which may or may not include the use of spirometry. To do this, we propose a comparative effectiveness trial of introducing a COPD assessment and management bundle targeted to primary care providers for patients suspected of having COPD versus usual care.</detailed_description>
