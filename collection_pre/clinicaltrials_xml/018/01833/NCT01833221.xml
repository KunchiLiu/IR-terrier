	<brief_title>Reinnervation of Facial Muscles After Lengthening Temporalis Myoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators want to study the physiology of nerve healing after lengthening temporalis myoplasty done for facial nerve impairment. The investigators already observed few cases of spontaneous neurotization and the investigators want to check the nerve command of the facial muscles. Clinical and photographic evaluations will be performed before and after a facial nerve block using 1% lidocaine.</detailed_description>
