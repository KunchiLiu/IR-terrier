	<brief_summary>Colour Doppler sonography has also been evaluated in differentiating adenomyosis from fibroids. Two dimensional color Doppler ultrasound revealed that 87% of adenomyosis cases had vessel distributions different from those found in leiomyoma cases, in addition to a high pulsatility index (PI) .Adenomyotic lesions had randomly scattered vessels or intratumoral signals while leiomyomas usually had peripheral scattered or outer feeding vessels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Because it is more sensitive, less angle-dependent, and not susceptible to aliasing , power Doppler Sonography has the potential to detect fluctuations in blood flow , with results superior to those of frequency-based color Doppler sonography, particularly in situations of low-velocity blood flow. Three dimensional power Doppler ultrasonography can be applied to differentiate between uterine adenomyosis and leiomyoma ,and it may reduce the number of false positives by detailed investigations.</detailed_description>
