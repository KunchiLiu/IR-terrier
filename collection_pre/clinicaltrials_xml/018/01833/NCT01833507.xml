	<brief_summary>Obesity is common in adults with complex medical problems with ensuing complications afterwards. Obese patients suffer higher mortality and impaired functional status often as a result of their obesity. One primary goal to reduce both obesity and improve functional status is exercise. The investigators hypothesize that a simple exercise intervention with limited behavioral goal-setting will reduce weight and increase functional status compared to usual care. As a secondary measure, the investigators hypothesize that using this intervention will reduce hospital admissions and ER visits.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We are enrolling up to 150 subjects where half will receive a pedometer and behavioral goal-setting at enrollment and half will receive a pedometer and goal-setting 2 months later. It is a 4 month study. Our aims are as follows: Primary Aim: Determine the relationship between gait speed, grip strength and walking steps in patients randomized to a self-exercise program compared to usual care in complex medical patients. Second Primary aim: To determine the effect of a self-exercise program compared to usual care on weight loss in complex medical patients. Secondary Aim: Determine the relationship between the number of hospitalizations in patients randomized to a self-exercise program compared to usual care in complex medical patients.</detailed_description>
