	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypothesis that a wearable automated bionic pancreas system that automatically delivers both insulin and glucagon can improved glycemic control vs. usual care for young people with type 1 diabetes 12-20 in a diabetes camp environment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 1220 years with type 1 diabetes for at least one year. Diabetes managed using an insulin infusion pump and rapid or veryrapidacting insulins including insulin aspart (NovoLog), insulin lispro (Humalog), and insulin glulisine (Apidra) for at least three months prior to enrollment. Otherwise healthy (mild chronic disease such as asthma will be allowed if well controlled that do not require medications that result in exclusion). Unable to provide informed assent Unable to comply with study procedures. Current participation in another diabetesrelated clinical trial other than one that is primarily observational in nature. Total daily dose (TDD) of insulin that is &gt; 2 units/kg. Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), plan to become pregnant in the immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception Hypoglycemia unawareness (selfreported or legal guardian report of consistent lack of hypoglycemia symptoms when BG is &lt; 50 mg/dl) End stage renal disease on dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis). History of prolonged QT or arrhythmia History of congenital heart disease or current known cardiac disease Acute illness (other than nonvomiting viral illness) or exacerbation of chronic illness other than type 1 diabetes at the time of the study. Seizure disorder or history of hypoglycemic seizures or coma in the last five years Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and any psychiatric hospitalization in the last year), or treatment with second generation antipsychotic medications, which are known to affect glucose regulation. Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might be susceptible to radiofrequency interference. Use noninsulin, injectable (e.g. exenatide, pramlintide) or oral (e.g. thiazolidinediones, biguanides, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, dipeptidyl peptidase4 inhibitors, acarbose)antidiabetic medications. History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and vomiting. Unwilling or unable to completely avoid acetaminophen during the usual care and closedloop BG control portions of the study. History of eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia, "diabulemia" or omission of insulin to manipulate weight History of intentional, inappropriate administration of insulin leading to severe hypoglycemia requiring treatment Any factors that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would interfere with the safe completion of the study procedures.</criteria>
