	<brief_summary>Calf muscle atrophy (muscle degeneration) is common following Achilles tendon repair due to the immobilization period necessary to ensure optimal healing. The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) after Achilles tendon surgery will reduce calf muscle atrophy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E-Stim and Achilles Tendon Repair Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of this study are to evaluate the use of electrical stimulation on muscle cross-sectional area and muscle fascicle length following post-operative Achilles tendon surgery. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive an electrical stimulation unit (CompexÂ®, DJO Global, San Diego, CA). Twenty of these units will be experimental and 20 will be sham.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Any patient who is having surgery to treat an acute Achilles tendon rupture or any surgery that involves reflecting or repairing the distal Achilles tendon. 1. Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 45 2. Inability to consent to participate in clinical research 3. Any patient younger than 18 years old 4. Any limitations that would interfere with the delivery of electrical stimulation including, but not limited to: 1. Presence of an insulin pump 2. Pacemaker, defibrillators or other implanted electrical device 3. Neurostimulation implants 4. History of epilepsy/seizure 5. Current pregnancy. A pregnancy test will be performed for any female prior to surgical intervention per hospital protocol unless she is postmenopausal or has been sterilized. 6. Active malignancy 7. Peripheral neuropathy 8. Diabetes Mellitus 9. Ischemia of lower limbs 10. Active infection 11. Following acute trauma or fracture</criteria>
