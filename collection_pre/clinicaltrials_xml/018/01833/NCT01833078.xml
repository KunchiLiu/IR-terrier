	<brief_summary>Frailty is a geriatric syndrome leading to physical deterioration including muscle wasting (sarcopenia) and unintentional weight loss. There are currently no approved therapies for frailty. Ghrelin is a hormone produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite centers in the brain. The investigators already know that a single dose of Ghrelin improves food intake immediately after the dose in frail older people. In this study, the investigators are trying to find out if repeated daily doses of ghrelin will help frail older people improve food intake for multiple days in a row.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ghrelin Repeated Dose Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design is an open label, repeated dose administration study in which we will examine the safety and efficacy of repeated subcutaneous ghrelin administration in frail individuals. There will be a screening visit plus three additional study visits at the CTRC on Days 1, 2, and 7. Participants will receive an injection of ghrelin subcutaneously once daily on Days 1 and 7 and will self-administer the subcutaneous injection before breakfast on Days 2-6 at home. A food record will be kept from Day -3 to Day 6. We will assess the efficacy of repeated ghrelin doses to sustainably increase caloric intake from pre-treatment baseline without hyperglycemia or raising of cortisol levels.</detailed_description>
