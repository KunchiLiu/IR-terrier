	<brief_summary>In a previous study conducted within the Center for Musculoskeletal Research (CMR) on Total Hip Arthroplasties (THA), it was determined that the investigators could simultaneously capture in vivo sound and motion of the femoral head within the acetabular cup during weight-bearing activities for subjects implanted with either a metal-on-polyethylene (MOP), metal-on-metal (MOM) or ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) THA. This was the first study to apply sound analysis as an impulse excitation technique for testing hip conditions and for measuring femoral head sliding in the acetabular component of human hip joints by acoustic means. Unfortunately, no studies have been conducted to compare the in vivo kinematics and sound for subjects implanted using various surgical approaches. It could be hypothesized that subjects having various surgical approaches could lead to an increase or reduction of in vivo hip separation. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze a total of 30 subjects implanted with either an anterior (10 patients), anterior-lateral (10 patients), or posterior-lateral (10 patients) surgical approach to determine if any of these surgical approaches leads to less or more in vivo hip separation. All subjects will be analyzed under in vivo weight-bearing conditions using video fluoroscopy to determine in vivo motion.</brief_summary>
