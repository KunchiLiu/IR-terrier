	<brief_summary>Effects of creating an artificial night on physiological changes, weight and feeding tolerance in preterm infants. Introduction:Nowdays,with medical advances in intensive care increased chance of survival in premature infants.One of the major concerns exposure to high light levels in neonate &amp; subsequent it is increase in metabolism rate.So,this study was conducted to determine the effect of creating an artificial night on physiological changes, weight and feeding tolerance in preterm infants. Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial dual group study, 38 preterm infants (gestational age of 30-34weeks)due to prematurity hospitalized at Ghaem NICU,were evaluated within 10 days. Infants were divided into two groups of 1200-1700 and 1701-2200g based on the weight and the weight of each group were randomized into artificial night(dark period was from 19 to 7 during incubator was covered with linen cloth &amp; light period was from 7 to 19 removed the cover) and control groups(continuous lighting). Mothers &amp; infants through questionnaires,interviews,observation &amp; document completion, changes in physiologic &amp; weight befor entering the study &amp; then physiologic changes twice a day,weight &amp; feeding tolerance were collected daily.Data were analyzed using spss v.16 software.</brief_summary>
