	<brief_title>A Study of DC-CIK to Treat Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 60 patients with HCC, who had received complete resection or TACE and got Complete remission (CR) or partial response (PR), will be randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly follow up), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 2-3 cycles of DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks). Patients in group B will have no anti-tumor therapy.</detailed_description>
