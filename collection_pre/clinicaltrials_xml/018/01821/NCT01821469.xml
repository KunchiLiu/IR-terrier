	<brief_summary>This research project follows two main objectives: 1) Assess anatomical and functional cerebral abnormalities in bipolar disorder. 2) Evaluate anatomical and functional changes after the application of a psychoeducational program in these patients. Specifically, this project aims to assess neurophysiological (fMRI - activation and functional connectivity) and neuroanatomical (morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging) specificities related to bipolar disorders and the therapeutic response to the psychoeducation. The results of this thesis project would also contribute to the validation of a pathophysiological model of the bipolar disorder.</brief_summary>
