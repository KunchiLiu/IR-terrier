	<brief_summary>Much of the basic general medical care and chronic disease management in rural Honduras comes from groups of volunteers setting up temporary clinics run by volunteers. These clinics, also known as brigades, or medical missions, are often criticized for their lack of quality and the lack of follow-up, both of which stem, in part, from understaffing with volunteer physicians. This study is designed to assess if it is feasible, safe, and acceptable to treat patients in short-term mobile medical clinics in rural Honduras using US physicians connected with patients by videoconference.</brief_summary>
