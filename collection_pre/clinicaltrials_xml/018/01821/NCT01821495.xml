	<brief_summary>Concurrent of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the main treatment method for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, Relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure. A series of studies reported that dendritic and cytokine-induced killer cells (DC-CIK) have a broad anti-tumor spectrum. We suppose that DC-CIK will improve the prognosis of NPC. In this study, the patients with NPC will be treated with DC-CIK cells after concurrent of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of DC-CIK for NPC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of DC-CIK to Treat NPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 60 patients with staging Ⅱ-Ⅲ of NPC, after accepting concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy, will be randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly follow up), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 2-3 cycles of DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks). Patients in group B will have no anti-tumor therapy.</detailed_description>
