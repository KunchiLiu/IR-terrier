	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of LY3045697 after multiple doses and to determine how long LY3045697 remains in the body. Each participant is expected to complete 3 dosing periods. At least 7 days will pass between dosing periods.</brief_summary>

In addition, participants with the following findings will be excluded: Confirmed corrected QT (QTcF) interval &gt;450 millisecond (msec) for men and &gt;470 msec for women; additional ECGs may be performed if required Complete bundle branch blocks and other conduction abnormalities other than mild first degree atrioventricular block Irregular rhythms other than sinus arrhythmia or occasional, rare supraventricular ectopic beats History of unexplained syncope Family history of unexplained sudden death or sudden death due to long QT syndrome Twave configurations are not of sufficient quality for assessing QT interval, as determined by the investigator Show evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or positive human HIV antibodies, hepatitis C and/or positive hepatitis C antibody, or hepatitis B and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Intend to use overthecounter or prescription medication within 5 days prior to dosing, other than daily multivitamin therapy, stable thyroid hormone replacement or medication assessed as acceptable by the investigator and not interfering with the integrity of the study data collection. Medications for benign indications in healthy participants may be continued, with the exception of drugs that may alter adrenal function, blood pressure or potassium, such as the use of excessive nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, diuretics, antihypertensive drugs, betaagonists, and nasal decongestants Have donated blood of more than 500 milliliters (mL) within 60 days prior to dosing. Donation of more than 1.5 liters of blood (for men) / more than 1.0 liters of blood (for women) in the 10 months preceding the start of this study (this is the first administration of study drug) Have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week or participants unwilling to stop alcohol within 48 hours of entry into study until discharge each period [1 unit = 12 ounces (oz) or 360 mL of beer; 5 oz or 150 mL of wine; 1.5 oz or 45 mL of distilled spirits] Have an abnormal blood pressure (supine) defined as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;95 or less than (&lt;) 50 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) and/or systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;150 or &lt;90 mmHg confirmed by at least 1 repeat measurement Regularly use known drugs of abuse or show positive findings for such use on urinary drug screening Use of natural licorice (glycyrrhizinic acid) within 5 days of enrollment or use during the study Are unwilling to abstain from using grapefruitcontaining products and saltsubstitutes containing potassium for the duration of the study Have known sensitivity or are unable to tolerate spironolactone Have serum potassium &gt;upper limit of normal (result from suspected hemolyzed sample may be repeated) Have serum sodium &lt;lower limit of normal per lab reference range Have serum creatinine &gt;124 micromole/liter (μmol/L) (male); &gt;106 μmol/L (female)</criteria>
