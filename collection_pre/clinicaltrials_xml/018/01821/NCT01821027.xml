	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) affect the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) and pharmacodynamics (ie, how the drug affects the body) of a single dose of simvastatin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) on the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety of Simvastatin in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the assigned treatment), single-center, fixed-sequence study (all volunteers receive the same medication on the same days and in the same order) to determine how multiple doses of canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of simvastatin (a drug used to treat raised cholesterol). The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. During the open-label treatment phase, each volunteer will receive a single 40 mg dose of simvastatin on Day 1, followed by 300 mg of canagliflozin once daily on Days 2 through 6. On Day 7, volunteers will receive both simvastatin 40 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg. Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 32 days</detailed_description>
