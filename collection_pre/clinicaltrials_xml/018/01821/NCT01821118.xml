	<brief_summary>Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) is a condition caused by the build-up of a protein called amyloid, predominantly AÎ²40, within the walls of brain blood vessels, especially those blood vessels in the occipital lobe of the brain. Probable CAA may be defined as two or more hemorrhages in the brain cortex in individuals 55 years of age or older. This study will examine the study drug (PF-04360365) vs. placebo (saline) at 10 mg/kg - Day 1 and the maintenance dose of the study drug (PF-04360365) vs. placebo (saline) at 7.5mg/kg on Days 30 and 60. Subjects will be followed for 6 months after receiving the last dose of study medication.</brief_summary>
