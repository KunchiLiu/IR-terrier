	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Orally ingested lactoferrin has effects on promotion of growth and differentiation of the immature gut; also it has immunomodulatory properties, so it will prevent serious infections in preterm infants. The aim of the study is to: - Evaluate the effectiveness of oral lactoferrin in prevention of neonatal sepsis. - Compare two dose regiment of lactoferrin supplementation. - Study effect of lactoferrin supplementation on serum iron stores. It is a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study, it will include 180 preterm neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of of Ain Shams University Hospitals and Manshiet El Bakry Hospital. •Group A: Who will receive oral lactoferrin supplementation in a dose of 100 mg/day. •Group B: Who will receive oral lactoferrin supplementation in a dose of 150 mg/kg/ twice daily. •Group C (Controls): Who match the subjected neonates, will receive placebo in form of distilled water.</brief_summary>
