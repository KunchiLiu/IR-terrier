	<brief_summary>Adenomyosis is a rare non-malignant disease of the uterus that causes significant symptoms including heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain. The only widely accepted treatment for adenomyosis is hysterectomy. The investigators will use a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, as a therapy based on animal models of the disease and our prior clinical research to observe any objective improvement in the extent of the disease using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)and standard measurements for other gynecologic diseases to measure symptomatology.</brief_summary>
