	<brief_summary>The study will compare initial peri-implant bone healing and longitudinal osseointegration between a fully microtextured dental implant and an analogous implant with a smooth machined collar. The investigators hypothesize the fully textured implant will result in less peri-implant crestal bone resorption than the implant with a machined collar.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance of MicroTextured Dental Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Zimmer dental has developed a microtextured tapered screw-vent implant design with a titanium skin that has been grit-blasted with hydroxyapatite particles resulting in an overall roughened surface, which, when compared to an implant with a machined (smooth) collar (narrow band around the top of the device) surface is thought to increase the apposition of osseous tissue integration and to promote epithelial attachment to the implant device.</detailed_description>
