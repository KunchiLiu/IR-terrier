	<brief_title>A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Golimumab in Japanese Patients With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo-controlled (study in which an inactive substance is given to one group of participants, while the study medication is given to another group), multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), 2-arm (two groups), parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time), randomized-withdrawal (participants receiving study medication for a specified time will be later randomized to receive either study medication or placebo.) study, including an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) induction phase. Approximately 200 participants will participate in this study. This study will consist of an induction phase, a maintenance phase, and a follow-up phase. During the induction phase (lasting 6 weeks) participants will receive 200 mg subcutaneous (SC) (under the skin) golimumab at Week 0 and 100 mg SC golimumab at Week 2. During the maintenance phase (up to Week 52) all participants who show a clinical response (measure of therapeutic effect of study medication) to golimumab during the induction phase will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SC administration of placebo (Group 1) or 100 mg golimumab (Group 2) every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 52. Participants who do not show clinical response to golimumab will also receive 100 mg SC administration of golimumab until Week 4 and if, by Week 8 of the maintenance phase, these participant's disease activity does not appear to be improving, participants will be discontinued from further study medication administration and will be followed up for safety evaluations 16 weeks after the last administration of study medication. However, if disease activity of these participants improves at Week 8, they will continue to receive golimumab (100 mg every 4 weeks) through Week 52 of the maintenance phase. The follow-up phase will be of 16 weeks duration. During this study, any participant who have a clinical response during the induction phase but lose clinical response at any time will be eligible for dose adjustment only once as follows: 1) participants receiving placebo (Group 1) will receive golimumab 100 mg; 2) participants receiving golimumab 100 mg (Group 2) will continue to receive golimumab 100 mg. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, laboratory measurements, antinuclear antibodies/anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies, and vital signs. The maximum study duration for a participant will be 68 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants with ulcerative colitis diagnosed prior to screening Participants should have current treatment for ulcerative colitis with at least one of the following therapies: oral 5aminosalicylates (5ASAs), oral corticosteroids, 6mercaptopurine (6MP), or azathioprine (AZA) Participants must have a history of failure to respond to, or tolerate, at least 1 of the following therapies: oral 5ASAs, oral corticosteroids, 6MP, or AZA Participants must be ambulatory and have moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis confirmed during the screening sigmoidoscopy by a greater than or equal to 2 using the endoscopy subscore of the Mayo score Participants must have moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, defined as a baseline Mayo score of 6 to 12, inclusive Participants with ulcerative colitis limited to the rectum only or to less than 20 cm of the colon Participants with stoma Participants with fistula or history of fistula Participants who require, or required within the 2 months prior to screening, surgery for active gastrointestinal bleeding, peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, or intraabdominal or pancreatic abscess requiring surgical drainage, or other conditions possibly confounding the evaluation of benefit from study agent treatment Participants with symptomatic colonic or small bowel obstruction, confirmed by objective radiographic or endoscopic evidence of a stricture with resulting obstruction</criteria>
