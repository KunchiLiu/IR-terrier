	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer to the historical standard value in in-vitro fertilization (IVF)/embryo transfer (ET) cycles in Japan (Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology [JSOG] 2009 registry data: 24.3 percent [%]). The secondary objectives of this trial are to assess the biochemical pregnancy rate per ET, pharmacokinetics, and safety of COL-1620.</brief_summary>
