	<criteria>Male and female patients ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years of age with or without documented coronary artery disease. Taking statin therapy for at least 30 days prior to Screening (Visit 1). In the opinion of the investigator, patient currently on statin therapy other than atorvastatin 40 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg who could be switched to one of these regimens at Visit 1 for the duration of the study. Clinically significant heart disease which will require coronary bypass, PCI, cardiac transplantation, surgical repair and/or replacement during the course of the study. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure within the past 90 days. Have a body mass index (BMI) greater than 36 kg/m2. Patients of East Asian descent (due to pharmacological food effect noted for rosuvastatin). Previous or current diagnosis of severe heart failure (NYHA Class IIIIV) or a documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt; 25% as determined by contrast left ventriculography, radionuclide ventriculography or echocardiography. The absence of an LVEF measurement in a patient without a previous or current diagnosis of heart failure does not prohibit entry into the study. Patients with evidence of cardiac electrophysiologic instability including a history of uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation/flutter or uncontrolled supraventricular tachycardias with a ventricular response heart rate of &gt; 100 beats per minute at rest within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Evidence of renal impairment Have hypertension that is uncontrolled defined as 2 consecutive measurements of sitting blood pressure of systolic &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 95 mmHg at Visit 1. Women of childbearing potential who do not agree to use two reliable methods of birth control during the study and for one month following the last dose of study drug, or pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. Where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive ßhCG laboratory test (≥ 5 IU/L) at the time of enrollment. Where women of childbearing potential are defined as women not surgically sterilized and between menarche and 1 year post menopause, and a reliable method of birth control includes use of oral contraceptives or levonorgestrel; or a reliable barrier method of birth control (diaphragms; cervical caps; condoms; intrauterine devices; partner with vasectomy; or abstinence). Current or recent (within 12 month prior to Visit 1) treatment with immunosuppressants (e.g., Cyclosporine). Triglycerides &gt; 4.5 mmol/L at screening Visit 1. Use of fibrates of any dose or niacin/nicotinic acid 250 mg or more within 90 days prior to Visit 1 Any medical or surgical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of medication including, but not limited to any of the following: cholecystitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or any gastric bypass alteration. Evidence of hepatic disease A total bilirubin that is &gt; ULN by local laboratory at screening, Visit 1 History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 5 years of Visit 1 whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin. History or evidence of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months of Visit 1. Current dependence on nicotine containing products. Any surgical or medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may place the patient at higher risk from his/her participation in the study, or is likely to prevent the patient from complying with the requirements of the study or completing the study. Use of any HIV and/or chemotherapy drugs, and/or antibiotics within 30 days or 5 halflives of Visit 2, whichever is longer. Use of other investigational drugs and devices at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5 halflives of Visit 2, whichever is longer. History of noncompliance to medical regimens or unwillingness to comply with the study protocol. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would confound the evaluation and interpretation of efficacy and/or safety data.
