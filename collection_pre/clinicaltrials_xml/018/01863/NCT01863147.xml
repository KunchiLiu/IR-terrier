	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular complications account for the highest mortality in type 2 diabetic patients, mainly due to coronary artery disease (CAD).Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD, even in the absence of hypertension .It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality . Sitagliptin, an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), may regress left ventricular mass (LVM) in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with CAD .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients had to have the levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt; 7.0 %. They also had to have either angiographically documented coronary artery disease or a previous history of myocardial infarction. In addition, they were also required to have an office BP &lt; 135/85 mm Hg and the presence of LVH on echocardiography (American Society of Echocardiography criteria LVM index [LVMI] &gt; 115 g/m2 for men and &gt; 95 g/m2 for women) . Patients were excluded if they were currently prescribed glucagonlike peptide (GLP) 1 analogues or DPP4 inhibitors or glucosidase inhibitor or antihypertensive drugs (including bblockers), diabetes medications, estrogen supplements, thyroxine, diuretics, hypolipidemic drugs. They were also excluded if they had renal and liver dysfunction, heart failure, or malignancy, or were unable to give informed consent. Patients with contraindications to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (pacemakers, claustrophobia) were also excluded, as were pregnant or lactating women.</criteria>
