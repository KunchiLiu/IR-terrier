	<brief_title>Study of Dexamethasone-Allantoin-Metronidazole (DAM) Solution in the Treatment of Post-Operative Ileus (POI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative ileus (POI) is temporary slowing down or stopping of bowel function and a slowing down of movement of contents of the intestines. This functional impairment persists for a variable duration following surgery, usually resolving within 1 day in the small intestine, 1 to 3 days in the stomach and 3 to 5 days in the colon. When POI persists for more than 5 days, it is generally considered severe, sometimes referred to as complicated or prolonged POI, and increases the risk for related morbidity. This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study designed to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of DAM solution for the treatment of POI in patients following abdominal operation. It will be conducted at multiple centers in China. A total of 480 patients will be enrolled in the study. Patient participation in the study will last for up to postoperative day 7 [POD 7] , with follow-up safety assessments to occur 7 days after the operation.The treatment outcome measures include: 1) GI2(Time to achieve recovery of both upper and lower GI function as measured by a composite endpoint of time to the first bowel movement and time to tolerate first solid food). 2) Time to ready for discharge. 3) Time to the first flatus.</detailed_description>
