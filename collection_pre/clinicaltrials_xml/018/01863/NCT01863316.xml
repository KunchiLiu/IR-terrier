	<brief_summary>Although the safety and efficacy of the I gel in children has been shown in several large observational studies, There is no study about comparison of the clinical efficacy between I-gel and LMA-Supreme , in particular sizes 1 and 1Â½. The pediatric i-gel and LMA Supreme are new supraglottic airway device for children. It is made of a soft, gel-like elastomer with a noninflatable cuff. Studies about I-gel and LMA Supreme in adults have been promising, showing an easy insertion, high airway leak pressures, and low complication rates with few postoperative complaints. The aim of this study is to compare clinical performance of the pediatric i-gel and LMA Supreme in infants.</brief_summary>
