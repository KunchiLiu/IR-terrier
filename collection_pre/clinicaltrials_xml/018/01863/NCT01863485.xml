	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study of CM082 (X-82) Tablets in Advanced Cancer Patients in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of CM082 tablets in Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors. After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the optimal biological dose is identified, an expansion cohort of ~20 advanced renal cell carcinoma patients will be enrolled to further characterize the safety and tumor response by CT.</detailed_description>
