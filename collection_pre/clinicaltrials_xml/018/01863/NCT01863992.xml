	<brief_summary>The investigators wish to learn about the quality of life (QOL) of children needing long term home ventilation and also that of their regular caregivers. In addition, the investigators will monitor the extra health-related expenses these families must meet. Data will be collected using two age-specific questionnaires of QOL plus a third one validated for assessing chronic health care costs. Questionnaires will be administered at an initial face to face meeting, supplemented by two telephone follow-up calls, to monitor medical expenses, one and two months later.</brief_summary>
