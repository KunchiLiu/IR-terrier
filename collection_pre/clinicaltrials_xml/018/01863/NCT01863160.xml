	<brief_summary>It is a phase I randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) data of 0.1% and 1.0% ZEP-3 cream, administered topically up to 5 consecutive treatment days in healthy volunteers. This is a single center trial. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at the Department of Dermatology, at the Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel. The screening/enrollment visit includes a PK study for 24h following a single IP topical application. After a 24h washout time break, the subject will enter the treatment period for 5 consecutive treatment days followed by a follow up visit 1 and 5 days after end of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability Study of ZEP-3 Cream (0.1% and 1.0%), Administered Topically In Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoints of this study are: - Safety evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream safety in terms of skin irritation score. - Safety evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream safety in terms of type and severity of reported adverse events. - Tolerability evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream tolerability in terms of treatment compliance by the treated volunteers. The secondary endpoints of this study are: - Systemic absorption PK profile. - Dermal absorption PK profile (Optional). Subject safety will be assessed following treatment by ZEP-3 cream, using measurements of the following variables: - Dermal reaction parameters - Physical examination - Vital Signs (HR, BP, RR, Body temperature) - 12 lead ECG data - Laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistry, coagulation functions, urinalysis) - Adverse events recording - Change in concomitant medications</detailed_description>
