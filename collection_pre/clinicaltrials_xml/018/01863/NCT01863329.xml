	<brief_summary>Studies in patients with intracranial hypertension have shown a good relationship between optic nerve sheath diameter measured by retrobulbar ultrasound and invasively measured intracranial pressure. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in optic nerve sheath diameter before and after drainage of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with hydrocephalus.</brief_summary>
