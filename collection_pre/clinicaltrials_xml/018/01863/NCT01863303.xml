	<brief_summary>The incidence risk of colorectal cancer （CRC） is increasing at 4.2% year by year in China. Most effective way to reduce the death rate of CRC patients is to diagnose in quite an early stage. QiaoKou District is a chemical industry Zone of Wuhan with a long history, which has few data of CRC epidemiology. The investigators design the primary CRC screening for this district by healthy questionnaire, Fecal Occult Blood Test(FOBT) and colonoscopy. HanYang Areo has been chosen as Control for its non-industry environment.The crowd would be screen biennially. The high risk group would be intervened, such as resection of polyps or other specific treatment. A follow-up registration database has been built for analysis the relationship between incidence or death rate to high risk factors, such as age, life environment, lifestyles, base diseases and family history of cancer. This study will provide some epidemiology dates of CRC to the local Government, and assist the governor to built a more effective screening system of CRC.</brief_summary>
