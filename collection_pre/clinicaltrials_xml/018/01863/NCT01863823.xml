	<brief_title>The Effective Treatment of Oral Helicobacter Pylori With the Success Rate of Gastric Eradication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The present study was aimed to explore the relationship of Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) of the oral cavity with the success rate eradication of gastric H. pylori infection. Study Design and Setting: 202 symptomatic and 148 asymptomatic individuals were recruited and tested using Saliva H. pylori antigen tests (HPS), H. pylori flagellin (HPF), the urea breathe test (UBT) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Test subjects also received various treatments. We collected data of HPS, HPF , PCR and UBT before treatment on 202 symptomatic patients and 148 asymptomatic individual groups. After drug treatment, we run HPS, HPF, PCR and UBT tests. If the tests of HPS, HPF and PCR show negative that indicate success of oral H.pylori eradication. If the test of UBT show negative that indicate success of stomach H.pyloi eradication. We also compare the suceess rate of eradication on stomach infection with and without oral H. pylori infection.</detailed_description>
