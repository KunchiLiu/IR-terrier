	<brief_summary>This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of omarigliptin (MK-3102) compared with the sulfonylurea, glimepiride, in type 2 diabetes mellitus participants who are metformin intolerant or who have a contraindication to the use of metformin. The primary hypothesis is that after 54 weeks, the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in participants treated with omarigliptin is non-inferior compared with that in participants treated with glimepiride.</brief_summary>
