	<brief_summary>The imbalance between anti- and pro-inflammation often occurs in patients with sepsis. And continuous such imbalance could lead to immunoparalysis, which is characterized by loss of delayed type hypersensitivity, failure of primary infections eradication, and a predisposition of secondary nosocomial infections development. However, in which phase of sepsis does immunoparalysis occur is still unknown. So this study aims to tentatively understand this problem by checking monocytes/macrophages` antigen presentation and cytokine secretion，and by checking monocytes/macrophages` expression of Tim-3 (the T cell transmembrane, immunoglobulin, and mucin-3), which is an inhibitory regulatory molecule, in sepsis patients` peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</brief_summary>
