	<brief_summary>This study compares Spironolactone, a non-selective aldosterone antagonist, with Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone antagonist, regarding efficacy and hormonal side effects when treating male cirrhotic patients with uncomplicated ascites over a 6 month period. The investigators hypothesis is that Eplerenone is as effective as Spironolactone as treatment of ascites with less side effects such as painful gynecomastia.</brief_summary>
