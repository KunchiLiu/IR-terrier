	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over trial evaluating the safety, efficacy, daily functioning, and health-related quality of life of Subcallosal Cingulate Gyrus Deep Brain Stimulation (SCG DBS) for participants with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). A total of 40 eligible participants will be randomized to four treatment sequences (10 participants per sequence). Each participant will be treated over a 6-month period with active or sham stimulation in which both the participants and the attending psychiatrists will be blinded to treatment allocation.</brief_summary>
