	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess if panitumumab is active enough to warrant comparative studies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after treatment with cetuximab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study of Panitumumab in Patients With Cetuximab-refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was amended with modification of inclusion criteria (from wild-type tumor KRAS gene to wild-type RAS gene, including KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4) RAS mutational status of tumors of patients enrolled before amendment 1 approval will be centrally revised. Patients whose tumors will result RAS mutated at the biomarkers central revision, will be replaced. Therefore, the overall sample size at both the stages may be higher than the one initially planned.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologic diagnosis of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma a wildtype RAS tumor (mutational status has to be determined by an experienced laboratory using validated test methods for detection of KRAS exons 2, 3, and 4, and NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4 Failure from previous treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Patients may or may not have been treated with bevacizumab. Documented disease progression following a treatment with cetuximab in patients who showed either an objective response after 8 weeks or stable disease after 16 weeks of cetuximab treatment.
