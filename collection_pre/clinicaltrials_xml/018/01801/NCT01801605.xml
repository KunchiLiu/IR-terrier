	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IBS patients frequently demonstrate a rectal hypersensitivity which could participate to the abdominal pain. rTMS is an effective treatment of neurogenic chronic pain. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS on rectal hypersensitivity in patients with IBS in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Patients and method: 20 patients with rectal hypersensitivity secondary to IBS will have one active session of rTMS located on the cortical area of the abdominal muscles during 5 consecutive days and one session of simulated rTMS during 5 over consecutive days corresponding to the placebo session. The order of the two session will be randomized. The efficacy of rTMS will be assessed by a rectal barostat to determine the pain or discomfort threshold and by a RIII reflex. The barostat and RIII reflex will be performed at the beginning and at the end of each session. The investigators hope to demonstrate an improvement of the rectal hypersensitivity during the active stimulations compared to the placebo one.</detailed_description>
