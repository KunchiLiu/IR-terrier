	<brief_summary>To assess the feasibility of a new brain tissue probe for multi-parameter neuromonitoring (NeMo Probe) and the accuracy of measurement values. To demonstrate the ability of the NeMo probe to detect changes in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation during cerebrovascular events monitored with established methods including brain tissue oxygenation tension and microdialysis</brief_summary>
