	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the effect of fatigue on clinical performance in a simulated obstetric emergency. This scenario was chosen because it is a common clinical situation faced by anesthesia providers on call and therefore likely to occur when a provider is fatigued. Secondary outcomes will include the evaluation of other factors that worsen fatigue related decrement in performance including age, years of training/practice and clinical load prior to study participation.</brief_summary>
