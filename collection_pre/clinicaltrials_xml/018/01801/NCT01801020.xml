	<brief_summary>Introduction: Temperature measurement is a crucial and integral element in the assessment of the emergency department patients. The basis of triage and treatment is often directly influenced by temperature measurement. The finding of hyper/hypothermia may differentiate between a simple urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis, or in more extreme cases may discern "weakness" in the elderly from sepsis. This brief encounter of temperature measurement may be paramount to the medical treatment of the emergency department patient. The investigators will explore the different modes of temperature measurements in emergency department patients.</brief_summary>

The finding of hyper/hypothermia may differentiate between a simple urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis, or in more extreme cases may discern "weakness" in the elderly from sepsis. This brief encounter of temperature measurement may be paramount to the medical treatment of the emergency department patient.We will explore the different modes of temperature measurements in emergency department patients. We will check which temperature measurement is beneficial.</detailed_description>
