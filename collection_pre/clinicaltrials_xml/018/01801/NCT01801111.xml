	<brief_summary>This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter phase I/II study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of RO5424802 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have ALK mutation and failed crizotinib treatment. In Part 1, cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of RO5424802 orally twice daily. In Part 2, patients will receive the recommended phase II dose of RO5424802 as determined in Part 1. Treatment will continue in Part 1 and Part 2 on the same dose until disease progression. In Part 3, following disease progression, patients without EGFR mutation will be offered continued treatment with RO5424802, patients with EGFR mutations will be offered a combination of RO5424802 and Tarceva (erlotinib).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patients, &gt;/= 18 years of age Locally advanced or metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (stage IIIB or IV by AJCC 7th) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 Documented ALK rearrangement based on FDA approved test Prior treatment with crizotinib and progression according to RECIST v1.1 criteria with the last dose of crizotinib within 60 days from enrolment; patients can either be chemotherapyna√Øve or have received at least one line of platinumbased chemotherapy Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function Patients with brain or leptomeningeal metastases are allowed on study if the lesions are asymptomatic without neurological signs and clinically stable for at least 2 weeks Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 prior to administration of study drug Receipt of any other ALK inhibitors in addition to crizotinib Receipt of any prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for ALKpositive NSCLC within 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Patients who received crizotinib or any other tyrosine kinase inhibitors need to have a minimum 2week washout period before the first dose Active uncontrolled infectious diseases requiring treatment NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 3 or higher toxicities due to prior therapy that have not shown improvement and are considered to interfere with current study medication History of organ transplant Coadministration of anticancer therapies other than those administered in this study Baseline QTc &gt; 470 ms or baseline symptomatic bradycardia &lt; 45 beats per minute Pregnant or breastfeeding women Known HIV positivity or AIDSrelated illness History of significant drugrelated allergy (such as anaphylaxis) Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with, or for which treatment might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or absorption of oral medications, or that would, in the opinion of the principal investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in the study</criteria>
