	<brief_summary>The field of neuroeconomics has begun to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying self-control; however, researchers have not yet harnessed neuroeconomics findings to develop interventions for improving self-control ability. The investigators are currently developing such an intervention. The investigators' approach involves using a brain-computer interface with audiovisual feedback to show people what is happening in their own brains, in real time. Through this interface, individuals are trained to increase levels of neural activity that may facilitate self-control, which, in turn, may improve the ability to exhibit self-controlled behaviors. This may increase the ability to engage in heath behaviors for which self-control is required (eg, dieting and exercising). The investigators' long-term goal is to create a tool that will help people develop the self-control needed to achieve lasting improvements in health behaviors.</brief_summary>
