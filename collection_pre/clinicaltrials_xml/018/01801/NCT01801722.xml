	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study was to evaluate if the analysis of NT-proBNP might be used as an initial step for the diagnosis of chronic heart failure in patients with COPD in primary health care, and to select patients for a further examination by echocardiography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using NT-proBNP to Detect Chronic Heart Failure in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD were examined regarding chronic heart failure. 1. An interview regarding symptoms: breathlessness, orthopnoea, night cough, nocturia, walking distance. 2. Physical examination: weight and height, heart and lung auscultation, blood pressure measurement after 5 minutes' rest in the sitting position and the presence of peripheral oedema. 3. Electrocardiography. 4. Natriuretic peptide- NT-proBNP (Immulite 2500, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics AB Sweden). 5. Patients with the NT-proBNP level of &gt; 1200 pg/ml were referred for echocardiography to assess left ventricular function.</detailed_description>
