	<brief_summary>The development of a high grade AV-block is a frequent complication associated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Patients who were suitable for TAVI will be enrolled in this study. The HV-interval will be determined before and immediately after implantation. The hypothesis is that a prolonged HV-interval is associated with a high rate of complete AV-block following TAVI.</brief_summary>
