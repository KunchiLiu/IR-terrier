	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing a brain tumour neurosurgery with craniotomy may present rare but lifethreatening post-operative complications. There are currently no strong recommendations to help the clinician in an attempt to properly hospitalise these patients after their intervention (Neuro-ICU, ICU,surgical ward). Determining risk factors of post-operative complications could optimise resources. Therefore hospitalisation in Neuro-ICU would be mandatory in only a little number of patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Retrospective analysis of a prospective database to create a Risk Score. Post-operative neurosurgery complications recording (Hyponatremia &lt; 135mmol/l,Insulin administration, Nausea-Vomiting, Glasgow Coma Score, Inhalation, Post-operative intra-cranial bleeding requiring neurosurgery, Intra-cranial hypertension, Use of osmotherapy, Status epilepticus, Brain death, Death). Collection of datas as Duration of mechanical ventilation, Length of ICU stay, Length of hospital stay. Validation of this score on an independent prospective cohort.</detailed_description>
