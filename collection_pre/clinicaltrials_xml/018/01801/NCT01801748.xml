	<detailed_description>All children in this study were sensitized to wheat. Each patient was clinically evaluated, with focus on wheat allergy by both a detailed medical examination and collection of medical history. Blood sample was taken for baseline determination of ImmunoglobulinE antibodies to wheat and to omega-5-gliadin. The oral wheat challenge were performed in all study subjects to identify a case of wheat outgrowing. The primary outcome was the development of oral tolerance to wheat. Oral wheat challenge were generally performed at least every 1 years if the child did not have an interval history of symptoms with unintentional exposure.</detailed_description>
