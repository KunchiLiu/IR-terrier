	<brief_summary>This pilot trial will be the first step toward direct comparison of delivery of endovascular reperfusion therapy to intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in a time-to-treatment framework shown as most effective by the NINDS rt-PA Stroke Trial. A randomized trial is justified for the following reasons: 1) The high rate of death and disability associated with ischemic stroke despite treatment with intravenous rt-PA mandates critical analysis of alternate therapies with therapeutic potential, 2) endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke is expanding in North America without compelling evidence of safety and efficacy from well-designed clinical trials, 3) critical cost-effectiveness analysis cannot be done without acquiring pertinent outcomes data from controlled studies.</brief_summary>
