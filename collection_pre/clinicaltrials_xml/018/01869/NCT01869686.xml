Alcohol is prohibited 24 hours prior to screening and administration of investigational product. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 drinks per day for the duration of the study; where a standard drink is equivalent to 12 ounces of regular beer, 89 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits; Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study, or less than 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) since ending treatment on another investigational device or drug study(s). Other investigational procedures while participating in this study are excluded; Use of any nonAmgen approved overthecounter or prescription medications, within the 14 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer), prior to receiving the dose of denosumab. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g per day) for analgesia and hormone replacement therapy (eg, androgen, thyroid) will be allowed. Other medications may be approved following review by the Principal Investigator and the Amgen Medical Monitor. Written documentation of this review and Amgen acknowledgement is required for subject participation; Subject likely to not be available to complete all protocolrequired study visits or procedures, and/or to comply with all required study procedures to the best of the subject and Investigator's knowledge; Subject has any kind of disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to comply with all required study procedures; History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion</criteria>
