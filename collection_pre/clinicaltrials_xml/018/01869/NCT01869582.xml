	<brief_summary>Safer Births is a research and development collaboration to establish new knowledge and new innovative products to better equip and increase competence of health workers for safer births and increased newborn survival worldwide. The main objectives are: To randomize different devices for fetal heart rate assessments. To assess if a novel Newborn Resuscitation Monitor will facilitate newborn resuscitation in a low-resource setting. To determine bag mask ventilation treatment and devices beneficial for neonatal outcome.</brief_summary>
