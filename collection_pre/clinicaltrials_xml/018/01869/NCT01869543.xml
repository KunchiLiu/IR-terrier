	<brief_summary>Two hundred moderate to severely asthmatic children (6-12 years) will be enrolled in a study to look at the effectiveness of high efficiency filtration of indoor air in homes on reducing asthma symptoms. One intervention group will have high efficiency filters or filtration systems installed in their central heating and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The second intervention group will have high efficiency portable air cleaners placed in the child's bedroom and in the main living area. Each participant will receive true air filtration for a year and a placebo for a year. During the placebo period a sham filter will be used that removes very little of the particles. Measures of health effects will include days of symptoms, unplanned utilization of the healthcare system for asthma-related illness, short-term medication use, peak exhaled flow, spirometry, and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO).</brief_summary>
