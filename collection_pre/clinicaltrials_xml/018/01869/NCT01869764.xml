	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial studies how well omega-3 fatty acid works in treating patients with stage I-III breast cancer. Studying samples of tissue and blood in the laboratory from breast cancer patients receiving omega-3 fatty acid may help doctors learn more about the effects of omega-3 fatty acid on tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acid in Treating Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if omega-3 dietary supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) results in higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) levels in surgical specimens of normal and malignant breast tissue in women who took omega 3 tablets in comparison to those who took placebo. II. To determine if omega-3 dietary supplementation results in higher PUFA levels in plasma and red blood cells in women who took omega 3 tablets in comparison to those who took placebo. III. To determine if omega-3 dietary supplementation affects the metabolites of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA in surgical specimens of malignant and normal breast tissue in comparison to controls. IV. To determine if women who take omega-3 dietary supplementation have less proliferation and greater apoptosis in malignant breast tissue in comparison to women who take placebo. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid orally (PO) daily for 7-14 days. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO daily for 7-14 days.</detailed_description>
