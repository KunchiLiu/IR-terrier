	<brief_summary>The investigators will recruit 450 older adults and will utilize 12 Administration on Aging (AoA)-supported senior centers to implement a multisite, cluster randomized (by center), wait-list clinical trial. Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program immediately (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control group). The community choirs will be led by professional music directors. The investigators will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months, with the main intervention group comparison being at 6 months. The investigators will also evaluate the start-up and ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and determine quality adjusted life years. The hypotheses are: 1. Compared to delayed intervention controls, participation in a community choir program will be associated with improvements/maintenance on the primary outcomes of physical function (balance, walking speed, strength), depressive symptoms, and cognition (executive function and memory) at 6 months. The investigators also predict within-group improvements on these primary outcomes at 12 months. 2. Compared to delayed intervention controls, participation in a community choir program will be associated with improvements in the secondary outcomes of well-being (depressive symptoms, loneliness, resilience, social participation, health-related quality of life, shortness of breath, functional status, falls, and health services use) at 6 months. The investigators also predict within-group improvements on these secondary outcomes at 12 months.</brief_summary>
