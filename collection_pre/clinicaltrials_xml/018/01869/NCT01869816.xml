	<brief_summary>Visceral obesity is the one of the major causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Adipose tissue secretes various kinds of bioactive molecules termed adipokines which contribute to the development of obesity-related disorders including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Progranulin and CTRP3 are recently discovered novel adipokines. Therefore, the investigators tried to compare circulating CTRP-3 and progranulin levels in patients with CAD and investigated whether CTRP-3 or progranulin is significantly associated with CAD prevalence after adjustment for well-known CAD risk factors.</brief_summary>
