	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY2405319. It was given as a daily injection under the skin to participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for 28 days. This study determined how long the drug stays in the body and how it affects blood sugar levels. After screening, the study lasted about 2 months for each participant. Participants continued their prestudy regimen of diet and exercise alone or in combination with metformin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Have a diagnosis of T2DM. Are on diet and exercise or diet, exercise, and metformin (stable dose of at least 1000 mg/day for at least 60 days) regimen. Have a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value of 7.0% to 10.0%, inclusive, or are on metformin and an additional oral antidiabetic medication (OAM) with an HbA1c value of 6.5% to 9.5%, inclusive. Participants on another OAM in addition to metformin therapy may be randomized if removed from treatment of the other OAM ≥14 days prior to study drug administration and fasting blood glucose is ≥145 mg per deciliter (mg/dL) and ≤270 mg/dL. Are females not of childbearing potential due to surgical sterilization or are postmenopausal. Have a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 and ≤40. Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the population. Use insulin, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV inhibitors, or exenatide during the 3 months prior to screening. Have had more than 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance of another person to administer a resuscitative action within 6 months prior to entry into the study or are currently diagnosed with having hypoglycemia unawareness. Have had 2 or more emergency room visits or hospitalizations due to poor glucose control in the past 6 months. Have any abnormality of the electrocardiogram (ECG) that will, in the opinion of the investigator, impair the ability to measure the QT (a corrected QC [QTc] [Bazett's correction] interval &gt;450 milliseconds [msec] for men and &gt;470 msec for women or a PR interval &gt;220 msec are specifically excluded) or have conduction abnormalities that may confound the QTc analysis. Have a personal or family history of long QT syndrome, family history of sudden death, personal history of unexplained syncope within the last year; or use prescription or overthecounter medications known to prolong the QT or QTc interval. Have diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥95 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and/or systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥160 mm Hg. Have an active or untreated malignancy or have been in remission from a clinically significant malignancy for &lt;5 years. Have a history of a transplanted organ. Evidence of a significant active, uncontrolled endocrine or autoimmune abnormality, as judged by the investigator, at screening. Have a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Have a known allergy to yeast or yeast proteins, history of anaphylaxis with bronchospasm, or atopic dermatitis with chronic urticaria. Have any other condition (including known drug or alcohol abuse or psychiatric disorder within the last 6 months) that may preclude the participant from following and completing the protocol. Have a significant history of or current cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine (including pancreatitis), hematological, or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs; of constituting a risk when taking the study medication; or of interfering with the interpretation of data. Are women who are breastfeeding. Have had a significant change in weight, defined as a gain or loss of at least 4 kilograms (kg) (9 pounds) in the 90 days prior to randomization. Have taken in the 30 days prior to randomization, a medication, herbal product, or nutritional supplement that affects adipose mass or distribution or energy balance. Are receiving chronic (&gt;2 weeks) systemic glucocorticoid therapy (excluding topical or inhaled preparations) or have received such therapy within 4 weeks immediately prior to second screening appointment. Have current or recent (within the past 3 months) use of gemfibrozil or fenofibrate, niacin, ezetimibe, or bile acid binding resins (for example, cholestyramines). Stable statin therapy of ≥3 months will be allowed. Are currently taking central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.</criteria>
