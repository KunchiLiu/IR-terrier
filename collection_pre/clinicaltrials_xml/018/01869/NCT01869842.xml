	<brief_summary>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) after the stent procedure to improve the adhesion and expansion, or incomplete uncovered struts attached to the main track. OCT in clinical areas by improving the parameters of the best stent will be useful. However, for better results for optical coherence tomography in percutaneous interventions have little useful data on the role. Randomized controlled study of the traditional percutaneous coronary intervention and intervention using optical coherence tomography.</brief_summary>
