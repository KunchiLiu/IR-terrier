	<brief_summary>The main objective of the SONR-ECHO trial is to demonstrate that optimization of CRT parameters by SonR technology is able to increase the rate of CRT-D responders, based on significant LV reverse remodeling, as compared to Standard of Care settings. This study will also evaluate the effectiveness of CRT-D SonR system as compared to Standard of care (SoC) programming methods in providing appropriate LV filling, as expected from the Ritter method.</brief_summary>
