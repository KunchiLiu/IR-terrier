	<brief_summary>Rationale: Pregabalin is effective on radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic pain. Purpose: This randomized double-blind trial aims to investigate whether pregabalin is effective in treating radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Pregabalin in Patients With Radiation-Induced Peripheral Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head and neck radiotherapy is associated with peripheral neuropathies, especially with brachial plexus neuropathy, which included painful sensation that are described as burning, aching, spasm, or tingling. Though there is some recommendation about neuropathic pain, there is no definite drug which is recommended for radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic pain. Pregabalin, a Central nervous system(CNS)-active compound, is an analog of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It has been proved an effective treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia in previous clinical trials. This study plans to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin versus placebo for relieving radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic pain, and assessed its safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have received radiation therapy for histologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 2. Clinical evidence support the diagnosis of radiationinduced peripheral neuropathic pain(confirmed by the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument) and had a daily pain score of 4 or higher based on a numerical rating scale (010 points). 3. The mean duration of pain is more than 4 weeks. 4. No prior carbamazepine and pregabalin therapy. 5. Fertile women who are willing to take contraception during the trial. 6. Routine laboratory studies with bilirubin &lt;/=2 * upper limits of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) &lt; 2 * ULN, creatinine &lt;1.5 * ULN, redcell count &gt;/= 4,000 per cubic millimeter; whitecell count &gt;/=1500 per cubic millimeter, platelets &gt;/= 75,000 per cubic millimeter; Hb &gt;/=9.0. 7. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 1. Current diagnosis of tumor recurrence or metastasis and evidence of tumor associated pain. 2. Evidence of secondary neuropathic pain other than radiation. 3. Treatment with antidepressants, antiepileptics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs(NSAID) or opioids for a minimum of one month before study enrollment. 4. Treatment with carbamazepin or pregabalin within 30 days. 5. History of anaphylactic response to carbamazepine or pregabalin. 6. Evidence of sever systematic diseases.</criteria>
