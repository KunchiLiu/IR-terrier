	<brief_summary>Radiography of breast specimens is currently the only radiological procedure used to verify removal of microcalcifications and presence of tumor-free margins after breast surgical resection. Ex vivo MRI will be tested for its ability to detect residual tumor tissue not detected by radiography in resected breast tumor specimens and/or its ability to verify tumor-free margins in breast cancer detected by MRI only.</brief_summary>
