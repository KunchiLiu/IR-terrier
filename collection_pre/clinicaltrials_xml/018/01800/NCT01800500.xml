	<brief_title>Interest in Smokeless Tobacco Product as a Substitution for Cigarettes in Current Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Systematically vary price, availability, product type, and information about products to examine their individual and joint effects on degree of substitution of smokeless products for cigarettes. II. Examine the impact of smokeless tobacco (ST) substitution on biomarkers of exposure (carbon monoxide [CO], cotinine). III. Explore relationships between ST substitution and measures of mood and health related quality of life. OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Participants purchase ST products using a fixed rate of product prices once weekly and record their consumption of ST products and cigarettes smoked daily for 3 weeks. ARM II: Participants purchase ST products using escalating product prices once weekly and record their consumption of ST products and cigarettes smoked daily for 3 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.</detailed_description>
