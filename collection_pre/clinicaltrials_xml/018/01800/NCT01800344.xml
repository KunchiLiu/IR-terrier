	<brief_summary>The study compares the incidence of pharyngolaryngeal complications in patients managed with either a pressure-limiting strategy using the AES Ultra CPVTM or a standard practice using a LMA, in ambulatory surgery patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of a New Supraglottic Airway With Built-in Cuff Pressure Indicator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent evidence suggests that reduction of LMA intracuff pressure may decrease the incidence of pharyngolaryngeal symptoms. Yet, pressure manometers are not widely available limiting the application of a strategy of intracuff pressure reduction. The Ultra airway has been designed to provide continuous indication of intracuff pressure and can limit the intracuff pressure to &lt; 60 cm H2O. This study compares the incidence of pharyngolaryngeal complications in patients managed with either a pressure-limiting strategy using the Ultra or a standard practice using a LMA, in ambulatory surgery patients.</detailed_description>
