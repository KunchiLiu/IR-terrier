	<brief_summary>This proposed research is a single center, prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial, designed to evaluate IVF pregnancy outcomes following endometrial injury in 254 patients with implantation failure. Patients will be identified during their work-up and treatment at Shady Grove Fertility Reproductive Science Center. Only Shady Grove patients are eligible for the study. The investigators hypothesize in patients with one or more previous failed day 5 blastocyst transfers, injury to the endometrium via endometrial biopsy will improve clinical pregnancy outcomes compared to controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endometrial Biopsy Prior to IVF in Those Patients With Prior Implantation Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advances in assisted reproductive technologies; implantation failure in patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) is frequent. Unfortunately, few treatments exist except for the use of a gestational carrier. There have been a number of recent clinical studies demonstrating that local injury to the endometrium results in improved clinical pregnancy outcomes for patients with a history of implantation failure. However, not all studies have shown a beneficial effect, and those demonstrating benefit have been limited by small sample sizes, and considerable heterogeneity in the procedures and populations evaluated. A recent meta-analysis synthesized the available data concluded that a large, prospective, well-designed randomized trial is desperately needed to definitively assess this new possible treatment. If these preliminary findings from previous trials are confirmed, this practice could be applied in the clinical setting to help patients suffering from repeated implantation failures.</detailed_description>
