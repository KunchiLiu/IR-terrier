	<brief_summary>This study is an investigator initiated placebo controlled double blinded trial. The hypothesis is that treatment with modafinil positively will affect behavioural and cognitive rehabilitation after stroke, causing the treatment group to experience decreased fatigue, increased endurance, improved skills of sustaining attention and faster reaction times. The cognitive rehabilitation will show in increased muscle mass, decreased osteoporosis and better physical performances due to a higher level of physical activity.</brief_summary>
