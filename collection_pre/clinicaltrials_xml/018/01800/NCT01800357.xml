	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Mildronate for Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II multicenter trial is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mildronate injection in patients with acute ischemic stroke. patients will be randomized to receive a 14-day treatment of placebo or mildronate (500mg/5ml/each).Primary end-point is the modified Rankin scale at 3 monthes. Secondary end-point is the NIHSS scores and the Barthel index at 8 days and 15days. The safety end-point is defined as the incidence of adverse events, the change of Samples for routine laboratory tests and vital signs. Analysis is by intention to treat.</detailed_description>
