	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to investigate the outcomes of congenital cataract surgery when injecting intraoperative intracameral triamcinolone versus the postoperative use of oral prednisolone. This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial. Sixty children will be submitted to congenital cataract surgery younger than 2 years of age. They will be randomly divided in two groups. The study group will receive an intraoperative intracameral triamcinolone acetonide injection. The control group will receive prednisolone syrup postoperatively. The surgical outcomes will be assessed after one year.</brief_summary>
