	<brief_summary>The object of this randomized, parallel, positive controlled study is to explore the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile of the test drug after single-dose subcutaneous administration, compared to the comparator drug (EPIAO®) after multiple-dose subcutaneous administration, by assessing plasma concentration of the drug and the reticulocyte count, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit following subcutaneous administration, evaluate the security and tolerability of the test drug in healthy subjects, and provide sufficient information for dose selection in the future phase II and III study.</brief_summary>
