	<brief_summary>Aging in men reduces the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (Te) secreted in each burst. Stress-associated mechanisms introduced by acute illness and chronic disease decrease LH and Te secretion further. A major unresolved issue is whether the aging process heightens the negative effects of a stressor (whether physical or metabolic) upon LH and Te secretion. This study will assess LH and Te secretion in response to a physical stressor (maximal exercise) and a common metabolic stressor (hyperglycemia) as a function of age in healthy men ages 18-80 yr.</brief_summary>
