	<detailed_description>Employers are increasingly looking for opportunities to encourage weight loss among employees. While studies have shown that financial incentives can effectively encourage weight loss, little is known about their use in health benefits design. The goal of this study is to determine whether a financial incentive program delivered to obese University of Pennsylvania Health System employees can effectively encourage weight loss when compared to changes in health benefit design. This is a randomized controlled trial involving financial incentives with four study arms: control, delayed gratification, immediate gratification, and financial incentive with frequent feedback. Participation in this study will last about 12 months. The primary goal of the study is to test the effects of a novel financial incentive program using a lottery with frequent feedback to normal benefit design structures.</detailed_description>
