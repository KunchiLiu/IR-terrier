	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether noninvasive electrical stimulation at acupuncture points (NESAP) and/or 24% sucrose is effective in reducing pain in infants during invasive procedures. The investigators hypothesize that: - Gentle noninvasive electrical stimulation at selected acupuncture points and/or oral use of 24% sucrose with pacifier will reduce the newborn infant's responses to heelstick pain, as measured by the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), heart rate variability, duration of crying, and salivary cortisol levels. - The effects of combined therapies will be additive. - The analgesic effects of NESAP and/or sucrose will continue for the duration of the heelstick, reflected by the first two minutes of heelstick and the first two minutes of recovery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A collaborative prospective, double-blind, randomized trial will be performed at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Hospital (Little Rock, AR), and Lucille Packard Children's Hospital (Palo Alto, CA). After obtaining IRB approval at both sites and parental consent, newborn infants less than 3 days of age who require heelsticks for clinical blood sampling will be randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial trial design to four groups: standard pain management with pacifier and water, Non−invasive Electrical Stimulation of Acupuncture Points (NESAP) with pacifier and water, 24% oral sucrose solution with pacifier, or NESAP plus oral sucrose solution and pacifier prior to their heelstick. We will study the pain response to the heelstick routinely used to obtain blood for term neonatal infants by enrolling up to 192 infants, 96 from University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and 96 from Lucille Packard Children's Hospital. This number will allow for screen failures and withdrawals. A minimum of 164 infants collectively from both sites is required to complete the study. Infants will be divided into 4 experimental groups: 1. Group A: Sham (fake electrical stimulation) plus sugar water with pacifier before heelstick. 2. Group B: Electrical stimulation plus water with pacifier before heelstick. 3. Group C: Electrical stimulation plus sugar water with pacifier before heelstick. 4. Group D: Sham (fake electrical stimulation) plus water with pacifier before heelstick. Electrical stimulation will be applied at appropriate acupuncture points using a very low current for 10 minutes, routine for procedural pain. The response to pain will be assessed using a pain scale, heart rate, heart rate variability and oxygen saturation changes, duration of crying, and changes in salivary cortisol levels.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Newborn infants born at 3742 weeks gestational age Less than 3 days of age Requiring a heelstick for clinically indicated blood sampling Written, informed consent from their parents. Newborns who have received any analgesic treatment Exposed to chronic opiates in utero (excluding opiates given only at the time of delivery) or with a positive drug screen based on review of medical records. Current maternal cigarette smoking. Infants exposed to birth asphyxia (5minute Apgar scores of &lt;5 or cord pH &lt;7.0). Infants on mechanical ventilation. Newborns with suspected or confirmed neuromuscular diseases, congenital anomalies, or sepsis. Infants with birth trauma to the lower extremities (bruising or other) or those exposed multiple heelsticks in the previous 24 hours (e.g. requiring frequent glucose or bilirubin measurements). Infants born from mothers with drug addiction, diabetes, preeclampsia, or systemic inflammatory conditions. Abnormal neurological exam Congenital heart defects Enrollment or participation in other studies Dermatologic condition in the area of electrode placement or elsewhere Local or systemic infection documented or suspected Reasonable known allergy to the gel/adhesive Bleeding abnormality Connection to other medical equipment or devices that might interfere with the workings or functioning of the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit Any condition the investigator determines will put the subject at risk if participating in the study.</criteria>
