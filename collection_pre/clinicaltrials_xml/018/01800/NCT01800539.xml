	<brief_summary>Based on the need to characterize and improve early intervention services for minority and under-resourced children with ASD, this study translates a manualized and proven training model to examine its impact on the use of evidence-based practices (EBP) by early intervention providers, and to examine its relationship to child and family outcomes. By highlighting the impact of EBP-focused training on participating providers, children, and families, findings of the proposed study have the potential to effect significant change in the organization and delivery of early intervention services for minority and under-resourced children with ASD.</brief_summary>
