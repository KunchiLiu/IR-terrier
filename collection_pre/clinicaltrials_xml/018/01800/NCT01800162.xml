	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial to compare three currently available management strategies for women with a persisting pregnancy of unknown location (PPUL), which makes them at-risk for ectopic pregnancy. We will recruit hemodynamically stable women with a confirmed PPUL to be randomized to one of three strategies: 1) Uterine evacuation followed by methotrexate (MTX) for some (those that have evidence of a non visualized ectopic pregnancy) 2) Empiric treatment with MTX for all 3) Expectant management. Randomization will be 2:2:1 into these three arms. After randomization, they will be followed and treated clinically as is indicated by the progression of their condition. Primary outcome measures: uneventful decline of hCG to 5 IU/mL. Secondary outcome measures: re-interventions, treatment complications, health-related quality of life, financial costs, future fertility, and patient's preferences.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Female with a persisting pregnancy of unknown location: 1. A pregnancy of unknown location is defined as a women with a positive pregnancy test with no signs of pregnancy in the uterus or adnexa on ultrasound imaging 2. Persistence of hCG is defined as at least 3 serial hCG values (over 414 days), with the last 3 values with less than 30% rise, or less than 30% fall. (This abnormal pattern of serial hCG confirms that the gestation is nonviable.) 2. Patient is hemodynamically stable, hemoglobin greater than 10 mg/dL, 3. Greater than or 18 years of age 1. Hemodynamically unstable in need of acute treatment 2. hCG greater than 5000 IU/mL 3. Patient obtaining care in relation to a recently completed pregnancy (delivery, spontaneous or elective abortion), 4. Diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease, 5. Subject unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures, 6. Presence of clinical contraindications for treatment with methotrexate (ACOG guidelines, Appendix 2), 7. Prior medical or surgical management of this gestation.</criteria>
