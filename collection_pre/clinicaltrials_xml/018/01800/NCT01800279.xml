	<brief_title>Physiotherapy and Deontology in the Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction in Patients With Fibromyalgia Syndrome.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: randomized clinical trial. Objective: to compare the therapeutic effects of physiotherapy and deontology protocol to improve pain, quality of life, physical function, quality of sleep, depression, anxiety, clinical severity, clinical improvement, and diagnostic criteria for research temporomandibular joint dysfunction in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Background: the results on physiotherapy benefits for temporomandibular joint dysfunction in patients with FMS are controversial. Descriptive data and intervention studies are still scarce. Methods and measures: sixty patients will be randomly assigned to experimental or control group. The experimental group will receive 24 sessions (twice a week) of kinesitherapy and myofascial release protocol, whereas the control group will undergo to deontology therapy (porting a deprogramming occlusal splint every night, an average of 8 hours per day, for 12 weeks of the treatment). Pain levels, impact of FMS symptoms, quality of sleep, depression, anxiety, clinical severity, clinical improvement and diagnostic criteria for research of temporomandibular joint dysfunction will be collected in both groups at baseline and 12 weeks after 48-hr the last intervention in the experimental and control groups, by an assessor blinded to the treatment allocation of the patients. Baseline demographic and clinical variables will be examined between both groups independent Student t-test for continuous data and Ï‡2 tests of independence for categorical data. Separate 2x2 mixed model ANCOVAs with time (pre-post) as the within-subjects factor, group (experimental, control) will be to determine the effects of the treatment on pain, function, quality of sleep,depression, anxiety, clinical severity, clinical improvement and diagnostic criteria for research of temporomandibular joint dysfunction as the dependent variables.</detailed_description>
