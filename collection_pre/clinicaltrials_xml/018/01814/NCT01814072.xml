	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the proposed research is to use an innovative methodological framework, the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), to design, for the first time, an optimized, scalable version of a technology-supported intensive lifestyle intervention (INLI) for obesity. MOST involves highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the effects of individual treatment components, and thereby identify which components and component levels make important contributions to the overall program effect on weight loss. This information then guides assembly of an optimized treatment package that achieves target outcomes with least resource consumption and participant burden. Because the intervention strategies being tested minimize in-person coaching and leverage technology that participants already own, the new optimized intervention, to be called Opt-IN, will be more scalable than traditional INLIs. Opt-IN will thus enjoy greatly increased reach, and enable significant progress in the fight against obesity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opt-IN: Optimization of Remotely Delivered Intensive Lifestyle Treatment for Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the proposed study is to determine the optimal composition of a technology supported intervention for obesity that minimizes expense and burden to participants, while achieving 6 month weight loss outcomes comparable or superior to those achieved by the current full cost, full burden form of INLIs. All intervention components to be examined were selected based on the Opt-IN model's prediction that they enhance behavioral adherence to weight regulation via the designated pathways. The five components to be tested will be: (1) coaching intensity (12 vs. 24 phone sessions), (2) text messaging (No vs. Yes), (3) progress report to participant's primary care provider (No vs. Yes), (4) recommendation to use meal replacements (No vs. Yes), (5) training participants' self-selected buddies to be supportive (No vs. Yes).</detailed_description>
