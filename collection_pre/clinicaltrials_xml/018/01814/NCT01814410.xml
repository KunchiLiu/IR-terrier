	<brief_summary>There are mixed reports on nicotine's effects on ethanol-induced impairment in cognitive performance and behavior in humans. The main objective of this study is to characterize the interactive effects of acute intravenous (IV) ethanol and nicotine administration on cognition and behavior in healthy smokers. The general hypothesis is that nicotine will attenuate the negative effects of ethanol on cognition and subjective stimulant/sedative effects of ethanol.</brief_summary>
