	<brief_summary>The goal of this pilot study to evaluate the effect of the MedSentry system, a multi-faceted medication adherence device and reminder system, on medication adherence and clinical outcomes in heart-failure (HF) patients. We will also evaluate the usability and satisfaction derived from using this system. We hypothesize that: 1. The use of the MedSentry system will improve medication adherence in patients with a discharge diagnosis of HF. 2. The improvement in adherence correlates with fewer hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. 3. The improvement in adherence correlates with better health-related quality of life.</brief_summary>
