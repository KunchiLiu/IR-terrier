	<brief_summary>Women with a history of 'diabetes in pregnancy' or Gestational Diabetes (GDM) have a high risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. This can often be prevented, however, with improvements in eating habits and higher physical activity levels. However, many women find it difficult to alter their lifestyle habits, especially if they have young children. In adults with type 2 diabetes, the investigators have been studying the effects of combining nutrition education with meal preparation training and pedometer-based self-monitoring to improve eating habits and increase activity levels. The investigators have shown that such a strategy can reduce hemoglobin A1C by 0.3% and correlates with small reductions in weight (Dasgupta et al, International Journal of Behavioural Nutrition and Physical Activity, 2012). In developing the present interventional study, we presented this strategy to women with a GDM history and asked them how they would modify it to suit their needs. They expressed strong interest in such an approach but emphasized a need to involve their spouses and provide childcare support. They did not express interest in use of meal replacements. Therefore, in MoMM-intervention phase, the investigators will examine the effects of a once per month (4 session) program combined with Internet/telephone-based support. The four sessions with include meal preparation training, strategies to limit mindless eating and improve meal content and portion control. All sessions will offer child care. Two sessions will involve spouses. The investigators will assess effects on weight, BMI, DXA measures of fat, and measures of insulin resistance and blood pressure. This single-arm intervention study may lead ultimately to a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motivational Support and Meal Preparation Training to Reduce Vascular Risk After Gestational Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have adopted a single-arm intervention pilot study to assess the potential effects of a nutrition/physical activity behavioural intervention in women with a history of GDM within the past 5 years. The investigators have designed the intervention to include in-person sessions- but at a feasible frequency for busy mothers- as well as telephone calls and an on-line discussion forum, to provide an ongoing source of support, information, and accountability. Further, participants' partners will be invited to some of the in-person sessions and childcare will be provided on-site. Importantly, there are no meal replacements included, despite the study title, because focus group discussions indicated that this was not of interest to the target population. The investigators will hold in-person sessions at a frequency of once per month over a 4-month period. In addition to the in-person, on-site sessions, we will arrange for participants to have in a grocery store 'tour' led by a student from the McGill School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition BSc program. This will allow a review of label reading and interpretation as well as tips on produce selection. Details of the intervention are provided under the trial arm section below.</detailed_description>
