	<brief_summary>Background: Medication reviews performed on admission to hospitals reduce medication errors; however, evidence of effect on morbidity and mortality is currently inconsistent. It is known that patients' risks of experiencing medication errors are dependent on both patient- and drug factors, e.g. age, co-morbidity, number of drugs, risk of side effects. Aim and hypothesis: The aim of this pilot study is to study acute medical patients' risk of getting a medication error based on an algorithm that takes into account both patient and drug related factors. Secondary, the investigators will explore whether our methods are applicable in a randomised controlled trial. The investigators will also decide the number of patients in a randomised controlled trial based on this pilot study. The hypothesis is that an algorithm that has already been developed can stratify patients according to their risk of experiencing a medication error. Methods: 100 acute admitted patients will be risk stratified at admission (&gt;8 hours after). The patients who have highest risks of medication errors will receive a medication review performed by either a clinical pharmacist or a clinical pharmacologist.</brief_summary>
