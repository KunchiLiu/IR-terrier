	<brief_summary>Docetaxel based chemotherapy is a standard therapy in various metastatic cancers including lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and bladder cancer. One of the main plasma protein carriers of docetaxel is Alpha 1 acid glycoprotein. Retrospective data suggests that plasma level of alpha 1 acid glycoprotein is associated with the outcome of docetaxel based therapy in cancer patients. The investigators aim to prospectively study the association between the plasma level of alpha 1 acid glycoprotein and the outcome of docetaxel based therapy in cancer patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Docetaxel based chemotherapy is a standard therapy in various metastatic cancers including non small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and bladder cancer. One of the main plasma protein carriers of docetaxel is Alpha 1 acid glycoprotein Retrospective data suggests that plasma level of alpha 1 acid glycoprotein is associated with the outcome of docetaxel based therapy in non small cell lung cancer patients. The investigators aim to prospectively study the association between the baseline plasma level of alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (measured on the first day of the first cycle of docetaxel) and the outcome (response rete, progression free survival, overall survival) of docetaxel based therapy in patients with metastatic non small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer, prostate cancer, and bladder cancer.</detailed_description>
