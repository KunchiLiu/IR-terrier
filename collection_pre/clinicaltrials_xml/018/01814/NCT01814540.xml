	<brief_title>Bovine Milk Oligosaccharide Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-blind crossover study designed to determine if BMO at two different doses selectively enrich beneficial bacteria in the human gut and will be tolerated in healthy participants compared with a placebo control supplement. Each participant will consume two sachets of supplement for eleven days, separated by a two-week washout before starting the second and third arms. To determine the effect of dose, the placebo-control supplement will be administered in the first arm, followed by the low and high dose. Participants will collect stool and first morning urine and study personnel collected blood from each participant at baseline (day 0) and at the end (Day 11) of each study arm for all three arms.</detailed_description>
