	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty represents over 70 000 surgical procedures per year in France, increasing about 10% each year since the early 1990s. Clinical experience shows a strong rate of success on pain relieve and improvement of knee articular function for these patients. Longevity of the implants had been proved to depend on the biomechanical design and implantation techniques, particularly the bone cuts during the surgery. To improve the precision of these cuts, the patient matched cutting blocks developed by Medacta company allows to adapt bone cuts to the patient anatomy improving the reliability of these procedure. A reduction of surgical time and bleeding would be another benefit expected with this type of ancillary. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the advantage of patient matched cutting blocks for total knee arthroplasty on realiability for both clinical and radiological criteria, morbidity reduction during and after the procedure and also a benefit on an economic point of view.</brief_summary>
