	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted globally. The aim of the trial is to compare efficacy of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) + insulin aspart (IAsp) once daily (OD) versus basal bolus with insulin degludec (IDeg) OD + IAsp three times a day (TID) in controlling glycaemia by evaluating glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The trial is an extension to trial NN5401-3941 (NCT01680341).</brief_summary>
