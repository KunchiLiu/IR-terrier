	<brief_summary>Aim is to investigate the influence of an early supply of parenteral nutrition including a fish oil containing lipid emulsion on the course of acute lung injury in the intensive care unit. In comparison, a standard parenteral nutrition with a soybean oil based emulsion will be used. Data obtained in this trial may provide evidence for a beneficial effect of fish oil derived omega-3 fatty acids in parenteral nutrition regarding their influence on acute lung injury.</brief_summary>
