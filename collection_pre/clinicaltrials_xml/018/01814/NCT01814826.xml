	<brief_summary>This study is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1b, dose-escalation study of MLN4924 in combination with azacitidine in adult patients with AML. The patient population will consist of patients 60 years of age or older, previously diagnosed with World Health Organization(WHO)-defined AML, who are unlikely to benefit from standard induction therapy and who have not received definitive treatment for AML or prior treatment with azacitidine or decitabine.</brief_summary>
