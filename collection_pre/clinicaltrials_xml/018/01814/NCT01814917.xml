	<criteria>The subject and/or parent(s)/guardian(s) must be capable of providing informed consent, and assent when applicable, in agreement with regional requirements. The subject has completed either of the shortterm studies, MCI196E14 or MCI196E16 or The subject has been withdrawn from MCI196E14, but is eligible to enter this study according to the following rules, as defined in MCI196E14: Hyperphosphataemia: Subjects who experienced hyperphosphataemia, defined as any increase in serum phosphorus [P] levels above the agerelated upper limit of normal(ULN) on two consecutive occasions, and was withdrawn by the Investigator in order to proceed to this study, where flexible dosing with colestilan (MCI196) is available. Subjects withdrawn from MCI196E14 due to hyperphosphataemia may only enter this study after Week 6 of the shortterm study, following two consecutive outofrange P values (one obtained at Week 3 and one obtained at Week 6). After Week 6, subjects meeting the above criteria may enter this study at any time (the two consecutive outofrange P values having been obtained any time after Week 6 from a scheduled or unscheduled visit). Hypercalcaemia: Subjects treated with CBPB and experiencing hypercalcaemia may be withdrawn from the shortterm study at the discretion of the Investigator in order to proceed to this study at any time, where flexible dosing with colestilan (MCI196) is available. The subject has current clinically significant medical comorbidities, which may substantially compromise subject safety, or expose them to undue risk, or interfere significantly with study procedures and which, in the opinion of the Investigator, make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g., the subject currently has or has had a history of seizure disorders, dysphagia, swallowing disorders, predisposition to or current bowel obstruction, ileus or severe gastrointestinal [GI] disorders such as chronic or severe constipation [as judged by the Investigator], intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, GI ulcers, current or a history of GI bleeding, or major GI tract surgery). The subject is expected to receive immunosuppressant treatment during the course of the study. The subject is considered unstable on his/her current treatment for CKD within one month prior to enrolment (e.g., subjects starting treatment with vitamin D or its analogues, or other agents/procedures that may influence bone mineral metabolism [i.e., serum P and calcium (Ca) levels]). The subject is considered to be noncompliant with study procedures in the opinion of the Investigator.</criteria>
