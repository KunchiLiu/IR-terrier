	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, longitudinal observational study of adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) participants at academic and community-based practices in the United States who are switching from first-line to second-line therapy. The study's primary hypothesis is that HIV participants switching to raltegravir-based regimens will have better Medical Outcomes Study-HIV (MOS-HIV) Health Survey scores than participants switched to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based or protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens.</brief_summary>
