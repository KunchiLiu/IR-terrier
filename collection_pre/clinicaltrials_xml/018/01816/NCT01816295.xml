	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate if testosterone solution can raise testosterone hormone levels into the normal range, and also improve levels of sexual arousal, interest and drive and/or energy level, in men with low testosterone and decreased sexual arousal, interest and drive and/or decreased energy. The study will last about 16 weeks, followed by an optional 24 week open label treatment phase to investigate the long term safety of testosterone solution.</brief_summary>
