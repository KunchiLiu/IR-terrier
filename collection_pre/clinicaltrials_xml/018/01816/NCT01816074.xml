	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that successfully treating maternal Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) will have a beneficial effect that extends to the child. We believe that multi-component interventions combining maternal stimulant medication, Lisdexamfetamine (LDX), and Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) will improve parenting, maternal, and child outcomes. In terms of improved parenting, we hypothesize that some mothers may respond well to LDX or BPT alone and therefore may not require multi-modal treatment, whereas others may benefit most from multi-modal treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequencing Treatments for Mothers With ADHD and Their At - Risk Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarching goal of this study is to construct and evaluate an adaptive intervention (i.e., an individualized treatment protocol that is adjusted based on the child-mother dyad's initial response to treatment) to improve the trajectory of ADHD outcomes in at-risk children. Our primary outcome measure for the child will be whether child ADHD symptoms on the Conners Parent and Teacher Rating Scales decreased at the completion of the study. Our secondary outcome measure will be whether there was a need for medication for the child over the course of the study. The primary outcome for the mother will be the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) Attention Scale and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S).</detailed_description>
