	<brief_title>NeoPHOEBE: Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab + BKM120 in Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel in HER2-positive Primary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NeoPHOEBE will evaluate the efficacy (as defined by pCR) of BKM120 (an oral PI3K inhibitor) in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel in a randomized, placebo-controlled, neo-adjuvant study in women diagnosed with primary breast cancer &gt;1.5 cm (by US or MRI) with centrally confirmed HER2 overexpression or amplification, and who have not previously undergone treatment for invasive breast cancer. Prior to the initiation of paclitaxel, there will be a 6-week "biologic window" with trastuzumab plus BKM120 or placebo only. The study will be conducted separately in two cohorts (PIK3CA mutated and PI3K3CA wild-type) using a two-stage approach. Within each cohort patients will be randomized into one of the following treatment arms: Arm 1: BKM120 placebo plus trastuzumab for 6 weeks followed by BKM120 placebo plus trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel for an additional 12 weeks. Arm 2: BKM120 plus trastuzumab for 6 weeks followed by BKM120 and trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel for an additional 12 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients will undergo definitive surgery.</detailed_description>
