	<brief_summary>This is a clinical study to evaluate the effect of CMPN (Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm) to the bone. The hypothesis is that patients with CMPN have a higher fracture-rate compared to the background population. We expect to find a lower BMD using conventional DXA scan (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), and a change in other parameters using HR-pQCT (high-resolution peripheral quantitative computerized tomography).Biochemical bone markers is measured to support the hypothesis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a clinical study to evaluate the effect of CMPN to the bone. Three individual cohorts are defined; a cohort consisting of 50 patients with Polycythemia Vera (PV), a cohort consisting of 50 patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), and a cohort consisting of 25 patients with Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). Patients are recruited from the Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital. Interventions consist of: - Conventional DXA scan to measure Bone Mineral Density (BMD). - Experimental HR-pQCT to assess geometry, strength and microstructure of the bone in 3 dimension. - Blood-samples are collected and frozen for later analyses of Biochemical Bone Markers: 1-CTP, Ctx, ALP (alkaline phosphatase)and P1NP. The outcome is compared to healthy control individuals.</detailed_description>
