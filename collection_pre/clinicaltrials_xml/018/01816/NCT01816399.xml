	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether a new vectorcardiogram (VCG) analysis will facilitate the detection of significant coronary disease (CAD) in patients with normal rest 12-leads ECG (NE).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Vectorcardiogram Analysis a Good Predictor of Coronary Disease in Patients With Normal Rest 12-leads ECG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with NE will undergo coronary angiography for routine indications. Prior to the angiography a computerized simultaneous multi-leads ECG will be recorded and, using a new dedicated algorithm for 3D electrical activity reconstruction, the investigators will plot the horizontal VCG of the whole ECG cycle. Using this new VCG analysis we will determine whether the patients have normal coronary arteries or coronary disease.</detailed_description>
