	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way of giving ado-trastuzumab emtansine in treating patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or nearby tissue and cannot be removed by surgery. Biological therapies, such as ado-trastuzumab emtansine, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ado-Trastuzumab Emtansine in Treating Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess change in thrombokinetics (platelet circulation life span). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), duration of response, benefit rate (as defined by stable disease, partial response, or complete response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v 1.1), overall response rate (as defined by partial or complete response by RECIST v 1.1), and survival. II. To evaluate the safety of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (non-platelet toxicity). III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ado-trastuzumab emtansine. OUTLINE: Patients receive ado-trastuzumab emtansine intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving response may continue treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

1) prior to randomization Brain metastases that are untreated or symptomatic, or require any radiation, surgery, or steroid therapy to control symptoms from brain metastases within 30 days of first onstudy thrombokinetic study; for patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases or unequivocal progression of brain metastases on screening scans, localized treatment (i.e., surgery, radiosurgery, and/or whole brain radiotherapy) is required before study enrollment; subjects with known brain metastases must have clinically controlled neurologic symptoms, defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 14 days of stable neurologic function prior to the first thrombokinetic procedure;
