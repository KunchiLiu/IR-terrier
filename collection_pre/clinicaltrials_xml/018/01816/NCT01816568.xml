	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic techniques have allowed surgeons to perform complicated intrabdominal surgery with minimal trauma. In numerous studies, when conventional laparoscopic appendectomy using 3 ports is compared with open appendectomy, it has advantages of reduced pain, reduced hospital stay, and enhanced cosmetic effects. Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was developed with the aim of reducing the invasiveness of conventional laparoscopy. In this study the investigators aimed to compare results of SILS appendectomy and three port conventional laparoscopic appendectomy prospectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Comparison of Single Incision Laparoscopic Appendectomy and Three Port Laparoscopic Appendectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total of 50 patients who undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis will randomly assign to undergo SILS appendectomy group (n = 25) or Three port laparoscopic appendectomy group (n= 25) according to a computer-generated table of random numbers. Demographics (ie, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, need for conversion to a standard or three port laparoscopic appendectomy, need for conversion to an open appendectomy will be recorded. Outcome measures include operative morbidity, operative time, pain score, hospital stay. Morbidity will be evaluated by rates of colonic leak, wound infection, intrabdominal abscess hospital readmission, and hernia.</detailed_description>
