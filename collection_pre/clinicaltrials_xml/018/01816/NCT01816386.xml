	<brief_summary>In the present study, the investigators want to evaluate if press needle acupuncture applied prior to surgery may contribute to the anaesthesiologic outcome. Acupuncture might improve fast-track anaesthesia in the PACU after general surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acupuncture Trial for Post Anaesthetic Recovery and Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of complementary approaches, especially acupuncture, has gained momentum within the last decade. In this regard, it might be appropriate to develop a simply applicable (a) and effective (b) acupuncture regimen for the complementary support of fast-track anaesthesia. Regarding practicability (a), it might be of interest to reduce the amount of necessary acupuncture points. Trials have shown that single-point acupuncture is strong enough to cause relevant clinical effects (Fleckenstein et al., 2009; Lee and Fan, 2009). In addition, practicability means to reduce the amount of needling events; therefore the investigators suggest the use of press needles, making complete peri-anaesthetic availability possible. Regarding effectiveness (b), it has been reported that acupuncture at Governing Vessel 26 (Du-26) may be successful in shock resuscitation (Hsu et al., 2006). In combination with other points it has been evaluated in a Chinese study improving the vegetative state after operation of acute subdural hematoma (Zheng, 2005).</detailed_description>
