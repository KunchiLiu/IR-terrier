	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance (IR) is an important contributor to increased cardiovascular disease risk in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Non-esterified fatty acid elevation is a significant contributor to IR in T1D and may be a target of intervention. The hypothesis of the study is that isolated fatty acid lowering with acipimox will improve insulin action and blood vessel function and have the benefit of reducing mitochondrial oxidant generation and improving mitochondrial function in T1D. Targeting IR through fatty acid lowering is a novel approach to T1D treatment that may significantly improve current management of TID and of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in this high risk population.</brief_summary>
