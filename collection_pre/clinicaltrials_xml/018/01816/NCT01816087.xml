	<brief_title>Performances of a Brief Assessment Tool for the Early Diagnosis of Geriatric Syndromes by Primary Care Physicians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AGE (Active Geriatric Evaluation) program is a collaborative project between a primary care institution and a specialised geriatric unit that aims to develop a brief assessment tool (BAT) adapted to the primary care setting. The objective of this study is to assess the performances of the BAT to identify major geriatric syndromes: cognitive impairment; mood disorder; functional impairment; urinary incontinence; malnutrition; gait and balance impairment; osteoporosis; hearing impairment; visual impairment. In order to achieve our objective, we plan to recruit 155 patients &gt; 70 years old in primary care settings for which primary care physicians will perform the BAT (composed of specific questions and clinical exams). At the end of the consultation, the primary care physician will fill a questionnaire where the absence/presence of syndromes will be recorded (according to the findings of the BAT). Each patient will be then seen a second time by expert geriatricians that will perform a full geriatric evaluation (90 minutes). This will allow to calculate the performances of the intervention (BAT) in terms of sensibility /specificity,...</detailed_description>
