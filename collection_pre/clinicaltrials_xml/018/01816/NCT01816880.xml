	<brief_summary>The aim of this sub-study is to determine whether healthy individuals over 90 years of age possess immune cells that are involved in protection from chronic disease. The immune system is well known to produce anti-cancer and other immune cells, called antibodies that can be beneficial to our health. In this study the investigators will evaluate the immune status of the healthy individuals over 90 years of age. The investigators will be focused on studying molecules known to be involved in cholesterol, cancer like those for prostate cancer and breast cancer, inflammatory diseases, and infectious diseases like influenza.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wellderly Immune Antibodies Study, a Sub-Study of Healthy Elderly Active Longevity (HEAL) Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this sub-study is to determine whether the Wellderly posess neutralizing antibodies targeting antigens involved in chronic disease. The humoral immune system is well known to produce anti-cancer and other antibodies that can be long lived in vivo. In this study we will evaluate the antibody status of the Wellderly with respect to neutralizing (i) molecules known to induce cholesterol like PCSK9, (ii) antibodies against cancer antigens like PMSA (prostate cancer) or Her2 (Breast cancer), (iii) antibodies against inflammatory molecules like TNFa or IL-6, (iv) antibodies that have broad neutralizing activity against infectious diseases like influenza.</detailed_description>
