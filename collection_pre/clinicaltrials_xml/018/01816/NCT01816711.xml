	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether all frail elderly admitted with hip fracture has a vitamin D deficiency, and if s-25(OH)D deficiency increases the risk of hip fracture in frail elderly. Frail elderly are defined as being 65 years of age or older, and living in nursing homes or senior housings. The investigators' hypotheses state that: 1. Frail elderly with hip fractures will have a suboptimal level of vitamin D. 2. Frail elderly with hip fractures are more likely to have a suboptimal level of vitamin D than frail elderly without any hip fractures during the last ten years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Levels in Frail Elderly Patients With a Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study examined frail elderly patients, defined as 65 of age or older and living nursing homes or senior housings. Cases where taken from a Randomised Controlled Trial (NCT01102010), where the included where frail elderly admitted with a hip fractures to the Orthopaedic Surgery Ward at Aarhus University Hospital. Controls were frail elderly, without a hip fracture in the previous ten years, admitted to the Geriatric Ward at Aarhus University Hospital. The investigators will look at all eligible patients' files and record their serum-25(OH)D levels upon admission. According to sample size calculations 92 patients are needed in the case group, and 138 patients in the control group. The inclusion period will be from the 18th of January 2010 to the 1st of October 2012 for both groups.</detailed_description>
