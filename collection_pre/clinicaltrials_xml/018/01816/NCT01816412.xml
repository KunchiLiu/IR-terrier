	<brief_summary>To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of MD02-LDCB for treatment of stenosis or occlusion of the femoral and popliteal arteries in the Japanese population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LEVANT Japan Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will enroll patients presenting with claudication or ischemic rest pain and an angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery and a patent outflow artery to the foot. After successful protocol-defined pre-dilatation, subjects that are determined not to require stenting based on defined angiographic criteria are randomized 2:1 to treatment with either MD02-LDCB (test arm) or standard PTA catheter (control arm) using similar techniques. Subjects that do not meet post-predilatation lesion criteria are excluded (and treated per standard practice) and followed for safety for 30 days. Randomized subjects will have ultrasound follow-up through 2 years and are consented for up to 2 years clinical follow-up.</detailed_description>
