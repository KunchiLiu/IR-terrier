Uncontrolled data report that 1 operator technique is associated with a higher adenoma detection rate, although it is also characterized by a lowwer cecal intubation rate and longer intubation time. The aim of present randomized controlled study was to assess whether one technique is better than the other one in terms of colonoscopy quality performances.</brief_summary>
