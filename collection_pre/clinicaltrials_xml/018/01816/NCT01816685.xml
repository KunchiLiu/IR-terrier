This study loans autotitrating CPAP machines to randomly-selected patients who are at high-risk for obstructive sleep apnea with the goal of preventing post-operative delirium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of CPAP on Postoperative Delirium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing elective knee and hip replacements will be prospectively enrolled. These surgical procedures all have an expected length of stay &gt; 3 days. Immediately following enrollment, patients will be randomized to receive CPAP or routine peri-operative care. Patients in the CPAP group will be instructed to wear an autotitrating positive airway pressure (APAP) device any time they sleep prior to surgery and on postoperative days 0, 1, and 2.</detailed_description>
