	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this project is to evaluate the immunogenicity of TIV vaccination in HIV-uninfected pregnant women compared with HIV-uninfected non-pregnant women in 2013. Safety data will also be collected.THe Pregnancy outcomes and the transplacental transfer of antibodies will also be assessed.</brief_summary>

(ii) Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures. (iii) Provides written informed consent prior to initiation of study. (iv) Women age ≥ 18 years to &lt; 39 years. pregnant women (i) Gestational age ≥20 weeks to &lt;36 weeks documented by the approximate date of the last menstrual period and corroborated by physical exam and sonar report if available. All women (i) Receipt of TIV, other than through the study, during the current influenza season documented by medical history or record. (ii) Receipt of any live licensed vaccine ≤ 28 days or any other vaccine (except for tetanus toxoid vaccine) ≤ 14 days prior to studyvaccine. (iii) Receipt of a nonlicensed agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) ≤ 28 days prior to vaccination in this study, or expects to receive another nonlicensed agent before delivery unless study approval is obtained. (iv) Any significant (in the opinion of the site investigator) acute illness and/or oral temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C ≤ 24 hours prior to study entry. (v) Use of anticancer systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy ≤ 48 weeks of study enrollment, or has immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment. (vi) Long term use of glucocorticoids, including oral or parenteral prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks (or 2 weeks total) ≤ 12 weeks of study entry, or highdose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) ≤ 12 weeks before study entry (nasal and topical steroids are allowed). (vii) Receipt of immunoglobulin or other blood products (with exception of Rho D immune globulin) ≤ 12 weeks prior to enrollment in this study or is scheduled to receive immunoglobulin or other blood products (with the exception of Rho D immune globulin) during pregnancy or for the first 24 weeks after delivery. (viii) Receipt of immune mediators ≤ 12 weeks before enrollment. (ix) Uncontrolled major psychiatric disorder. (x) History of a severe adverse reaction to previous TIV. (xi) Any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol. pregnant women (i) Receipt of corticosteroids for preterm labor ≤ 14 days before study entry. (ii) Pregnancy complications (in the current pregnancy) such as preterm labor, hypertension (Blood Pressure (BP) &gt;140/90 in the presence of proteinuria or BP &gt;150/100, with or without proteinuria or currently on antihypertensive medication) or preeclampsia.</criteria>
