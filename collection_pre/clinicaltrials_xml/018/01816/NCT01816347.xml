	<brief_summary>The cyclic movement of the heart and the coronary arteries induces relative axial movement between the artery and a pre-deployed intra-luminal stent which may cause malpositioning. Using a new imaging algorithm to indicate the position of a stent in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the investigators will measure the pre-deployment relative, intra-luminal stent axial movement in the different coronary arteries to facilitate the precise deployment site.</brief_summary>
