	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study in which women who desire an etonogestrel implant will be randomized to either a home or office insertion visit. The purpose of this research is to study the interest in, feasibility of, and rates of insertion for implantable birth control (Implanon®/Nexplanon®) when inserted at home visit appointments compared to standard office visit appointments. The ultimate goal of the study is to reduce barriers to insertion of the etonogestrel implant and increase consistent and correct contraception use by introducing a previously unexplored method of access, the home visit.</brief_summary>
