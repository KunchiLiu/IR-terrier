	<brief_summary>Prehypertension are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, and often complicated with the metabolic disorder of glucose and lipid. The comprehensive prevention of hypertension is still an important and complex clinical issue. Taurine is one of the ingredients of Chinese medicine bezoar ,as an endogenous amino acids is central inhibitory neurotransmitter, can regulate the excitability of nerve tissue, regulate body temperature, therefore, antipyretic, sedative, analgesic, anti-inflammatory,the role of anti-rheumatic, anti-convulsant. In addition, Taurine inhibits platelet aggregation in the circulatory system, lower blood lipids, to maintain the body's normal blood pressure and prevent atherosclerosis; protective effect on myocardial cells, can be anti-arrhythmic; special efficacy to lower blood cholesterol, to treat heart failure. The effect of oral Taurine on blood pressure is not consistent, however, many animal study has shown that oral administration of Taurine, could reduce 24-hour mean arterial systolic and diastolic blood pressure in spontaneous hypertensive rats. Furthermore, Taurine interfere with calcium and low affinity binding of the calcium binding sites, decrease the voltage-dependent Ca2+channel in vascular smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation, lower blood pressure.In a prospective, double-blind, randomized, and parallel-group study, we will evaluate the effects of Taurine granule on blood pressure and metabolic parameters in prehypertensive and mild hypertensive patients. This study will help develop future comprehensive prevention and treatment strategies for hypertension.</brief_summary>
