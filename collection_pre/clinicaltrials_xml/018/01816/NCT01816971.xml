	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone before and after stem cell transplant works in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from diving. Giving carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone before and after stem cell transplant may kill more cancer cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone Before and After Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the rate of stringent complete response (CR) (sCR) after 8 cycles of CRd (4 cycles of induction + autologous stem cell transplant [ASCT] + 4 cycles of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and low dose dexamethasone [CRd] consolidation). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Overall response rate defined as partial response or better (&gt;= partial response [PR]) including the rate of very good partial response (VGPR) or better (&gt;= VGPR) and near complete response or better (sCR/CR/nCR) across entire treatment in high risk and low risk patients. II. Duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determination of the rate of minimal residual disease in patients who achieved CR. II. Prospective evaluation of candidate markers of response to CRd established in the completed CRd trial. III. Evaluation of markers of response and duration of response to treatment strategy using CRd with or without transplant. OUTLINE: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) or orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 8, 15 and 22; carfilzomib IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16; and lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.. TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplant. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive dexamethasone, carfilzomib, and lenalidomide as in induction. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive dexamethasone and lenalidomide as in induction therapy and carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

the first pregnancy test must be performed within 1014 days before day 1 cycle 1 and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours of day 1 cycle 1; the subject may not receive lenalidomide until the treating investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative, and must agree to ongoing pregnancy tests as outlined in the protocol FCBP must agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: For at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide While participating in the study;
