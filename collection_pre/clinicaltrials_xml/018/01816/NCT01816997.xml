	<brief_title>The Statins on Glucose Homeostasis in Subjects With Impaired Fasting Glucose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statin therapy effectively reduces cardiovascular events. However, trial data1 and meta-analyses suggest that statins also confer increased risk of development of diabetes. In order to elucidate whether statins increase risk of diabetes, investigators conducted this study to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin (maybe the highest diabetogenic) and pravastatin (seems to be protective) on the glucose homeostasis and other biomarkers in subjects with impaired fasting glucose.</detailed_description>
