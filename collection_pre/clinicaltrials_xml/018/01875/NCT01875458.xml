	<brief_summary>Bisphosphonates are drugs that prevent bone loss by blocking the activity of cells that normally resorb bone. The most common examples of these drugs are Boniva and Fosamax. These drugs are available for oral or intravenous dosing and are prescribed at daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly intervals. Among the many thousands of individuals who currently take these medications, certain individuals experience "atypical" femur fractures preceded by prodromal pain, changes in cortical thickening of bone, or bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ). Osteonecrosis of the jaws is defined as exposed bone of the jaws for 8 weeks or more and requires surgical treatment. This study will attempt to identify genomic and rna biomarkers that may play a role in differential metabolism of bisphosphonates or indicate tendency toward the severe adverse events associated with these drugs.</brief_summary>
