	<brief_summary>Simulation-based training has been widely implemented in medical education. According to educational theories, simulation-based medical education (SBME) is associated with significant advantages, which has been investigated and proved by many studies. However, the value of SBME in comparison to other instructional methodologies remains largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is to directly compare two instructional methods for neonatal resuscitation training.</brief_summary>
