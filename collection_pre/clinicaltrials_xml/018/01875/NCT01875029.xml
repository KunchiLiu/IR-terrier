	<brief_summary>Back School (BS) is a behavioural intervention designed to treat and prevent chronic low back pain. Up to date clinical research studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is able to decrease the intensity and duration of pain modulating the activity of brain areas involved in the circuits that regulate pain and facilitating the mechanisms inhibitors descendants of pain control. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of combining tDCS with a behavioural intervention (i.e. BS) in subjects with chronic low back pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>tDCS Effects on Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic low back pain involves high individual and social costs. Back School (BS) is a behavioural intervention designed to treat and prevent the aforementioned condition. Up to date clinical research studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be considered a reliable tool for chronic pain. It has been shown how tDCS is able to decrease the intensity and duration of pain modulating the activity of brain areas involved in the circuits that regulate pain, such as the thalamus, and facilitating the mechanisms inhibitors descendants of pain control. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of combining tDCS with a behavioural intervention (i.e. BS) in subjects with chronic low back pain. Specifically, we will test their effects on low back pain intensity and participation of patients' in daily activities.</detailed_description>
