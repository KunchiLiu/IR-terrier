	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of ELAD to Treat Acute Liver Failure (ALF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VTI-212 is an open-label, multicenter, historically-controlled study of subjects with acute liver failure (ALF). Approximately 40 subjects who meet the eligibility requirements of the study will receive ELAD treatment in addition to standard of care treatment for ALF. The outcomes of these subjects will be compared with matched historical controls drawn from existing databases. Subjects will undergo ELAD treatment for a minimum of 3 days (72 hours). It is recommended ELAD treatment be continued up to 10 days (240 hours). Following ELAD treatment, subjects will continue standard medical therapy as defined by the institution and be followed through Study Day 28. Subjects' diagnosis of ALF will be attributed to one of the following: 1. FHF (acute liver failure with no preexisting liver disease); 2. Primary Graft Non-Function (PNF); 3. Surgically-Induced Liver Failure (including subjects with small for size liver transplants, living donor liver transplants, and subjects with risk of ALF following liver cancer surgery. Screening evaluations and assessments will be completed for subjects and reviewed against inclusion/exclusion criteria. Enrollment will define the time of study entry (Hour 0, Study Day 1, study baseline) and inclusion in the ITT population. Subjects will be evaluated throughout the 28-day study period. If standard medical therapy, as defined by the institution and this protocol is consistent with discharging the subject home, then the subject should be discharged. Prior to discharge, the subject will be advised to attend all follow-up visits. An extension of this study, VTI-212E, will provide additional ELAD survival data, as available, through VTI-212 study termination (after the last surviving enrolled ELAD subject completes Study Day 28). This registry protocol segment of VTI-212 extends the safety monitoring period to 5 years to assess survival, incidence and characterization of tumor (in particular hepatocellular tumor), incidence of liver transplant, and assess quality of life using a standard, validated questionnaire.</detailed_description>

Jaundice to encephalopathy time ≥ 7 days 1. Cerebral Perfusion Pressure ≤ 40 mm Hg for 1 hour or longer as measured by an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor. (NOTE: In those cases where ICP monitor placement cannot be performed prior to study enrollment, this exclusion criterion will not apply); 2. Chronic liver disease (e.g., compensated cirrhosis of any etiology, chronic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cholestatic liver disease, or metabolic liver disease) (NOTE: steatosis is not an exclusion criterion); 3. Acute clinical symptoms that, in the Investigator's opinion, are likely to result in death within 48 hours of enrollment; 4. Evidence of infection unresponsive to antibiotics (e.g. increased tissue involvement relative to initial diagnosis, clinical worsening of symptom) indicated by any of the following: 1. Presence of sepsis or septic shock; OR 2. Positive blood cultures (bacteremia, fungemia) within 72 hours prior to Enrollment; OR 3. Presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during the 2 days prior to Enrollment; OR 4. Clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia. 5. Concomitant disease including chronic congestive heart failure, severe vascular disease, emphysema, AIDS, cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), acute fattyliver disease, hepatitis due to herpes virus or BuddChiari syndrome. (NOTE: in the case of subjects enrolled due to surgeryinduced liver failure (SILF) then the original cause for the surgery will not be a criterion for exclusion); 6. Portal hypertension; 7. Liver dysfunction due to trauma; 8. Irreversible brain death; 9. Platelet count &lt; 30,000/mm3 [NOTE: Subject may be included at the physician's discretion if platelet count exceeds 30,000/mm3 at time of initiation of therapy (even if the value is following platelet transfusion) and can be managed through the administration of blood products] 10. Cardiovascular SOFA score &gt; 3; 11. Stroke or intracranial hemorrhage; 12. Seizures uncontrolled by medication; 13. Acute myocardial infarction; 14. Lung disease defined by a PaO2 ≤ 60 mm Hg or an FiO2 ≥ 0.6, not corrected by medical management [including continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) if indicated] and ventilation with a Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) of &gt; 8cm H2O; 15. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; 16. Pregnancy as determined by betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) results; 17. ≤ 2 weeks postpartum; 18. Participation in another investigational drug, biologic, or device study within one month of enrollment, except for observational studies (the observational study setting should not affect the safety and/or efficacy of the VTI212 clinical trial); 19.

Has a Do Not Resuscitate or a Do Not Intubate (DNR/DNI) directive (or local equivalent) or any other Advanced Directive limiting Standard of Care in place (the DNR/DNI criterion is not applicable in the UK).</criteria>
