	<brief_summary>Our objective is to assess whether pre-treatment with a fixed dose of insulin, based on weight, given to pregnant patients with gestational or preexisting diabetes receiving betamethasone can provide adequate glycemic control. Our hypothesis is that pre-treatment with a weight-based calculated insulin dose will help maintain euglycemia for pregnant patients with gestational and preexisting diabetes after steroid administration, and possibly impact length of hospital admission.</brief_summary>
