	<brief_summary>There is evidence that intense physical activity has a potential effect on thrombotic events due to catecholamine release. The hormones leptin and adiponectin have been used as markers of cardiovascular risk, but they are few and contradictory studies that relate physical training intensity and duration of high plasma concentrations of these hormones. The use of antioxidants, such as proanthocyanidins present in grapes, may help in reducing the undesirable effects of intense training.</brief_summary>
