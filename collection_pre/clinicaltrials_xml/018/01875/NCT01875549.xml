	<brief_summary>Internal biliary drainage is an useful method for a control of jaundice and cholangitis to patients who had a malignant hilar obstruction due to hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gall bladder cancer or metastatic lymphadenopathy. Bilateral biliary drainage is more physiologic but technically difficult to compared with unilateral biliary drainage specially related to conformability and flexibility between using stents. There are no prospective clinical trials compared with these internal biliary drainage methods in hilar malignant obstruction using metal stent. Therefore, the investigators want to compare the clinical outcome of two method: Unilateral biliary stent and Bilateral biliary stent</brief_summary>
