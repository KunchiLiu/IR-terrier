	<brief_summary>Combined application of surgery planning software and rapid prototyping technology and preshaped titanium plates can effectively promote the accuracy of the diagnosis and treatment of bilateral maxillofacial post traumatic deformities, reduce operation time and improve surgical effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Bilateral Maxillofacial Post-traumatic Deformities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients underwent preoperative CT scan. Firstly, SurgiCase were used to analyze CT data and design preliminary surgery plans. Secondly, three-dimensions resin skull models were produced by rapid prototyping technology. Model surgeries were performed to determine the location, reduction direction and shift distance of osteotomy. Based on the surgical simulation, the preliminary surgery plans were validated and optimized. Then, the titanium plates and mesh were preshaped on the models. Finally, according to the final surgery plans the operations were performed. The operation time, therapeutic effects and complications were observed. The follow-up periods were 1-12 months.</detailed_description>
