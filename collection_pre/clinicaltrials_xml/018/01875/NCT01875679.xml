	<brief_summary>Simulation in surgical skills training is widely accepted as a necessary step to improve surgical training outside the operating room. Simulation predominately focuses on teaching a specific task or procedure. Once this task is acquired ongoing optimization of technique is desirable. Commonly ongoing skills assessment occurs in the form of peer feedback throughout training rotations. This feedback is frequently subjective and of variable educational use. Identifying ongoing technical training needs and enabling personalized objective feedback represents an important training concept that has not yet been formally used in resident training. The specific goal of this study is to prove the effect of a comprehensive surgical coaching (CSC) approach which combines concepts of behavior modeling training, task debriefing and error recognition to improve overall surgical technique without additional technical skills training.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design The study design is a randomized, controlled trial involving evaluation of a study and a conventionally trained group at pretest and posttest. Participants The study and control groups will consist of senior surgical residents (PGY 3-5) and surgical fellows involved in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Inclusion: Since concurrent operative training in the operating room (OR) in the technique of MIS is a prerequisite for this study, only residents and fellows on rotations with a practice focus on MIS during the time period of the study will be eligible for participation. Exclusion: Individuals with severe illnesses precluding performance in the OR will not be included. Outcome measures: Surgical performance will be assessed using a global rating scale as well as through tabulation of observed intraoperative technical errors. Primary outcome measure is surgical skill level before and after targeted training.</detailed_description>
