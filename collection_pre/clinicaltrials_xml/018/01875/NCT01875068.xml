	<brief_summary>The investigators have previously demonstrated utilizing a validated tool, that the quality of referrals from nurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA) is less than referrals from physicians. The investigators hypothesize that with local physician input, the quality of referrals from nurse practitioners and physician assistants will improve. This is a prospective study comparing patient referrals from nurse practitioners and physician assistants with and without prior discussion with a local physician.</brief_summary>
