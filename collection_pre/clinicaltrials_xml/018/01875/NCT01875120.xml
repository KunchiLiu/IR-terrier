	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the influence of somatic symptom load and anxiety sensitivity as risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Physiological and psychological variables are assessed in female patients with an increased risk for PONV prior to a planned surgical intervention with a 33-item questionnaire composed of the ASI-3 and the PHQ-15. Postoperative evaluation includes the occurrence of nausea and vomiting in the first 24 hours after surgery. It is hypothesized that patients with high sum scores for somatic symptom load (measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-15) and with increased levels for anxiety sensitivity (measured with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, ASI-3) experience more frequently postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) than patients with low scores in both self-rating instruments.</brief_summary>
