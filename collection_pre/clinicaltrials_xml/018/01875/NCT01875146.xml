	<brief_summary>Investigation of the training effects following 8 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIT)in combination with side-alternating whole-body vibration compared to conventional HIT or side-alternating whole-body vibration. The adaptations are investigated on a molecular (muscle biopsy of the M. vastus lateralis) and systemic (e.g. cycling, jumping mechanography, dynamometry) level. In addition, the acute effects of the first and last training session will be investigated on a molecular (e.g. satellite cell activation, mRNA abundance) and systemic (e.g. ventilatory ga exchange, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion) level.</brief_summary>
