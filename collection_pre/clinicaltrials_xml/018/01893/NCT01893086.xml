	<brief_summary>Recently, many gynecologic oncologists proposed that surgeons should consider opportunistic salpingectomy to prevent ovarian cancer for all patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign disease. However, the safety and the consequences regarding ovarian function after salpingectomy have not yet to be established. Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled study is compare the ovarian reserve via anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) between laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) alone and LH combined with salpingectomy.</brief_summary>
