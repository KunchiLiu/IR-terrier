	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand the family planning needs and practices of postpartum Malawian women, with a focus on long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Hypotheses: 1. Postpartum women who are older, who have a history of unintended pregnancy, who do not desire another child within 2 years, and who were counseled about LARC during their pregnancy are more likely to have interest in using LARC. 2. Postpartum women who are older are more likely to be aware of LARC methods. 3. HIV+ postpartum Malawian women will have similar knowledge about LARC as postpartum Malawian women who are HIV-.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective cohort study of 630 postpartum Malawian women. Since our focus is on HIV+ women, HIV+ participants will be recruited in a 1:2 ratio, with a total of 210 HIV+ women and 420 HIV- women. We will recruit in the postpartum ward of Bwaila Maternity Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi. Participants will complete a baseline survey about demographics, reproductive health history, and family planning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. At 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum, we will complete follow-up phone calls to determine what family planning methods they are using and if they encountered any barriers to receiving LARC if they had been interested in using them.</detailed_description>
