	<brief_summary>Smoking cessation improves mortality, even in patients with existing smoking-related morbidity. Telephone follow-up after smoking cessation counselling as been shown to be an important method to provide support to smokers and to improve quit rates, especially if three or more calls were used in addition to face-to-face counselling. While it is reasonable to assume that more counselling leads to better smoking cessation outcomes, little evidence exists over the amount of telephone follow-up counselling that is required for optimal and sustained abstinence. We aim to investigate if six-months of weekly telephone follow-up is superior to one-month of weekly telephone follow-up.</brief_summary>
