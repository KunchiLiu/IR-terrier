	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerate dose (MTD) of intra-tumoral injection of gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) when administered as a one time initial induction therapy in conjunction (=&lt; 33 hours) prior to conventional multimodality treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the initial and delayed toxicity associated with this treatment regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intratumorally (IT) on day 1. Within 33 hours, patients receive standard chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 and undergo standard radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>
