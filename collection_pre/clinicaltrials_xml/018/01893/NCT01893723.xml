	<brief_summary>The Physiodoloris (MetroDoloris, Lille, France) monitor, CE marqued, uses the ECG signal in order to compute the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) which has been shown to measure the relative parasympathetic tone, and hence to reflect the analgesia/nociception balance during general anesthesia. The primary endpoint of this randomized multicenter study is to measure whether there is a benefit to use the ANI in order to adapt remifentanil administration during propofol anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery. Primary endpoint : lesser proportion of patients presenting with at least one episode of hemodynamic reactivity, hypotension or bradycardia in the ANI guided group vs control group ?</brief_summary>
