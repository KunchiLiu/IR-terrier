	<brief_summary>Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI) describes a condition of the hip where additional bone results in the abutment of the femoral neck against the rim of the acetabulum. This gives rise to localised cartilage damage and pain, but also increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic surgery versus physiotherapy and activity modification for the treatment of this condition.</brief_summary>
