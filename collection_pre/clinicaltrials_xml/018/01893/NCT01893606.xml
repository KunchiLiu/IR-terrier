	<brief_summary>This study is a withdrawal randomized clinical trail to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 1.1 chemical drugs N-acetyl glucosamine on Chinese IBS-D patients coming from four centers in chongqing. 180 IBS-D patients in this research are accord with the Rome III diagnostic criteria, screening/import period pain intensity scores of the NRS week mean value are 3.0 plus and the days which at least more than one time a stool type are 6 or 7 type over 2 days/week. Test cycle includes screening/import period (2 weeks), open treatment period (8 weeks), a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal period (8 weeks), the main outcome measures are pain intensity (NRS score 11 point scale) and stool type ( Bristol type). And secondary endpoints included overall symptoms sensory scores, defecation frequency, abdominal distension, mucous stool and quality of life parameters (IBS-36 scale). After the end of the treatment period, the participants whose pain intensity and stool type are effective subjects into a randomized withdrawal period, analysis and comparison of the difference between treatment group and placebo group withdrawal rate and curative effect index score reduces.</brief_summary>
