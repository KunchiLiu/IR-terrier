	<brief_summary>The prevalence of obesity continues to increase at an alarming rate for all sectors of the population in the US. Obesity in the older adult cohort is of great concern as it is associated with reductions in mobility, declines in physical performance and increased risk for physical disability. With regard to body composition, a) fat mass has been determined to be a stronger predictor of mobility limitations than low muscle mass in older individuals and alternatively, b) leg lean mass has also been cited as a primary determinant of lower extremity physical function. Obesity is related to increased levels of fatigue and lack of motivation and mental energy. Fatigue can be categorized as both a subjective perception and a performance decrement. Fatigue can be defined as a perceived lack of physical or mental energy while fatigability is another construct categorized by the degree of fatigue associated with activity in any dimension (i.e. physical, mental, emotional, and/or social). The impact of a higher protein diet on muscle quality, muscle fatigability, perceptions of fatigue and systemic inflammation in older adults has not been well documented. The utility of a higher protein weight loss diet combined with resistance exercise training to augment fat mass loss, attenuate lean mass loss and improve muscle quality and physical function could potentially be of high value to overweight older women. The potential further benefits of this regimen to enhance mental energy and other aspects of psycho-social well-being are unknown. The aims of the present study include assessing the effects of the proposed diet and exercise intervention on 1) body composition, 2) strength and muscle quality, and 3) energy and fatigue symptoms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our target population includes 75 overweight or obese (BMI &gt;/= 25kg/m^2) women between the ages of 65 and 80. This study will use a parallel-arm design. After blocking on age and BMI, 75 overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) older females (65 - 80 y old) will be randomized into three groups; PRO or CARB diet combined with exercise (PRO+EX;n=25, CARB+EX; n=25) or PRO (n=25) without exercise for 6 months. All groups will have the goal of losing ~10% of initial body weight. We anticipate an adherence rate of 80% (n = 20 in each group remaining). At the initiation of the study, all subjects will be weight stable (within 2 kg) for past 6 mos and sedentary (defined as &lt; 1h/wk or less than 2 exercise sessions per week in the last 6 months). Eligible participants will be planning to live in the community for the duration of the study. Exclusion criteria will include any chronic disease/condition that would not permit exercise or dietary restriction or alter interpretation of data. All subjects will require personal physician clearance prior to enrollment. Main outcome variables of interest are whole body composition, regional body composition, muscle strength endurance and quality, physical function, fatigue and biomarkers related to fatigue.</detailed_description>
