	<brief_title>Applicability of Video Games and Vibrational Therapy in Reducing Pain Secondary to Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After physiotherapy assessment individuals will be randomly divided into three groups: Group Virtual Reality - Cinesioterapia (G1), Group Vibration Therapy - Cinesioterapia (G2) and Control Group (G3), which will be submitted to the respective treatment protocols. Group Virtual Reality Cinesioterapia (G1) participate in this group 20 women will be treated through the games Xbox 360 ®, attributed to this, customized applications using virtual and augmented reality to be developed. Vibration Therapy Group - Cinesioterapia (G2) - will participate in this group 20 women who will undergo 15 minutes of continuous vibration through the blanket vibrating members higher, with frequency 40 Hz, 3 function and intensity tolerable, keeping the limb supported and elevated to 120 º. At the end held muscle stretching exercises, dissociation of shoulder girdle and upper limb exercises assets. Control group (G3) - participate in this group 20 women who are treated with conventional cinesioterapia through muscle stretching exercises for flexors, extensors, adductors and abductors shoulder for 20 seconds each; dissociation girdle; financial assets and Active assisted for groups flexors, extensors, abductors and adductors of the upper limbs, which will be performed three sets of 10 repetitions for each exercise. Implementation of treatment protocols for the groups G1, G2 and G3 will run for two weeks, being Monday through Friday feira.totalizando 10 consecutive treatment sessions lasting 30 minutes each session. You will be prompted to patients groups G1, G2 and G3 to respond individually and without any aid the visual numeric scale of pain, 10 minutes pre-therapy, 15 minutes after the start and 10 minutes after the end of therapy. Patients will undergo the assessment of pain, electromyographic activity of muscles, muscle strength, range of motion analysis and perimetry in the first day of treatment, and after completing all the sessions patients were reassessed.</detailed_description>
