	<brief_title>Professional Breastfeeding Support Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to determine whether early post-partum professional breastfeeding support improves breastfeeding outcomes. The primary hypotheses are: 1. Exclusive breastfeeding rates at 1, 2, and 3 months will be increased among mother-infant pairs who receive professional lactation support or telephone follow-up support (intervention groups) when compared with those who receive usual post-natal breastfeeding support (control group); 2. The rate of any breastfeeding (predominant or partial) at 1, 2, and 3 months will be increased among mother-infant pairs in the intervention groups when compared with those in the control group; The secondary hypotheses are: 1. The overall duration of exclusive breastfeeding will be increased among mother-infant pairs in the intervention groups when compared with those in the control group; 2. The overall duration of any breastfeeding (predominant or partial) will be increased among mother-infant pairs in the intervention groups when compared with those in the control group.</detailed_description>
