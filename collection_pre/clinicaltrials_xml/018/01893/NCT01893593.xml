	<detailed_description>Objective: The Young Hearts Strong Starts Study was designed to test strategies to facilitate adoption of the Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents among pediatric and family medicine providers. The study compares quality measures based on the guidelines for two dissemination strategies: a multi-faceted, practice-directed intervention or standard dissemination. Methods: Two primary care research networks recruited practices and provided support for the intervention and outcome evaluations. Individual practices were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control groups using a cluster randomized design based on network affiliation, number of clinicians per practice, urban vs. nonurban location, and practice type. In this design, the units of observation are individual children because outcomes are abstracted from medical records for individual patients. The units of randomization are physician practices. This results in a multilevel design in which patients are nested within practices. Implementation The intervention practices receive toolkits, including guideline summaries and slides, a patient and family behavior change workbook, and a clinical decision support tool. Guideline implementation was promoted through an introductory academic detailing session and the use of an ongoing e-learning group. The intervention strategy was further enhanced by aligning this project with the American Board of Pediatrics quality improvement Maintenance of Certification (MOC) requirements and offers voluntary MOC participation to participants. MOC participation includes the creation of a practice aims statement, monthly physician self-abstraction to track progress throughout the intervention, and participation in webinar presentations and sharing of best practices.</detailed_description>
