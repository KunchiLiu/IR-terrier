	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of Botulinum toxin type A into muscles of the leg(s) are effective in treating children/adolescents (age 2-17 years) with increased muscle tension/uncontrollable muscle stiffness (spasticity) due to cerebral palsy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female or male subject of 2 to 17 years of age (inclusive). Uni or bilateral cerebral palsy with clinical need for uni or bilateral LL injections with BoNT for the treatment of spasticity. Ashworth Scale [AS] score â‰¥2 in plantar flexors (at least unilaterally). Clinical need for a total dose of 16 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 400 U) for the treatment of LL spasticity according to the clinical judgment of the investigator. Fixed contracture defined as severe restriction of the range of joint movement on passive stretch or predominant forms of muscle hypertonia other than spasticity (e.g., dystonia) in the target limb(s). Surgery on pes equinus on side(s) intended to be treated with BoNT injections in this study within 12 months prior to Screening Visit (V1), in the screening period or planned for the time of participation in this study. Hip flexion requiring BoNT injection.</criteria>
