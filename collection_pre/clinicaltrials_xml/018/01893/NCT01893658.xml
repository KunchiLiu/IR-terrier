	<brief_summary>The investigators goal is to evaluate the role of XOLAIR® in treatment of Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (AIN) with the goal of shortening the duration and dose of prednisone for treatment of drug-induced AIN. Currently there is no good treatment for drug-induced AIN. Prednisone is the standard treatment but is associated with many side-effects when used long-term and at high doses.</brief_summary>
