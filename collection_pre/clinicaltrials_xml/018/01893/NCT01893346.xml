	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability of Ceftazidime-Avibactam for Pediatric Patients With Suspected or Confirmed Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I, open-label, single-dose study. The study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetics of CAZ-AVI and assess its safety and tolerability following a single IV dose given to hospitalized pediatric patients receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for suspected or confirmed infection. This study will include 4 cohorts, each consisting of at least 8 evaluable pediatric patients, aged ≥3 months to &lt;18 years, who are hospitalized with infections.</detailed_description>
