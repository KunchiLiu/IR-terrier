	<criteria>Female patient has primary symptoms of SUI, as confirmed by patient medical history and clinical symptoms, including a focused incontinence evaluation. Patient has symptoms of pure urge incontinence as confirmed by basic evaluation of etiology from a patient medical history, including a focused incontinence history. Patient has symptoms of mixed urinary incontinence where urge incontinence is the predominant factor. Patient has had stress urinary incontinence symptoms less than 6 months prior to signing the informed consent. Patient has not previously attempted conservative treatment prior to signing the informed consent. (Examples of conservative treatment include behavior modifications, bladder exercises, biofeedback, etc.) Patient has more than 2 episode of awakening to void during normal sleeping hours. Patient cannot be maintained on a stable dose and/or frequency of medication (including diuretics) known to affect lower urinary tract function, including but not limited to, anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants or alphaadrenergic blockers, for at least 2 weeks prior to screening or is likely to change during the course of the study. Patient is pregnant, lactating, or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study. Patient refuses to provide written informed consent. Patient is not at least 18 years of age.
