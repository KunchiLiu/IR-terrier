	<brief_title>Placebo-Controlled Therapeutic Trial for the Prevention of Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy of study drug in improving chronic lymphedema while further elucidating the role of inflammatory and lymphangiogenic processes in the pathogenesis of this disease. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive study drug orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO TID for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>
