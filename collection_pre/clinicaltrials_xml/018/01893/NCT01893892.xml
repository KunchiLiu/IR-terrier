	<brief_title>Levocarnitine in Treating Patients With Vismodegib-Associated Muscle Spasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine mean number of muscle spasms per week after levocarnitine arm compared to placebo arm. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess intensity of muscle spasms per week after levocarnitine arm compared to placebo arm. II. To assess responses related to activities of daily living or psychosocial function after 4 weeks of placebo or 4 weeks of levocarnitine. III. To assess the frequency of all adverse effects on levocarnitine versus placebo. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive levocarnitine orally (PO) every 6 hours twice daily (BID) during weeks 1-4. Patients then cross-over to Arm II for weeks 8-12. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO every 6 hours BID during weeks 1-4. Patients then cross-over to Arm I for weeks 8-12. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
