	<brief_summary>This will be a 3 part study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and repeat doses of GSK2862277 administered via inhalation (IH) or intravenous (IV) routes in healthy subjects. Part 1 of this study will involve an initial assessment of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK286227, via single escalating intravenous doses, compared to a predecessor molecule, GSK1995057. After completion of Part 1 an interim data review will occur which will assess key comparability criteria to inform progression to Part 2 of the study. Part 2 of the study will involve single doses of GSK2862277 at a level predicted to be at or close to therapeutic dose levels. Part 2 will investigate both intravenous and inhaled routes of administration, in sequential manner, respectively. An interim data review will also occur after completion of Part 2, where all data accumulated previously will be assessed to examine appropriateness to progress to Part 3. Part 3 of the study will involve 5 days of repeat dosing via both inhaled and intravenous routes using the same dose administered in Part 2.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Subject is positive at screening for HAVH autoantibodies against GSK1995057 (Part 1 only). A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day.
