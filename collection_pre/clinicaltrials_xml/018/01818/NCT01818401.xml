	<brief_summary>Over 70.000 total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are performed in France every year, with a 10% yearly increase since the early 1990s. The clinical experience shows a strong rate of success on pain relief and on function. Longevity of the implants has been shown to be determined by the biomechanical design of the prosthesis, and by the implantation technique, especially the correct positioning of the bone cuts during the surgery. To improve the precision of these cuts, the patient matched cutting blocks developed by Medacta allow to adapt the bone cuts to the patient's anatomy, improving the reliability of this procedure. A reduction of the surgery time lengh and bleeding would be other benefits expected with this type of ancillary. The objective of this trial is to study the reliability of patient matched cutting blocks for total knee arthroplasty, by both clinical and radiological assessment, the effect on morbidity reduction during and after the procedure and also the benefit it could bring on an economic point of view.</brief_summary>
