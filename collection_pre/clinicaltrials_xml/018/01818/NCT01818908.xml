	<brief_title>Trial of DA-EPOCH Regimen for NHL With HLH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis(LA-HLH) has a high fatality rate and the worst outcome. The major cause of LA-HLH is aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL), especially T/NKT cell lymphomas. Until now, there is no recommended therapeutic schedule for this fatal disease. Dose-adjusted(DA) EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) shows effective activity in patients with aggressive NHL. The investigators therefore developed DA-EPOCH regimen to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and assess its clinical outcome including safety and efficacy.</detailed_description>
