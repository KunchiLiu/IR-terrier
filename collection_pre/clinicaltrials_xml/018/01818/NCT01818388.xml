	<brief_summary>A multicenter prospective single arm interventional trial in hospitals where therapeutic hypothermia is standard practice. This trial will enroll 50 subjects to evaluate the ability of the ZOLL Intravascular Temperature Management (IVTM) System to induce, maintain, and reverse mild therapeutic hypothermia and maintain normothermia post cardiac arrest.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Signed informed consent 2. 18 years of age or older 3. Outofhospital witnessed cardiac arrest with any rhythm [Ventricular Fibrillation/Tachycardia (VF/VT), Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA), or Asystole (AS)] during EMS phase of treatment OR: Outofhospital unwitnessed cardiac arrest with VF upon EMS arrival 4. Lack of meaningful response to verbal commands upon arrival to hospital after suffering nontraumatic cardiac arrest in an outofhospital setting 5. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) within 30 minutes of EMS arrival 6. Able to maintain a SBP &gt; 90mmHg for 30 minutes post ROSC without the use of pressors OR with stable dose of pressors (if escalation of pressors is required, patient is not eligible) 7. Undergoing Therapeutic Hypothermia using ZOLL's IVTM System within twelve hours of ROSC BUT should have been initiated as soon as possible Exclusion Criteria 1. Traumatic cardiac arrest [due to blunt trauma, penetrating injury (e.g., stabbing, gunshot, etc.), burns, exsanguinations, strangulation, smoke inhalation, electrocution, hanging, drowning, etc.] 2. Toxicological etiology (e.g., inhalation of toxic substances, drugs, etc.) 3. Known or suspected pregnancy 4. Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate (DNAR) order in force 5. Ward of the state or prisoner 6. Anatomy, previous surgery or disease state contraindicating femoral venous access 7. Received neuromuscular blocking agents or central nervous system sedatives whose effects have not worn off prior to assessing level of consciousness following ROSC 8. Hypothermia initiated at a transferring facility prior to arrival at the enrolling hospital (excludes prehospital IV fluids or cold packs for cooling by EMS) 9. Current Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter 10. Known history of acute neurological illness or severe functional disabilities prior to arrest (e.g., seizures, traumatic brain injury, increased intracranial pressures, intracerebral hemorrhage, etc.) 11. Known heparin allergy 12. Known allergy to any adjunctive pharmacologic agent required for induction or maintenance of therapeutic hypothermia 13. Known history of bleeding or blood disorders such as coagulopathy, cryoglobulinemia, sickle cell or thrombocytopenia with a platelet count below 40,000. 14. Known hypersensitivity to hypothermia including a history of Raynaud's disease 15. Evidence of intracranial bleed 16. Terminal illness or life expectancy of less than 3 months prior to arrest 17. Currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with this trial's endpoints Note: For the purpose of this protocol, subjects involved in extended followup trials for products that were investigational but are currently commercially available are not considered enrolled in an investigational trial.</criteria>
