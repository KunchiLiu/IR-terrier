	<brief_summary>Pulmonary phage therapy to treat bacterial infections of the respiratory tract have been investigated in animals. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of bacteriophages in infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) strains present in sputum samples. A cocktail of 10 bacteriophages will be applied on 60 sputum samples obtained from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients during 6 hours.We will determine the bacteria and bacteriophages strains in sputum samples collected. Then the sensitivity of individual colony will be tested.</brief_summary>
