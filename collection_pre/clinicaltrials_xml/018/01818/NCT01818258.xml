	<brief_summary>HIV-infected children from sub-Saharan Africa often present with severe malnutrition. In severe malnutrition, metabolic and/or gut structural derangement may lead to inadequate antiretroviral (ARV) absorption and/or erratic drug levels. The greater surface area to weight ratio in severely malnourished children could also place them at higher risk of under dosing compared to children with mild to moderate malnutrition. However, limited data are available on the pharmacokinetics of ARVs in severely malnourished children. This study will address this critical gap in knowledge by evaluating the PK of zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in severely malnourished children, compared to children with normal nutrition to mild malnutrition.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥6 to &lt;36 months at entry 2. Documentation of HIV1 infection defined as positive results from two samples collected at different time points, using protocolspecified tests 3. Meets WHO classification for severe malnutrition, normal nutrition status, or mild malnutrition 4. Eligible for HAART 5. Parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide signed informed consent, remain within the study area during the study period and agree to have subject followed at the clinical site 6. Qualifying hematology and chemistry laboratory values obtained from specimens collected within the studyspecific screening period 7. For severely malnourished children: An inpatient in a nutrition rehabilitation unit. Clinical improvement after 1018 days on nutrition rehabilitation defined as: Appetite returned and eating better child shows interest in food even if does not complete amount given: No further weight loss Normalized sodium and potassium defined as severity grade 1 or lower No evidence of cardiac failure Loss of apathy and starting to play No hypothermia or pyrexia temperature stable at &gt;35.0 to &lt;38.0° C (nonaxillary) or &gt;34.4 to &lt;37.4° C (axillary) For children with normal mild malnutrition, clinical stability will be indicated by: Good appetite Normalized sodium and potassium defined as severity grade 1 or lower No hypothermia or pyrexia temperature stable at &gt;35.0 to &lt;38.0° C (nonaxillary) or &gt;34.4 to &lt;37.4° C (axillary) 1. Edematous malnutrition at the time of study entry 2. ≥ Grade 3 respiratory distress or presence of cardio respiratory compromise within 3 days prior to entry 3. Chemotherapy for malignancy 4. Acute infection for which the child has received appropriate antimicrobial treatment for &lt;5 days 5. Tuberculosis disease 6. Clinic hepatitis as evidenced by jaundice and hepatomegaly 7. Taking any disallowed medications 8. Any condition, situation, or clinical finding that in the opinion of the investigator would place the child at an unacceptable level of risk for injury, or render the child/caregiver(s) unable to meet the requirements of the study, interfere with study participation, or in the interpretation of study results.</criteria>
