	<brief_summary>Patients with hyperuricemia were confirmed to have higher risks of cardiovascular disease, but the exact mechanism remained to be elucidated. Many connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are often associated with antiphospholipid antibodies-associated endothelial impairment. In the present study, the investigators will analyze the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the serum of the patients with gout/asymptomatic hyperuricemia, with a comparison to the patients of osteoarthritis but without hyperuricemia and gout. The investigators expect to find a correlation between these pathogenic antibody and those cardiovascular co-morbidities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with hyperuricemia were confirmed to have higher risks of cardiovascular disease, but the exact mechanism remained to be elucidated.
