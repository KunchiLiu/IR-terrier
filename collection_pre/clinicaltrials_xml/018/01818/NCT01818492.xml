	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a new drug aimed at controlling disease activity in patients diagnosed with primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The new drug can be administered as the first-line therapy, to patients not previously treated with the current standard of care, or can be given to patients who have either failed or were unable to tolerate the current standard of care. Administration will be on top of a glucocorticosteroid, which is usually part of the current recommended treatment.</brief_summary>
