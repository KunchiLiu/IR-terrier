	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to investigate the safety of T4 immunotherapy when administered to treat loco-regional disease in Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) that is not suitable for conventional active therapy. The investigators propose to conduct an open-labelled, non-randomized, dose-escalation phase I trial in which autologous T4+ T-cells are administered to patients with SCCHN. T-cells will be engineered to express a second generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) named T1E28z. Engineered T-cells will be injected directly into the tumour site. Patients will not be lymphodepleted. A classical 3+3 design will be employed, with dose escalation from 10^7 through to 10^9 transduced T4+ T-cells, dependent upon toxicity monitoring. It is anticipated that up to 30 patients will be enrolled over the course of the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologically and/ or cytologically confirmed SCCHN. 2. 18 years or older. 3. Locally advanced and/ or recurrent head and neck cancer with or without metastatic disease (excluding brain metastases) for whom no standard therapy remains or is suitable. 4. Regarding previous treatment, patients may have received prior systemic therapy, including platinum chemotherapy, at least one month earlier. In the presence of metastatic disease, recent shortcourse palliative radiotherapy to nontarget site(s) is allowed. 5. Those who refuse palliative treatment may be eligible for participation. However, their reasons for not opting for palliative treatment must be explored thoroughly. 6. At least one locoregional target lesion measurable by RECIST v1.1 criteria on CT or MRI scanning within four weeks of enrolment, and amenable to intratumoral injection. 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance Status of 02. 8. Normal cardiac function as assessed by electrocardiography and either echocardiography (ECHO), or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scanning. Left ventricular ejection fraction must be &gt; 50%. Assessment must take place within four weeks of enrolment. 9. Haematology results within seven days of enrolment: neutrophils &gt;1.5 x 109/L, platelets &gt;100 x 109/L, haemoglobin &gt;9g/dl, INR &lt;1.5. 10. Biochemistry results within seven days of enrolment: • serum creatinine &lt;1.5 upper limit of normal • bilirubin &lt;1.25 times normal; • ALT/ AST &lt;2.5 times upper limit of normal (&lt;5 times upper limit of normal if liver metastases present) 11. Female patients must be postmenopausal (12 months of amenorrhea), surgically sterile or they must agree to use a physical method of contraception. Oral or injectable contraceptive agents cannot be the sole method of contraception. Women of childbearing potential (WOCB) who receive cyclophosphamide must adhere to these contraceptive requirements during the trial and until 3 months after the last dose of cyclophosphamide. Male patients, even if sterilized, must agree to use a barrier method of contraception. Male subjects must also commit to use a barrier method of contraception until at least 3 months after the end of study treatment. 12. Written informed consent prior to registration. 13. Eligible for NHS care in the UK. 1. The presence of or imminent occurrence of airway obstruction, unless tracheostomy in place. 2. The presence of or imminent occurrence of tumourmediated infiltration of major blood vessels. 3. Positive history of HIV1, HIV2, HTLV1, HTLV2, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or syphilis infection. 4. Prior splenectomy. 5. Clinically active autoimmune disease. Subclinical or quiescent autoimmune disease does not exclude from participation. 6. Treatment in the preceding week with systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 20mg prednisolone/ day), any systemic immunomodulatory agent, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or investigational medicinal product. 7. Concurrent use of anticoagulant therapy is not permissible. 8. The presence of major comorbidity likely to impair ability to undergo trial therapy, such as recent myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure or uncontrolled hypertension. 9. The presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule. 10. Cyclophosphamide allergy (Cohort 6 only). 11. Pregnancy. 12. Breastfeeding. 13. Prior T4 immunotherapy.</criteria>
