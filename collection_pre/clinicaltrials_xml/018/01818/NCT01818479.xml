	<brief_summary>Open label, dose finding trial with two treatment arms ( high-TBI and low-TBI conditioning regimens) to assess the efficacy of Treg/Tcon addback to CD34 selected partially matched related donor stem cells. The maximum tolerated dose will be established using 3 patients per dose level and there will be an expansion cohort at the MTD.</brief_summary>

Relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation with evidence of responsive disease. 9b. Patient with chemosensitive relapse who have no option for autologous stem cell transplantation due to blood or marrow involvement or failure to mobilize autologous stem cells or are not considered eligible for autologous transplant by their treating physician. 9c. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: relapse after autologous HCT, chemorefractory disease 10. No suitable HLAidentical sibling donor. 11. No identified 8/8 (based upon A, B, C, DRB1 loci) allele matched unrelated donor, or unable to wait sufficient time to procure a 8/8 allele matched unrelated donor 12.
