	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: the Telaprevir(TVR) plasma levels (750 mg q8h or 1125 mg/12h )will not be affected when co-administered with un-boosted Atazanavir (ATV) 200 mg q12h plus two analogues (NRTIs) in HCV/HIV-co-infected patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Interactions Between Telaprevir and Un-boosted Atazanavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives 1. Primary Outcome Measures: evaluate the changes in the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Cmin, AUC, t 1/2, and Cl) of Telaprevir (TVR) administered at 750 mg/8h together with un-boosted Atazanavir (200 mg/12h), taking as reference the pharmacokinetic parameters observed when TVR is administered with Atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg/day) 2. To assess the changes in the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of Atazanavir administered as 200 mg/12h with respect to its administration as 300/100 mg/day when administered together with TVR (750 mg/8h or 1125 mh/12h). Method: open labelled clinical trial with a planned duration of 24 weeks in which 14 HIV/Hepatitis C virus genotype 1 patients under treatment with pegylated α-interferon, Ribavirin and Telaprevir will be enrolled. A 24 hours pharmacokinetic profile will be obtained after a supervised drug intake while taking TVR and ATV/rtv. Afterwards, the patients will take un-boosted ATV 200 mg bid for 7 - 10 days. Subsequently, a new pharmacokinetic profile will be obtained.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients over 18 years old coinfected with HIV and genotype 1 HCV under treatment with pegylated αinterferon, Ribavirin and Telaprevir according to the recommendations of the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Health Products. Informed consent of the patient. The usual exclusion criteria in clinical practice to start the treatment with these drugs (pegylated αinterferon, Ribavirin, Telaprevir and atazanavir) according to the Spanish and international recommendations (Spanish Agency of Medicines and Health Products,European Association for the Study of the Liver Clinical Practice Guidelines: management of hepatitis C virus infection. J Hepatol. 2011. Consensus Document of Gesida/Spanish Plan on Aids regarding the antiretroviral treatment in adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus [Updated January 2012]). Concomitant use of drugs or medicinal products that could alter the pharmacokinetics of TVR or ATV. Medical records suggesting malabsorption or presence of diarrhea (&gt;3 depositions/day) that could interfere with the absorption of the studied drugs.</criteria>
