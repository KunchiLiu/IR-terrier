	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Trial to Evaluate the Hydrus(TM) Implant in Subjects Undergoing Cataract Surgery.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a post-market, prospective, single-masked, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial comparing Cataract Extraction (CE) surgery + Hydrus Implant vs CE surgery alone for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with a positive diagnosis for open angle glaucoma (POAG) or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma. Eligible patients will be scheduled for cataract surgery. At the time of the procedure, qualified subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups: Hydrus Implant with cataract surgery or cataract surgery alone. Post-operative follow up will be conducted at regular intervals.</detailed_description>
