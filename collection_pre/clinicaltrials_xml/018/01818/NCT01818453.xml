	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to determine whether genetic information can be used to predict response to an internet-based treatment of depression. Several studies now indicate that completing an internet-based treatment for depression, called Deprexis, can significantly improve symptoms of depression. However, not everyone improves. The purpose of this study is to determine whether genetic profile can predict who is likely to improve.</brief_summary>
