	<brief_summary>Revascularization strategies for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) study (ASSIST-CMR) will compare the effects of two revascularization strategies [same sitting multivessel primary PCI (SS-PCI) and culprit vessel only primary PCI (IRA-PCI)] on myocardial infarct size (MIS) as determined by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in patients presenting with STEMI and multivessel disease (MVD).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>High risk ST elevation myocardial infarction evidenced by: ≥2 mm ST elevation in 2 anterior or lateral leads; or ≥2 mm ST elevation in 2 inferior coupled with ST depression in 2 contiguous anterior leads for a total ST deviation of ≥8 mm; or New left bundle branch block with at least 1 mm concordant ST elevation. Multivessel CAD as evidenced by ≥1 significant (≥70% by visual assessment or FFR&lt;0.80 for 5070% stenosis) stenosis in nonIRA. Successful IRAPCI with &lt;10% residual angiographic stenosis and TIMI III flow. Written informed consent. Age ≤ 18 years. Prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Administration of thrombolytic therapy. NonIRA stenosis is a chronic total occlusion or located in left main artery. Hemodynamic instability evidenced by BP&lt;90 mmHg, Killip class ≥2, need for inotropes/vasopressors. Known renal insufficiency (estimated GFR &lt; 50ml/min). Contraindication to CMR.</criteria>
