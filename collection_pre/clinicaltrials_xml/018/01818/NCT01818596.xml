	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, multi-cohort study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Genvoya®; E/C/F/TAF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HIV-positive, adult participants with mild to moderate renal impairment. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of E/C/F/TAF on renal parameters at Week 24. The proportion of subjects achieving virologic response of HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL will also be assessed. At sites able to conduct the appropriate testing, approximately 30 participants will be enrolled into an intensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) substudy to evaluate the PK/PD parameters of the individual components of E/C/F/TAF as well as tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Cohort 1 (treatmentexperienced switch) Must not have a history of known resistance to elvitegravir (EVG), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), or emtricitabine (FTC) Plasma HIV1 RNA concentrations (at least two measurements) at undetectable levels (according to the local assay being used) in the 6 months preceding the screening visit and have HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at screening Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 3069 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula for creatinine clearance, using actual weight May be currently enrolled in Gilead studies GSUS2360102, GSUS2360103, and GSUS2160114, but will be eligible to enroll only after the Week 144 visit for that study is complete; or currently receiving Stribild® (STB) or atazanavir (ATV)/cobicistat (COBI) + Truvada (TVD) in Gilead studies GSUS2360104 or GSUS2160105, but will be eligible to enroll only after the Week 48 visit for that study is complete. Cohort 2 (treatmentnaive) Plasma HIV1 RNA levels ≥ 1,000 copies/mL at screening Screening genotype report provided by Gilead Sciences must show sensitivity to EVG, FTC, and TDF No prior use of any approved or investigational antiretroviral drug for any length of time, except the use for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), or postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), up to 6 months prior to screening Estimated GFR 3069 mL/min according to the Cockcroft Gault formula for creatinine clearance, using actual weight All Cohorts: All subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study: The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures CD4+ count of ≥ 50 cells/μL Stable renal function: serum creatinine measurements to be taken at least once (within three months of screening) Cause of underlying chronic kidney disease (eg hypertension, diabetes) stable, without change in medical management, for 3 months prior to baseline Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin Adequate hematologic function Serum amylase ≤ 5 x ULN Females of childbearing potential must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods (two separate forms of contraception, one of which must be an effective barrier method, or be nonheterosexually active, practice sexual abstinence) from screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug Female subjects who utilize hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing Male subjects must agree to utilize a highly effective method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse throughout the study period and for 30 days following discontinuation of investigational medicinal product. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as two separate forms of contraception, one of which must be an effective barrier method, or male subjects must be nonheterosexually active, or practice sexual abstinence Age ≥ 18 years Key A new AIDSdefining condition (excluding CD4 cell count and percentage criteria) diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening,with the exception of the first two bullet points Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive. Subjects who are HCV positive, but have a documented negative HCV RNA, are eligible Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBVsAg) positive Subjects receiving drug treatment for Hepatitis C, or subjects who are anticipated to receive treatment for Hepatitis C during the course of the study Subjects experiencing decompensated cirrhosis (eg, ascites, encephalopathy, etc.) Females who are breastfeeding Positive serum pregnancy test Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker Current alcohol or substance use judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with subject study compliance A history of malignancy within the past 5 years or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to baseline Subjects on hemodialysis, other forms of renal replacement therapy, or on treatment for underlying kidney diseases (including prednisolone and dexamethasone) Subjects receiving ongoing therapy with any medications not to be used with EVG, COBI, FTC, or TAF or subjects with any known allergies to the excipients of E/C/F/TAF Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
