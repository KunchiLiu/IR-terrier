	<brief_summary>Based on the study about carbon monoxide in human inflammatory and other beneficial physiological function , now we'll be going to research its application in neonates .Phase 1 Study as a foundation for the further test is, the safety and Adverse reaction study of newborn to inhaled CO</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Adverse Reaction Study of Neonatal to Inhaled Carbon Monoxide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have demonstrated that, carbon monoxide has showed the effectiveness such as in inflammation ,apoptosis as well as relaxation of smooth muscle of the body. Now we have a hypothesis to use carbon monoxide in pulmonary hypertension of the newborns, to observe whether it will decrease pulmonary artery hypertension on newborns. Phase 1 study is ,the safety and Adverse reaction study of newborn to inhaled CO , after this,we can master the application of carbon monoxide dose</detailed_description>
