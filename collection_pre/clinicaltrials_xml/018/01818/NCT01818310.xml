	<brief_summary>The aim of the presented clinical trial is to evaluate a hypothesis, that BMAC prepared from bone marrow aspirate and injected intramuscularly into ischemic areas of the lower extremity in patients with diabetes mellitus type II., intraarterially into the defect of the limb or with an intravenous application only, has a greater potential to improve the perfusion in the ischemic limbs than standard treatment of NO-CLI. Another aim of the study is to find out differences among three different therapeutic types of BMAC application, to define their effectiveness and safety and to compare the impact of different means of application to the speed of healing of the limb defects and the improvement of perfusion parameters.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary hypothesis assumes, that the intravenous application of BMAC in patients with T2DM older than 30 years of age, with a dose of insulin exceeding 0.7 U/kg/day or 50U/day will result in decreasing the insulin dose in the course of 6-month follow-up and in an improvement of the glycHBA1c levels, improvement of the liver and kidney function, decrease of the cholesterol levels and improvement of the immune response parameters, i.e. parameters of lymphocytar blastic transformation, more than in case of patients with intramuscular or intraarterial application of BMAC.</detailed_description>
