	<criteria>Main diagnosis: aplastic anemia Absence of severe and/or uncontrolled comorbidities Confirmed iron overload (serum ferritin ≥ 1000 mkg/L) Serum creatinine is not higher than the upper limit of normal for the given age Absence of severe proteinuria. Protein/Creatinine ratio should be &lt; 0.5 mg/mg Liver enzymes are &lt; 5 ULN Completion of a scheduled cycle of immunosuppressive treatment program, with no severe infectious or generalized hemorrhagic complications WHO (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 No signed informed consent form Patient is under 18 years old Severe concomitant condition Severe infectious and generalized haemorrhagic complication following regular planned cycle of programmed immune suppressive treatment. History of increased sensitivity to active substance and any other ingredient of the medicinal product. Creatinine clearance (CC) &lt; 60 ml/min and/or creatinine concentration in blood serum is 2 or more times higher than upper limit of age normal by results of 2 tests at Visits 1 and 2. Severe liver disorders (class C by ChildPugh scale). Patients with aplastic anaemia in which chelator treatment will be ineffective due to rapid progression of the disease. Significant proteinuria basing on protein creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0 mg/ml in urine sample from second urination at Visits 1 and 2 (or as an alternative in 2 of 3 urine samples at screening); Rare hereditary disorders related to galactose intolerance, severe deficit of lactase or glucosegalactose malabsorption; Pregnancy, lactation; Level of liver enzymes higher than 5 upper limits of age normal at Visits 1 and 2.</criteria>
