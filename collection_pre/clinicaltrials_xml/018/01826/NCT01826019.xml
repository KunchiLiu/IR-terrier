	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the HOPE-4 Phases (HT and CVD) is to develop, implement and evaluate an evidence-based, contextually appropriate programme for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment, treatment and control involving: (1) simplified algorithms implemented by non-physician health workers (NPHW) and supported by e-health technologies (tablets programmed with decision and counselling support software); (2) initiation of evidence-based cardiovascular (CV) medications and (3) treatment supporters to optimize long-term medication and lifestyle adherence.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design: open-label, parallel cluster randomized controlled trial design. HT Phase: at least 50 urban and rural communities in Canada, Colombia and Malaysia will be randomized to participate in an intensive CV risk detection and control program by NPHW or to care as usual for 12 months. CVD Phase: Continuation and expansion of HT Phase to include at least 190 urban and rural communities in countries within Asia, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Canada that will be allocated to participate in an intensive CV risk detection and control programme supported by NPHWs or to care as usual for up to 6 years. Communities will be randomized 1:1 with a central randomization system to either a) intervention or b) control, after screening in the community is complete.</detailed_description>
