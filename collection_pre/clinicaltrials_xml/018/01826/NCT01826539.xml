	<brief_summary>As the donor nerve attached with the flap, the dorsal branch of the digital nerve and the dorsal digital nerve is commonly used for finger pulp reconstruction.This study compares two donor nerves: the dorsal branch of the digital nerve and the dorsal digital nerve.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Dorsal Branch of the Digital Nerve Versus Dorsal Digital Nerve for Finger Pulp Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators compares two donor nerves attached with the flap for sensory reconstruction of finger pulp: the dorsal branch of the digital nerve and the dorsal digital nerve. The main outcomes were static 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of the flap, and pain and cold intorlence of the reconstructed finger.</detailed_description>
