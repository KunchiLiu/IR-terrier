	<brief_summary>Postoperative airway clearance and recovery of pulmonary function after lung resection is critical in patients undergoing pulmonary resection surgery. The investigators hypothesized that vibratory positive expiratory pressure using the Acapella device may improve pulmonary function recovery in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lung resection surgery.</brief_summary>
