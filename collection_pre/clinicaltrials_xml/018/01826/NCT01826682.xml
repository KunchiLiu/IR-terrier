	<detailed_description>The benefits added to the respiratory physiotherapy and physical activity have been evidenced previously in the treatment of COPD. This justify the need of a short physiotherapy intervention program regarding to the hospital stay in exacerbation of COPD and a follow-up after the hospital stay. 4% of europeans have been reported to have medical intervention caused by respiratory exacerbation. 20% of these patients are patients with COPD. The mortality of COPD exacerbation is about 14% and 30% if mechanical ventilation is needed. In order to that, it is very important to improve the quality of life and the recuperation of patients. It is relevant to mention the the high cost associated to this condition.</detailed_description>
