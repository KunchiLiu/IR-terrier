	<brief_title>The Effects of JNJ-42165279 on the Neural Basis of Anxiety Disorders in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single site, double-blind (neither investigator nor the participant knows the treatment that the participant receives) study. The study will consist of a screening phase (1-2 visits), a treatment phase (4 visits), and a post treatment phase (follow-up safety visit, 7 to 14 days after the last dose of the study drug). During the screening phase, participants will be evaluated to determine if they meet the study eligibility criteria, which will include collection of blood and urine samples. During the treatment phase, eligible participants will be assigned by chance (like a toss of a coin) to receive either JNJ-42165279 100 mg or placebo once daily during 4 consecutive visits to the clinic. Placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect. The potential of the drug to treat anxiety will be assessed on Day 4 of the treatment phase. The primary assessment, Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (BOLD-fMRI), will measure brain activity patterns while participants complete 3 emotionally-provoking tasks. Additionally, participants' startle responses (eye blinks) will be evaluated in two emotionally-provoking behavioral tasks outside of the scanner. Questionnaires will be completed to evaluate participants' mood, and blood samples will be collected to measure concentrations of JNJ-42165279 and biomarkers of drug activity. Safety will be monitored throughout the study, including adverse events, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), 12-lead ECGs, physical examinations, clinical safety laboratories, evaluation of suicidal risk, and a Walk and Turn test. The total study duration will be approximately 46 days.</detailed_description>
