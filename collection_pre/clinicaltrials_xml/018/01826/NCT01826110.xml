	<brief_title>PET Imaging Study Using [11C]PIB in Subjects With AD &amp; Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the study are: 1. To perform PET scans with [11C]PIB to use for direct (i.e., same-subjects) comparison of [11C]PIB and [18F]AV-45 2. To establish the most effective and reliable PET imaging method to detect amyloid deposition in AD, in order to understand disease progression and subsequently evaluate treatment effects. 3. To ascertain a PET imaging method that will minimize discomfort for subjects, thus increasing the potential for clinical follow-up scans, by reducing the patient burden and potential cost of future PET examinations. A separate protocol/study will be conducted using [18F] AV-45. Participants who enroll in this protocol using [11C] PIB will be consented to participate in the [18F] AV-45 (IRB # NA_00033155) protocol/study as it is a mandatory requirement that participants participate in both protocols.Up to 20 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease and 10 healthy volunteers will participate in this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects at least 18 years of age Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator based on medical history and physical exam can tolerate the PET scan procedures Have clinically significant hepatic, renal, pulmonary, metabolic, or endocrine disturbances Have current clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the last year, or prior prolonged history of abuse Have a clinically significant infectious disease, including Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection or previous positive test for hepatitis Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant (negative urine betahCG at the time of screening and negative urine betahCG on the day of imaging) or lactating at screening or at day of imaging Have a history of relevant severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity (Relevant severe drug allergies should be determined by the PI, and any questions about a subject's eligibility can be directed to Avid. If a subject has a history of severe drug allergies, it may be dangerous for them to participate in a study with a novel compound Have received an investigational medication within the last 30 days. Current clinically significant or unstable medical comorbidities, as indicated by history or physical exam Have received a radiopharmaceutical for imaging or therapy within the past 7 days prior to the imaging session for this study Body weight &gt; 300 pounds History of significant radiation exposure Participants with pacemakers, implanted electronic hearing devices, aneurysm clips, shrapnel, unallowed prosthetic or other metallic device in their bodies Preexisting CNS disease (other than dementia), endocrine, or severe cardiovascular disease (MI, CABG, angioplasty)</criteria>
