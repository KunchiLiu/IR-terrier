	<brief_summary>The objective is to test the hypothesis that luteal phase support with vaginal progesterone leads to a higher clinical pregnancy rate (primary outcome) and live birth rate (secondary outcome) when compared to no luteal phase support in a program of intrauterine insemination (IUI) after controlled ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins. Additionally, the length of the luteal phase will be recorded (secondary outcome) in order to detect luteal phase defects/insufficiencies in the absence of luteal phase suppletion as well as luteal phase prolongation in case of luteal phase support which may be a burden for the patients waiting for the outcome of the treatment.</brief_summary>
