	<brief_title>Chest Wall Muscle Stretching and Acute Effects in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial involving patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease evaluated before and immediately after a program of stretching muscles of the rib cage or after resting with time similar to the intervention, as volume variation of thoracoabdominal wall by optoelectronic plethysmography and on the electromyographic activity of accessory muscles of respiration.</detailed_description>
