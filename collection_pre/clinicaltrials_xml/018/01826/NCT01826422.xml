	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the supplement with docosahexaenoic fatty acid and eicosapentaenoic fatty acid for six months in the inflammation states as well as the process of muscular regeneration and the metabolic disorders like obesity and insulin resistance on patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMB) compared to those receiving placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of EPA and DHA in the Inflammation and Metabolic Disorders in DMD/DMB Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DMD and DMB are X-linked diseases caused by mutations in the DMD gene, these mutations have important functional and structural consequences in skeletal muscle. In muscle fiber is observed inflammation and necrosis as a result of lost regenerative capacity. The muscle fibers can be replaced by connective and adipose tissue. In a previous study the investigators identified that 50% of Duchenne and Becker patients in the range of thirteen years old have obesity. In addition, these patients (N=66) have hyperinsulinemia (53.7%) and insulin resistance (48.5%). It is well known that obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance have a inflammatory background. It has been demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic fatty acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and have beneficial effects on obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in children and adolescents. Objective: Determine the effect of EPA and DHA on inflammation, obesity and insulin resistance in patients with DMD/DMB compared to those receiving placebo.</detailed_description>
