	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate potential metabolic effects of resveratrol in morbidly obese women undergoing gastric bypass surgery. The investigators hypothesize that resveratrol will: - Decrease hepatic very-low-density-lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG) secretion - Decrease hepatic and adipose tissue VLDL-TG uptake - Increase insulin sensitivity The investigators will look at changes in: - Lipid turnover (VLDL-TG kinetics, palmitate kinetics,calorimetry) - VLDL-TG uptake in different tissues (subcutaneous femoral adipose tissue, subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue and liver tissue) - Insulin sensitivity (glucose kinetics during hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp) - Regulation of liver fat handling - Lipoprotein lipase activity and fat cell size (abdominal and femoral adipose tissue)</brief_summary>
