	<brief_summary>Fluid expansion during cardiocirculatory insufficiency was helped by cardiac output monitoring. However, the goal of fluid expansion was to increase the oxygen delivery, which consider cardiac output, but also Haemoglobin which decrease during a fluid challenge. The maximalization of cardiac output could decrease the oxygen delivery if the haemodilution was too wide. The aim of this study was to describe the oxygen delivery during a fluid expansion conducted for cardiac output maximalization, following actual guidelines.</brief_summary>
