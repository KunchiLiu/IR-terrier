	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of an investigational new drug called PLX3397 when used in combination with Vemurafenib (Zelboraf™) at different dose levels. Vemurafenib has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of a specific category of unresectable or metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Open Label, Dose Escalation Study of PLX3397 in Combination With Vemurafenib in V600-mutated BRAF Melanoma</brief_title>

	<mesh_term>Melanoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or female ≥18 years old. Patients with histologically confirmed unresectable Stage III or Stage IV metastatic melanoma who have not been previously treated with a selective BRAF inhibitor. Presence of a BRAF V600 mutation in the tumor tissue using the cobas BRAF mutation assay or comparable standard of care methodology. Measurable disease per RECIST v. 1.1 criteria. ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Radiation therapy within 14 days of C1D1. Investigational drug use within 28 days of C1D1. Patients with active CNS lesions are excluded (i.e., those with radiographically unstable, symptomatic lesions). However, patients treated with stereotactic therapy or surgery are eligible if they remain without evidence of disease progression in the brain for ≥3 weeks.</criteria>
