	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators intend to determine the impact of fractional CO2 laser treatment on the edges of a fresh wound during surgical area closure on thin skin (e.g. face, hands, arms, thorax, etc.) and on thick skin (abdominoplasty procedure) on scar formation. The investigators will also evaluate the effect of shallow fractional laser treatment versus deep parameters settings. If effective treatments could be performed at time of surgery, this would result in both time and cost saving to the patient and to the healthcare system and will improve patient's self-image post surgeries.</brief_summary>

History of or the presence of any skin condition/disease that might interfere with the diagnosis or evaluation of study parameters (i.e., atopic dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis) Treatment with a systemic retinoid within the past year (e.g., AccutaneÂ®, Roche Dermatologics) History or presenting with a keloid scar Any current or recent treatment for cancer, unless the surgical procedure of issue is for cancer treatment purposes. Any uncontrolled systemic disease. A potential subject in whom therapy for a systemic disease is not yet stabilized will not be considered for entry into the study Significant history or current evidence of a medical, psychological or other disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude enrollment into the study. Subject planning any other cosmetic procedure to the study area during the study period, other than the treatments that will be performed by the investigator Female subject who is pregnant, nursing an infant or is less than 6 months after termination of breast feeding Small surgical closure (&lt;4cm)</criteria>
