	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and user preference of the Newport AutoSet for Her in female obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Efficacy will be evaluated by comparing the apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) of the Newport AutoSet for Her algorithm to a standard algorithm. User preference will be evaluated by subjective feedback relating to comfort, ease of falling asleep, sleep disturbance and feeling of being refreshed.</brief_summary>
