	<brief_title>Propofol Effects on Mitral Valve Annular Velocity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of different concentration of propofol on patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery. The patients will receive infusion remifentanil 0.5mcg/kg/min with different target-site propofol concentration namely 1.0ng/ml, 2.0ng/ml and 3.0ng/ml. Tissue Doppler Imaging by transesophageal echocardiography will be done to assess the changes in cardiac function.</detailed_description>
