	<brief_summary>The purpose of this multicenter, randomized, open label, parallel arm study whether the newest 3rd generation stent - Orsiro hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent is noninferior to the newest 2nd generation stent - Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent in terms of 9 months in-stent late lumen loss. 345 Korean patients with a wide variety of coronary heart disease will be enrolled to this "all-comers" trial to give definite answer to the above hypothesis that is urgently needed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Angiographic Result of the Orsiro Hybrid Stent With Resolute Integrity Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rate of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has dramatically decreased since the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES). However, restenosis still remains a problem and some papers reported that the rate of restenosis can even go up to nearly 20% after the first-generation DES implantation, depending on the complexity of target lesion. Furthermore, there arises a concern about thrombogenic risk of these DES at the expense of reduced restenosis. Therefore, works aiming to reduce both restenosis and thrombosis are on-going, and there has been a rush of various second-generation DES with "biocompatible but non-absorbable polymer" and third-generation DES with "bioabsorbable polymer". Recently, Orsiro hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent (Orsiro SES, Biotronik AG, Bulach, Switzeland) has been developed. It has a unique hybrid combination of polymers coated on thin cobalt-chromium struts (60um). The BIOlute® active component is a bioabsorbable polymer matrix combined with an anti-proliferative drug, sirolimus, and elutes the drug in a controlled manner after implantation, degrades over time and leaves only the PROBIO® coated stent behind in the long-term. The PROBIO® passive coating encapsulates the stent and protects interaction between the metal stent and the surrounding tissue. Although Orsiro SES showed excellent results in terms of late lumen loss at 9 months in first-in-man single arm trial (BIOFLOW-I trial), randomized controlled trials evaluating its efficacy and safety are limited to date. The ORIENT Trial will evaluate the angiographic and clinical outcomes of the innovative third-generation DES, Orsiro SES, compared with the latest second-generation DES, Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES-I, Medtronic Cardiovascular, Santa Rosa, California, USA), for treatment of patients with coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must be at least 18 years of age. Subject is able to verbally confirm understandings of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives of receiving the Orsiro Hybrid DES® or Endeavor Resolute Integrity® stent. He/she or his/her legally authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any study related procedure. Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, recent infarction, silent ischemia, positive functional study or a reversible changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with ischemia) with a coronary artery or graft vessel lesion with &gt;50% stenosis by visual estimation or &gt;70% stenosis irrespective of the functional status. Target lesion(s) must be located in a coronary artery with estimated reference diameter of ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 5.0 mm. Target lesion(s) must be amenable for PCI. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following medications: Heparin, Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Sirolimus, Zotarolimus, Cobalt chromium, Contrast media (Patients with documented sensitivity to contrast media which can be effectively premedicated with steroids and diphenhydramine [e.g. rash] may be enrolled. Those with true anaphylaxis to prior contrast media, however, should not be enrolled.) Patients who cannot maintain aspirin, plavix from the study enrollment to study completion (during 1 year). Systemic (intravenous) Sirolimus or Zotarolimus use within 12 months. Female of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative, who possibly plan to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study. History of bleeding diathesis or known coagulopathy (including heparininduced thrombocytopenia), or refuses blood transfusions. Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the prior 3 months, or major surgery within 2 months. Planned major noncardiac surgery within the study period. Patients in cardiogenic shock Patients with symptomatic heart failure that preclude coronary angiography in supine position. Noncardiac comorbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that may result in protocol noncompliance (per site investigator's medical judgment). Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational study, which have not completed the primary endpoint followup period.</criteria>
