	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether the successful perinatal depression intervention among mothers (Thinking Healthy Programme, THP) has led to improved developmental outcomes in the children 6 years later. Economic and human resources aspects of the intervention will also be evaluated to determine overall societal benefits from investment in such a program, feasibility of scaling up the intervention and its sustainability in the long-term. The primary hypothesis is that children of mothers who participated in the THP will have better cognitive outcomes and socio-emotional functioning when compared to children of mothers randomized to the control group.</brief_summary>
