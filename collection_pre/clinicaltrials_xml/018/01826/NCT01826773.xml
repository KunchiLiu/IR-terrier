	<brief_summary>The study is designed to evaluate how safe and how well an investigational imaging product CardioPET™ performs as compared to standard approved imaging products in assessing the function of heart muscle in coronary artery disease patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CardioPET as PET Imaging Agent to Assess Myocardial Perfusion and Fatty Acid Uptake in Known or Suspected CAD Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The open label, phase II, multi center, study objectives are as follows: - To evaluate the diagnostic performance of CardioPET™ in assessing myocardial perfusion as compared to standard Tc-99m myocardial perfusion agents with coronary angiography as the standard of reference for CAD. - To evaluate the safety of CardioPET™ in known or suspected CAD subjects. - A secondary objective is to assess fatty acid uptake at rest and following stress.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedures; Male and female subjects over 30 years of age with known or suspected CAD; Subjects have been evaluated as having known or suspected CAD by either exercise or pharmacologic MPI or echocardiography with ≥2 segments of ischemia and have been referred to coronary angiography for known or suspected CAD; Subjects must be able to complete all evaluations within 30 days of Tc99m MPI imaging, and must be without any intervention or change in symptoms between the tests. Past or present use of medications that target fatty acid uptake or metabolism, e.g. Ranexa® (Ranolazine); Acute changes in comparison to most recent ECG; Suspected acute coronary syndrome; Chronic renal failure (Cr &gt; 2.5); Anemia (Hgb &lt; 10 within past 2 weeks); NYHA Class III or IV Congestive heart failure; Severe heart valve disease; Any exposure to any investigational drugs or devices, within 30 days prior to imaging study; Any acute or unstable physical or psychological disease judged by the Investigators based on medical history or screening physical examination; Female subjects only: Subject that has a positive pregnancy test or is lactating or the possibility of pregnancy cannot be ruled out prior to dosing. Females not of childbearing potential require confirmatory documentation in their medical records or must have a negative pregnancy test within 4 hours prior to receiving the test drug and agree to use an acceptable form of birth control for at least 30 days following CardioPET™ administration. Male subjects: Reliable contraception method from the first injection with the tracer until 3 months after the last injection with the tracer. The following contraceptive method(s) is (are) allowed during the study: Condom. If your partner becomes pregnant during the study, you should immediately report this to the investigator.</criteria>
