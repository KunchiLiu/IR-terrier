	<brief_summary>This study using pembrolizumab (MK-3475) will be done in 5 parts. In Part A, successive participant cohorts with advanced solid tumors will receive pembrolizumab to assess the safety and tolerability of monotherapy. In Parts B, C, and D, participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will receive pembrolizumab in combination with either cisplatin/pemetrexed or carboplatin/pemetrexed (Part B); with either carboplatin/paclitaxel or carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel (Part C); or with ipilimumab (Part D) by non-random assignment to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy. In Part E, participants untreated Extensive-disease (ED) Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) will receive pembrolizumab in combination with either cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/etoposide by non-random assignment to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy.</brief_summary>
