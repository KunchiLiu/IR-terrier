	<brief_summary>The stress of orthotopic living donor liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis could induce worsening of an already recorded myocardial dysfunction or may be associated with a new myocardial dysfunction in patients previously having normal myocardial functions, therefore this study will be designed for intra-operative detection of new onset ventricular dysfunction or worsening of already diagnosed ventricular dysfunction in living donor liver transplant recipient and the possible contribution of several hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters in the generation of any cardiovascular function impairment will be also investigated and to determine the impact of ventricular dysfunction on early (7 PO days) graft function, 28 days survival and patient outcomes.</brief_summary>
