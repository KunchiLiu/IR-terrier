	<brief_title>Validation of Actigraph Measured Sleep During Acute Diverticulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The actigraph has been proven to measured sleep data with an accuracy about 80% (compared with Polysomnography) in patients who have undergone surgery. But this accuracy has not been validated in relation to none surgical inflammatory diseases. This study will investigate the accuracy of actigraph measured sleep in diverticulitis patients. Following methods will be applied Device: Wrist-Actigraph - Octagonal Basic Motionlogger, Ambulatory monitoring Inc, New York, USA Other: Sleep-diary Device: Polysomnograph - Embla Titanium (Natus Medical Incorporated, USA)</detailed_description>
