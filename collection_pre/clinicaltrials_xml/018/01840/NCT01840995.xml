	<brief_summary>The stellate ganglion block increase cerebral blood flow, as the consequence of that, it has the potential to cause an increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). Previous studies have proposed that ultrasonographic measurements of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) correlate with signs of increased ICP. Therefore, this study is aim to confirm the increased ICP by ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD after the stellate ganglion block.</brief_summary>
