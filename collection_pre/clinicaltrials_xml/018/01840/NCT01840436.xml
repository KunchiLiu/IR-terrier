	<brief_summary>MUCIPLIQ is a nanopolymer engineered to mimic glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfates. Glycosaminoglycans are involved 1) in the stabilization of cells micro-environment, known as extracellular matrix, by binding to structural proteins, and 2) in cells communication process by protecting growth factors. At the site of a lesion, glycosaminoglycans are degraded, thereby the extracellular matrix is disorganized and the tissue is destroyed. By replacing damaged glycosaminoglycans, MUCIPLIQ provides a protection, and restores the matrix scaffold and cells communication, a process known as Matrix Therapy. The purpose of this new controlled study is to determine whether MUCIPLIQ can decrease the incidence and the severity of radio-chemotherapy-induced mucositis in patients suffering of upper aerodigestive tract cancers, when used as a preventive agent. The study's main hypothesis is that MUCIPLIQ mouthwash applications before radiotherapy would protect the healthy oral tissue against cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy and radiations.</brief_summary>
