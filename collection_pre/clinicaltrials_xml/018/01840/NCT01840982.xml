	<brief_title>The Effects of Mixed Grain on Blood Glucose and Insulin in Healthy Male</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a 12-hour fast, oral glucose or meal tolerance test was performed with blood samples drawn at time 0, 15, 30, 45, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min. 1. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were analyzed by biochemical autoanalyzer. The area under the curve (AUC) changes in blood glucose were computed by the trapezoidal method. 2. Glycemic index(GI): the area under the glucose response curve after consumption of a test food divided by the area under the curve after consumption of a control food containing the same amount of carbohydrate and calculated using 50 g glucose as the reference.</detailed_description>
