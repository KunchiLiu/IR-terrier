	<brief_title>A Confirmatory Study of TAU-284 in Pediatric Patients With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparative study to demonstrate the noninferiority of TAU-284 to ketotifen fumarate in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, as assessed by the primary endpoint of the change from baseline in pruritus score after 2-week treatment with TAU-284 (20 mg/day) or ketotifen fumarate dry syrup (2 g/day); and to investigate the safety, and plasma concentrations of TAU-284.</detailed_description>
