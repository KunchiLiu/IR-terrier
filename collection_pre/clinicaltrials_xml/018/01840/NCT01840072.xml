	<brief_title>China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to test: - The effectiveness of blood pressure reduction among patients with acute ischemic stroke (within 48 hours of onset) on the primary outcome, a combination of death within 14 days after randomization and dependency (modified Rankin scale ≥3) at 14 day or at the time of discharge, if that occurred before 14 days. - The effectiveness of blood pressure reduction among patients with acute ischemic stroke (within 48-hours of onset) on secondary outcomes: - Combination of all-cause mortality and dependency over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up - Combined vascular disease events over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up (vascular deaths, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, hospitalized or treated angina, hospitalized or treated congestive heart failure, and hospitalized or treated peripheral arterial disease) - Recurrent fatal and non-fatal stroke over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up - Neurological functional status measured by NIH Stroke Score and modified Rankin scale at 14 day or discharge after randomization, and over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up - All-cause mortality over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up - Duration of initial hospitalization - Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure within 24 hours and over 7 days, and 14 days</detailed_description>
