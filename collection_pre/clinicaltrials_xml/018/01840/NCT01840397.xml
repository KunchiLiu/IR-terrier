	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is to find evidence if there is an influence of spine surgery on the serum levels of two proteins secreted from neuronal cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuromarker S-100B as Diagnostic Tool</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The question, if there is an effect on the cerebrospinal system during spine surgery, which can be traced by monitoring serum levels of neuromarkers is not yet answered. This study has its background from other studies on patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), in whom elevated serum levels of the two neuromarkers S-100B and NSE are associated with injury severity, neuronal damage, brain, tissue damage, and outcome. Patients undergoing spine surgery with or without pre-existing traumatic neurologic symptoms are planned to be the study cohort. Pre- and postoperatively the serum levels of S-100B and NSE are obtained and are statistically compared with patients undergoing other types of bone-related surgery.</detailed_description>
