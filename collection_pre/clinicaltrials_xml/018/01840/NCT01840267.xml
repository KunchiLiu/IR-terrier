	<brief_summary>The pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery in pediatrics has the potential to cause an increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). Previous studies have proposed that ultrasonographic measurements of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) correlate with signs of increased ICP. Therefore, this study aims to confirm the increased ICP by ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD during laparoscopic surgery in pediatric patients.</brief_summary>
