	<brief_summary>Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) is effective and safe in alleviating post-stroke spasticity and reducing the burden of associated symptoms. The hypothesis for this non-interventional study in arm spasticity (AS-NIS early BIRD) is no significant difference between naïve and pre-treated patients. The patients will be divided in sub-groups according to the time interval between occurrence of stroke and start of treatment (early, medium and late start of treatment according to the first and third quartiles time distribution). It is hypothesized that the "early" start of treatment group will have a reduced modified Ashworth scale (MAS) on the elbow and wrist flexors when compared to the "late" start of treatment group.</brief_summary>
