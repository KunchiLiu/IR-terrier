	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies nanoscale artificial nose (NA-NOSE) in monitoring response and detecting recurrence after surgery or radiation therapy in patients with stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using the NA-NOSE breath test may be an effective way to monitor response and detect recurrence of NSCLC after surgery or radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nanoscale Artificial Nose in Monitoring Response and Detecting Recurrence After Surgery or Radiation Therapy in Patients With Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if a suitable fraction of patients become NA-NOSE negative within three years post treatment. We will test the hypothesis that this fraction is at most 30% versus the alternative that it is at least 50%. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if patients who become NA-NOSE negative post treatment then become NA-NOSE positive prior to clinical recurrence. II. Estimate the time post treatment needed to become NA-NOSE negative. III. Estimate the lead time gained between a negative to positive NA-NOSE transition and clinical recurrence. OUTLINE: Patients undergo breath sample collection for the NA-NOSE breath test at baseline (2 pre-treatment samples), and post treatment samples at regularly scheduled follow up visits, for 2 years in the absence of disease progression.</detailed_description>
