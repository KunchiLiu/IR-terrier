	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of ODM-104 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is divided into two parts. Part one is a crossover study where healthy volunteers will receive two doses of ODM-104 and one dose of placebo. Part II of the study is a multiple ascending dose parallel group study where healthy volunteers will receive ODM-104 three times daily for seven days. Healthy volunteers taking part in Part II of the study will also receive levo/carbidopa and entacapone four times daily on day 1 and levo/carbidopa in addition to ODM-104 on day 9. The study will also look at the pharmacokinetic(how the body handles the drug) and pharmacodynamics (how the drug affects the body) of ODM-104.</detailed_description>
