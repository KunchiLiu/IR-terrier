	<brief_summary>Project Re-Engineered Discharge (Project RED) has previously demonstrated that patients who received the RED were 30% less likely than patients receiving usual care to access inpatient or emergency services within 30 days of discharge. In this project, the investigators add a new dimension to RED by integrating screening, referral and treatment for depression into the original RED intervention and determining if this enhanced intervention increases the effectiveness of RED in preventing readmissions and controlling costs in the 180 days after discharge for patients with signs of depression.</brief_summary>
