	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate heart rate variability during Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis by ECG-monitor (Holter), the investigators hypothesis is the inflammation causes a decrease of High Frequency(HF)-power component of heart rate variability and this correlates with sleep quality and daytime fatigue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heart Rate Variability During Acute Diverticulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increasing number of studies have shown that circadian variation in the excretion of hormones, the sleep-wake cycle, the core body temperature, the tone of the autonomic nervous system and the activity rhythm are important both in health and disease processes. The investigators are interested in investigating the heart rate variability (HRV) during an acute surgical non-inflammatory condition, and to exam whether there are correlations between: HRV and sleep stages, HRV and cytokine levels in blood and HRV and subjective fatigue. Following methods will be applied Device: Holter monitor - Medilog AR12 (Oxford Instruments, Oxford, England) Other: Karolinska Sleepiness Scale Other: Physical Fatigue Scale Device: Polysomnograph - Embla Titanium (Natus Medical Incorporated, USA) Procedure: Plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF(tumor necrosis factor)-alfa) Procedure: Plasma CRP(C reactive protein) and leukocytes</detailed_description>
