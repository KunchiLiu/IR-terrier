	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate metabolic effects of 3 different nutritional compounds. Fasting (36 hours) creates a catabolic state that is comparable with the catabolic state seen in acute illness. This study is a randomized, placebo cross-over study investigating 8 healthy men on 4 separated days (at least 3 weeks between trials). - High leucine content drink - Low leucine content drink - Low leucine content drink + HMB - Carbohydrate (isocaloric) The investigators hypothesize that these nutritional supplements may counteract catabolic processes in different ways and degrees.</brief_summary>
