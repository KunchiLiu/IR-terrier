	<brief_summary>A study to evaluate the efficacy of SRM003 treatment versus participating sites' standard practice treatment in improving the rate of AVF maturation and use in subjects with end-stage renal disease undergoing surgery for creation of an AVF to facilitate hemodialysis access. It is hypothesized that when placed outside the blood vessel, the seeded SRM003 gelatin matrix containing endothelial cells can provide a continuous supply of multiple growth regulatory compounds to the underlying cells within the blood vessel, while being protected from the effects of blood flow in the vessel(s) or complications resulting from being in direct contact with the point of injury.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject must be 18 years of age or older at the time of signing and dating informed consent (no upper age limit), can be male or female. 2. Subject who is of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception for 6 months after randomization. 3. Subject must be currently undergoing hemodialysis or anticipating the start of hemodialysis and must require a new permanent, suitable access for the AVF creation in the upper extremity. 4. Subject must have a life expectancy of at least 26 weeks after randomization. 5. Subject must be able to understand and be willing to complete all study requirements. 1. Subject is currently on an active organ transplant list from a deceased donor or is undergoing assessment and expects to be placed on the active organ or bone marrow transplant list within the next 26 weeks from surgery, or expects to receive a living donor organ or bone marrow within the next 26 weeks and is unwilling to change transplant list status to "hold" for 3 months after randomization. 2. Subject has had more than 1 access placement surgery (defined as a new access, not a revision) in the target limb. 3. Subject has medical conditions and diseases that may cause noncompliance with the protocol 4. Subject has a known allergy to bovine/porcine products or collagen/gelatin products. 5. Subject has a history of intravenous drug use within 6 months prior to screening 6. Subject is morbidly obese, defined as having a body mass index &gt;40. 7. Pregnant or nursing woman, or plans to become pregnant during the study.</criteria>
