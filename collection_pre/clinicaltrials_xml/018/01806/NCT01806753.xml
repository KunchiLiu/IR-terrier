	<brief_summary>Although proper sedation is mandatory for endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic submucosal dissection, the effects of sedation on ESD performance and complications have not been fully evaluated. In the investigators previous retrospective study, en bloc resection and complete resection rates, and procedure time could be improved by sedation with continuous propofol infusion with opioid administration by anesthesiologists. However, there are several limitations to the study including retrospective design. The investigators aimed to evaluate the relationship among sedation methods, satisfaction of endoscopists or patients, clinical outcomes, and complications after endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasia.</brief_summary>
