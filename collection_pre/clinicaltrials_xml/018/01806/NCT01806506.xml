	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a bariatric procedure with known safety and effectiveness. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a newer procedure gaining popularity. The aim of the study is to compare outcomes of these two surgical methods in terms of weight loss, improvement of common comorbidities of obesity and influence on metabolic and hormonal status.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Authors of the study believe that a more detailed head-to-head comparison of RYGB and LSG is necessary. The former method is the established "gold standard" procedure with good outcomes reported in many studies. However it is much more complex and the learning curve is longer. The latter method was introduced as an initial procedure in superobese patients because of its relative simplicity. It produced good outcomes in this population of superobese patients and surgeons in some centers started to use it as a primary bariatric procedure. RYGB is a restrictive and partially malabsorptive procedure and it is believed to have additional benefits in patients with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Purely restrictive procedures such as LSG are theoretically less beneficial in this group of patients. In the present study authors will look at weight loss as well as improvement in comorbidities and several biochemical parameters and indices to assess also metabolic action of these two procedures.</detailed_description>
