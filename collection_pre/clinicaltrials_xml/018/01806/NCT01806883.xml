	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effects of Rehabilitation Using the "Wii" on Upper Limb Kinematics in Chronic Stroke Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal aim of this study is to evaluate changes in strategies of hemiparetic upper limb movement in chronic stroke patients following twelve one hour sessions of rehabilitation using the "Nintendo Wii" over a period of four weeks, and to compare with a group of patients receiving traditional upper limb rehabilitation of the same duration. The investigators hypothesize that the use of compensatory strategies will increase in the group receiving the "Wii" rehabilitation while they will decrease in the group receiving traditional rehabilitation. The investigators further hypothesize that this will have an impact on the functional benefit with a greater improvement of function in the group receiving traditional rehabilitation.</detailed_description>
