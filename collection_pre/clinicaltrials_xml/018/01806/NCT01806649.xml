	<brief_summary>There is a need for more effective therapy for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who developed disease progression after first line therapy. Currently, there is no standard second-line therapy for this disease. BKM-120 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor currently tested in clinical trials. In a cellular model of oral-esophageal carcinogenesis, it has shown that EGFR overexpression activated PI3/AKT pathway. Therfore, there is interest to see the efficacy and safety of BKM120 in this setting.</brief_summary>

As such, the patient must have completed any prior treatment for CNS metastases &gt; 28 days (including radiotherapy and/or surgery) prior to enrollment in this study and should not be receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy for the CNS metastases. Patient has a concurrent malignancy or has a malignancy within 5 years of study enrollment, (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ. Patient has any of the following mood disorders as judged by the Investigator or a Psychiatrist, or meets the cutoff score of ≥ 10 in the PHQ9 or a cutoff of ≥ 15 in the GAD7 mood scale, respectively, or selects a positive response of '1, 2, or 3' to question number 9 regarding potential for suicidal thoughts ideation in the PHQ9 (independent of the total score of the PHQ9) Medically documented history of or active major depressive episode, bipolar disorder (I or II), obsessivecompulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of suicidal attempt or ideation, or homicidal ideation (immediate risk of doing harm to others) ≥ CTCAE grade 3 anxiety Patient is concurrently using other approved or investigational antineoplastic agent Patient has had major surgery within 28 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects of the surgery Patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus(HbA1c &gt; 8 %) Patient has active cardiac disease including any of the following: LVEF &lt; 50% QTc &gt; 480 msec on screening ECG (using the QTcF formula) Angina pectoris that requires the use of antianginal medication Ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions Supraventricular and nodal arrythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication Conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker Valvular disease with documented compromise in cardiac function Symptomatic pericarditis Patient has a history of cardiac dysfunction including any of the following; Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, documented by persistent elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of LVEF function History of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV) Documented cardiomyopathy Patient is currently receiving treatment with QT prolonging medication known to have a risk to induce Torsades de Pointes, and the treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug Inability to swallow, impaired gastrointestinal (GI) function, or GI disease that would significantly alter the absorption of study drugs or preclude the use of oral medications Patient has other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment contraindicate her participation in the clinical study (e.g.,chronic pancreatitis, active chronic hepatitis etc.) Patient is currently being treated with drugs known to be moderate and strong inhibitors or inducers of isoenzyme CYP3A, and the treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug.</criteria>
