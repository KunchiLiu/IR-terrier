	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis are two inflammatory diseases that share many pathophysiological similarities as some inflammatory mediators like TNF-alpha, IL-1, Il-6, Il-17, Il-12 et Il-17, RANK-L, or OPG The most severe or progressive forms of rheumatoid arthritis require in 10-30% of cases, the use of biotherapies such as anti-TNF-alpha, anti CD-20 and anti-lL-6. All these treatments results in, among other things, an increased risk of infection, both viral and bacterial. These new biotherapies could have an impact on periodontal status - either by favouring sub gingival colonization of root surfaces by periodontal pathogenic bacteria and initiate periodontitis or exacerbate pre-existing periodontitis, - or a positive modulation of the host response by inhibiting bone resorption of the alveolar process. To date, very few studies have been conducted on this subject which is really a translational research, involving several medical specialties.</brief_summary>
