	<brief_summary>Objective: to test the hypothesis that recombinant activated protein C (aPC) therapy improves the microcirculation of severe septic patients. Design: Prospective, open study. Setting: University 12-beds intensive care unit. Patients: Septic patients with at least two sepsis-induced organ failures occurring within 48 hours of the onset of sepsis were included in a one year period. Interventions: Patients who had no contraindication to aPC administration received aPC at a dose of 24 mcg/kg/h for 96 hours. Patients with contraindications to aPC infusion were considered as controls.</brief_summary>
