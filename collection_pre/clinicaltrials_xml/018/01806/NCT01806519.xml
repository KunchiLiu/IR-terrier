	<brief_summary>Neck pain is a common problem in the western world. There is a group of people suffering from neck pain with a reduced ability to maintain an upright posture showing a forward head position and an altered muscle function. The aim of the study was to evaluate a motor control intervention for patients with persistent neck pain and a forward head posture. This pilot study used a Single System Experimental Design (SSED) with an A-B-A-design and multiple baselines. The tailored motor control intervention addressed the faulty postural alignment and the deep muscles of the cervical spine.</brief_summary>
