	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in civilian patients with a confirmed diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This research study will determine whether low-frequency (1 Hertz [Hz]) or high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has an effect on symptoms of PTSD compared to sham rTMS treatment.</brief_summary>
