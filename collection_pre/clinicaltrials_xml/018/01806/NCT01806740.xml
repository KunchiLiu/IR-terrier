	<brief_summary>Primary objective : The main objective is to evaluate the value of DCE-MRI in prediction of response of patients with HCC to treatment with Sorafenib assessed by mRECIST.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DCE-MRI Using Dotarem® in Evaluation of Therapeutic Response to Sorafenib in Patients With Advanced Stage HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives : 1. To evaluate the value of percent change of DCE-MRI/AFP/DWI from baseline to follow up at 1 or 2 weeks in prediction of overall survival, progression-free survival, and time to progression 2. To evaluate the value of baseline DCE-MRI/AFP/DWI in prediction of overall survival, progression-free survival, and time to progression.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 20 years old 2. Subject diagnosed for Unresectable HCC (Child Pugh class A and major vascular invasion, extrahapatic metastasis, or progression after TACE more than 2 times). 3. Presence of mRECIST target lesion (Lesion which can be classified as a RECIST measurable lesion(can be measured ≥ 1 cm in at least one dimension), Lesion suitable for repeat measure, Lesion showing intraluminal arterial enhancement on contrastenhanced CT or MRI) within liver 4. Patient planned to be treated with sorafenib 5. Patient with liver CT performed or planned to be performed within 4 weeks before initiation of Sorafenib treatment 6. Patient with a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more 7. No previous treatment with Sorafenib 8. Subjects able to understand and having provided written informed consent to participate in the trial. 9. Female subjects who are surgically sterilized, or postmenopausal (minimum 12 months of amenorrhea) or who have a documented negative urine hCG test at screening 1. Contraindication to MRI (e.g. : severe claustrophobia, pacemaker, metalic joint replacement or any other according to the imaging center's standard practice) 2. Subjects presenting with known severe renal failure (estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min calculated by the CockcroftGault formula or estimated GFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73m² by MDRD) 3. History of hypersensitivity reaction to a gadolinium contrast media 4. Female with child bearing potential without contraception using at least 2 different methods 5. Breast feeding or pregnant female 6. Any condition which, based on the investigator's clinical judgment, would prevent the patient from completing all trial assessments and visits (for example: mental or physical incapacity, language comprehension, geographical localisation, etc…) 7. Previous other therapy to a target lesion within 30 days 8. Previous radiation therapy to a target lesion 9. Subjects having participated in any investigational drug study within 30 days prior the study inclusion or currently participating in another clinical trial involving an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP).</criteria>
