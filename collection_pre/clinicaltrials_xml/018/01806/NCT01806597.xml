	<criteria>Subjects with chronic, moderate to severe plaque type psoriasis for at least 6 months prior to randomization and significant involvement of the palms and soles at baseline, defined as palmoplantar Investigator's Global Assessment (ppIGA) score of ≥ 3 on a 5point scale, as well as at least one skin plaque at baseline which is not in the palmoplantar area Candidates for systemic therapy, i.e. psoriasis inadequately controlled by topical treatment (including super potent topical corticosteroids) and/or phototherapy and/or previous systemic therapy Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaque type psoriasis (e.g., pustular psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis, acrodermatitis of Hallopeau, erythrodermic and guttate psoriasis) Druginduced psoriasis (e.g. new onset or current exacerbation from βblockers, calcium channel inhibitors or lithium) Ongoing use of prohibited treatments (e.g. topical or systemic corticosteroids (CS), UV therapy). Washout periods do apply. Prior exposure to secukinumab (AIN457) or any other biological drug directly targeting IL17 or the IL17 receptor Use of any investigational drugs within 4 weeks prior to study treatment initiation or within a period of 5 halflives of the investigational treatment, whichever is longer Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis that might confound the evaluation of the benefit of secukinumab therapy History of hypersensitivity to constituents of the study treatment Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria do apply</criteria>
