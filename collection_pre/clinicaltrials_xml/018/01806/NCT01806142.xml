	<brief_summary>Several lines of evidence indicate that a significant proportion of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events are attributable to the presence of a cluster of metabolic abnormalities and perturbations, defined as the metabolic syndrome. It has been estimated that approximately 25% of the North American adult population is living with the metabolic syndrome. Recent studies from the investigators group show that overaccumulation of atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) seen in insulin-resistant patients is partly due to increased production rate of intestinally derived apolipoprotein (apo) B-48-containing lipoproteins. This is of interest because substantial evidence exists indicating that elevated levels of intestinal lipoproteins are associated with increased CVD risk. In this regard, there is some evidence that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) may beneficially modify lipoprotein metabolism in hypertriglyceridemic patients. However, as emphasized in the body of this grant proposal, the specific impact of MCTs on the intestinal lipoprotein secretion and on expression of genes that regulate intestinal lipid absorption and chylomicron synthesis has not yet been investigated in humans. The general objective of the proposed research is to investigate the mechanisms by which MCTs beneficially modify intestinal lipoprotein metabolism in patients with the metabolic syndrome. The primary hypothesis is that MCT supplementation will decrease plasma levels of intestinal lipoproteins by reducing secretion of these particles.</brief_summary>
