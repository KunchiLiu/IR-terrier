	<brief_summary>Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technique that measures regional cerebral oxygenation in a non-invasive manner. Through the use of near infrared light, the difference between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin can be measured. By applying the Beer-Lamber law, a numeric result can be calculated. During a cardiac arrest, there is no stroke volume, no cardiac output and no cerebral perfusion. By using cerebral NIRS during out-of hospital cardiac arrest, low flow time and return of spontaneous circulation, this study wants to show the prognostic value of NIRS as extra monitoring.</brief_summary>
