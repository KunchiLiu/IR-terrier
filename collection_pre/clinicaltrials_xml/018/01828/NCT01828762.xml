	<brief_summary>Although liver resection, liver transplantation, a-interferon, Transarterial Chemo Embolization (TACE), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT), Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) provide options to treat patients with HCC, the high recurrence rate of mid-late stage liver cancer still exists. The safety of autologous Immune Cell Therapy in Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Patients Following Resection and TACE Therapy will be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is a single center,open label trial. To obtain safety information on toxicities and adverse events attributable to the subcutaneous injections of autologous dendritic cells incubated with irradiated autologous tumor stem cells and suspended in GM-CSF in patients with HCC.</detailed_description>
