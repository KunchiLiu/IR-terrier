	<brief_summary>Adjuvant use of fibrin glue (FG) in the fistula tract has been shown to promote closure of low-output enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs). The primary objectives of this study are to compare the clinical efficacy, safety of autologous platelet-rich fibrin glue (PRFG), commercial fibrin glue, and control therapy in the management of patients with low-output volume ECFs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glue Application in the Treatment of Low-Output Fistulas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This is a prospective, randomized, multi-centered study clinical, safety and economic outcome of ECFs patients. - Subjects are randomized to one of 3 groups: - Group 1: Autologous PRFG-treatment [PRFG + Standard of care (SOC)] - Group 2: Commercial FG-treatment [FG + Standard of care (SOC)] - Group 3: Control (SOC only) - Study will include three phases: - Phase 1: Screening, consent and enrollment - Phase 2: Patients will receive either PRFG, commercial FG, or SOC only for 14 days - Phase 3: Follow up: for patients with closed fistula within 14 days, we will follow up them for 6 months. For patients whose fistulas were still open will be treated with other therapeutic option and follow up for 6 months after closure.</detailed_description>
