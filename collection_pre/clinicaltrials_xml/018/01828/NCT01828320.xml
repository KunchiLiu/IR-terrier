	<brief_summary>There is an urgent need to identify modifiable mechanisms contributing to risk and vulnerability among youth. The investigators test the hypothesis that eveningness, the tendency to go to sleep late and wake late, is an important contributor to, and even cause of, vicious cycles that escalate vulnerability and risk among youth. This study seeks to determine whether two interventions to reduce eveningness can reduce risk and confer resilience in critical aspects of health, development and functioning in youth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triple Vulnerability? Circadian Tendency, Sleep Deprivation and Adolescence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Teens who exhibit a circadian tendency toward eveningness ('night-owls') follow a delayed sleep schedule, increasing activity later in the day and both going to sleep and getting up later, compared to morning-types ('larks'). The circadian tendency toward eveningness during adolescence arises from a confluence of psychosocial, behavioral and biological factors and is an important contributor to, and maybe even cause of, vicious cycles that escalate vulnerability and risk for poor health and major forms of psychopathology. Indeed, an evening circadian tendency has been associated with a wide range of adverse effects including poorer health, poorer academic performance, poorer self-regulation, greater use of substances, greater tendency for impulsivity, more depression and anxiety, greater emotional instability and more aggressive and antisocial behavior. While the biological shift toward eveningness during puberty may be difficult to modify, the psychosocial and behavioral contributors are modifiable. Moreover, modifying these contributors will eliminate key factors that exacerbate the biological shift. The proposed research will advance current knowledge on the role of eveningness as a mechanism contributing to poorer outcomes during adolescence. The investigators aim to reduce eveningness among 10-18 year olds via an intervention which integrates evidence-based treatments derived from basic research on the circadian system (Treatment 1) compared to a psychoeducational intervention that highlights the interplay between sleep, diet, exercise and stress (Treatment 2). The investigators will randomly allocate adolescents with an evening circadian tendency, and who are 'at risk' in at least one of five health domains (emotional, cognitive, behavioral, social, physical), to either: (a) Treatment 1 (n = 86) or (b) Treatment 2 (n = 86). Measures will be taken pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. This research is a first step within a longer term plan to accelerate knowledge on the potentially powerful positive effects, for the developing neural system, of simple, disseminable psychosocial interventions specifically designed to target modifiable risk factors across adolescence.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Sleep Deprivation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria. 1. Scoring within the lowest quartile of the Children's MorningnessEveningness Preferences Scale (CMEP; 27 or lower) and a 7day sleep diary showing a sleep onset time of of 10:40 pm or later for 1013 year olds, 11 pm or later for 1416 year olds, and 11:20 pm or later for 1718 year olds at least 3 nights per week. Must have had the current pattern of late bedtimes for the last 3 months. 2. 'At risk' in one of the five health domains: emotional, behavioral, social, physical, and cognitive. Emotional risk will be operationalized as a score of 4 or above on any of the following items on the Child Depression Rating Scale: Difficulty Having Fun, Social Withdrawal, Irritability, Depressed Feelings, Excessive Weeping, or a Tscore of 61 or above on the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASQ), based on age group (1011 years, 1215 year, 1619 years) using the MASC10 Profile. Behavioral risk will be operationalized as a Sensation Seeking Scale score greater than 3.93 for males ages 1013, greater than 3.19 for females 1013, greater than 4.07 for males 1418, or greater than 3.19 for females 1418; taking ADHD medication or Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for SchoolAge Children (KSADs) diagnosis of ADHD; current alcohol or substance abuse; or past alcohol or substance dependence. Social and cognitive risk will be defined as "worse" than others the teen's age in one or more social behavior from Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Section VI or failing one or more academic class from CBCL Section VII, respectively. Physical risk will be operationalized as a Physical Health Questionnaire15 score of 4 or above, six or more days of school absences, or a BMI above the 85th percentile for the participant's sex and age. 3. Age between 10 and 18 and living with a parent or guardian and and attending a class/job by 9am at least 3 days per week; 4. English language fluency; 5. Able and willing to give informed assent. Exclusion criteria. 1. An active, progressive physical illness (e.g., cancer, respiratory disorder) or neurological degenerative disease directly related to the onset and course of the sleep disturbance; 2. Evidence from clinical diagnosis or report by youth or parent of sleep apnea, restless legs or periodic limb movements during sleep. Youth presenting with provisional diagnoses of any of these disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) will be referred for a nonstudy polysomnography (PSG) evaluation at the parent's discretion and will be enrolled only if the diagnosis is disconfirmed; 3. Mental retardation, autism spectrum disorder, or other significantly impairing pervasive developmental disorder. Based on previous recruitment experiences in our youth depression study, we expect this exclusion to be invoked very infrequently (once every few years); 4. Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or another current Axis I disorder if there is a significant risk of harm and/or decompensation if treatment of that comorbid condition is delayed as a function of participating in any stage of this study. Otherwise, we will allow all other comorbid psychiatric conditions to (i) to maximize representativeness and (ii) because a byproduct may be that the treatment constitutes a helpful 'transdiagnostic' treatment for youth across psychiatric disorders. 5. A medicationfree group may be difficult to recruit and would likely be unrepresentative. Hence, participants will not be excluded on the basis of stable use of medications (&gt; 4 weeks). The exception was use of hypnotics and other medications known to alter sleep (e.g., melatonin). 6. History of substance dependence in the past six months; 7. Current suicide risk sufficient to preclude treatment on an outpatient basis.</criteria>
