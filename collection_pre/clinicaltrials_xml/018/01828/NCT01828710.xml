	<brief_summary>Many clinical evidences suggest that Myo-inositol plays a crucial role in human reproduction. Also, it was shown that Myo-inositol concentration in the seminiferous tubules was higher than in serum, and interestingly it was increasing through the epididymis and the deferent duct mining that sperm cell before ejaculation are stored in a "medium" highly enriched in myo-inositol. Starting from this evidences, the investigators hypothesized that myo-inositol may be a possible factor able to improve the semen parameters of samples used in in vitro fertilization cycles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Samples of seminal fluid were obtained from two groups of patients undergoing to an IVF cycle: healthy normospermic subjects and subjects with oligoasthenoteratospermia (OAT, &lt; 15 mil/ml). Semen volume, spermatozoa number and motility were evaluated during the initial semen analysis and after density gradient separation method. These parameters were evaluated before and after the administration of 4000mg/die of myo-inositol associated to 400 µg of folic acid (Inofolic lolipharma Rome) for three months. A third group of healthy normospermic subject were traded with 400 µg of folic acid for three months and was consider a control group.</detailed_description>
