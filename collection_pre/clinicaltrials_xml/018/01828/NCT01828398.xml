	<brief_summary>After stroke a limited motor recovery in the paretic upper limb accounts for a large proportion of the disabling sequelae. Only about 15% of those with initial complete upper limb paralysis after stroke recover functional use of their impaired arm in daily life. The aim of this study is to test the effects of tDCS combined with upper extremity robot-assisted therapy on stroke survivors.</brief_summary>
