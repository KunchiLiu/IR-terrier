	<brief_summary>Very few studies have examined different models of care involving initial ambulatory home-based diagnosis in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), identifying patients who benefit from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and reducing the need for polysomnography (PSG). This study aims to assess the role of an ambulatory approach with home diagnostic sleep study. We hypothesize that the ambulatory approach is as good as the conventional approach in managing OSA in terms of improvement of clinical outcome but the former approach will lead to substantial cost savings.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) parallel study on new referrals to the Respiratory Clinic, Prince of Wales Hospital, with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS). OSAS was defined by apnea-hypopnea index(AHI) 5/hr or more of sleep plus excessive daytime sleepiness or two of the following symptoms: choking or gasping during sleep, recurrent awakenings from sleep, unrefreshed sleep, daytime fatigue, and impaired concentration. All patients with suspected OSAS underwent assessment at the clinic with the Epworth sleepiness score(ESS) and symptoms evaluation. Patients who had ESS score&gt;9 or at least two OSAS symptoms as described above were invited to join the study. They were randomized into either group A)home-based management approach or group B)hospital-based management approach by a random table by a third party not involved in the trial.</detailed_description>
