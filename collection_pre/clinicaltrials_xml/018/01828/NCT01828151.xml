	<brief_title>Noninvasive Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation and Risk of Facial Pressure Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Noninvasive ventilation improves the outcome of patients with acute respiratory failure; however patient's discomfort may be responsible for up to a fifth of failures. Scant literature exists on NIV-related pressure ulcers and their determinants. Aim of the study is to seek for determinants, if any, associated with the development of pressure ulcers related to noninvasive ventilation. Study design: observational. Patients treated with NIV from December 2009 to December 2011 will be analyzed. Main end-points: to seek for variables associated to the development of NIV-related pressure ulcers in patients with acute respiratory failure.</detailed_description>
