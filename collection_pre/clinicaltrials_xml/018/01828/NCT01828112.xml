	<criteria>1. Patient has a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive as assessed by the FDA approved Abbott FISH Test. 2. Patient has stage IIIB or IV diagnosis and must have received one or two prior regimens (including platinum doublet) of cytotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 3. Patient has at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1. A previously irradiated site lesion may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation 1. Patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of LDK378 (microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate) 2. Patient with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed or docetaxel or any known excipients of these drugs. 3. Patient with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who is neurologically unstable or has required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to screening to manage CNS symptoms.</criteria>
