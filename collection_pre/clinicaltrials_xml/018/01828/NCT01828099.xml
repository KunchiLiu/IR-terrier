	<criteria>1. Patient has a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of nonsquamous Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive as assessed by the Ventana Immunohistochemistry (IHC) test. The test will be performed at Novartis designated central laboratories. 2. Patient has newly diagnosed stage IIIB (who are not a candidate for definitive multimodality therapy) or stage IV NSCLC or relapsed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC not previously treated with any systemic anticancer therapy (e.g. cytotoxic drugs, monoclonal antibody therapy, crizotinib or other ALK inhibitors, or other targeted therapies, either experimental or not), with exception of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy 3. Patient has at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1. A previously irradiated site lesion may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation 1. Patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of LDK378 (microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate) 2. Patient with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to platinum containing drugs, pemetrexed or any known excipients of these drugs. 3. Patient with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who is neurologically unstable or has required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to screening to manage CNS symptoms.</criteria>
