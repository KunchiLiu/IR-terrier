	<brief_title>Effect of Magnesium on the Recovery Time of Neuromuscular Blockade With Sugammadex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sugammadex is a novel neuromuscular blocking reversal agent. Its mechanism of action is the encapsulation of rocuronium and vecuronium molecules. Numerous studies show a potential role of magnesium in reducing anesthetic requirements, sympathetic response to surgical trauma, antinociceptive action and neuroprotective effects. However, its use is limited because magnesium potentiates non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Primary outcome: evaluate the effect of pretreatment with magnesium sulfate on the time reversal with sugammadex (recovery of the T4/T1 ratio = 0.9) of moderate neuromuscular blockade (two answers to a train-of-four TOF) induced by rocuronium. Secondary outcome: evaluate severe respiratory events, the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade in the post anesthesia recovery room and postoperative pain.</detailed_description>
