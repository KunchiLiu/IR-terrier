	<brief_summary>A multicenter, randomized, Phase 2 trial to study the effectiveness and feasibility of association of trastuzumab with combination chemotherapy in advanced or metastatic bladder cancer patients. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with combination chemotherapy may improve treatment efficacy on tumours overexpressed HER 2.</brief_summary>
