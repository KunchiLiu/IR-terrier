	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of injecting the Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) [containing Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs)] enriched fat grafts into regions of the face that require enhancement. The safety of SVF will be evaluated throughout the course of the study phase through the assessment of laboratory values, physical examinations, adverse events, safety phone calls etc.</brief_summary>

Subjects who are unlikely to comply with the protocol (e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for subsequent visits, dementia, and/or otherwise considered by the Investigator to be unlikely to complete the study) 4. Subjects with a known drug or alcohol dependence within the past 12 months as judged by the Investigator 5. Subjects with major illnesses involving the renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, and/or nervous systems 6. Subjects with elevated kidney and/or liver functions 7. Any other disease condition or laboratory results that in the opinion of the investigator may be clinically significant and render the subject inappropriate for the study procedure(s), may alter the accuracy of study results, or increase risk for subjects. 8.
