	<brief_summary>Relapse contributes significantly to the chronicity of substance use disorders, one of the most costly medical/mental health problems facing our nation. The incorporation of exercise into relapse prevention efforts will address stress, a critical factor in relapse, provide other health benefits, and improve overall quality of life. Combined, these changes will reduce the risk of relapse to substance use while also lessening the burden of this psychiatric disorder upon society</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise: Addressing Stress in Relapse Prevention for Substance Use Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About half of all individuals who receive treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) relapse within a year. Stress and an individual's biological response to it are significant predictors of relapse. Thus, interventions that decrease stress and normalize an individual's biological response to stress are desperately needed. Exercise decreases stress and improves the body's regulation of stress. The proposed project will utilize exercise as a novel relapse prevention intervention with individuals who have recently completed inpatient SUD treatment. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a motivational intervention for exercise in a randomized clinical trial of 150 SUD patients beginning Aftercare treatment at the VA St. Louis Health Care System. Participants will be randomized to one of two interventions: (1) standard care (SC), or (2) standard care plus a motivational intervention targeting exercise that lasts for six months. Participants are followed every three months for one year. Results from this study will advance exercise as a new strategy for enhancing stress regulation and prevention of relapse in SUD populations.</detailed_description>
