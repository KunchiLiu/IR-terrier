	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new RNActive®-derived prostate cancer vaccine CV9104 prolongs survival in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer that is castrate resistant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of RNActive®-Derived Prostate Cancer Vaccine in Metastatic Castrate-refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is the first clinical study with the new prostate cancer vaccine CV9104. This vaccine is composed of 6RNActive®-based compounds, each encoding for an antigen that is overexpressed in prostate cancer compared to healthy tissues. RNActive®-based vaccines are a novel class of vaccines based on messenger RNA. The study is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase I/II trial in men with asymptomatic- minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate-refractory prostate cancer. The phase 1 (safety lead- in) part of the trial has the primary objective to assess the safety of CV9104 and to determine the dose for the randomized phase II part. The primary objective of the phase II part is to compare overall survival in patients treated with CV9104 compared to patients treated with placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key 1. Male, age ≥18 years 2. Histologically confirmed castrate refractory metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate with progressive disease after surgical castration or during androgen suppression therapy including a GNRH agonist or antagonist and after at least 1 additional antihormonal manipulation; and serum testosterone level of &lt; 50 ng/dL or &lt; 1.7 nmol/L Progression will be confirmed either radiologically or by 2 consecutive rises of PSA, measured at least 1 week apart, resulting at least in a 50% increase over the nadir and a PSA &gt; 2 ng/mL. An antiandrogen withdrawal response must have been excluded after discontinuation of antiandrogen therapy for at least 6 weeks. 3. Metastatic disease confirmed by imaging 4. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 Key 1. Previous immunotherapy for PCA (e.g. sipuleucelT [Provenge®], experimental cancer vaccines or ipilimumab [Yervoy®]). 2. Treatment with any investigational anticancer agents within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug 3. Systemic treatment with immunosuppressive agents 4. Active skin disease (atopic eczema, psoriasis) in the areas for vaccine injection (upper arms or thighs) preventing the administration of i.d. injections into areas of healthy skin. 5. History of or current autoimmune disorders 6. Primary or secondary immune deficiency. 7. Seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus (except after hepatitis B vaccination) or hepatitis C virus infection. 8. Symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association 3 or 4), unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction, significant cardiac arrhythmia, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, all within 6 months prior to enrolment or severe hypertension according to WHO criteria or uncontrolled hypertension at the time of enrolment (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg)´ 9. Previous chemotherapy for metastatic PCA. 10. Previous antihormonal treatment with abiraterone or any other investigational antihormonal treatment. 11. Cancerrelated pain requiring opioid narcotics within 28 days before enrolment or an average pain score of &gt; 3 on a visual analogue scale. 12. Presence of visceral metastases. 13. History of other malignancies other than PCA over the last 5 years (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin).</criteria>
