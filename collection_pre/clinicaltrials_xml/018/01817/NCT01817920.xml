	<brief_summary>Falls are very common accidents in Hospital. It not only results in injuries, less mobility among patients but increases their length of stay, cost and family burdens. Reducing the rates and injuries of falls is an urgent issue around hospitals. An integrated multidisciplinary fall prevention program (IMFPP) was implemented from 2006 in CCH. Members include physicians, nurses, case manager therapists, engineers and staffs of maintenance. The aim of this study is to determine whether IMFPP efforts support interventions with multiple components do reduce the fall rates and severity of injuries.</brief_summary>
