	<brief_summary>1. Evaluate quantitative VCEUS imaging for determining early breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and compare results to co-temporal volume change on grayscale ultrasound and post-treatment mammography findings utilizing final surgical pathology and clinical outcome. 2. Assess incremental benefit of quantitative VCEUS to planar CEUS tumor perfusion measurements and enhancement patterns in predicting tumor response to adjuvant treatment in clinical studies. The contrast agent Definity® is FDA approved for use as a contrast agent during ultrasound (echocardiography) of the heart. Definity® will be used "off-label" (during ultrasound of the breast) in this study. The administration of Definity® during this study will follow total dose guidelines approved by the FDA.</brief_summary>
