	<brief_summary>Default options represent the events or conditions that are set into place if no alternatives are actively chosen. The setting of default options has well-established effects on a broad range of human decisions, but its influence on patients' preferences for end-of-life care is only beginning to be understood. This is a 3-armed randomized clinical trial in Veterans at high risk for critical illness, assessing the impact of Advance Directive (AD) forms framed with different default options. The central goals are to assess how default options in ADs influence the end-of-life care choices made by patients at risk for critical care, and these patients' hospital and ICU utilization. The investigators hypothesize that setting defaults in real ADs will increase the proportion of Veterans selecting comfort-oriented plans of care, decrease selections of life-extending therapies such as mechanical ventilation and dialysis, and reduce the proportion of time during follow-up that Veterans spend in the hospital and/or ICU, without affecting patient satisfaction with end-of-life care planning.</brief_summary>
