	<brief_title>Combined Chemoembolization and Systemic Hyperthermia for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an intermediate and advanced stage when the tumors become unresectable. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been shown to be effective in prolongation of survival for patients with unresectable HCC and generally adopted as a standard palliative treatment option for patients with intermediate stage HCC. However, the therapeutic effect of TACE in terms of objective tumor response is variable and modest (27%-40%), indicating that there is actually much room for improvement in the treatment. In many cases, patients with intrahepatic HCC uncontrolled after TACE treatment may not be suitable for other treatment options because of their physical condition. For these patients, repeat TACE combined with adjuvant systemic hyperthermia may offer a chance of disease control.</detailed_description>
