	<brief_summary>Spasticity, muscle weakness, abnormal gait pattern are co-morbidities commonly seen in stroke patients. They cause disabled condition of patients in activities of daily life and functional performance, and also accidental falls and subsequent fractures. This study is to evaluate and compare the effects of different phase injection of Botulinum Toxin Type-A at affected limbs on muscle rheological changes, muscle activity, muscle tone, functional performance, gait pattern and energy consumption in stroke patients.</brief_summary>
