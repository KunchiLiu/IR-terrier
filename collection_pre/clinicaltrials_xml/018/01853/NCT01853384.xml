	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find out if an investigational product called HP802-247 can help people with venous leg ulcers. Investigational means that HP802-247 has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This research is being done to compare the efficacy of HP802-247 plus compression therapy against Vehicle plus compression therapy in achieving complete wound closure over the 12-week treatment period. Vehicle looks the same as HP802-247 but contains no cells. At least 440 subjects will participate. The study is going to be conducted in approximately 5 countries at approximately 50 sites across the European Union.</brief_summary>
