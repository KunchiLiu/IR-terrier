	<brief_summary>Background: After a traumatic spinal cord injury, a severe bone loss in the paralyzed extremities is observed. This leads to a osteoporosis which is connected to a high fracture risk. Aims: To compare the two measurement methods DEXA and pQCT concerning optimal diagnostics and assessment of fracture risk in subjects with spinal cord injury. Subjects: 250 women and 250 men (ageâ‰¥18, any AIS-classification) with an acute or chronic spinal cord injury will be recruited for this study. For a reference group, 500 able-bodied persons will be measured analogously. Methods: Using DEXA-Osteodensitometry, bone parameters of the lumbar vertebral column, proximal femur, distal radius, distal tibia and knee area will be assessed. Additionally, geometric bone parameters of the tibia will be measured by using pQCT. All measurements will be done unilaterally. For the assessment of potential risk factors for reduced bone stiffness after spinal cord injury a questionnaire will be used.</brief_summary>
