	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess presence of myocardial ischemia by contrast stress echocardiography in patients with symptomatic non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) by CT-coronary angiography, and the clinical, vascular, biochemical and genetic markers of myocardial ischemia in such patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myocardial Ischemia in Non-obstructive Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is particularly common in women and associated with reduced quality of life and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The project will recruit patients with angina pectoris and non-obstructive CAD by CT- coronary angiography for further imaging with contrast stress echocardiography for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. Better characterization of patients with symptomatic non-obstructive CAD due to myocardial ischemia will be done by vascular assessment by tonometry, biochemical and genetic markers as well as quality of life questionnaire. This interdisciplinary project is expected to add new knowledge to the impact of multimodality cardiac imaging in improving diagnosis in patients with symptomatic non-obstructive CAD.</detailed_description>
