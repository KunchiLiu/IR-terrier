	<brief_summary>This open-label, non-randomized, single arm study will provide treatment or re-treatment with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) as monotherapy or in combination with Copegus (ribavirin) to patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. Patients who have received prior Pegasys monotherapy or combination therapy or who were considered eligible for treatment with Pegasys in previous donor protocols will be eligible to participate in this study. Treatment will be on investigator's decision according to the approved label for up to 48 weeks, with a 24-week safety follow-up.</brief_summary>
