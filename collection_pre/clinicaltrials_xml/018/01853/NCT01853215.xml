	<brief_title>Healthy Adult Volunteer Study of Intraosseous Infusion Using the Sternum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the presence or absence of extravasation when using the T.A.L.O.N. Intraosseous System to establish sternal intraosseous infusion. This study will also evaluate the user preference feedback received from the device operators about the ease of use and level of satisfaction with the device. Lastly, this study will evaluate the infusion flow rates obtained when using intraosseous infusion in the sternum.</detailed_description>
