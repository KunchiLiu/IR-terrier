	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to further investigate the safety of six different commercially used Gadolinium-containing contrast agents. The study has been developed to evaluate Gadolinium retention in patients with renal function ranging from stable to severely impaired renal function who had previously (i.e. before start of this study) received any of the six different contrast agents within a magnetic resonance contrast imaging procedure and who will now undergo a hip or knee replacement surgery to get bone and skin samples for analysis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to further investigate the safety of six different commercially used Gadolinium-containing contrast agents. In order to get a better view of internal organs such as the brain, joints and other body regions contrast agents containing Gadolinium are often administered during magnetic resonance imaging. Gadolinium-containing contrast agents were introduced in the 1980s, and presently many different products are in common use. Although these agents are well tolerated, in 2006 it was reported that some patients with severe renal failure undergoing magnetic resonance contrast imaging developed signs of a rare condition known as Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF). NSF is an extremely rare disease that has predominantly been reported in patients with severe kidney impairment, acute kidney insufficiency due to the hepatorenal syndrome (kidney failure in patients with advanced chronic liver disease) or in patients with acute kidney insufficiency, who have recently had or soon expect to have a liver transplantation. In order to collect additional clinical data on a global scale and across different agents in common use, this study was requested by the European Medicines Agency to further investigate whether Gadolinium in human bone and skin are retained for a long time after administration of Gadolinium-containing contrast agents. It was recommended to analyse bone and skin samples from patients undergoing a hip or knee replacement. Therefore, this study has been developed to evaluate Gadolinium retention in patients with renal function ranging from stable to severely impaired renal function who had previously received any of the six different contrast agents within a magnetic resoÂ¬nance contrast imaging procedure and who will undergo a hip or knee replacement surgery. For this study the patients will not be administered any research medication. Participating sites are located in Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, USA, Japan and Republic of Korea.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Main Patient scheduled for hip or knee replacement A minimum of 3 months have elapsed between Gadolinium contrast agent (GdCA) dose and scheduled hip or knee replacement. Patient belongs to one of the following subgroups with respect to the number of GdCA doses received and the status of their renal function: 1. patient has stable severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/ 1.73 m2) and has received one GdCA injection at the standard dose (0.025 mmol per kg body weight for Gadoxetic acid and 0.1 mmol per kg body weight for all other agents) or 2. patient has stable severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/ 1.73 m2) and has received more than one injection of the same GdCA or 3. patient has stable moderate renal impairment (eGFR within the range 30 to 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and has received one GdCA injection at the standard dose (0.025 mmol per kg body weight for Gadoxetic acid and 0.1 mmol per kg body weight for all other agents) or 4. patient has stable moderate renal impairment (eGFR within the range 30 to 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and has received more than one injection of the same GdCA or 5. patient has stable renal function (eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min /1.73 m2) and has received one GdCA injection at the standard dose (0.025 mmol per kg body weight for Gadoxetic acid and 0.1 mmol per kg body weight for all other agents) or 6. patient has stable renal function (eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min /1.73 m2) and has received more than one injection the same GdCA. Main Patient has received different GdCAs. Patient has received intraarticular GdCA or per any other noni.v. route. Patient has received any investigational product or has participated in any other clinical trial within 30 days prior to enrolling in this study.</criteria>
