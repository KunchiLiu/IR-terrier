	<brief_summary>Freezing of gait (FOG) means that patients cannot walk without any known causes, other than parkinsonism, which is very disabling symptom. Patients descirbe their feeling of the feet suddenly being glued to the floor. Transcranial magnetic stiumation is a noninvasive procedure using electromagnetic induction to stimulate brain. Transcranial magnetic stiumation (rTMS) can selectively change brain activity to enhance desired effects. The aim of this study is to the therapeutic effect of rTMS for the FOG.</brief_summary>
