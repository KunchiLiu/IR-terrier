	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well tivozanib works in treating patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Tivozanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tivozanib in Recurrent, Platinum-Resistant Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the clinical activity of tivozanib in patients with platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determining the potential survival advantage and characterizing the safety of single agent tivozanib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive tivozanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Patients must have recurrent or persistent, platinum resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma; platinumresistant disease is defined as a recurrence within 6 months of completing adjuvant, platinumbased chemotherapy Patients must have measurable disease or nonmeasurable (detectable) disease: Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or by clinical exam; or greater than or equal to 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Nonmeasurable (detectable) disease in a patient is defined in this protocol as one who does not have measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria but does have a cancer antigen 125 (CA125) greater than or equal to two times the upper normal limit within the last 60 days (confirmatory at baseline) and at least one of the following conditions: Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor Hypermetabolic lesions on positron emission tomography (PET) scan Patients with measurable disease must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy: Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [UTI]) Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy, biological/targeted (noncytotoxic) agents and immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the patient underwent any major surgery (e.g., major: laparotomy, laparoscopy, thoracotomy, video assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS); there is no restriction on minor procedures (e.g., minor: central venous access catheter placement, ureteral stent placement or exchange, paracentesis, thoracentesis) Patients must have had one prior taxane and platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organo platinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, noncytotoxic (biologic/targeted agents, such as bevacizumab) or extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment; there is no maximum number of prior regimens; patients may not have had any prior systemic therapy (including interleukin2, interferonalpha, chemotherapy, bevacizumab, investigational or licensed drug that targets vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] or VEGF receptors/pathway or are mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors) for treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting the release of personal health information Patients must meet preentry requirements A female is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential or as documentation of a negative pregnancy test prior to the start of the study treatment; sexually active premenopausal female subjects must agree to use adequate, highly effective contraceptive measures, while on study and for 45 days after the last dose of last study drug; effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD) plus one barrier method; (b) oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives plus one barrier method; or (c) 2 barrier methods; effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm) • Age &lt;
