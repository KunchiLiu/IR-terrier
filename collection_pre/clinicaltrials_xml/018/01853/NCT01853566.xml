	<brief_summary>The growth hormone (GH) secretion declines gradually with age, with studies demonstrating a progressive reduction of 14% secretion per decade of life beginning in the second decade. Other studies suggest a disruption in GH secretion in elderly people. These findings suggest a possible association between growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and the ageing process.GH replacement is well known to improve body composition, leading to a decrease in total body fat and an increase in lean body mass. However, GH replacement has only shown an effect on muscle strength in GH-deficient adults subjected to long-term GH therapy. Few studies have evaluated the effect of GH replacement on muscle strength in elderly people engaged in a program of exercise training.Our purpose is to evaluate the effect of GH therapy on muscle strength in healthy, non-sedentary men over 50 years old.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Growth Hormone Administration on Muscle Strength and Body Composition in Men Over 50 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At baseline, subjects are submitted to evaluation of GH secretion, testosterone level, body composition, and muscle strength. Absence of GHD and normal testosterone levels were necessary for the inclusion in the study. These parameters will be evaluated after 6 months of GH use x placebo.</detailed_description>
