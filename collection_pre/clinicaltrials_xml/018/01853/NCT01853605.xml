	<criteria>For entry in this study, subjects must have been enrolled in the 410 CA Clinical Study or 410 CARE Clinical Study under the inclusion criteria listed below and received NATRELLE速 410 Highly Cohesive Anatomically Shaped SiliconeFilled Breast Implants Styles 410 FM, FF, MM, or MF in 1 (for unilateral breast reconstruction or revision) or both breasts. Female, age 18 or older Present with one or more of the following conditions: Primary breast augmentation (i.e., no previous breast implant surgery) indicated for subject dissatisfaction, with size or shape of breast (e.g., mammary hypoplasia), asymmetry, ptosis, or aplasia Primary breast reconstruction (i.e., no previous breast implant surgery other than implantation of tissue expanders or contralateral augmentation for asymmetry) indicated, in the affected breast, for mastectomy for cancer, prophylactic mastectomy, or breast trauma (resulting in mastectomy) and for the unaffected breast, contralateral asymmetry (may be performed on the date of the mastectomy or the date when permanent implants are placed in the reconstructed breast) Breast implant revision surgery (i.e., removal and replacement of breast implants) indicated for previous augmentation or reconstruction with siliconefilled or salinefilled breast implants Has adequate tissue available to cover implants Willing to undergo MRI at the specified followup visit for subjects at MRI designated sites and be eligible for MRI (e.g., no implanted metal or metal devices, no history of severe claustrophobia) For entry in this study, subjects must have been enrolled in the 410 CA Clinical Study or 410 CARE Clinical Study and met the exclusion criteria listed below but not received any NATRELLE速 410 Highly Cohesive Anatomically Shaped SiliconeFilled 410 X or LStyle Breast Implants Does not have advanced fibrocystic disease considered to be premalignant without accompanying subcutaneous mastectomy Does not have existing carcinoma of the breast, without mastectomy Does not have abscess or infection in the body at the time of enrollment Is not pregnant or nursing Does not have any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes (e.g., HbA1c &gt; 8%), that is clinically known to impact wound healing ability Does not show tissue characteristics that are clinically incompatible with mammaplasty, such as tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue, compromised vascularity, or ulceration Does not have or is under treatment for any condition that may constitute an unwarranted surgical risk (e.g., unstable cardiac or pulmonary problems) Does not show psychological characteristics that may be incompatible with the surgical procedure and the prosthesis, such as inappropriate attitude or motivation (e.g., body dysmorphic disorder) Is not willing to undergo further surgery for revision, if medically required</criteria>
