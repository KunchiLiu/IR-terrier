	<brief_summary>The present study is conducted, to elucidate the value of follow-up examinations in endometrial cancer patients. Specifically the objective is to compare hospital-based follow-up examinations with instruction in self-referral in stage I endometrial cancer patients. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention, instruction in self-referral, will: - reduce fear of recurrence - improve quality of life - improve cost-utility - not affect disease-free survival.</brief_summary>
