	<brief_summary>Rivaroxaban is a substance developed for use in the treatment of blood coagulation disorders. Thrombosis (blood clots) can occur as a result of excessive coagulation activity in the blood vessels. Excessive coagulation activity can occur in children as well, and rivaroxaban is therefore being developed for the treatment of thromboembolic events in children and adolescents. As small children are often unable to swallow tablets, an oral suspension (mixture of a liquid containing finely distributed solids) has been developed which allows dosing according to body weight. The objective of this trial is to compare the bioavailability (proportion of a substance that remains available unchanged in the blood circulation) of a rivaroxaban oral solution with that of the rivaroxaban tablet approved for treatment. In order to evaluate the potential influence of food, the oral suspension containing 20 mg rivaroxaban will be taken after consuming food. In addition, the pharmacokinetics (concentrations of the drug and breakdown products (metabolites) in blood), safety and tolerability will be assessed.</brief_summary>
