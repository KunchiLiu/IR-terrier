	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to demonstrate that acellular dermal matrix, Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix, can reduce the surgical complexity and post-operative pain of breast reconstructions with implants by avoiding one more surgical step in the operating room.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of ADM in Reduction of Surgical Complexity of Breast Reconstructions With Implants (Nava)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to compare the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing mastectomy followed by a direct to implant breast reconstruction with Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix to patients undergoing a standard two-stage reconstruction without Strattice™ or any other mesh or tissue flap. Potential candidates for the study will be identified through routine practice. Women who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. A screening visit will take place maximally 30 days prior to surgery. Randomization will occur maximally 7 days prior to the mastectomy procedure. As some women may have to undergo bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction, the randomization scheme will ensure that both breasts will be reconstructed with the same surgical approach. The Day of Surgery consists of both a mastectomy and a breast reconstruction. The surgical site and the breasts will be evaluated on the day of hospital discharge and at postoperative days 14 and 30 for all patients after each hospital admission. During these visits, the breasts will be examined and an Acute Inflammatory Assessment (AIR) will be completed. In addition the breast flaps and incisions will be evaluated for signs of infection, seroma, hematoma or skin necrosis.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A study patient may be included if she: 1. Has planned to undergo a unilateral or bilateral mastectomy and have small to medium size breasts (predicted breast implant size maximally 500 gms), with none or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) ptosis, and healthy, sufficiently thick, wellvascularized skin flaps anticipated by the surgeon. 2. Is a clinically suitable candidate for immediate reconstruction with ADM based single stage reconstruction technique (as defined for use in the Experimental arm). 3. Is female, ≥18 years of age. 4. Is willing to undergo immediate breast reconstruction with subpectoralis muscle placement of a breast implant by either the Experimental (ADM based single stage) or the Control (TE/Implant based two stage) techniques. 5. Is in good health other than breast pathology and is suited to general anesthesia and planned treatments. 6. Understands and is willing to follow all aspects of the study protocol including randomization and has signed and dated the approved Informed Consent Form prior to any studyrelated procedures being performed. A study patient is excluded from participation to the study if she: 1. Has undergone breast radiation treatment and/or be preoperatively evaluated to require radiation treatment to the breast area during the course of the study. 2. Has collagenvascular, connective tissue, or uncorrectable bleeding disorders as determined clinically by the PI. 3. Has a BMI that is ≥ 35. 4. Has any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes, which is clinically known to impact wound healing ability. 5. Has an autoimmune disease, an immune deficiency, or is on immune suppression drugs other than any other current treatment for breast cancer. 6. Currently has an alcohol/substance abuse problem or have had a relapse within 1 year prior to screening visit. 7. Is pregnant, or lactating. 8. Has concomitant unrelated condition of breast/chest wall/skin that, as determined by the PI, could affect the surgical outcome (e.g. significant chest wall abnormalities including pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum). 9. Has an abscess or infection at the time of surgery. 10. Has undergone previous breast surgery with the exception of breast biopsy, cyst removal, and lumpectomy. 11. Has had a prior soft tissue support device implanted in the breast or is participating in another clinical trial with a breast related device (e.g. drains, expanders, implants). 12. Has a known pork allergy or is sensitive to polysorbate.</criteria>
