	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of kilovoltage (kV) cone beam CT imaging to track the dose delivered in head and neck cancer patients, to assess the benefit of cone beam CT to patients set-up for radiation treatment, to determine how shifts based on kV cone beam CT compare to the standard approach (orthogonal pair), and to develop remote access tools (preferably internet-based) so that the MD can approve these plans in real time.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators' secondary objectives for this study are to assess the possibility of using kV cone beam for treatment replanning as compared to standard the treatment planning, to determine the need and feasibility of adaptive radiation therapy, to develop concept of establishing cumulative DVH (C-DVH) with daily updates and compare it to planned DVH (P-DVH), to identify tolerance margins, to evaluate local control, locoregional control, distant metastasis, and overall survival, to assess patient quality of life,and to develop predictors of patients which may benefit from ART.</detailed_description>
