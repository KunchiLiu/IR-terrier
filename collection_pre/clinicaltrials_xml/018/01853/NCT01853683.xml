	<brief_summary>Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical problems in children, with 20-35% of patients having perforated by the time they present to a doctor. In these cases, the patient is often treated non-surgically with antibiotics. Once a patient has improved, it is not known whether it is better to perform an interval appendectomy (IA) or to continue a watchful waiting approach. The purpose of this trial is to determine if expectant nonoperative management (watchful waiting) is not inferior compared to IA management after successful conservative treatment of appendiceal mass at admission.</brief_summary>
