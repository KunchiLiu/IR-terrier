	<brief_summary>This pilot study seeks to evaluate initial evidence for the effect of L-methylfolate supplementation to OROS-Methylphenidate pharmacotherapy on ADHD symptoms and associated features in adults with ADHD, as well as tolerability of this supplementation. The investigators will conduct a 12-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with L-methylfolate supplementing open-label OROS-Methylphenidate (OROS-MPH). The investigators propose to examine 40 adult (ages 18-55) subjects satisfying the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD.</brief_summary>
