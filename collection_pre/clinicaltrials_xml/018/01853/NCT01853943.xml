	<brief_summary>Transradial coronary procedures are gaining in popularity worldwide. A possible complication of transradial approach is the occlusion of the radial artery that in most cases is asymptomatic. However the investigators do not know if the radial artery occlusion may impact over the muscle force of the hand or fingers. To evaluate if transradial approach for percutaneous coronary procedures may affect muscle force of the hand, thumb and index finger the investigators use a standardized hand-grip manometer and a pinch gauge before the transradial procedure, the day after the procedures and after few months.</brief_summary>
