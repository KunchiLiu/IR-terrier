	<brief_summary>Graft rejection has traditionally been one of the leading causes of cornea transplant failure. To help prevent rejection, corticosteroid eye drops are used for an extended period after transplant surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and side effects of different corticosteroid dosing regimens after endothelial keratoplasty (cornea transplant) surgery.</brief_summary>
