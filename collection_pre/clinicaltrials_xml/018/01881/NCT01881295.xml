	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare the effect of sources of potassium on uptake and the effect of potassium on blood pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioavailability of Potassium From Potatoes and Potassium Gluconate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will compare uptake of potassium from three different doses and sources; supplements (720, 1440 and 2160 mg) potatoes (720, 1440 and 2160 mg) or French fries (2160 mg). During 9 phases, participants will consume a controlled diet with the supplements, potato or french fries (every other week for 5 days). On the 4th day, blood and urine samples will be taken to monitor potassium uptake and excretion. Measures of blood pressure will be analyzed at defined time points throughout the intervention.</detailed_description>
