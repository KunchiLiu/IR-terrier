	<brief_summary>Study design: This is a 2-phase study. During the first phase, the investigators developed a contraceptive counseling intervention based on the principles of Motivational Interviewing, trained counselors, and conducted a small pilot study to develop skills and refine the intervention. The second phase is this feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare outcomes between: Group 1 - Women randomized to a 20-40 minute contraceptive counseling session based on the principles of motivational interviewing, vs. Group 2 - Women receiving usual clinic care. Population: Women, aged 15-29 years, presenting to the University of Chicago family planning clinic for termination of an unintended pregnancy. Hypothesis: A larger proportion of women who are randomized to receive the MI counseling intervention will be using very effective contraception 3 months after the intervention.</brief_summary>
