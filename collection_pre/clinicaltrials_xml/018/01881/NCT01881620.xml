	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The investigators would like to demonstrate that diagnosis performance of PET/CT scan without and with contrast agent (COMBI TEP), are equivalent or better than those of PET/ non enhanced CT scan (PET scan) associated with an enhanced CT scan. This research project is a pilot study given the few available data concerning this imaging exam reproducibility. This study is a prospective single center study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Enhanced CT Scan Performance in Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: We would like to demonstrate that diagnosis performance of PET/CT scan without and with contrast agent (COMBI TEP), are equivalent or better than those of PET/ non enhanced CT scan (PET scan) associated with an enhanced CT scan. This research project is a pilot study given the few available data concerning this imaging exam reproducibility. This study allows us to assess the feasibility of such a large-scale study, but also to evaluate COMBI TEP performance. From these estimates, we can then consider a comparative study to evaluate the performance of COMBI PET. This study is a prospective single center study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any patient with a cancerous disease for which PET scan is indicated in the SOR (Standards Options Recommendations) FDG PET 2003 updated in 2006 must be included in the trial, in the following locations: 1.

Esophageal cancer: initial staging. Pancreatic cancer Initial staging, Differential diagnosis with chronic pancreatitis. Liver cancer: differential diagnosis of liver metastases, cholangiocarcinoma and benign tumors in the case of an isolated hepatic localization. Digestive Endocrine tumors: staging in case of normal pentetreotide scintigraphy. 2. Lung cancer Initial staging, Diagnosis of lung isolated lesion &gt; 1 cm. 3.
