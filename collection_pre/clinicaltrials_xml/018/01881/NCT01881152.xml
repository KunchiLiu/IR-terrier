	<brief_summary>The starting hypothesis is that a multilevel educational campaign, specifically developed for the local community, can increase public stroke awareness and reduce pre-hospital delay. The effectiveness of such intervention will be evaluated according to a cluster randomized, stepped wedged design. The clusters are the four communities of the Area Vasta Emilia Nord, AVEN (Parma, Piacenza, Modena e Reggio Emilia). As analysis Units, we will consider the patients consecutively admitted to the six participating hospitals throughout the study period, for suspected stroke or transitory ischemic attack (TIA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Public Campaign to Increase Stroke Awareness in Reducing Prehospital Delay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a baseline 3 month period, the educational campaign will be sequentially launched in the four communities over four 3 month periods, according to a computer-generated list. The comparison will be the"usual care". Primary outcome measures: The proportion of patients arriving at the Emergency Department (ED) with suspected stroke or TIA within two hours. Secondary outcome measures: the proportion of patients with confirmed stroke or TIA diagnosis; the proportion of ischemic stroke patients evaluated for recominanat Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rTPA) therapy; the proportion of patients treated with rTPA; time interval between arrival at the ED and CT scan; for patients treated with rTPA, time interval between arrival at the ED and therapy initiation (door to needle time); death and disability (assessed as modified Rankin Score 3-5) at 1 and 3 month from stroke onset.</detailed_description>
