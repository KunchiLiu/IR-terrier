	<brief_summary>The goal is to build social/cultural, political/economic, and physical/built environments that will promote active play and intake of healthy food to prevent young child obesity in the Pacific Region. Our methods will support local culture in order to achieve this goal in these remote, underserved native populations. CHL will engage the community, and focus on capacity building and sustainable environmental change. The focus of the CHL community-based program is to promote healthy eating and to increase physical activity. In order to demonstrate effectiveness, the investigators will recruit and measure children in six communities selected in each of our jurisdictions in the Pacific. These represent intervention communities, comparison communities, and temporal communities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific objectives of our study are as follows. Objective. Decrease the prevalence of young child overweight and obesity by 5%; and its functional outcomes (decrease acanthosis nigricans by 5%, and increase sleep by 15 min/day); increase moderate to vigorous physical activity by 10 min/day and decrease sedentary behavior (screen time) by 10 min/day; increase healthy eating (fruit and vegetable intake by 1 serving/day, water intake by ½ cup/day; decrease sweetened beverage intake by ½ cup/day, through community-based primary prevention environmental interventions in PLGA regions. Objective. Measure 2-8-year-old children at baseline, 12 months and 24 months in selected communities to track behaviors and anthropometry that indicate healthy eating, physical activity, and BMI.</detailed_description>
