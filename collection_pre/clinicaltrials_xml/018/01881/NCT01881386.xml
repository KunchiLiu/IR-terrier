	<brief_summary>This project is designed to investigate whether measurements of lactate in tumours, made using a magnetic resonance technique similar to MRI, is an effective non-invasive method to detect whether some new targeted drugs are having their desired effect. The study hypothesis is that by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques, we will be able to observe changes in tumour lactate levels in vivo, in response to treatment.</brief_summary>
