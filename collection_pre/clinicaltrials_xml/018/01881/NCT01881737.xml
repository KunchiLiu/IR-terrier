	<brief_summary>This study will assess the tolerability and effectiveness of pregnenolone in the treatment of behavioral deficits in adults with autism. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring hormone found in the body which has been shown to help with the function of nerve cells. It is also shown to modulate the activity of certain brain receptors implicated in autism. We hope to examine the tolerability of pregnenolone in adults with autism.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will assess the tolerability and effectiveness of pregnenolone in the treatment of behavioral deficits in adults with autism. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring hormone found in the body which has been shown to help with the function of nerve cells. It is also shown to modulate the activity of certain brain receptors implicated in autism. Pregnenolone has been used safely in research studies involving individuals with schizophrenia. In the proposed trial, we hope to examine the tolerability of pregnenolone in adults with autism. We hope to see improvement in behavioral outcomes as measured by standardized behavioral measures. Further, we will measure concentrations of pregnenolone and related neuroactive compounds in the blood. The use of pregnenolone has been studied in a number of mental disorders but not autism. Thus, we hope the study will identify new avenues of research for the treatment of autism.</detailed_description>

Stable concomitant medications for at least 2 weeks; and 8. No planned changes in psychosocial interventions during the openlabel pregnenolone trial. 1. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSMIVTR) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder, not otherwise specified; 2. Prior adequate trial of pregnenolone; 3.

Pregnancy or sexually active females (as determined by a urinary pregnancy test in the beginning of the study); and 5. Subjects taking oil or fat based nutritional supplements will be excluded from the study unless they have been off these compounds for at least 4 weeks</criteria>
