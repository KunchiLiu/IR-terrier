	<brief_summary>This is a research study examining the effectiveness of pivotal response treatment group (PRTG) in targeting language skills in young children with autism. Research has demonstrated that behavioral interventions, such as Pivotal Response Training (PRT), lead to improvements in the core symptoms of autism. The purpose of this study is to further examine the effectiveness of teaching pivotal response treatment to parents of children with autism in a group format. To determine the effectiveness of pivotal response training group (PRTG) it will be compared to another parent education group by conducting a randomized controlled 12-week trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a research study examining the effectiveness of pivotal response treatment group (PRTG) in targeting language skills in young children with autism. Research has demonstrated that behavioral interventions, such as Pivotal Response Training (PRT), lead to improvements in the core symptoms of autism. Researchers have begun to develop strategies to investigate the effectiveness of teaching parents how to implement PRT in a group format, as opposed to an individual format. Preliminary data has demonstrated that teaching PRT in a group format has shown to be effective in teaching parents and increasing children's communication skills. The purpose of this study is to further examine the effectiveness of teaching pivotal response treatment to parents of children with autism in a group format. To determine the effectiveness of pivotal response training group (PRTG) it will be compared to another parent education group by conducting a randomized controlled 12-week trial. PRTG will aim to teach parents pivotal response training strategies, whereas the parent psychoeducational group (PEG) will aim to teach parents information with regards to assessment and treatment for children with autism. By conducting this research it will improve researchers understanding of group treatment options for individuals with autism and allow us to help in the development of therapeutic approaches that can meet the increasing service demands for families.</detailed_description>
