	<brief_summary>This study has been developed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of a commercial product (Nopalea) containing Prickly Pear Cactus Fruit Juice in healthy adults. The research method employs a double blind, placebo controlled, and time-series (repeat measures) design with high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (HS-CRP) serving as a marker for inflammation - testing for levels of CRP at time points: baseline (pre-test), 8 weeks (60 days) and 12 weeks (90 days). The final time point (i.e., 12 weeks) will serve as the post-test. It is expected that baseline CRP levels in healthy participants will decline.</brief_summary>
