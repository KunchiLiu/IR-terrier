	<brief_summary>The psychosocial development of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) can be challenged by many issues including family overprotection, impaired peer relationships, delayed progression into independent adulthood, and difficulties with career and future planning. One-third of patients have diagnosable mood or anxiety disorders and the prevalence of depression is 3 times that of the general Canadian population. Unfortunately, most adults with CHD and significant depression or anxiety do not receive mental health treatment. Despite an increasing awareness of the unique psychosocial concerns of this patient population by both health care providers and patients, there have been no interventions targeting psychosocial outcomes in the adult CHD population. Our quantitative and qualitative research suggests that patients themselves are very interested in psychological services that target their distinctive life experiences, are provided in a group setting, and emphasize coping and resilience. The overarching aim of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of a full-scale randomized controlled trial of a group intervention aimed at improving the psychosocial functioning, quality of life, and resilience of adults with CHD.</brief_summary>
