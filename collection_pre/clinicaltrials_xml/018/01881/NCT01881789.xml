	<brief_summary>Phase 1b: - To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oprozomib and dexamethasone administered in combination with lenalidomide or oral cyclophosphamide - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oprozomib and dexamethasone administered in combination with lenalidomide or oral cyclophosphamide Phase 2: - To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR) - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oprozomib and dexamethasone administered in combination with lenalidomide or oral cyclophosphamide Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates of oprozomib and variability in these estimates when administered in combination with dexamethasone and lenalidomide or oral cyclophosphamide - To estimate the duration of response (DOR) - To estimate progression-free survival (PFS)</brief_summary>
