	<brief_summary>It was hypothesized that resin infiltration in conjunction with fluoride varnish treatment of smooth-surface caries lesions in deciduous teeth reduce considerably the progression of treated caries lesions, compared to fluoride varnish therapy only.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial on Resin Infiltration in Deciduous Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To determine the number of patients, sample size was based on data from studies assessing fluoride varnish efficacy in children with deciduous teeth (progression of caries reduction by 33 %)(95% CI, from 19 to 48%, P&lt;0.0001); (Î± = 0.05; power = 80%; chi-square test2). The calculated sample size was 60 children and 120 white spot lesions. The initially planned number of participants was increased by expected 20% drop-out after 1 year, at least 72 children; the minimal number of treated active caries lesions amounted to 144. - Participants were allocated to the "test" and to the "control" group, respectively, by computer-generated randomly permuted blocks using package blockrand in R statistical software, sealed in envelopes. - The children were re-examined clinically by the same 2 examiners as at baseline evaluation. - Statistical analyses were performed using statistical software STATISTICA 10 (StatSoft), the level of significance was set at 0.05. Intra-examiner reliability was assessed by kappa statistics. - To compare average values between two independent groups U Mann-Whitney test was used (for e.g. to compare experimental group with the control one); Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for paired samples (for e.g. to compare first measurement with final measurement for experimental group). Comparison of fractions was conducted using Pearson's chi-square test of independence and Z test. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of normal approximation.</detailed_description>
