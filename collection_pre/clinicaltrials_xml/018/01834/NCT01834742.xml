	<brief_summary>This study is to investigate the effect of various modified low volume polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and ascorbic acid/ascorbate (PEG+ASC)-based gut cleansing solutions on stool output in healthy subjects. In addition, the study is to assess and compare the safety and tolerance of the modified PEG+ASC formulations following oral administration with the safety profile of MOVIPREPÂ®.</brief_summary>

Use of laxatives in the last 12 months or colon motility altering drugs in the last 6 months. 2. Use of any prescription or overthecounter (OTC) medication within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of investigational drug (excluding hormonal contraception, and occasional use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAID], acetaminophen or metamizole). 3. Donation or loss of 500 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to the first dose of investigational drug. 4. Any evidence of the history or presence of organic or functional gastrointestinal conditions (e.g. chronic constipation, irritable bowel syndrome [IBS], inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]). 5. Exhibiting relevant abnormal gastrointestinal motility according to clinical judgement in the past or now. 6. History or presence of any clinically significant acute illness within the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of investigational drug based on clinical judgement at screening and checkin evaluation. 7. Known glucose6phosphatase dehydrogenase deficiency. 8. Known phenylketonuria. 9. History or evidence of any clinical significant systemic cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonal, neurological, metabolic and/or renal organ dysfunction. 10. History of clinically significant drug allergy; history of atopic allergy (asthma, urticaria, eczematous dermatitis), known hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycols and/or ascorbic acid. 11. History or evidence of any clinically relevant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and hypertension. 12. Evidence of dehydration. 13. Any evidence for abnormal sodium or potassium levels or clinically significant other electrolyte disturbances. 14. Females who are pregnant, having a positive pregnancy test at screening and/or admission to unit or planning a pregnancy. Females not using reliable methods of birth control. 15. Clinically relevant findings on physical examination based on Investigator's judgement. 16. Clinically relevant deviations of laboratory parameters from reference ranges at screening or checkin evaluation. 17. Positive serology for chronic viral hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening. 18. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing or evidence of such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening or checkin evaluations. 19. Subjects who are unwilling to comply with the provisions of the study protocol. 20. Concurrent participation in an investigational drug study or participation within 3 month of study entry. 21. Subject has a condition or is in a situation, which in the Investigators opinion may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly. 22. Previous participation in the study.</criteria>
