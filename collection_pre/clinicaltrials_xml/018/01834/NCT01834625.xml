	<brief_summary>In this pilot study the investigators shall prospectively in a blinded fashion evaluate with Aβ PET and CSF Aβ42 and tTau or pTau in patients committed to shunt surgery and then investigate the relationship of these biomarkers with outcome on gait, cognition and urinary control improvement in the short term (3 months) and long term (1 year). The imaging agent will be provided by AVID. Furthermore the study will standardize imaging studies using florbetapir F 18 PET to provide information on amyloid burden.</brief_summary>
