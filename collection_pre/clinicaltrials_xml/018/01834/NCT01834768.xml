	<brief_summary>Kidney transplant recipients usually lose their graft by rejection or by immunosuppressive drugs toxicity. In kidney transplantation, calcineurin-inhibitors (including cyclosporine A) are widely used. Their renal toxicity could be divided between an acute toxicity (toxic arteriolopathy and toxic tubulopathy) and a chronic toxicity (hyaline arteriolopathy, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and glomerulosclerosis). Several animal models have shown the implication of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation in those toxic phenomenons. The use of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is useful regarding to the renal function and kidney histological damages. Several antagonists are available in France but none is indicated in kidney transplantation. Eplerenone appears to be the most selective molecule of the mineralocorticoid receptor and to have less adverse anti-androgenic effects than others molecules. Its principal adverse events are hyperkalemia and orthostatic hypotension. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, especially eplerenone, could be very useful in the prevention of the nephrotoxicity induced by calcineurin-inhibitors. Classically, eplerenone is contra-indicated in patients presenting with an impaired renal function, determined by a creatinine clearance under 50mL/min. Moreover, in France, a warning is especially notified for the association with cyclosporine A due to the fact that no study have been done in this context. The investigators study first the safety of the use of eplerenone in association with cyclosporine A in kidney transplant recipients. Then, if it is safe, the investigators will study its efficiency in a large randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
