	<brief_title>Reintervention-study After Previous Renal Denervation in Non-responding Patients With Severe Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal Denervation is a CE-certified opportunity for treating patients with therapy-refractory hypertension. In some patients it doesn't show a significant lowering of the blood pressure, so a repeated renal denervation is an option. In this study repeated renal denervation will be performed with the Recor Paradise Ultrasound Catheter. For the study no specific procedures are required which would exceed the standard renal denervation procedure with the CE-certified Recor Paradise Ultrasound Catheter System. There are no additional risks for the patient in consequence of participating in the study or the follow up procedures.</detailed_description>
