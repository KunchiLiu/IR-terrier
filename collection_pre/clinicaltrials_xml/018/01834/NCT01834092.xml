	<brief_summary>The investigators want to measure the degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx before and after clamping the aorta, in patients operated for a abdominal aortic aneurism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Glycocalyx in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>50 patients is scheduled for enrollment. Blood samples will be up taken before surgery, 10 min after reperfusion, at the end of surgery and the following morning. In addition the investigators are placing a renal venous catheter where blood samples will be up taken as mentioned above for the analysis of endothelial markers together with markers for kidney damage. The first 10 patient will act as part of a pilot study, where only measurement of the endothelial and renal failure markers will be performed.</detailed_description>
