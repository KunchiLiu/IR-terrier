	<brief_summary>Tetrabenazine has been shown to improve gating of abnormal visual stimuli and improve postural stability in Huntington disease (HD) patients as measured by computerized dynamic posturography testing. This study aims to elucidate whether partial dopaminergic depletion via low dose tetrabenazine has a similar effect on masking out of abnormal visual stimuli on the Stroop interference test.</brief_summary>
