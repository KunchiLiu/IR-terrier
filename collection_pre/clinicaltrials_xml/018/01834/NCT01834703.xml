	<brief_title>Uterine Artery Embolization(UAE) Versus High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound(HIFU) for Treatment of Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The usual management for symptomatic uterine fibroid is surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy), in the current study, uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a form of non-surgical and minimally invasive treatment, High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU) is a form of non-invasive treatment that can be completed as an out-patient within hours. Embolization causes ischaemia and shrinkage of the fibroid and therefore symptomatic relieve. HIFU is a medical technology that has been used for cancer treatment. Energy is delivered from outside the body in a non-invasive manner to produce heat energy that causes necrosis and shrinkage of the uterine fibroid thereby relieves the symptoms due to the fibroid. It does not involve radiation. The clinical effectiveness of HIFU for uterine fibroid is unknown, however, based on the knowledge of the clinical effectiveness of HIFU on liver cancer and pancreatic cancer, there is reasonable ground to believe that HIFU is effective for uterine fibroid.</detailed_description>
