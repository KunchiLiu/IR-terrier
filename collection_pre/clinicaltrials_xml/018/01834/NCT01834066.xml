	<brief_title>Study Safety and Efficacy of Bone Marrow Derived Autologous Cells for the Treatment of Muscular Dystrophy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscular dystrophy is a group of inherited disorders that involve muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue, which get worse over time. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition. slowly progress diseases.it causes Muscle weaknesses, Difficulty with motor skills ,Progressive difficulty walking.Breathing difficulties and heart disease,Frequent falls,weak limbs,lose motor Function.Begins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other areas of the body.Trouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs.</detailed_description>
