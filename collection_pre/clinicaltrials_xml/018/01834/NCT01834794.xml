	<brief_summary>This project aims to develop and test an intervention for the simultaneous treatment of cannabis use disorders and tobacco smoking. This is important because over 50% of adults seeking treatment to help stop cannabis use also smoke tobacco regularly, which decreases their chance for a successful treatment outcome and increases adverse acute and long-term psychosocial and health consequences. The proposed treatment will integrate existing computer-based behavioral interventions for cannabis and tobacco and use nicotine replacement medications to improve outcomes in this difficult to treat clinical population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeting Tobacco Cessation During Treatment for Cannabis Use Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 50% of persons seeking treatment for cannabis-use disorders (CUDs) regularly smoke tobacco. Combining tobacco with cannabis has become a common method of smoking cannabis. Similarities of use, and using together, can make quitting difficult. Stopping tobacco simultaneously with cannabis may be beneficial. Little scientific information currently addresses how to best target tobacco smoking during treatment for CUDs. Our long-term goal is to develop an effective protocol for intervening in tobacco smoking without changing cannabis outcomes. A two-phase, Stage 1 therapy development project will accomplish the following: First, a treatment protocol and manual will be developed that integrates a tailored intervention for tobacco smoking with an intervention for CUD (Aim 1). Utilization of web-based counseling programs will standardize delivery of the intervention and foster eventual dissemination. A pilot study will provide an initial test of acceptability and feasibility. Second, a Stage 1, proof-of-concept study will compare this intervention to one that targets CUD only (Aim 2). The hypotheses assert that the intervention (1) will be accepted by the majority of eligible participants (2) will result in more tobacco quit attempts and rates than the CUD-only treatment; and (3) will not adversely affect cannabis outcomes. Last, the project will evaluate the potential of specific moderators of outcomes to predict outcomes and inform subsequent treatment development efforts (Aim 3). If the hypotheses were confirmed, dissemination of this protocol would reduce adverse psychosocial and health consequences of tobacco or cannabis dependence. Findings will inform future development of prevention and intervention strategies.</detailed_description>
