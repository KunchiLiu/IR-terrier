	<brief_summary>The ever expanding breast cancer survivor population urges the health care system to develop (cost-)effective screening and management of convalescent care needs that can be easily implemented in conventional follow-up care. Internet-delivered systems may be well-equipped to meet these demands. The aim of the current study is to assess the effectiveness of a web-based support system. Key features of this system are patient self-screening of physical and psychosocial problems, tailored patient education on reported problems and self-referral to professional care. In this era of high internet usage, we expect that internet is a highly suitable medium to provide tailored support for breast cancer patients and will empower the patient to take control over their convalescence.</brief_summary>
