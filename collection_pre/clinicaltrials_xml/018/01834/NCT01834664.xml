	<detailed_description>Cerebral Palsy is commonest cause of Disability in India and south East Asia. This Study is devised to quantify the safety and efficacy of bone marrow derived autologous mononuclear cells(100 millions per dose)study enrolment duration 36 months sample size 100 patients should be treated (above 15 years of age) with cerebral palsy, in India. Primary outcome measures are improvement in walking ability and kinetic gait pattern as per as various clinical scales and also changes in the brain.</detailed_description>
