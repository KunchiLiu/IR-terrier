	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties and utility of new, computerized, neurocognitive measures in humans with depression, and humans with depression undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The benefits of the study outweigh the risk as there is the possibility of developing better computerized neurocognitive measures, and the risks are limited to no more than minimal test related fatigue and psychological stress. Depressed humans, depressed human participants undergoing ECT, and humans diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (age 18-85) will be invited to participate in this study. After providing informed consent participants will undergo a clinical psychiatric evaluation to confirm the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After the clinical psychiatric evaluation, participants will complete common and new neurocognitive measures. There will be a total of two testing visits (baseline, 1-month follow-up). The anticipated duration of the participant's involvement is no more than 2 study visits that can take place over a 4-day period (i.e., the clinical evaluation can occur on day 1 and the neuropsychological measures can be administered on day 2 of each study visit) equating to approximately 6-hours (3-hours each day) per study visit.</brief_summary>
