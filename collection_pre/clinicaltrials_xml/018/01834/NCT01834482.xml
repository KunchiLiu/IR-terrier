	<brief_summary>The modified Atkins diet (MAD) has been shown to be effective in treating children and adults with medically resistant seizures. A recent study in children showed that the use of KetoCal® once per day in addition to the MAD appeared to be beneficial when used during the first month. The investigators hypothesize that including a daily KetoCal® liquid tetrapak with one meal during the initial month of the MAD will produce urinary ketosis in more adult patients than the MAD alone and will lead to greater seizure reduction.</brief_summary>
