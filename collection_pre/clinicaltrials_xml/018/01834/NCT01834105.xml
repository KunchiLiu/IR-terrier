	<brief_summary>This study use RT-PCR and Western Blot technique to detect the expression of CLCF1 mRNA and protein in POP Kidney Yin deficiency group and healthy group to verify the relevance between CLCF1 and POP the kidney Yin deficiency syndrome.Through siRNA and overexpression,observe the mRNA and protein 's expression of CBP、JAK1、STAT4 and the protein phosphorylation of JAK1、STAT4 in JAK-STAT signal to reveal the CLCF1 regulate the CBP's mechanism.Use the Liuwei Dihuang Pills to detect the effect of treatment ,compare use or not the Liuwei Dihuang Pills to detect the mRNA and protein 's expression of CLCF1、CBP etc.Aim to clarify the POP kidney Yin deficiency molecular mechanism.</brief_summary>
