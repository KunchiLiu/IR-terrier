	<brief_summary>Conventionally, the outcome of liver transplantation is usually reported in terms of graft and patient survival, medical and surgical complications, but lack of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) that might be associated with immunosuppression complications (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction, osteoporosis, and de novo malignancy), disease recurrence, and rejections after transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uses of Immunosuppression Therapy in Patients With Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific aims are proposed to achieve in this study: 1. To compare graft and patient survival rate, incidence of treatment-related adverse effects between different patterns of immunosuppression combination among patients received post-liver transplant care in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (KCGMH), Taiwan. 2. To quantify the long-term health impacts of immunosuppressive regimens on quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), the loss-of-QALE relating to immunosuppression therapy, and types of transplantation.</detailed_description>
