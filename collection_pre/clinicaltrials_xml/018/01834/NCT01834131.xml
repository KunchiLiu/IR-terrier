	<brief_title>Hypertension Control Program in Argentina (HCPIA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Although the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive pharmaceutical treatment for the prevention and control of hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease and premature death have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, this scientific knowledge has not been fully applied in the general population, especially in low and middle income countries. Objectives: To test whether a comprehensive intervention program within a national public primary care system will improve hypertension control among uninsured hypertensive patients and their families in Argentina Design: Cluster randomized trial Study Participants: 1,888 study participants from 16 primary care clinics within a public primary care network in Argentina will be recruited. Patients with hypertension from the participating clinics, their spouses, and their adult hypertensive family members will be enrolled. Intervention: Eight clinics with approximately 944 participants will be randomly assigned to the comprehensive intervention group and 8 clinics with similar participants to the usual care group. The comprehensive intervention, including health care provider education, a home-based intervention among patients and their families (lifestyle modification and home blood pressure [BP] monitoring) delivered by community health workers, and a mobile health intervention, will last for 18 months. Outcomes: BP and other indicators will be measured at baseline and months 6, 12, and 18 during follow-up using standard methods. The primary outcome is a net change in systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to month 18 between the intervention and control groups among hypertensive study participants. The secondary outcomes are the proportion of hypertensive patients with adequate BP control (BP&lt;140/90 mmHg or &lt;130/80 mmHg if patient has diabetes or CKD), net BP changes in normotensive participants, and cost-effectiveness.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Clinics: The clinic is affiliated with the Remediar+Redes program. The clinic is located in urban poor areas according to the 2010 census data. The clinic has ≥1000 outpatient visits each month, so that sufficient participants can be recruited. The minimum distance between the selected clinics will be 10 kilometers to minimize the risk for contamination of the intervention. Physician visits and essential medications are free of charge to patients under all circumstances. The clinic has a high number of prescriptions for antihypertensive medications. The clinic employs community health workers. The clinic has general practitioners and nurses. The clinic has a history of good performance in the Remediar+Redes program. The clinic performs blood draws on patients when appropriate. Inclusion Criteria for Participants: Patients aged ≥21 years who received primary care from the participating clinics and have hypertension ( SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg on at least 2 separate visits) and their spouses (with or without hypertension) and/or any adult hypertensive family members (age ≥21 years) living in the same household will be included. Hypertension patients and their spouses and/or family members must be available for the first baseline nurse home visit. The index patient must have a cell phone that receives text messages. The family's homes must be located within 10 kilometers from the clinic. Exclusion Criteria for Participants: Hypertension patients who do not have a spouse or another adult with hypertension in the household.
