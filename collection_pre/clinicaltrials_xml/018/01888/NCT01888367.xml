	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, blinded, placebo and standard of care controlled study of the efficacy of a novel antibiotic containing gel compared to placebo gel in preventing surgical site infection after abdominal surgery. patients will be randomized to active or placebo gel in a double-blind manner. The gel will be applied a single time in the incision during closure at the end of surgery. A cohort of patients will also be randomized to standard of care, saline irrigation at prior to skin closure, in an open manner. The efficacy, safety and tolerability of the active gel will be assessed compared to the control group (combined placebo gel and standard of care groups). Patients will be randomized to DFA-02 active gel: placebo gel: standard of care in a 4:1:1 ratio.</brief_summary>

Participation within 30 days before the start of this study in any experimental drug or device study, or currently participating in a study in which the administration of investigational drug or device within 60 days is anticipated; 22. Unable to participate in the study for any reason in the opinion of the Principal Investigator; 23. Postsurgical life expectancy of less than 30 days; 24. Expected discharge from the hospital less than 3 days after surgery.</criteria>
