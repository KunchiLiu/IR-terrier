	<brief_summary>Can participation in group physical activity, such as a community-based organized group walk, help adult diabetes patients develop a physically active lifestyle? Can such engagement ultimately lead to an improvement in hemoglobin A1c? To address this question, the investigators have designed this pilot study with the aim to investigate the effect of community-based group walks among Joslin adults with diabetes on the development of a physically active lifestyle and glycemic level. The investigators hypothesize that participation in group walking events helps Joslin adults with diabetes engage in physical activity and improves glycemic control.</brief_summary>
