	<brief_title>The Effect of Prematurity and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy on Offspring Cardiovascular Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While the incidence of cardiovascular disease has reduced dramatically, coinciding with favourable changes in risk factors, cardiovascular disease remains the single largest cause of mortality and premature mortality in the United Kingdom. Identification of novel biological pathways that underlie disease susceptibility raises the potential for new early primary prevention strategies to complement classical management. There is particular interest in the role of early environment in 'programming' risk of cardiovascular disease in later life and growing evidence that various early life exposures impact cardiovascular health in the longer term. The investigators have therefore designed the EPOCH study to investigate whether those individuals born to hypertensive pregnancies and/or to a preterm birth demonstrate differences in the cardiovascular phenotype at birth, or whether they develop any differences over the first three months of life and whether this varies with other perinatal factors. This study also allows investigation of the short term impact of perinatal interventions used in this cohort. Comprehensive multi-modality non-invasive imaging measures of cardiovascular structure and function allow precise quantification of cardiovascular phenotype in this population.</detailed_description>
