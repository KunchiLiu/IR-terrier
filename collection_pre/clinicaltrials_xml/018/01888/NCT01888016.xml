	<brief_summary>The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of fascial manipulation treatment in terms to reduce pain and improve physical functionality after rotator's cuff surgery. The technique involves deep friction manipulation of fascia's specific spots. Distant from surgical site.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Fascial Manipulation in Rotator's Cuff Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effectiveness of fascial manipulation treatment associated with standard physiotherapies treatment in rotator's cuff surgery patients, we'll randomize about 60 patients for arm's of study. Both arm's will receive 10 standard physiotherapies treatments in 2 weeks while the experimental arm will receive 3 manual intervention on deep fascial tissues, according to fascial manipulation technique, providing a specific motor and manual assessment, and a deep manual intervention over specific fascial alteration. To evaluate the effectiveness of fascial manipulation treatment we'll use 2 type of outcome measure and we will compare the result of both arms of study.</detailed_description>
