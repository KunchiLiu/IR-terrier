	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate whether the anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) leads to an increase in cortical plasticity (change in motor evoked potentials (MEP) in mV).</brief_summary>
