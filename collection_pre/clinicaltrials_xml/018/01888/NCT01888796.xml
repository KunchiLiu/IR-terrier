	<brief_summary>Examination of the effect of Linagliptin versus placebo on diastolic function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diastolic dysfunction as assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. Furthermore the effect on serum levels of NT-pro BNP as a biomarker of heart failure will be investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diastolic Dysfunction in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment: The Patients will receive Linagliptin 5 mg QD or placebo for a period of 6 months. The echocardiography and 24h RR measurement will be performed at baseline and 6 months after initiation of the therapy. The blood chemistry (Glucose, HbA1c, BNP) will be evaluated at baseline as well as 3 and 6 months after initiation of the therapy.</detailed_description>

Recent (&lt;3 months) clinically significant coronary or cerebral vascular event 12. Pregnant females as determined by positive [serum or urine] hCG test at Screening or prior to dosing. Participants of childbearing age should use adequate contraception as defined in the study protocol. 13. Lactating females 14. The subject has a history of any other illness, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might pose an unacceptable risk by administering study medication. 15. The subject received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to inclusion into this study 16. The subject has any current or past medical condition and/or required medication to treat a condition that could affect the evaluation of the study 17. The subject is unwilling or unable to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol 18. The subject is mentally or legally incapacitated</criteria>
