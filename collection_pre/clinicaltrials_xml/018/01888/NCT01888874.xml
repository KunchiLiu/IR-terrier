	<brief_summary>- 595 patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis despite continued treatment with methotrexate will be evaluated for improvement of disease activity (efficacy) when taking GLPG0634 (3 different doses - 50mg, 100mg and 200mg daily -, each evaluated as QD and BID regimen) or matching placebo for 24 weeks. - During the course of the study, patients will also be examined for any side effects that may occur (safety and tolerability), and the amount of GLPG0634 present in the blood (Pharmacokinetics) as well as the effects of GLPG0634 on disease- and mechanism of action-related parameters in the blood (Pharmacodynamics) will be determined. Also, the effects of different doses and dose regiments of GLPG0634 administration on subjects' disability, fatigue, and quality of life will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-finding Study of GLPG0634 as add-on to Methotrexate in Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients (DARWIN1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Treatment duration will be 24 weeks in total. - However, at Week 12, subjects on placebo who have not achieved a 20% improvement in swollen joint count(SJC66) and tender joint count (TJC68) will be re-randomized (automatically via interactive voice/web response [IXRS]) to treatment to receive GLPG0634 100 mg q.d. or 50 mg b.i.d. doses in a blinded fashion, subjects on 50 mg q.d. who have not achieved a 20% improvement in SJC66 and TJC68 will be assigned to 100 mg q.d. and subjects on 25 mg b.i.d. who have not achieved a 20% improvement in SJC66 and TJC68 will be assigned to 50 mg b.i.d. All will continue the study until Week 24. - Subjects in the other groups will maintain their randomized treatment until Week 24.</detailed_description>

Stable doses of MTX as low as 10 mg/week are allowed when there is documented evidence of intolerance or safety issues at higher doses. current therapy with any diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) other than MTX, current or previous RA treatment with a biologic DMARD, with the exception of biologic DMARDs administered in a single clinical study setting more than 6 months prior to Screening (12 months for rituximab or other B cell depleting agents), where the biologic DMARD was effective, and if discontinued, this should not be due to lack of efficacy, previous treatment at any time with a cytotoxic agent, other than MTX, before Screening.</criteria>
