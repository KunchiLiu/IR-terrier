	<brief_summary>To study the NSCLC evolutionary genomic landscape between primary and metastatic sites and the dynamics of intratumour heterogeneity over time combined with detailed clinical, histopathological and cancer phenotypic annotation for each patient, in order to significantly improve the outcomes of NSCLC patients (e.g. reduce their chance of recurrence and improve survival).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TRAcking Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Evolution Through Therapy (Rx)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The importance of intratumour genetic and functional heterogeneity is increasingly recognised as a driver of cancer progression and survival outcome. Understanding how tumour clonal heterogeneity impacts upon therapeutic outcome, however, is still an area of unmet clinical and scientific need. TRACERx (TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy [Rx]), a prospective study of patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aims to define the evolutionary trajectories of lung cancer in both space and time through multiregion and longitudinal tumour sampling and genetic analysis. By following cancers from diagnosis to relapse, tracking the evolutionary trajectories of tumours in relation to therapeutic interventions, and determining the impact of clonal heterogeneity on clinical outcomes, TRACERx may help to identify novel therapeutic targets for NSCLC and may also serve as a model applicable to other cancer types.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written Informed consent Patients â‰¥18 years of age, with early stage IIIIA disease who are eligible for primary surgery Histopathologically confirmed NSCLC, or a strong suspicion of cancer on lung imaging necessitating surgery (e.g. diagnosis determined from frozen section in theatre) Primary surgery in keeping with NICE guidelines planned (see section 9.3) Agreement to be followed up in a specialist centre Performance status 0 or 1 Suspected tumour at least 15mm in diameter on preoperative imaging Any other current malignancy or malignancy diagnosed or relapsed within the past 5 years (other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer, stage 0 melanoma in situ, and in situ cervical cancer) Psychological condition that would preclude informed consent Treatment with neoadjuvant therapy for current lung malignancy deemed necessary Adjuvant therapy other than platinumbased chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) or syphilis infection. Sufficient tissue, i.e. a minimum of two tumour regions, is unlikely to be obtained for the study based on preoperative imaging.</criteria>
