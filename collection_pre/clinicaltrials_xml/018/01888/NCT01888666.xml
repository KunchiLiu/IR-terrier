	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the periodontal effects during rapid palatal expansion (RPE) or slow palatal expansion (SPE) and to compare them by means of periodontal indices, in order to establish the possible differences and advantages of one of these treatments in periodontal terms. Materials and methods: 10 patients will selected and submitted to RPE treatment; other 10 patients will selected and submitted to SPE treatment. The patients will treated with the Haas appliance. In both the groups the periodontal clinical indices (plaque index, PI; papillary bleeding index, PBI; probing pocket depth, PPD) will collected three times during the treatment (before, during and at the end). All measurements will performed by the same examiner. A descriptive statistical analysis will conducted. The paired samples Student's T test will used to evaluate the intra-group differences between t1 and t2. The unpaired samples Student's T test will used to evaluate between groups differences at t1 and t2. The significance level will set at 95%.</brief_summary>
