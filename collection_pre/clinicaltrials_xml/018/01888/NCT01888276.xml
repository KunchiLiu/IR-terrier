	<brief_summary>The pathophysiology of compulsive disorders as gambling could be close to behavior problems encountered in Parkinson's disease associated with a hyperactivity of the motivational system. Thanks to the words generation test, which reflects the cortico-subcortical loop functioning, involved in motivation, we want to evaluate and compare using tools (words generation and behavioral tests) the motivational functioning of gamblers and healthy volunteers that we can then compare to that of Parkinson's patients with and without behavioral hyperdopaminergic disorders which were explored in another study.</brief_summary>
