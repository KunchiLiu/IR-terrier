	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Efficacy of 『Opast Tablet』for Neurologic Claudication in Patients With Lumbar Spinal Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects who provided written consents voluntarily after receiving a sufficient explanation about this trial will be assigned to one of groups(study group; limaprost, comparative group 1; pregabalin, comparative group 2; limaprost+ pregabalin) by randomization at the rate of 1:1:1.

At each site visit point, the improvement effectiveness will be comparatively evaluated by evaluation of following endpoints; Efficacy endpoints: ICD(initial claudication distance) at treadmill test (speed:3km/hr, grade:0%), VAS in pain on lower extremities, EQ-5D and ODI Safety endpoints: Vital signs, hematology/blood chemistry tests and adverse events, etc.</detailed_description>
