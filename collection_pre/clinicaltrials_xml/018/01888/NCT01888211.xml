	<brief_summary>The mechanisms through which omega-3 fatty acids reduce adverse cardiac events remain uncertain. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on endothelial vasomotor function, endogenous fibrinolysis, and platelet and monocyte activation in patients with coronary heart disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Omega 3 Fatty Acids on Vascular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patients with a previous myocardial infarction were recruited into a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (2g/day for 6-weeks). Peripheral blood was taken for analysis of platelet and monocyte activation, and forearm blood flow was assessed in a subset of 12 patients during intrabrachial infusions of acetylcholine, substance P and sodium nitroprusside. Stimulated plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentrations were measured during substance P infusion.</detailed_description>
