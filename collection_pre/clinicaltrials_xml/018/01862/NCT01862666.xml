	<brief_summary>Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a pre-neoplastic condition formed by the metaplasia of the normal squamous mucosa of the distal esophagus into a specialized intestinal mucosa. Its development is mostly associated with chronic injury from gastroesophageal reflux. BE is widely considered the leading risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) can be thought of as an analogous technique to ultrasound, however, instead of producing an image from the scattering of sound waves, it utilizes optical scattering based on differences in tissue composition to form a two-dimensional image. The benefit of VLE over ultrasound is that it is capable of generating cross-sectional images of tissues with an axial-resolution of up to 10 micrometers, which is comparable to low-power microscopy. The proposed trial will evaluate the ability of physicians to use VLE to visualize high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or intramucosal adenocarcinoma (IMC) in both the ex-vivo and in-vivo setting and correlate those images to standard histology of endoscopic mucosal resection specimens as the gold standard.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy (VLE) and Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) in Patients With Barrett's Dysplasia or Intramucosal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis of dysplasia and early adenocarcinoma in BE remains challenging. At present, endoscopy with biopsy of suspected BE lesions is the only available method. However, the endoscopic recognition of early dysplasia in BE relies on the subjective visual recognition by an endoscopist. The subtle mucosal variations and early dysplastic changes in the esophagus may easily be missed. The development of a wide-field, high resolution endoscopic microscopy could enhance the early detection and treatment of dysplasia in BE.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Adenocarcinoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Males and females over the age of 18 years. Patients with either suspected or confirmed Barrett'sassociated dysplasia or intramucosal adenocarcinoma presenting for endoscopy likely requiring EMR. Only enbloc resections will be investigated, requiring lesions with a maximum diameter of 15 mm with a Paris classification of 0IIa, b, c, or a combination. Ability to provide written, informed consent. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to take a pregnancy test. Patients on anticoagulation. Patients with esophageal varices that preclude either mucosal resection or biopsies. Presence of an esophageal mass that precludes full distention of the balloon from the NvisionVLE Catheter. Patients with esophageal strictures that would prevent adequate expansion of the balloon from the NvisionVLE Catheter. Patients with known inflammatory disease, esophageal tears or ulcers, which would prohibit full distention of the balloon from the NvisionVLE Catheter. Patients with known eosinophilic esophagitis. Patients that are pregnant. Patients with a history of hemostasis disorders*. Patients with esophagitis above grade A. Hemostasis disorders will include, but will not be limited to: patients with hemophilia or other congenitally acquired clotting factor deficiencies, patients with cirrhosis with coagulopathy, patients known to have thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000 plt/ul) and individuals with von Willibrand's disease or other known platelet malfunction disorders.</criteria>
