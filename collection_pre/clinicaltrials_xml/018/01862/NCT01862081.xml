	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral GDC-0032 administered in combination with either docetaxel or with paclitaxel. Patients treated with the GDC-0032 and docetaxel have HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients treated with the GDC-0032 and paclitaxel combination have human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. There are two potential stages within each arm of this study: a dose-escalation stage (Stage 1) and a dose-expansion stage (Stage 2). Once the maximum tolerated dose of GDC-0032 in a given arm has been established from dose escalation, additional patients with each combination will be enrolled in Stage 2.</brief_summary>
