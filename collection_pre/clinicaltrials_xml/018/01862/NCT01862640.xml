	<brief_title>A Study of Two Fixed-doses of Brexpiprazole in the Treatment of Subjects With Agitation Associated With Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, are core features in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and develop in the majority of dementia subjects. The presence of agitation in subjects with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden not only on subjects and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system. This is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in the treatment of subjects with agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. The trial consists of a continuous 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day follow-up. The trial population will include male and female subjects between 55 and 90 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are residing either in an institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where the subject is not living alone.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female subjects 55 to 90 years of age, inclusive, at the time of informed consent. Subjects who are residing at their current location for at least 14 days before screening and are expected to remain at the same location for the duration of the trial. Subjects with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDSADRDA. Subjects with a MMSE score of 5 to 22, inclusive, at screening and baseline visits. Subjects with onset of symptoms of agitation at least 2 weeks prior to the screening visit. Subjects with a score of â‰¥ 4 on the agitation/aggression item of the NPINH at the screening and baseline visits. Subjects who require pharmacotherapy for treatment of agitation per the investigator's judgment, after an evaluation for reversible factors (eg, pain, infection, polypharmacy) and a trial of nonpharmacological intervention. Subjects must have a previous MRI or CT scan of the brain, which was performed after the onset of symptoms of dementia, with findings consistent with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Subjects with dementia or other memory impairment not due to Alzheimer's disease Subjects with a history of stroke, welldocumented transient ischemic attack, pulmonary or cerebral embolism. Subjects who currently have clinically significant neurological, hepatic, renal, metabolic, hematological, immunological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or psychiatric disorders. Subjects who have been diagnosed with an Axis I disorder (DSMIVTR criteria) Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension Subjects with uncontrolled insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) Subjects with epilepsy or a history of seizures Subjects considered in poor general health based on the investigator's judgment.</criteria>
