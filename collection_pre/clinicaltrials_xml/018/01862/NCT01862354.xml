	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to compare the postoperative analgesic effect of a continuous wound infusion of local anesthetics and a sole transverse abdominal plan (TAP) regional block in the surgery of Abdominoplasty Combined With Flank Liposuction. Local anesthetics products used are ropivacaine combined with clonidine. Similar amount of local anesthetics and clonidine are used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analgesic Effect Between TAP Block and Continuous Wound Infusion in Abdominoplasty Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a first group, patients receive, after induction of anaesthesia and before surgery, a TAP block (transverse abdominal plan block) with 3mg/kg Ropivacaine 0.5% (maximum 200 mg) and 150 microg Clonidine. In a second group, before skin closure, a multiholes catheter was inserted beyond the skin. 20 mg Ropivacaine 0.2% added with 150 microg Clonidine was injected as bolus dose through this catheter followed by a continuous infusion of Ropivacaine 0.2% 10ml per hour during the following 9 hours (total dose of 200 mgr).</detailed_description>
