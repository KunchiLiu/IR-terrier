	<brief_summary>Recruitment to phase I of the PANTHER trial is complete. In phase II, the combination of AZD8931 and FOLFIRI will be compared to FOLFIRI alone, to determine the efficacy of the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial of Antagonism of HER in GI Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PANTHER is a registered phase I/randomised phase II trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer. The phase II part of the study will be a randomised, controlled, 2 arm trial. Patients will be randomised to: receive AZD8931 (an EGFR/ERBB inhibitor) in combination with FOLinic acid, Fluorouracil and IRInotecan (FOLFIRI), or FOLFIR alone (control group). Treatment will be given in two-weekly cycles. Phase II's primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of AZD8931 plus FOLFIRI alongside FOLFIRI alone using the percentage change in tumour size from baseline at 12 weeks after start of treatment.</detailed_description>
