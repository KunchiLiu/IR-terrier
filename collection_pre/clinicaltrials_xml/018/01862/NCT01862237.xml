	<brief_summary>This project focuses on the physiopathology of left ventricular remodeling associated with type II diabetes in patients with aortic valve stenosis referred for surgical aortic valve replacement. The main objective is to compare the reverse left ventricular remodeling between patients with type II diabetes and case-control patients without diabetes at one(1) year after surgical aortic valve replacement. The secondary objectives are : 1. assess the influence of type II diabetes on left ventricular remodeling in patients presenting with aortic valve stenosis, 2. assess the predictive value of myocardial fibrosis and other LV characteristics present prior to aortic valve surgery on the LV reverse remodeling and their influence on cardiovascular events at one (1) year after surgery, 3. assess the influence of type II diabetes on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality post aortic valve surgery. The investigators main hypothesis is that patients with type II diabetes and aortic valve stenosis requiring aortic valve replacement have poorer LV function and less favorable post surgery clinical outcomes than patients without type II diabetes.</brief_summary>
