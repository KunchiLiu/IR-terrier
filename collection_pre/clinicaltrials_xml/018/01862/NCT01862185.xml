	<brief_summary>Sepsis is a serious clinical condition with a considerable morbidity and mortality. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a good biomarker for early diagnosis and infection monitoring. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of semi-quantitative PCT test to the empirical antibiotic initiation time, the appropriateness of empirical antibiotics and mortality in septic patients. The hypothesis of the study are : - There is an effect on mortality between septic patients who do and do not do semi-quantitative PCT examination - There is an effect on empirical antibiotic initiation time between septic patients who do and do not do semi-quantitative PCT examination - There is an effect on appropriateness of empirical antibiotic between septic patients who do and do not do semi-quantitative PCT examination Study design is randomized diagnostic trial which is also a pragmatic trial.</brief_summary>
