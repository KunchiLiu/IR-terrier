	<brief_title>The Usefulness of Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Biliary Drainage With a Newly Designed Hybrid Metallic Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage with a fully covered metallic stent was a safe and effective method in patients with malignant biliary obstructions and had a comparatively long patency duration. Nevertheless, the significant rate of distal stent migration cannot be ignored, suggesting the need for a newly designed metallic stent for endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage.</detailed_description>
