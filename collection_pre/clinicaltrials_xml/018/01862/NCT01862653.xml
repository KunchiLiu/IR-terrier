	<brief_summary>Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has emerged as a significant problem among troops returning from combat zones. A majority of these veterans will report difficulty maintaining or initiating sleep. The purpose of this research will be to conduct a prospective, randomized, wait list controlled, small scale feasibility study to examine if the use of an auricular acupuncture regimen improves quality of sleep for Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF)veterans with PTSD receiving standard PTSD treatment. Hypothesis: Objective and subjective sleep disturbances and sleep quality will be improved in OIF/OEF veterans who receive auricular acupuncture in conjunction with standard PTSD therapy or standard therapy alone.</brief_summary>
