	<brief_summary>Record the renal resistive index and hemodynamic parameters ( record the cardiac output and stroke volume if the patient's next to kin agree to undertake a PiCCO monitoring ) before and after resuscitation for severe sepsis or septic shock patients, to determine whether the changes of resistive index or hemodynamic parameters, especially the cardiac output can be a better parameter to predict AKI</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Resistive Index and Cardiac Output Changes During Resuscitation Predict the Occurrence of Acute Kidney Injury in Septic Shock Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Purpose: To examine whether the resuscitation-induced changes of renal resistive index or hemodynamic parameters has the superiority as a valid tool to evaluate the renal perfusion improvement and whether the changes can better predict AKI occurrence in severe sepsis or septic shock patients. - Methods: Measure the renal resistive index and take record of hemodynamic parameters (use a PiCCO monitoring to measure cardiac output if the patient's next to kin agree to undertake such a catheter ) before and after successful resuscitation for severe sepsis or septic shock patients, followup to determine the occurrence of AKI and mortality. - Hypothesis: The changes of resistive index or cardiac output during shock resuscitation may be a better parameter to evaluate renal perfusion and predict AKI, and may have a better value to guide renal protective therapy in septic shock.</detailed_description>
