	<brief_summary>This study will randomize hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) to usual care, or an electronic alert intervention. The electronic alert will be in the form of a text page that will be sent to the covering clinician and unit pharmacist once per patient with AKI at the time lab results are uploaded. The investigators hypothesize that such an alert will improve outcomes in these patients.</brief_summary>
