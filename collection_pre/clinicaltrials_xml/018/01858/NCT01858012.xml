	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that the means by which HCV induces glucose intolerance is through impairment of B-cell function and compensatory hyperinsulinemia in predisposed Latinos with insulin resistance and that HCV eradication improves these abnormalities. It is also hypothesized that moderate alcohol consumption impact insulin sensitivity and secretion with Latinos with or without HCV infection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study hypothesis is that the means by which HCV induces glucose intolerance is through impairment of B-cell function and compensatory hyperinsulinemia in predisposed Latinos with insulin resistance and that HCV eradication improves these abnormalities. This study addresses changes in the metabolic parameters over time. In addition, it is hypothesized that moderate alcohol consumption impacts insulin resistance and secretion and 30 patients with or without HCV who drink alcohol moderately will have discontinuation of alcohol use for 6 weeks and have metabolic testing before and after alcohol discontinuation.</detailed_description>
