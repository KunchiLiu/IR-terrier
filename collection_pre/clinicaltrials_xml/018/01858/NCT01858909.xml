	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES. To establish the therapeutic efficiency of melatonin in adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Specifically: 1. To evaluate the survival to 28 days of mechanical assisted ventilation, days with vasoactive drugs, need of hemodialysis-hemofiltration, superinfection and evolution towards the failure of other organs. 2. To evaluate, waiting for reduction under the influence of the treatment with melatonin, : 1. clinical - analytical parameters of sepsis; 2. levels of cytokines; 3. oxidative and nitrosative stress; 4. acute-phase proteins (APP), specially of the ITIH4; 5. immune response; 6. endocrine response. METHODOLOGY. Patients will be randomized in two groups, n = 55 in each group: 1) treatment with melatonin 30mg/12 hours 28 days; 2) placebo. Determinations: a) clinical - analytical parameters relative to the sepsis; b) melatonin plasmatic levels; c) quantification of malonyldialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal, protein carbonyl content, nitrites, erythrocyte membrane fluidity, and superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activity; d) Interleukins-1,2,4,5, 6, 7,8,10,12,13, IFN-γ; TNF-α and GM-CSF; e) acute-phase proteins: PCR, haptoglobin, Apo A-I, α1-GPA and ITIH4; f) lymphocytes T, B, NK, T CD4, and T CD8, and immunoglobulins; g) cortisol, aldosterone, ACTH, ADH, insulin, glucagon and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Data will be analyzed following a prospectively define plan and by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.</brief_summary>
