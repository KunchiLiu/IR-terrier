	<brief_title>Effect Of Capros Supplementation On Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors In Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A non-randomized, longitudinal study to determine the effect of Capros supplementation on a lipid profile, platelet aggregation and high-sensitivity C - reactive protein in 30 volunteers at risk for cardiovascular disease. -Herbal Polyphenols/Antioxidants: Role in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: Phenolic compounds are dietary antioxidants found in plants that are shown to inhibit LDL oxidation, inhibit platelet aggregation and adhesion, decrease total and LDL cholesterol, and induce endothelium-dependent vaso-relaxation. [Lapointe, Vita, and Mendes]. Epidemiologic studies suggest that higher polyphenol intake from fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk for cardiovascular disease. Among the numerous plausible mechanisms by which polyphenols may offer cardiovascular protection, improvement of the endothelial function and inhibition of angiogenesis and cell migration and proliferation in blood vessels have been the focuses of recent studies. Antioxidants in polyphenols, in addition to protecting LDL cholesterol against oxidation, may act at a vascular cell level by limiting cellular production of reactive oxygen species, and, thus, cell-mediated LDL oxidation. In traditional Indian medicine, the gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica) has been used for thousands of years as an effective source of polyphenols and antioxidants. "P. emblica is considered beneficial against various diseases namely cancer, diabetes, liver treatment, and various other diseases."[Hiraganahalli]. CaprosÂ®, from Natreon, Inc., is a cascading antioxidant ingredient derived from Phyllanthus emblica. It has been used in cosmetics and food-and-beverage formulations in many countries, and, based on extensive scientific research, also shows particular promise as a dietary supplement.</detailed_description>

Candidates for inclusion into the study will not include individuals as defined in 45 CFR 46 Subparts B, C and D, nor from any other population which may be considered vulnerable. Pregnant women are excluded to minimize the risk to such individuals (and fetus) and to decrease statistical variability and to minimize potential of confounders.</criteria>
