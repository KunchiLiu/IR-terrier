	<brief_summary>Aim: To evaluate a culturally-adapted method of lifestyle assessment, counseling, and education among Arab people with diabetes who have varying literacy skills using an interactive computerized tool and graphically-enhanced patient logs for dietary and physical activity. The investigators hypothesize that this tool will: a) increase patients' knowledge and understanding of the role of lifestyle (diet and physical activity) in diabetes management; b) improve patients' engagement in monitoring dietary intake and physical activity; c) improve dietary and physical activity behaviors and self-blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) practices; d) improve glycemic control; and, e) improve the efficiency of lifestyle assessment, education and counseling while increasing patients' engagement in the process.</brief_summary>
