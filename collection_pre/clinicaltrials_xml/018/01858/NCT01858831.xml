	<brief_summary>This study will be a single-center, phase I, randomized, open, in fed condition, parallel, single dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and the safety, tolerability of Atovaquone/proguanil combination tablets and atovaquone suspension in Japanese healthy male subjects. Serial blood samples will be collected for the determination of the plasma concentration of atovaquone, proguanil and cycloguanil after dosing of atovaquone 1000mg/proguanil 400 mg and the plasma atovaquone concentration of atovaquone 750 and 1500 mg. Safety assessments will be performed for each treatment group. CYP2C19 contribute to proguanil metabolism. CYP2C19 genotype will be determined in atovaquone/proguanil dosing group.</brief_summary>
