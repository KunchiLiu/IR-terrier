	<brief_summary>This Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study is designed to determine whether injection of autologous fibroblasts can increase the mobility (decrease the restriction) of burn scars. The study will assess the effects of azficel-T (autologous fibroblasts) in subjects who have a unilateral burn scar that is no deeper than the fascia (i.e., underlying structures including ligament, tendon, muscle, and bone must not contribute to the restriction) and that is either: 1. An axillary scar causing 20-60% restriction of shoulder adduction 2. An anterior elbow scar causing 20-60% restriction of elbow extension 3. A dorsal or palmar lesion of a single finger causing 20-60% restriction of flexion or extension Subjects will each receive 2 injections of azficel-T or placebo administered 14 days (± 7 days) apart (depending on cell availability) and will be followed for efficacy (including range of motion measurements, scar pain and ability to perform activities) to Visit 7 and for safety to Visit 9 at 1 year.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject is at least 18 years of age 2. Subject has a unilateral burn scar of a jointed area (i.e., finger, elbow, shoulder) that is no deeper than the fascia (i.e., underlying structures including ligament, tendon, muscle, and bone must not contribute to the restriction) and that is either: 1. An axillary scar causing 2060% restriction of shoulder abduction 2. An anterior elbow scar causing 2060% restriction of elbow extension 3. A dorsal or palmar lesion of a single finger causing 2060% restriction of flexion or extension 3. Subject's burn scar to be treated is &lt;100 sq cm in size 4. Injury occurred ≤ 36 months prior to screening 5. By the Investigator's assessment, physical therapy will not provide significant continuous improvement to the range of motion of the subject's joint 6. Subject agrees to maintain any current physical therapy regimen for the duration of the study 7. Subject must be able to provide written informed consent and comply with the study requirements 8. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the screening visit and prior to the first treatment, and must agree to use a reliable means of birth control for the duration of the study 9. Subject has healthy, nonscarred post auricular skin area suitable for biopsy 10. Subject must have a normal complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry panel within 90 days prior to enrollment 1. Restrictive burn scars that are primarily classified as keloid scars 2. Subjects for whom a post auricular biopsy cannot be collected for azficelT production 3. Sunburn or sun damage in the area that will be used for biopsy 4. Plans to initiate any other new scar therapy during the study period 5. Treatment with an investigational product or procedure within 30 days prior to study enrollment or plans to participate in another clinical trial during the course of this study 6. History of active autoimmune disease or organ transplantation 7. Diagnosis of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma, unless successfully treated or in remission for a minimum of 6 months 8. Known genetic disorders affecting fibroblasts or collagen, such as achondroplasia, osteogenesis imperfecta, epidermolysis bullosa, ataxiatelangiectasia, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, etc. 9. Active systemic infection 10. Requires chronic antibiotic or steroidal therapy 11. Any conditions that are considered by the Investigator to be contraindications to biopsy or injection 12. Pregnant or lactating women, or women trying to become pregnant during the study 13. Subject has any disorder that may prevent compliance, such as history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse, significant mental or nervous disorder or other illness that would, in the Investigator's opinion, interfere with the study 14. Presence of other disease or condition that would result in impairment of the range of motion of the extremity, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or stroke</criteria>
