	<brief_summary>The investigators conducted a prospective open unblinded clinical four-arm evaluation of Complementary and Alternate Medicine (CAM) interventions on children 1-12 years of age who were undergoing imaging by Medical Resonance Imaging(MRI) and receiving parenteral sedation. Children were assigned to active music therapy, passive music therapy, distraction therapy, and no intervention; measures included doses and numbers of sedation medications, time of sedation, and salivary levels of the stress hormone cortisol and pro-inflammatory cytokines, before and immediately after the intervention was completed. The Time Frame for the outcome measures are at the start of the intervention and immediately following the procedure (generally about 150 minutes). No further follow up was conducted.</brief_summary>
