	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well T cell depleted donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant works in preventing graft-versus-host disease in younger patients with high risk hematologic malignancies. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Removing a subset of the T cells from the donor cells before transplant may stop this from happening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selective Depletion of CD45RA+ T Cells From Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Grafts in Preventing GVHD in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the time to discontinuation of systemic immunosuppression in pediatric recipients of cluster of differentiation 45RA positive (CD45RA+) T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT). II. Estimate the probability of graft failure in pediatric recipients of CD45RA+ T-cell-depleted PBSCT. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate and compare to an appropriate historical cohort the probability of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (National Institutes of Health [NIH] criteria) requiring treatment with systemic pharmacological immunosuppression in pediatric patients who receive CD45RA+ T cell depleted PBSC. II. Estimate the probability of acute GVHD grade II-IV. III. Estimate the probability of steroid refractory acute GVHD. IV. Evaluate immune reconstitution. V. Estimate the probability of transplant-related mortality by day 100. VI. Estimate the probability of relapse. OUTLINE: CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -10 to -7, receive thiotepa intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days -6 and -5 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2. TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo CD34+ enriched, CD45RA+ T cell-depleted allogeneic PBSCT on day 0. POST-TRANSPLANT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally (PO) every 12 hours beginning on day -1 and continuing through day 50 with taper. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
