	<brief_title>Study To Evaluate D-Ribose For The Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of D-ribose administered via peripheral intravenous line for 24 hours to stabilized hospitalized patients following standard of care treatment for acute decompensation of CHF, followed by oral dosing of D-ribose three times a daily through the remainder of the inpatient hospital stay and outpatient period of 3 months. Subjects will complete Pretreatment Screening procedures only after the Investigator has established that they have met the pre-specified criteria for stabilization of heart failure, and be randomized to treatment no more than 7 days after admission to the hospital.</detailed_description>
