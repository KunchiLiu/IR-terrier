	<brief_summary>Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN) is a common respiratory disorder affecting late preterm and term babies caused by lung edema resulting from delayed absorption of fetal alveolar lung fluid. The investigators hypothesize that ENAC expression will be up-regulated as a result of administration of corticosteroids. This effect will lead to enhanced absorption of fetal lung fluid finally treating TTN. The aim of our study will be to evaluate whether inhaled corticosteroids reduce respiratory distress and morbidity in late preterm and term neonates presenting with TTN.</brief_summary>
