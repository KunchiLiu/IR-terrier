	<brief_summary>This is a point prevalence study conducted entirely in the United States (US) to establish the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis E virus (HEV) and other selected porcine viruses in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients receiving pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for pancreatic insufficiency compared with matched (age and region of residence) control patients with chronic medical conditions unexposed to PERT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence of Antibodies to Selected Porcine Viruses in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis Receiving Porcine-derived Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, non-interventional point-prevalence study conducted in the US to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to selected porcine viruses in pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy-exposed CF patients and in an unexposed control group with chronic medical conditions matched for age and geographic region of residence. Data collection includes demographic and medical history, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, transfusion history, and history of potential exposure to pig viruses. If a patient meets all the requirements of the study and provides a study specific informed consent/assent, a single blood sample is obtained as part of a planned standard-of-care blood collection. This harmonized protocol reflects equal sponsorship not only by the registering Sponsor, AbbVie, but also the Collaborators, Aptalis Pharma and Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All Patients (PERTexposed and unexposed controls) must meet the following criteria: Have a blood draw planned as part of their standard of care following enrollment into the study; and Provide informed consent/assent. Patients in the PERTExposed Group must meet the following criteria: Have been diagnosed with CF; and Have received PERT for a minimum of 6 months. Patients in the Unexposed Control Group must meet the following criteria: Be under medical management for chronic disease; Never received any PERT product; and Match an enrolled PERTexposed patient based on age and regionofresidence. Have a blood draw planned to be performed within 180 days of the matched PERTexposed patient blood draw. Has a porcine heart valve, a porcinederived graft, or has had exposure to porcine derived insulin. This exclusion does not apply to previous porcinederived heparin exposure. ; Refuses blood collection; or Has any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make participation not be in the best interest (e.g., compromise the wellbeing) of the patient or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocolspecified assessments.</criteria>
