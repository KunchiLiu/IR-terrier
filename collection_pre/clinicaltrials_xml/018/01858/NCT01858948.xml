	<brief_summary>The investigators will test the hypothesis that the adverse effects of second-generation antipsychotics exposure and the beneficial effects of long-chain omega-3 (LCn-3) fatty acids are mediated by opposing effects on the enzyme implicated in the metabolic syndrome and obesity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a two-phase study design: Phase I: to prospectively investigate the relationship between baseline LCn-3 fatty acid status and treatment-emergent adverse cardiometabolic events and weight gain in response to acute (6-week) open-label quetiapine in first-episode adolescent manic patients (ages 12-17 years). SGA-na√Øve acutely manic patients will be treated with open-label quetiapine for 6-weeks. Patients will be started on 100 mg BID of quetiapine, and the dose adjusted based on tolerability and response. The quetiapine target dose is 400-600 mg, with subjects in the range of 200-500 mg. Phase II: Patients from Phase I will be randomized to double-blind adjunctive treatment with LCn-3 fatty acids or placebo for an additional 24 weeks to investigate protective effects on the progression and resolution of adverse cardiometabolic events and weight gain during quetiapine maintenance therapy. They will have 6 visits over a 24-week period.</detailed_description>

For Phase II, additional Inclusion criteria are Receiving a stable therapeutic dose of quetiapine for a minimum of 1 week (i.e., patients who achieved remission (YMRS total score 7 during Phase I) Not requiring concomitant use of antidepressant or moodstabilizer medications (see Section C.4.c. Concomitant Medications). IQ &lt; 70, as determined by The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Positive pregnancy test (to avoid teratogenesis) A history of major cardiovascular or neurological illness Any lifetime DSMIVTR substance use disorder (nicotine dependence is permitted) A lifetime DSMIVTR diagnosis of any pervasive developmental disorder Any history of a hematological disorder in themselves or a firstdegree relative will be excluded (since omega3 fatty acids may be associated with antithrombotic effects). Similarly, concomitant use of medications with anticoagulant effects (e.g. aspirin) will be prohibited Allergy to fish/seafood; 8) Currently taking omega3 fatty acid supplements</criteria>
