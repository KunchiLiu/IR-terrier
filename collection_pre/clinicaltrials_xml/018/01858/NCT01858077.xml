	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy and performance in an all-comers contemporary population of the ABSORB bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) strategy versus the XIENCE family (XIENCE PRIME or XIENCE Xpedition) everolimus eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of coronary lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amsterdam Investigator-initiateD Absorb Strategy All-comers Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AIDA trial is a prospective, randomized (1:1), active control, single blinded, four-center, all-comers, non-inferiority trial. A total of 2690 subjects will be enrolled with broad inclusion and limited exclusion criteria. The study population will include both simple and complex lesions, as well as stable and acute coronary syndrome patients. The follow-up will continue for 5 years including clinical endpoint characteristics.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is an acceptable candidate for treatment with a drugeluting stent in accordance with the applicable guidelines on percutaneous coronary interventions and the Instructions for Use of the ABSORB BVS strategy and XIENCE family. Subject is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives of receiving the ABSORB BVS strategy and he/she or his/her legally authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any Clinical Investigation related procedure, as approved by the appropriate Ethics Committee. Subject is younger than 18 years of age Subject has a true bifurcation lesion where a priori two scaffold/stent strategy is planned. Unsuccessful predilation of one or more of the planned lesion to be treated. Planned treatment of instent restenosis of a previously placed metallic stent. Subject has one or more lesion planned to be treated with a scaffold/stent diameter size smaller than 2.5 mm or greater than 4.0 mm. Subject has one or more lesion planned to be treated with a stent/scaffold length greater than 70 mm and/or overlapping of four or more scaffolds/stents. Subject has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and bivalirudin, antiplatelet medication specified for use in the study (clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor, inclusive), everolimus, poly (Llactide), poly (DLlactide), cobalt, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated. Subjects pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 2 years following index procedure. (Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 28 days prior to the index procedure and contraception must be used during participation in this trial) Subjects with a limited life expectancy less than one year. Subjects with factors that impede clinical followup (e.g. no fixed abode). Subject is already participating in another clinical investigation that has not yet reached its primary endpoint. Subject is belonging to a vulnerable population (per investigator's judgment, e.g., subordinate hospital staff or sponsor staff) or subject unable to read or write.</criteria>
