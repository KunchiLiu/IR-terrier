	<brief_summary>The optimal technique of parenchymal transection in liver surgery has remained a matter of controversial debate among hepatobiliary surgeons. The optimal technique should enable secure sealing of the vascular and biliary structures that results in low intraoperative blood loss as well as low postoperative complication rates. Although numerous devices have been introduced and are used widely, high-level evidence, randomized controlled trials, that evaluate efficacy and safety of these devices are scarce. In the present randomized controlled trial two techniques of hepatic resection using vascular staplers and the LigaSure vessel sealing device are compared. While the primary endpoint is intraoperative blood loss a set of general and surgical variables will be analyzed to evaluate efficacy and safety of both methods.</brief_summary>
