	<brief_summary>Ocaratuzumab is a third-generation, fully humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the CD20 surface marker on normal and malignant B lymphocytes. It has been optimized for an increased binding for CD20 and an enhanced antibody dependent cell medicated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector function. A previous phase I/II study of intravenously (IV) administered ocaratuzumab in refractory/relapsed follicular lymphoma patients has concluded that ocaratuzumab is safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 375mg/ m2 weekly for four weeks. In this proposed phase I study, ocaratuzumab will be administered subcutaneously to patients with previously treated CD20+ B-cell malignancies. Three dose levels (40 mg weekly x 4 doses, 80 mg weekly x 4 doses, and 80 mg weekly x 8 doses) will be investigated for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic analyses.</brief_summary>
