	<brief_summary>Gastroparesis is a syndrome characterized by delayed gastric emptying in absence of mechanical obstruction of the stomach. The cardinal symptoms include postprandial fullness (early satiety), nausea, vomiting, and bloating.Capsule endoscopy (CE) has evolved to become a first-line, noninvasive diagnostic technique for the small bowel. CE is now being utilized to assess patients for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, possible Crohn's disease, celiac disease and small bowel tumors. Capsule endoscopy is preformed in a fasting state, and usually past the pylorus of the stomach into the duodenum after up to 30-40 minutes. The aim of the study is to determine the correlation between gasytoparesis symptoms to duration of capsule retention in the stomach</brief_summary>
