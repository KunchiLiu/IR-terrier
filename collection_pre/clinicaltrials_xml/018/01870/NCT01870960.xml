	<brief_summary>The main problem of using xenogenic bone in sinus floor elevation is the slow rate of absorption, which gives the percentages of vital bone low (20 to 30% depending on the study) in which the dental implant will be positioned However, osseointegration of the implant can be achieved only in vital bone. Enamel Matrix Derivative, through their angiogenic and osteogenic properties known, could promote bone healing during surgery sinus floor elevation by increasing the percentage of vital bone reformed, when added to xenografts.</brief_summary>
