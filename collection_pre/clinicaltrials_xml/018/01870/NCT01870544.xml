	<brief_summary>The purpose of the weight-loss study is to characterize the effect of LGG supplementation on the relative abundance of phyla in the gut microbiota of patients undergoing gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgery, and to elucidate a relationship between the gut microbiota pattern and the degree of weight-loss post-surgery. The investigators hypothesize that LGG administration will result in a "leaner" pattern of gut microbiota that will lead to higher weight loss at 3 months post-surgery.</brief_summary>
