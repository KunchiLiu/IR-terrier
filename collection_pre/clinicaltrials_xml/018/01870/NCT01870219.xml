	<brief_title>Effects of Sevoflurane and Ketamine on QT in Electroconvulsive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrolled in the study are randomly allocated by computer-generated random numbers to receive either sevoflurane or ketamine for their initial ECT session. They subsequently receive an alternative study drug in their next session, continuing to alternate between drugs at each session until the sixth session. In group S, sevoflurane are initiated at %8 sevoflurane for anesthesia induction and maintained at 2% to %4 until the electrical stimulus is delivered, In group K, ketamine are given to 1mg/kg ıv bolus. Electrical stimulus is delivered via bilateral frontotemporal electrodes.The mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR, and ECG are recorded before anesthetic induction (T1), after anesthetic induction (T2) and at 0, 1, 3, 10 min after the seizure ended (T3, T4, T5 and T6, respectively).The QT interval and Tp-e interval are measured by one author, who was unaware of group allocation.</detailed_description>
