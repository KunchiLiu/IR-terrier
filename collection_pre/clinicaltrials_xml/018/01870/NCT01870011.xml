	<brief_summary>Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced injury is known to be associated with immediate and long-term kidney dysfunction after renal transplantation. Protecting the kidney against I/R injury and maintaining renal function during renal transplant surgery is therefore very important in order to improve post-operative outcome. This purpose of this study is to investigate whether propofol anesthesia done in both kidney donors and recipients during deceased brain dead donor kidney transplantation is effective in reducing renal I/R injury via its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and improve post-transplant outcome compared to desflurane anesthesia.</brief_summary>
