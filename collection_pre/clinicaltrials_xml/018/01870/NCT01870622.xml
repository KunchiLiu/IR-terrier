	<brief_summary>Most premature babies have difficulty breathing at birth and need help (resuscitation). The treatment for this is to gently inflate their lungs with a resuscitation device and a facemask. To gently inflate an infant's lungs the clinical team places a breathing tube in the windpipe and blow air into your baby's lung (puffs). With the first puffs the clinical team checks if the breathing tube is correctly placed within the windpipe. The investigators routinely use a detector which checks for exhaled carbon dioxide or the graphical display of waves forms of the infants breathing to check that the breathing tube position. However, the investigators do not know which one (exhaled carbon dioxide or the graphical display of waves forms) is better to check that the breathing tube position is correct and therefore the investigators would like to study them. The purpose of this study is to compare exhaled carbon dioxide detectors (ECO2 group) with the graphical display of waves forms (flow waves group) to provide us with information on how the investigators can help babies who struggle with breathing at birth.</brief_summary>
