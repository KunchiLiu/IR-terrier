	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of contact lens lubricity on lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) in symptomatic contact lens wearers. LWE is defined as an alteration of that portion of the marginal conjunctival epithelium of the upper eyelid that wipes the ocular surface during blinking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, participants will wear either spectacles or contact lenses for two weeks to determine the impact of interruption of contact lens wear on LWE. In Stage 2, a second cohort of participants will wear one of two contact lens brands for two weeks, and LWE and ocular discomfort will be compared.</detailed_description>
