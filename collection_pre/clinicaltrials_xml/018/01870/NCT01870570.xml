	<brief_title>Determination of Glycaemic Index and Insulinaemic Index Values of 6 Food Products in 3 Separate Research Centers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be performed at 3 centers and 15 subjects will be recruited at each center.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Aged 1835 years inclusive. 2. Nonsmoker. 3. BMI 19.025.0 kg/m2 inclusive. 4.

Subject covered by social security or covered by a similar system 10.

Subject having given written consent to take part in the study 1. Following a restrictive or specific diet. 2. Suffering from any inflammatory or metabolic diseases 3. Suffering from mental illness. 4. Suffering from any food allergies or hypersensitivities (wheat, milk, egg, nuts, etc). 5. Taking any regular prescription medication at the time of inclusion that should interfere with carbohydrate metabolism (except regular oral contraception medication, thyroid replacement therapy) 6. Female who is pregnant (positive test results), lactating, planning pregnancy or not using acceptable contraceptive. 7. Subject having taken part in another clinical trial within the last week. 8. Subject currently taking part in another clinical trial or being in the exclusion period of another clinical trial. 9. Subject undergoing general anaesthesia in the month prior to inclusion. 10. Subject in a situation which in the investigator's opinion could interfere with optimal participation in the present study or could constitute a special risk for the subject.</criteria>
