	<brief_summary>Background: Burnout syndrome is an important health problem that affects many professionals and must be addressed globally, with both organizational measures and personal interventions. Burnout of health professionals can be prevented in order to avoid personal, familial, and social consequences, as well as repercussions for patients. Methods/Design: This work describes a protocol for a controlled, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial in 2 parallel groups: intervention and control. All health professionals from 7 health care centers (HCCs) will form the intervention group, and all health professionals from 7 different HCCs will form the control group. The intervention group will receive 16 hours of training at their work place. The Maslach's burnout inventory (MBI), burnout physician Questionnaire (CDPM) or burnout nurse Questionnaire (CDPE), and the 28-item Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), validated for our setting, will be used as measurement tools. Change in the average scores from the MBI emotional exhaustion scale will be compared between the intervention and control groups, measured as intention-to-treat, and the intervention will be considered effective if a minimum increase of 20% is achieved. Discussion: Due to the deleterious consequences of burnout syndrome for people suffering from it and for the organization where they work, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of certain interventions for its prevention. Organizational measures are important for preventing burnout syndrome, but so is providing professionals with coping strategies, as this group intervention intends to do.</brief_summary>
