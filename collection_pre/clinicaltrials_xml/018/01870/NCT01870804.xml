	<brief_title>Atorvastatin Versus Rosuvastatin on Contrast Induced Acute Kidney Injury (PRATO-ACS 2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single-centre, randomized study, designed to compare the nephro-protective effects of high-dose atorvastatin and high-dose rosuvastatin on the incidence of Contrast Induced-Acute Kidney Injury (CI-AKI). Consecutive statin-naïve patients admitted in the investigators institution for non-ST elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and scheduled for early invasive strategy will be eligible. Patients are randomized into two groups: 1) high-dose rosuvastatin (40 mg on-admission followed by 20 mg/day); 2) high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg on-admission followed by 40 mg/day). Randomization will be performed on-admission by computerized open-label assignment in blinded envelopes used in a consecutive fashion. All patients receive the standard pre-procedural hydration. The primary end-point is the proportion of patients with an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or ≥ 25% above baseline within 72 hours after contrast medium administration. The secondary end-points are persistent worsening of renal damage (eGFR reduction &gt;= 25% at 30 days) and cumulative adverse clinical events at follow-up. Specifically: death, myocardial infarction, dialysis, stroke or persistent renal damage at 30 days; death or myocardial infarction at 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
