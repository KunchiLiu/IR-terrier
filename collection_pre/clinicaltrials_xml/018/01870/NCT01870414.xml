	<brief_summary>The influence of cryotherapy on ankle motor control and balance of athletes is controversial. The aim of this study is to assess the neuromuscular response of the dominant leg and body balance basketball athletes after application of cryotherapy. The sample is distributed into two groups. Group one will consist of 20 basketball players without a history of ankle sprains in the past 12 months and no complaints of instability in this joint, and group two, 20 non-athletes, active, no complaints in the lower limb in the last 12 months. Will perform the inversion movements and single-leg hop for the analysis of the electromyographic signal of anterior tibial, peroneal, gastrocnemius (lateral), rectus femoris, hamstrings and gluteus medius. Will also be performed kinematic analysis in search of body balance and range of motion of the joints of the lower limbs. And yet, the analysis of the plantar support and ground reaction force. After the initial collection of the data subjects will be submitted to the application of cryotherapy by immersion in a time of 20 minutes, with a temperature of 6 ± 2 degrees Celsius. Data collection will be held in pre, 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes after application of cryotherapy. The data will be statistically analyzed to compare the results in collection times within and between groups. The significance level is set at 5%. The data support the intended use of cryotherapy in motor control of the inversion movement, jump and balance of athletes.</brief_summary>
