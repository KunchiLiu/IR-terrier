	<detailed_description>Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) is a common endoscopic procedure, performed to avoid malnutrition in various pathological conditions. Gastrostomy tube placement is associated with intra and postoperative complications both in the adult and in the paediatric population. Local infection is the most common complication following PEG. Antibiotic prophylaxis is a well-established strategy to reduce peristomal wound infection rate in adult population. The aim of this study is to evaluate if a single i.v. dose of co-amoxiclav before PEG can reduce the incidence of peristomal wound infection in the paediatric population.</detailed_description>
