	<brief_title>Nocturnal Breathing and Sleep in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Staying at Altitude</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized cross-over trial evaluates the hypothesis that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experience nocturnal hypoxemia, periodic breathing and sleep disturbances when staying at moderate altitude. Sleep studies and clinical evaluations will be performed during 2 days in Zurich (490 m, low altitude baseline) and during 2 days at Davos Clavadel (1650 m), and 2 days at Davos Jakobshorn (2590 m).</detailed_description>
