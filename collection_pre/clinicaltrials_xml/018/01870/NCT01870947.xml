	<brief_summary>This is an assisted exercise trial involving exercise on a stationary bike, brain imaging and DNA(genetics)sampling. The purpose of this study is to find out if performing a progressive, supervised assisted exercise program on a stationary bike improves quality of life, increases motivation to continue to exercise, improves dietary behavior and leads to sustained weight loss in women who have had early-stage endometrial cancer. Questionnaires will be used to assess exercise motivation and dietary behavior. Brain's responses to different visual images will also be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To evaluate changes in body weight, fitness, bi-manual dexterity, exercise motivation and self-reported eating behavior (via questionnaires) before and after a 16-week exercise intervention (EOT) and 12 and 24 weeks post-EOT, in obese EC patients who will be randomized to perform 'assisted' or voluntary exercise. Secondary Objectives: Objective 1: To objectively examine food behavior as determined by neuronal response to high- versus low-calorie visual stimuli under fasted (hunger) and fed (satiated) states and stop/go signaling (SST) in fed states in brain regions of interest (reward and motivation circuitry) using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI before and after a 16-week exercise intervention (EOT) and 12 and 24 weeks post-intervention in obese EC patients performing 'assisted' and voluntary exercise. Objective 2: To examine the modification of the neuronal response to high vs. low calorie food images in regions of interest by polymorphisms in key genes (e.g., dopamine receptor and dopamine transporter) and serum biomarkers (e.g., leptin, BDNF) involved in regulating homeostatic and non-homeostatic energy systems. Patients will be randomized to receive either the assisted exercise (n=60) or voluntary exercise (n=60) group. Subjects in the voluntary group will exercise on a stationary recumbent exercise cycle and pedal at their preferred rate. Subjects in the assisted exercise group will cycle on the same stationary exercise bike; however, a motor will provide assistance to the patient in order to maintain a pedaling rate 35% greater than their voluntary rate. Subjects in the exercise groups will complete 45 minute to 1-hour sessions, three times per week for eight weeks. The control group will be asked to complete all exercise, body composition and fMRI testing similar to the exercise groups.</detailed_description>
