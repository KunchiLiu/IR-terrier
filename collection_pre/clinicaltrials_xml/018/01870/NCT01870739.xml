	<brief_summary>This was the first evaluation of the effects of LCZ696 on local and regional measures of aortic stiffness in subjects with mild to moderate hypertension and widened pulse pressure. The results of this exploratory study will help to understand the mechanism of action of LCZ696 and used to inform the design of future clinical studies with LCZ696 in subjects with cardiovascular diseases.</brief_summary>
