	<brief_summary>This study will utilize T1-Rho MRI to evaluate the effect of intramedullary nailing on patellofemoral articular cartilage when the surgery is performed using the infrapatellar vs. the suprapatellar approach. Subjects will be randomized to one or the other standard care surgical approaches.</brief_summary>
