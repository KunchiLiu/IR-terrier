	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib/II experimental, open-label, dose escalation, active treatment study designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose of the combination. During the Phase 2 portion of the study, we will assess progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),overall response rate (ORR), correlative endpoints, DNA methylation measured by microarray, and expression level of the genes as measured by microarray</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b/2 Study of Vorinostat in Combination With Gemcitabine and Docetaxel in Advanced Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1b - To determine the dose of vorinostat that can be safely combined with gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with advanced sarcomas. - To characterize the Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of vorinostat when combined with gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with advanced sarcomas. Phase 2 - To determine the safety and efficacy of gemcitabine and docetaxel in combination with vorinostat in patients with advanced sarcomas. The hypothesis is that gemcitabine and docetaxel + vorinostat will be safe and will improve the 6-months progression-free rates (PFR) of the combination by 20% (from 20% to 40%). - To determine the objective response rate, progression-free, and overall survival of patients with advanced sarcomas treated with gemcitabine and docetaxel + vorinostat; - To develop a predictive molecular signature of response to treatment in advanced sarcomas.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma with evidence of metastatic or unresectable disease. Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. Up to 32 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting are allowed. Adjuvant chemotherapy or targeted therapy will not be considered a prior line of treatment. Age ≥18 years. ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%). Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes ≥3,000/µL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/µL platelets ≥100,000/µL total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) creatinine ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Peripheral neuropathy, if present, should be ≤grade 1. Women of Child bearing potential MUST use contraceptives. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. The following specific histologic subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas will be excluded: GIST, Kaposi's sarcoma, mesothelioma, dermatofibrosarcoma, chordoma, alveolar softpart sarcoma. Also, all bone sarcomas are excluded including Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, GIST, low grade chondrosarcoma, and chordoma. Patients who have had treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to starting study treatment or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients with known brain metastases. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to gemcitabine, docetaxel, vorinostat, or GCSF. Patients who have received and progressed on the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel in the metastatic setting. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and breastfeeding women Patients taking concomitant HDAC inhibitors. HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral treatment</criteria>
