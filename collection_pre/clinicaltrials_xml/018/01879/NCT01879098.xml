	<brief_title>The Effect of 3 Probiotic Strains on Bile Acids, Satiety, and Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study. After obtaining informed consent, healthy, middle-aged adults with a larger waist circumference (n=30/probiotic cross with n=90 total/study) will be randomized to one of four groups: Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, or placebo. Participants will consume 1 capsule per day of probiotic or placebo for 6 weeks. After a 4-week washout period, participants will be crossed to the other treatment (i.e., probiotic to placebo or placebo to probiotic). Participants will complete daily questionnaires throughout the intervention period, and one week before and after each intervention period. Blood samples will be collected at the baseline and final time points (Â±3 days) of each intervention. Stool samples will be collected during the pre-baseline and final weeks of each intervention. Dietary intake will be assessed weekly during each intervention period. Gastrointestinal symptoms and physical activity questionnaires will be completed weekly during each intervention period and also the weeks before and after each intervention period.</detailed_description>
