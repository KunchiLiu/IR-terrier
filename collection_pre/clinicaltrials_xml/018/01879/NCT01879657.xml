	<brief_summary>To evaluate the concordance and discordance between results of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT scan and OctreoScan ® which is considered standard of care diagnostic test for neuroendocrine cancers and other imaging modalities like CT scan/MRI as gold standard.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>68-Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT Scan for Diagnosis and Staging of Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number of lesions that could be identified clearly as single foci will be determined for each patient. The same anatomic areas will be imaged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and 111In-penteoctreotide Scintigraphy to ensure relevant comparison of lesion detection. Because of confluence and inability to clearly delineate single liver lesions in some cases, liver metastases will be classified as 1 organ metastasis, independent of the number of liver metastases present. Lymph nodes smaller than 1 cm on CT or MRI and showing marked avidity for 68Ga- DOTATATE and 111In-penteoctreotide will be labeled as positive for disease. The presence of lesions will be confirmed by cross-sectional imaging of all patients with CT or MRI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients of either gender, aged at least 18 years. Karnofsky status equal or greater than 60. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Histologically and/or clinically confirmed and/or suspicious of NET. Somatostatinanalogue scintigraphies scan with result (positive or negative) within the last 4 weeks. Recent Blood test results up to 23 weeks as follows:(WBC:equal/higher 2*109/L; Haemoglobin: equal/higher 8.0g/Dl; Platelets: equal/higher 50x109/L; ALT, AST, AP: equal/lower 5 times ULN; Bilirubin: equal/lower 3 times ULN; Serum creatinine: within normal range or &lt;120μmol/L for patients aged 60 years or older. Negative pregnancy test in women capable of childbearing. Known hypersensitivity to DOTA, to 68Gallium, to Octreotate or to any of the excipients of 68GaDOTATATE. Therapeutic use of any somatostatin analogue, including Sandostatin® LAR (within 28 days) and Sandostatin® (within 2 days) prior to study imaging. If a patient is on Sandostatin® LAR a washout phase of 28 days is required before the injection of the study drug. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Current somatic or psychiatric disease/condition that may interfere with the objectives and assessments of the study.</criteria>
