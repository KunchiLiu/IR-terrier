	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective single-center study is to evaluate sympathetic nervous system directly measured by microneurography, 24-hour blood pressure, endothelial function, vascular compliance, quality of life and platelet adhesion in patients with sleep apnea syndrome (defined by a complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness, an Epworth sleepiness score&gt;8[10], and an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI&gt;15/h) before and after catheter-based radiofrequency ablation of renal nerve. If the selected patients are treated with CPAP, this therapy should be stable during the whole study time. Primary and secondary end-point will be measured before and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after renal sympathetic denervation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: We plan to include male or female subjects, age 1880 with a diagnosis of mediumsevere sleep apnea syndrome (defined by symptoms, a complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness, an Epworth sleepiness score &gt;8, and an apnea / hypopnea index &gt;15/h) and a resistant hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or &gt;130 mmHg in patients with type II diabetes or chronic kidney disease, under treatment with three antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic). If the selected patients are treated with CPAP, this therapy should be stable during the whole study time. Every patient will be asked for a written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Heart failure (normal ejection fractions on echocardiography and no clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure). Long acting nitrates, or PDE5Hemmer Alcohol or drug abuse, Malignancy (unless healed or remission &gt; 5 years) Disease with systemic inflammation (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, M. Crohn) Pulmonary Hypertension (PAP&gt;50 mmHg) Pregnancy Anatomical contraindication to renal denervation Know allergy to contrast Participation in another study within the last month</criteria>
