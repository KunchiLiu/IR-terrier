	<brief_summary>Controlling the respiratory pattern of mechanically ventilated patients in volume control mode is recommended during nebulization. No studies looked into conditions of nebulization during assisted mechanical ventilation to define the optimal nebulization technique and its effect on pulmonary deposition. The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of ventilation mode (barometric versus volumetric) on deposition by planar scintigraphy during mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
