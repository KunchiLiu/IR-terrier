	<brief_summary>The aim of the Danish Organization for Randomized Trials with Clinical Outcome (SORT OUT) is to compare the safety and efficacy of the sirolimus eluting ORSIRO stent and the biolimus-eluting NOBORI stent in a population-based setting, using registry detection of clinically driven events</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus Eluting ORSIRO Stent Versus Biolimus-eluting NOBORI Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SORT OUT VII is a randomized, multicenter, all-comer, two-arm, non-inferiority trial comparing the sirolimus eluting ORSIRO stent to the biolimus-eluting NOBORI stent in treating atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions. Primary Endpoint: Target lesion failure within 12 months of stent implantation (combination of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (not index procedure related) not related to other than index lesion or target lesion revascularization). Secondary Endpoints: Individual components of the primary end point comprised the secondary end points and stent thrombosis rate according to the Academic Research Consortium definition (see protocol for further specification of secondary endpoints). Clinically driven event detection will be used to avoid study-induced reinterventions. Data on mortality, hospital admission, coronary angiography, repeat percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary bypass surgery will be obtained for all randomly allocated patients from the following national Danish administrative and healthcare registries: the Civil Registration System; the Western Denmark Heart Registry; the Danish National Registry of Patients, which maintains records on all hospitalizations in Denmark; and the Danish Registry of Causes of Death Inclusion criteria: at least 18 years old chronic stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes at least one coronary artery lesion with more than 50% diameter stenosis requiring treatment with a drug-eluting stent Exclusion criteria: life expectancy of less than one year allergy to aspirin, clopidogrel, sirolimus, or biolimus participation in another randomized trial nability to provide written informed consent</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients aged 18 years or over with chronic stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes, and at least one coronary artery lesion with more than 50% diameter stenosis, requiring treatment with a drugeluting stent. There are no restrictions on number of treated lesions, number of treated vessels, or lesion length. Exclusion criteria are life expectancy of less than one year; an allergy to aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugral, sirolimus, or biolimus; participation in another randomized trial; or inability to provide written informed consent</criteria>
