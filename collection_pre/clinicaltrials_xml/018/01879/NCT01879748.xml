	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Single and Multiple Doses of Rasagiline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects after administration of single and multiple doses of rasagiline. All subjects will have a screening visit within 28 days of their check-in day (day -1) to confirm eligibility. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the investigational center on study day -1 and their eligibility to participate in the study confirmed. On the morning of day 1, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 0.5, 1, or 2 mg of rasagiline or placebo at the same time every morning after an overnight fast (of at least 10 hours) on days 1 through 10. Venous blood samples (4 mL each) for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected at specified time points through 24 hours after study drug administration on day 1 and through 48 hours after study drug administration on day 10. The duration of study participation for each subject will be approximately 6 weeks.</detailed_description>

The subject has a history of tuberculosis. 6. The subject has any condition that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. 7. The subject is suffering from, or has a clinically significant history of, 1 or more of the following: cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, immunological, or psychiatric disorder(s), or a history of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subject if he or she participates in the study. 8.
