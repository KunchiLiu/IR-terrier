	<brief_title>Computer Assisted Orthognathic Surgery. Facial Asymmetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this randomized, controlled, clinical study, was to evaluate the most accurate procedure for orthognathic correction of facial asymmetry. The investigators compared two different methods of surgical planning: classical (esthetic analysis of the face, cephalometric study of the skull in lateral and posteroanterior cephalograms, analysis and surgical simulation of plaster casts mounted in semi-individual articulators, development of a surgical acrylic resin intermediate splint) and digital planning (cone-beam computed tomography, data acquisition, software-assisted virtual surgery -Maxilim; Medicim, Mechelen, Belgium- and CAD/CAM processing of the surgical intermediate splint).</detailed_description>
