	<brief_summary>The effects of physical inactivity on variations in blood glucose and vascular health are not fully understood. The purpose of this study is to determine if an acute transition from physical activity to inactivity alters vascular health. Specifically, the investigators wish to examine in healthy, lean physically active individuals (obtaining greater than 10,000 steps/day) if decreasing physical activity (obtaining less than 5,000 steps/day) will alter blood flow following a meal a marker of vascular health. Furthermore, the investigators wish to examine if a one day return to physical activity (obtaining &gt;10,000 steps/day) can restore the detrimental effects on blood flow following a meal.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Herein, we tested the hypothesis that an acute reduction in daily activity (from &gt;10,000 to &lt;5,000 steps/day) for 5 days in healthy individuals reduced meal-stimulated blood flow and if a 1 day return to activity improved this outcomes.</detailed_description>
