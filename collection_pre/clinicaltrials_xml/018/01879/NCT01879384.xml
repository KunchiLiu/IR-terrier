	<brief_summary>Microdialysis is admitted to be reliable by numerous surgeons to monitor flaps. Nevertheless, a few authors reported follow up with microdialysis in bone flaps, and they all described the position of the catheter in the surrounding soft tissue muscle. This surrounding soft tissue is not always the reflect of bone vascularisation. The aim is to study the feasibility of a follow up of microanastomosed bone flaps with microdialysis. To reach this goal, investigators perform a clinical prospective research project untitled MTM project</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition to our classical clinical monitoring, bone microanastomosed flaps for reconstructive facial surgery will be monitored with CMA 70 catheter directly positioned in bone tissue. The monitoring is recorded during 5 days. Glucose, lactate , pyruvate , glycerol rates will be analysed : - every hour at day 1, - every two hours at day 2, - every three hours at day 3,4 and 5. Data are managed with Labpilot software.</detailed_description>
