	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Study of Multiple Rising Doses of TAK- 063 in Participants With Stable Schizophrenia and Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-063. TAK-063 is being tested to find a well-tolerated dose and also to treat schizophrenia. This study will look at how well different doses of TAK-063 are tolerated in healthy people of Japanese descent and in people with stable schizophrenia. Five dose levels will be examined, starting at the lowest, in each population with 10 participants in each dose level. These participants will be randomized to receive TAK-063 (8 subjects) and placebo (2 subjects) once daily (QD) for 7 days. In total, approximately 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. This trial will be conducted in single site in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 42 days. Participants will make 2 visits to the clinic, including 8-10 days confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 7 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Dose escalation and the actual choice of the subsequent dose level will only occur following a review of the blinded data from the previous cohorts.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy Participants: 1. Aged 2055 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent and first study medication dose. 2. Is a healthy adult male or female of Japanese descent (born to Japanese parents and grandparents and has lived outside of Japan for less than 5 years). 3. Weighs at least 45 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 28.0 kg/m^2, inclusive, at Screening. Participants with Stable Schizophrenia: 1. Is aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent and first study medication dose. 2. Is an adult male or female with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 3. Weighs at least 45 kg and has a BMI between 18.0 and 35.0 kg/m^2, inclusive at Screening. 4. Has been receiving a stable dose of antipsychotic monotherapy for at least 1 month prior to Screening. 5. Has not had an acute exacerbation of psychosis or been hospitalization for the treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder for at least 3 months prior to Screening. All Participants: 1. Has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, or endocrine disease or other abnormality (other than the disease being studied), which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results. 2. If female, the participant is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant, or intending to donate ova, before, during the course of the study or within 12 weeks after last dose. 3. Intends to donate sperm during the course of this study or for 12 weeks after last dose. 4. Has evidence of current cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic, hematopoietic disease, renal dysfunction, metabolic or endocrine dysfunction, serious allergy, asthma hypoxemia, hypertension, seizures, or allergic skin rash. There is any finding in the participant's medical history, physical examination, or safety laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that would contraindicate taking TAK063, or a similar drug in the same class, or that might interfere with the conduct of the study. This includes, but is not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, seizure disorders, and cardiac arrhythmias. Healthy Participants: 1. Has a history or treatment of Axis I/II mental disorders according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSMIV) such as depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or schizophrenia within the past 3 years. 2. Has used nicotinecontaining products (including but not limited to cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch or nicotine gum) within 28 days prior to Checkin Day 1. Cotinine test is positive at Screening or Checkin (Day 1). Participants with Stable Schizophrenia: 1. Has a history of a primary DSMIV axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 2. Has not discontinued antipsychotic or other psychotropic medications or is unable to discontinue antipsychotic or other psychotropic medications at Day 7 (or five halflives prior to Day 1). 3. Is taking a concomitant medication for a medical condition at a stable dose or regimen for less than two months or is taking a concomitant medication for a medical condition for less than two months and for which the discontinuation for the study period is not medically permissible.</criteria>
