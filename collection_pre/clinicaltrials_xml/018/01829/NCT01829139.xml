	<brief_summary>In patients with gallbladder in situ after complete removal of common bile duct (CBD) stones, there is no definite guideline for the management of remnant acalculous gallbladder. This study was planned to evaluate the efficacy of choleretic agents in those patients comparing with non-treatment group during short (2 years) and long-term (5 to 10 years) period. So that, the investigators want to establish the treatment guideline in gallbladder in situ without definite stones following complete removal of CBD stones. Second, the protective or preventive effect of choleretics may be defined.</brief_summary>
