	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two different ways of teaching people how to give injections at home. The first is what we do now, which is teaching patients and/or their caregivers verbally and by giving written instructions. The second is what we do now (verbal and written instructions) along with a demonstration and practice using a needle and an injection pad that feels similar to skin and fat. This is being done to find the best method for teaching people to give an injection at home.</brief_summary>
