	<criteria>1. The subject must be enrolled in the parent protocol for at least one year. 2. The subject's parent or legal guardian must read and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and the subject must read and sign the Child's Assent Form and be provided a copy of each form. 3. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical protocol. 1. Ocular or systemic allergies that may interfere with contact lens wear. 2. Systemic disease or autoimmune disease or use of medication (e.g. antihistamine), which may interfere with contact lens wear. 3. Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining or any other abnormality of the cornea, which may contraindicate contact lens wear. 4. Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection that might interfere with contact lens wear. 5. Any ocular infection. 6. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. 7. Any infectious disease (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV) 8. Diabetes 9. Previous refractive surgery, orthokeratology, keratoconus, or other corneal irregularity in either eye. Rigid contact lens wearers cannot be enrolled in the study. 10. Strabismus. 11. Pupil or lid abnormality or infection in either eye 12. Central corneal scar in either eye 13. Aphakia in either eye 14. Contraindications to contact lens wear such as dry eye or history of prior unsuccessful contact lens wear. 15. History of participation in prior clinical trials aimed to control myopia progression, except for the parent trial 16. Surgically altered eyes, ocular infection of any type, ocular inflammation. 17. Anterior chamber angle grade 2 or narrower by Van Herrick method.</criteria>
