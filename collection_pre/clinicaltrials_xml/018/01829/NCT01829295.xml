	<brief_summary>In the First-line Antimetabolites as Steroid-sparing Treatment (FAST) Uveitis Trial, the investigators propose to establish which immunosuppressive therapy, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil, is more effective as a first-line, corticosteroid-sparing agent for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis in a block-randomized, observer-masked, comparative effectiveness trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methotrexate and Mycophenolate Mofetil for UVEITIS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial to determine which treatment, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil, is more effective as first-line corticosteroid-sparing treatment for patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis requiring corticosteroid-sparing therapy. The primary outcome is treatment success assessed at the 6 month visit (Phase 1, 0-6 months). If patients are a treatment success, they continue on the medication for another 6 months (Phase 1, 6-12 months). Patients who are a treatment failure can crossover to the other medication (Phase 2, 0-6 months).</detailed_description>
