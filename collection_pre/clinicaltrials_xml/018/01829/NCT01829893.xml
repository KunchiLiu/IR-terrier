	<brief_title>PK Comparison of GL2701 With Finasteride and Tamsulosin in Combination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single dose, open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly developed formulation with a conventional formulation in healthy subjects. For this, a single-center, randomized, single-dose, open-label, 2-period and 2-sequence crossover study with a 14-day washout period was conducted in 26 healthy volunteers. Plasma samples for the analysis of finasteride/tamsulosin were collected up to 48 h after drug administration. Participants received either reference (in combination of of 0.2mg tamsulosin and 5mg finasteride) or test drug formulation (single pill combination of 0.2mg tamsulosin and 5mg finasteride) in the first period and the alternative formulation in the second period. Plasma concentrations of both tamsulosin and finasteride were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including Cmax and AUC, were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using log-transformed Cmax and AUC, and the mean ratios and their 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. According to regulatory requirements set forth by Korea and the US Food and Drug Administration, products meet the criteria for bioequivalence if the 90% CIs of the mean ratios for Cmax and AUC are within the range of 0.80 to 1.25.</detailed_description>
