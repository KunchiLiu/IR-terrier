	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide and ibrutinib when given together with rituximab in treating patients with previously untreated stage II-IV follicular lymphoma. Lenalidomide may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can find cancer cells and help kill them. Giving lenalidomide and ibrutinib together with rituximab may work well in treating follicular lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab, Lenalidomide, and Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage II-IV Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the recommended phase II doses of ibrutinib and lenalidomide for combination with rituximab in previously untreated follicular lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and its major metabolite (PCI-45227) when combined with lenalidomide and rituximab. II. To determine the pharmacodynamics of basophil activation and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over a 24-hour period of ibrutinib when given in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide and ibrutinib. Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and once weekly at weeks 13, 21, 29, and 37. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 8 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Previously untreated, histologically confirmed follicular lymphoma, World Health Organization (WHO) classification grade I, II, or IIIa (&gt; 15 centroblasts per high power field with centrocytes present) that is stage III, IV, or bulky (i.e., single mass &gt;= 7 cm in any unidimensional measurement) stage II and requires therapy at the discretion of the primary physician Bone marrow biopsies as the sole means of diagnosis are not acceptable, but they may be submitted in conjunction with nodal biopsies; fine needle aspirates are not acceptable for diagnosis Failure to submit pathology specimens within 60 days of patient registration will be considered a major protocol violation Institutional flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry must confirm cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) antigen expression All risk by follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI): 05 risk factors No prior systemic therapy for nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) including chemotherapy or immunotherapy (e.g., monoclonal antibodybased therapy), radiation therapy, or radioimmunotherapy For nonNHL conditions, no chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or major surgery within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) of enrollment; no patients who have ongoing adverse events from agents administered more than 4 weeks previously No prior exposure to any of the study agents No corticosteroids within two weeks prior to study entry, except for maintenance therapy for a nonmalignant disease; dose of corticosteroid or prednisone (or its equivalent) should not exceed 20 mg per day; corticosteroid premedication for rituximab is allowed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be =&lt;
