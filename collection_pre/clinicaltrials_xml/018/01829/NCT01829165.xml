	<brief_summary>The overarching goal of this research program is to elucidate causal and directional neural network- level abnormalities in depression, and how they are modulated by an individually-tailored, circuit-directed intervention. By using concurrent TMS and fMRI, the investigators can overcome a major limitation of neuroimaging - the inability to demonstrate causality. The investigators' findings will serve as a platform for future studies wherein TMS treatment can be directly guided by the investigators' ability to image and causally manipulate specific neural networks. Aim 1: To examine causal interactions between two major brain networks in depression. Aim 2: To examine the impact of antidepressant TMS on causal network abnormalities in depression. Hypothesis 1: Depressed subjects will show blunted responses, compared to healthy controls, in two targeted and interacting networks, using concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Hypothesis 2: Treatment of patients with high-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) will result in normalization of baseline network-level deficits, and be predicted by degree of baseline network abnormalities.</brief_summary>
