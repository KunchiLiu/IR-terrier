	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery is the only long-term established treatment for morbid obesity. However, some patients experience suboptimal weight loss after surgery and/or experience a significant weight regain. Unfortunately there are very few studies in this area and little is known about the causes for lack of success or the best approach to treat this group of patients. The main aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of two different lifestyle treatment programs in this group of patients: 1) Hospital-based outpatient program or 2) an inpatient treatment program consisting of 3 - 3-week stays at a rehabilitation center over a 1-year period. Secondary aim is to determine potential reasons for suboptimal weight loss after bariatric surgery.</brief_summary>
