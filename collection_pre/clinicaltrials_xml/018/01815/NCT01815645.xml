	<brief_summary>Crack addiction has became a severe health problem in Brazil. Today, crack addiction is the primary cause for inpatient treatment (voluntary or not) for all illicit substances (losing only for alcohol addiction). A survey study conducted with children and adolescents currently living in the streets of 5 major cities of Brazil, point alarming results in which 15% to 26% of all these children have smoked crack at least once in the last month. When compared to cocaine, crack users develop much faster diagnoses for crack dependence (mean of 5 month after first use), shows a more compulsive pattern of use, has higher probability of living or have lived in the streets, and of engaging in illegal activities. Consequently to this, mortality of crack addicts are 7 times higher than for the rest of the population. Despite all efforts being made for the development of effective pharmacological treatments for stimulant addiction (crack included), up to today, there is no robust evidence of efficacy of any pharmacological treatment. For that reason, the use of evidence based psychosocial interventions is so important for treating this population. Although today open treatment facilities in Brazil are more and more starting to use evidence based interventions such as motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, relapse prevention and coping skills, such treatments present very modest results when treating crack addiction. The biggest difficulties encountered when treating this population are maintaining patients in treatment, reducing crack use and achieving continued abstinence. A psychosocial treatment based in behavioral principals' named Contingency Management (CM) is widely applied in the USA. Recent meta-analyses and review studies present robust evidence that, when applied alone or in adjunction with other psychosocial and pharmacological treatment, CM is the most effective treatment for what regards, treatment retention, reducing drug use and promoting continued abstinence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if Contingence Management (CM) treatment can be affective on the treatment of crack addiction for Brazilian population seeking outpatient treatment. To accomplish this, 60 individuals (male and female from 18 to 65 years of age) seeking open treatment for crack addiction will be randomized to 2 treatment conditions (Standard treatment (ST) or ST plus CM). Both treatments will last 12 weeks with 3 and 6-month follow-up. In both groups patients will be encourage to leave urine samples 3 times week. Hypotheses: Patients receiving ST+CM will stay longer in treatment, have more negative tests for cocaine/crack, and achieve longer periods of cocaine/crack abstinence when compared to patients receiving ST alone.</brief_summary>
