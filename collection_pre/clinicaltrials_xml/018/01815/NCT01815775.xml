	<brief_summary>The idea is to assess the predictive value of flow magnetic resonance imaging (flow MRI) for patient suffering normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) planned for surgery. By now, the depletive lumbar puncture is the best test assessing the efficacy of a forthcoming surgery. The idea is to demonstrate that flow MRI can be as effective as lumbar puncture in term of predictive value of surgery response. In that way, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics are evaluated by a single non invasive examination. CSF flow is measured at the Sylvius' aqueduct, cervical, arachnoid space and 4th ventricle levels.</brief_summary>
