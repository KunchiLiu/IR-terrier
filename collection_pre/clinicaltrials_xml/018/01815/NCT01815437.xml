	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate how much vitamin D is present in a mushroom supplement. This supplement contains an extract from mushrooms that have been exposed to sunlight. The mushroom supplement will be compared to non-commercially available vitamin D supplements produced in a Goo Manufacturing Practices (GMP)-licensed facility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Vitamin D Content in Mushrooms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mushrooms have the capability to produce vitamin D in a similar way to human skin. When exposed to ultraviolet light, mushrooms will convert a precursor to vitamin D. This reaction produces large amounts of vitamin D. This study is comparing a natural source of vitamin D to a synthetic source of vitamin D and will help determine if mushrooms are a novel source for this essential nutrient.</detailed_description>
