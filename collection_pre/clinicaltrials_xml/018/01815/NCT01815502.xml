	<brief_summary>The study will investigate the cardiovascular effects of sildenafil on patients with Fontan circulation. Recent studies suggest that sildenafil may improve exercise in patients with Fontan circulation. However, why this occurs is not known. The study will used specialized catheters to measure pressure and volume. The measure of pressure and volume leads to more detailed analysis of heart function. Patients will receive either sugar pill or sildenafil prior to catheterization. It is believed that sildenafil will improve relaxation and contraction of the heart.</brief_summary>
