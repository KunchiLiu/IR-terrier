	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of switching to a tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-containing fixed dose combination (FDC) relative to maintaining tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-containing combination regimens in virologically suppressed HIV-infected participants as determined by having HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures Currently receiving antiretroviral therapy consisting of E/C/F/TDF, EFV/FTC/TDF, RTV+ATV+FTC/TDF, or COBI+ATV+FTC/TDF for ≥ 6 consecutive months preceding the final visit in their earlier study Completion of the Week 144 visit in studies GSUS2360102, GSUS2360103, GSUS2160114, or completion of the Week 96 visit in study GSUS2640110 (only participants on an EFVbased regimen), or completion of studies GSUS2360104, GSUS2160105 Plasma HIV1 RNA concentrations at undetectable levels for at least 6 consecutive months prior to the screening visit and have HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at the screening visit Normal echocardiograph (ECG) Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 50 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula for creatinine clearance Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 × upper limit of the normal range (ULN) Direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Adequate hematologic function Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN Females of childbearing potential must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods or be nonheterosexually active or practice sexual abstinence from screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 12 weeks following the last dose of study drug if receiving EFV/FTC/TDF regimen, and 30 days for those assigned to all other regimens. Female participants who utilize hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing Female participants who have stopped menstruating for ≥ 12 months but do not have documentation of ovarian hormonal failure must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level at screening within the postmenopausal range based on the Central Laboratory reference range Key A new AIDSdefining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening Hepatitis B surface antigen position Hepatitis C antibody positive Participants experiencing decompensated cirrhosis Females who are breastfeeding Positive serum pregnancy test Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker Current alcohol or substance use judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with subject study compliance History of malignancy within the past 5 years or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to baseline Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with dosing requirements Participation in any other clinical trial without prior approval from the sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial Participants receiving ongoing therapy with drugs not to be used with elvitegravir (EVG), COBI, FTC, TDF, ATV, RTV, EFV, and TAF or participants with any known allergies to the excipients of E/C/F/TDF, E/C/F/TAF, EFV/FTC/TDF, ATV, COBI, RTV, or FTC/TDF Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
