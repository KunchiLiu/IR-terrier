	<brief_summary>Arthroscopic transosseous fixation of rotator cuff tears has become an alternative to arthroscopic suture anchor. This novel technique that allows surgeons to perform a standardized arthroscopic transosseous (anchor free) repair of rotator cuff tears can improve postoperative pain and reduce the incidence of shoulder stiffness. The aim of the this study is to compare clinical outcomes of two groups of patients: patients that received an arthroscopic transosseous fixation using the ArthroTunneler tunneling device (Tornier Inc, Edina, Minnesota) versus patients that received an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using suture anchors.</brief_summary>
