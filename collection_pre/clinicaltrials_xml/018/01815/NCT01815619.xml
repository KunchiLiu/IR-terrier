	<brief_summary>This study will test two different methods for processing biopsy specimens taken from the bile duct. Patient;s who are asked to participate int his study have a growth (mass) in the bile duct that needs a biopsy so a diagnosis can be made. Standard of care includes performing 5-7 biopsies in the bile duct and sending the tissue to the lab for testing to make a diagnosis. Using this method the investigators can establish a diagnosis only about 50% of the time. The investigators believe that if a pathologist is available in the endoscopy suite during the procedure, the investigators can improve the test results. The purpose of this study is to compare the two methods for processing biopsies obtained from the bile duct.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of On-Site Verus Off-Site Evaluation of Cholangioscopy-Guided Biopsies of the Bile Duct</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnostic accuracy rate of cholangioscopy-guided biopsy is only 50%. This translates to the need for performing repeat procedures to establish a diagnosis and therefore delays patient treatment. The biopsy specimen obtained at cholangioscopy are usually processed in an offsite pathology lab. We believe that if a pathologist can assess the tissue sample during the procedure itself (onsite) and provide feedback, the diagnostic accuracy rate will improve. This translates to better (faster) diagnosis and early treatment. Therefore, we will be comparing onsite versus offsite evaluation of bile duct biopsy specimens to determine which method yields a better diagnosis.</detailed_description>
