	<brief_summary>With the abundance of energy-dense foods that are designed for ease of consumption in the current environment, it is of importance to better understand the factors that may undermine the control of energy intake at healthy levels. One of the factors that is potentially important in response inhibition is caffeine. The aim is to assess the direct effects of caffeine on response inhibition, using a No Go/Go-task. We will also assess whether the presentation of food cues, i.e. as words or as pictures, modulate response inhibition different in restrained vs. non-restrained eaters.</brief_summary>
