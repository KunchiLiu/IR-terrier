	<brief_summary>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic pathogens normally found in soil and water that are being cultured from Cystic Fibrosis (CF) airways at an increasing frequency. They have been demonstrated to cause clinically significant lung disease in some cases and the transmission of NTM, from person to person has been proposed. There are currently no standardized guidelines for isolation of those colonized or infected with NTM. The investigators will measure particle droplet size from patients with CF who have positive sputum cultures for NTM with the hypothesis that they will be in a range that can spread infection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with a positive NTM sputum culture will be asked to participate in the study. If they agree to participate they will sign an informed consent and will be scheduled to come to the University of Florida Clinical Research Center for the testing. The test will consist of the following: pulmonary function test, collecting a sputum culture if possible, coughing for 5 minutes into a tube connected to a canister, hypertonic saline and albuterol will be given after the 5 minutes of coughing and then they would repeat with another 5 minutes of coughing. There can be a break inbetween the coughing if needed. Patients maybe asked to come back a second time if they develop a different type of NTM or start treatment for NTM.</detailed_description>
