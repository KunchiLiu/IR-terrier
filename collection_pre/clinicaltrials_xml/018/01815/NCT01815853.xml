	<brief_summary>Background: It has been shown that the patitents with gastric cancer could benefits from peri-operative chemoradiotherapy, but whether the pre-operative chemoradiotherapy can improve patitents' outcome is still unclear. Patients and methods: In this study , patients with histologically confirmed gastric cancer whose pre-operative staging are cT4 any N,MO, aged from 18 to 70 years and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status â‰¤2 and adequate organ function, are randomized 1:1 to receive pre-operative chemoradiotherapy with DT45Gy/25f plus two cycles of XELOX(Xeloda 1000mg/m2, BID, DI-D14; Oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 on day 1;,21-days per cycle) or chemotherapy alone then following by surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy with XELOX at the same dose up to 4 cycles. The primary end point is overall survival (OS), and secondary end point is disease free survival(DFS) and safety. Final study analysis will be conducted in the end of the 5th year after the last patient's enrollment.</brief_summary>
