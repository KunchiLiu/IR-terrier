	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that children with spastic cerebral palsy will show greater improvements in gross motor function, associated developmental skills and growth after the 3 months of myofascial structural integration treatment, a form of deep massage, than they showed after a 3- or 6-month pre-treatment waiting period. The investigators further hypothesize that children with spastic CP will maintain their gains in gross motor function for â‰¥ 3 months after completion of MSI treatment.</brief_summary>
