	<brief_summary>A personal sound amplifying device (PASP) like Teo First is a wearable electronic product that is not intended to compensate for impaired hearing, but rather is intended for non-hearing impaired consumers to amplify sounds in the environment for a number of reasons, such as for recreational activities. Nevertheless, a lot of mild and moderate impaired hearing people don't want to buy and wear all day a real hearing aid. The goal of our study is to evaluate the benefit of such a device for mild and moderate presbycusis patient 60 years of age and older, with no previous hearing aid.</brief_summary>
