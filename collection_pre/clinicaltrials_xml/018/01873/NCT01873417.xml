	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of symptomatic therapies on gastrointestinal (GI)-related events reported by participants with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) initiating therapy with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in the clinical practice setting. The secondary objectives of this study are as follows: - To evaluate GI-related events requiring symptomatic therapy and the role of those therapies over time in participants with relapsing forms of MS initiating therapy with DMF in the clinical practice setting. - To evaluate GI-related events that lead to DMF discontinuation after the use of symptomatic therapy in participants with relapsing forms of MS initiating therapy with DMF in the clinical practice setting.</brief_summary>
