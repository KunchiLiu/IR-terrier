	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to determine the role of renal sympathetic denervation in the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence in patients with hypertension for whom a catheter-based AF ablation procedure is planned. Patients will be randomized to either AF catheter ablation (usual therapy) or AF catheter ablation plus renal sympathetic denervation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years of age History of PAF and plans for a guidelinesupported catheter ablation procedure. Paroxysmal AF is defined as AF with duration of 30 secs to 7 days. History of significant hypertension (defined as SBP ≥130 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥80 mmHg) and receiving treatment with at least one antihypertensive medication Renal vasculature accessible as determined by preprocedural renal MRA Willingness to comply with all postprocedural followup requirements and to sign informed consent Inability to undergo AF catheter ablation (e.g., presence of a left atrial thrombus, contraindication to all anticoagulation) Prior left atrial ablation for an atrial arrhythmia NYHA class IV congestive heart failure Pers or longstanding Pers AF (duration &gt; 7 days) Renal artery anatomy that is ineligible for treatment An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 45mL/min/1.73m2, using the MDRD calculation Life expectancy &lt;1 year for any medical condition</criteria>
