	<brief_summary>The overall aim with this project is to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on control of breathing in healthy volunteers and to compare it with propofol at the same degree of sedation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Ventilatory Response to Hypoxia During Sedation With Dexmedetomidine Compared to Propofol in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>15 volunteers will be investigated for their hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory response during sedation with dexmedetomidine and propofol in a randomized cross-over study. 6 volunteers will be investigated for their repeated response to hypoxia and hypercapnia in order to validate the method.</detailed_description>
