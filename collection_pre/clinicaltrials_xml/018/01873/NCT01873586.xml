	<criteria>1. Are 18 (eighteen) years of age or older at the time of surgery. 2. Require spinal fusion using TLIF, PLF or PLIF, with or without the use of an interbody spacer, at 1 to 3 levels between L3S1. 3. Are willing and able to return for the scheduled followup visits, follow postoperative instructions and undergo the required radiographic exams (A/P, Lateral Neutral and Lateral Flexion/Extension Xrays) for up to 4 time points between 3 weeks and 12 months postsurgery (3 months ± 2 weeks, 6±1 months, 12±2 months and if required 24±3 months postsurgery), including one CTscan at 12±2 months. 4. Are unresponsive to conservative care over a period of at least 6 months or have signs and/or symptoms that mandate urgent surgical intervention. 5. Are willing and able to sign study specific informed consent. 1. Are long term users of medications (i.e. steroids greater than 8 days) that are known to inhibit fusion or bone metabolism at any time within 6 months prior to surgery. Exceptions are inhaled steroids for asthma treatment (i.e. patients on inhaled steroids are allowed), or epidural steroid injections. 2. Are taking immunosuppressive agents (Cancer chemotherapy, treatment with Disease Modifying Antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or any similar immunomodulating drugs) or are treated with Growth Factors or Insulin at any time within 6 months prior to surgery. 3. Are being treated with radiotherapy. 4. Are having medical conditions, known to impact bone metabolism, such as Paget's disease, or has established osteoporosis (i.e. has had one or more fragility fractures). 5. Are pregnant, lactating or women wishing to become pregnant. 6. Are a prisoner. 7. BMI ≥ 40 8. Are smokers and/or nicotine/tobacco users 9. Are currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the study endpoints. 10. Had prior spine surgery at the index level except posterior decompressive surgery where the posterior elements are preserved e.g. facet saving techniques such as discectomy, laminotomy, and intradiscal procedures. 11. Use of routine prophylactic NSAIDS for 3 months postoperatively, but low dose concomitant pain medications e.g. aspirin should be continued and recorded on the Concomitant Pain Medications case report form (CRF).</criteria>
