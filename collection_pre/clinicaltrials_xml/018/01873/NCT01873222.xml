	<brief_title>OPtical Frequency Domain Imaging Versus INtravascular Ultrasound in Percutaneous Coronary InterventiON - OPINION Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) is a novel, high resolution intravascular imaging modality. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a widely used conventional imaging modality for achieving optimal stent deployment. This study is the sub-study of OPINION Trial. (UMIN000010580) The aim of this study is to evaluate how OFDI or IVUS imaging technology influence to the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) strategy. We will enroll the first 100 patients who have enrolled in the main-study of OPINION trial.(UMIN000010580). We will assess lesions by the other device in addition to the assigned device in the main study at the time of post-PCI. We will then assess lesions by OFDI at a 8-month follo-up.</detailed_description>
