	<brief_title>Comparative Study Menaquinone-7</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In an earlier study, beneficial effects of a nutrient-enriched dairy product on vitamin K-status were observed. The study product contained menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and omega-3 fatty acids for vascular health and extra minerals and antioxidants to support general health. It was the first time that such low dose of MK-7 (50 Âµg) could significantly improve vascular and general vitamin K-status already after short-term treatment. From the results of this study, it was assumed that the matrix of the dairy product and/or other components in the product, in which the vitamin was offered, contributed to optimal absorption and availability of vitamin K2. In this new study, the uptake and efficacy of MK-7 from the nutrient enriched product is investigated and compared to the uptake and efficacy from a MK-7-containing supplement and a basic dairy product enriched with MK-7.</detailed_description>
