	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to find out if adding triamcinolone (steroid) injection at the participant's initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedure will improve the opening of their esophagus and decrease the need for repeat dilations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of Endoscopic Dilation: Triamcinolone Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized two-arms cross-over trial. In this study there are two groups, the control group and the triamcinolone treatment group. The cross-over design will apply only in the control group when patients are not responding to EGD dilations alone (defined as no sustained improvement in baseline dysphagia) and they will be allowed to cross-over to the triamcinolone group and undergo 3 successive EGDs with triamcinolone injection. Typically, triamcinolone (steroid) injection is given as a standard of care after several esophageal dilations are performed and failed to improve the condition. Therefore, researchers want to find out if adding triamcinolone (steroid) injection at the participant's initial EGD procedure will improve the opening of their esophagus and decrease the need for repeat dilations.</detailed_description>
