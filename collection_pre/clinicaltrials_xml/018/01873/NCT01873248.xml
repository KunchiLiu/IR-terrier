	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, Phase 1-2, single center study in a total of 100 subjects with Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs). Study participants will receive a one-time administration of 68Ga-DOTATATE and undergo a PET/CT imaging study, to investigate its suitability as a PET imaging agent for NETs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of 68Ga-DOTATATE, as a PET Imaging Agent in Neuroendocrine Tumor Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, we propose to use a well-established PET isotope, 68-Gallium (68Ga), bound to a somatostatin analogue, DOTA-octreotate, or DOTATATE, which has high affinity for the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2). Most gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) NETs express SSTR2 on their cell surfaces; when the radiolabeled SSTR2 analogue binds to these receptors, the radioactive molecule is internalized and transported to the tumor cell nucleus, thus concentrating the radioactivity and improving the signal-to-noise ratio on the PET scan, particularly as the background rapidly clears. This internalization, combined with the improved physical principles of PET imaging, shorter half-life of the 68Ga (68 minutes vs. about three days for 111In), improved radiation dosimetry, faster scanning, and lower cost results in a greatly improved scan for diagnosis, staging and restaging of NET disease compared to conventional 111In-octreotide imaging. Additionally, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning can be performed in 1.5 hours from injection of the radiopharmaceutical to completion of the scan, vs. 2-3 days for 111In-octreotide imaging.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Known diagnosis of NET, suspected SSTR positive tumors or suspected NET recurrence. At least 18 years of age. Patient or patient's legally acceptable representative cognitively provides written informed consent. Able to provide informed consent. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening/baseline. Use of any other investigational product or device within 30 days prior to dosing, or known requirement for any other investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments. Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more or not able to enter the bore of the PET/CT scanner due to BMI, because of the compromise in image quality with CT, PET/CT and MRI that will result. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time. Inability to complete the needed investigational and standardofcare imaging examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.) Recognized concurrent active infection. Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance.</criteria>
