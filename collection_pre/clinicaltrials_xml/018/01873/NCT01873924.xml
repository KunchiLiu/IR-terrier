	<brief_summary>This study aims to assess the natural history of Batten disease by obtaining information about the motor, behavioral, and functional capabilities of individuals with Batten disease (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis). This study will also refine and validate the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS) as a clinical rating instrument for Batten disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Batten Disease is an inherited disorder that causes progressive cognitive and behavioral decline in children. There have been no systematic clinical studies of Batten Disease using standardized rating instruments with known inter-rater reliability and validity. The Batten Study Group developed the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS), a clinical rating instrument used to assess the motor, behavioral, and functional capabilities of individuals with Batten disease. The UBDRS will be refined and targeted as a clinical tool and research instrument. Using the UBDRS, study physicians may evaluate participants every year to track disease progression and to determine whether the UBDRS is sensitive to symptom changes. Participants will be examined at the University of Rochester Batten Center or at the Batten Disease Support and Research Association annual meeting, which is held every summer. Study personnel may also conduct neuropsychological testing with participants who have Batten Disease in order to enhance our understanding of their cognitive functioning. Participants with Batten Disease may also be asked to have an electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained. This will provide information about cardiac changes that might occur in children with Batten Disease. Additionally, parents or legal guardians of participants with Batten disease may be asked to complete interviews and questionnaires involving the following topics: - racial and ethnic background, medical history, medications, and symptoms - family history, parent education, and the type of training the child received when his or her vision began to decline - previous testing that may have been done to confirm a Batten Disease diagnosis - child's mood and behavior (if child is 5 - 18 years old) - parental beliefs regarding the placement of pacemakers - beliefs regarding procedures and other surgeries for children with Batten disease - opinions regarding supportive care during the various stages of Batten disease If genetic testing has not yet been done, blood or cheek cells may be collected to confirm a Batten Disease diagnosis. Blood and cheek samples from participants with Batten Disease and their parents may also be collected and used in an attempt to better understand the genetic changes that cause Batten Disease and influence its severity. Furthermore, female siblings may participate by providing a blood sample. These samples will be examined to see how the amount of estrogen in the blood of females with Batten Disease compares to the amount of estrogen in the blood of their sisters who do not have Batten Disease. Participants will be added to a database of children with Batten Disease whose parents have consented to be contacted about possible participation in future studies. This registry serves as a vehicle for recruitment.</detailed_description>
