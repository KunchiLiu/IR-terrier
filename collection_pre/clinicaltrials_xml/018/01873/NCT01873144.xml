	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) is superior to hypertonic saline solution (HSS) in the treatment of moderate acute viral bronchiolitis in infants in improving respiratory distress and comfort and reducing length of hospital stay (LOS) and admission to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).</brief_summary>
