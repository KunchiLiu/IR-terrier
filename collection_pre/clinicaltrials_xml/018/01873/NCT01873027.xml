	<brief_title>OPtical Frequency Domain Imaging vs. INtravascular Ultrasound in Percutaneous Coronary InterventiON</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) is a novel, high resolution intravascular imaging modality. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a widely used conventional imaging modality for achieving optimal stent deployment. The aim of this randomized study is to evaluate the impact of OFDI guidance for Percutaneous Coronay Intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) as compared with IVUS guidance. We will enroll 800 patients with a de novo lesion who will undergo PCI with DES as is routine practice. Patients will be rondomely assigned to either OFDI-guided PCI arm or IVUS-guided PCI arm. Patients will then have a follow-up contact at the time of hospital discharge, 8 month and 12 month after PCI.</detailed_description>
