	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the possibility of using jaw-tapping training as a self-exercise for developing memory and preventing dementia in elderly subjects with memory disturbances using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Jaw-tapping Movement on Memory Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Right-handed female volunteers over the age of 50 years with subjective memory complaints are included in the study. Volunteers with dentures, psychoactive medication, history of stroke, or other neurologic disorders are excluded. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of university-based hospital. After administering the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores above 24 and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) scores of 0 are considered subjective memory complaints (SMC), and MMSE scores above 23 and CDR scores of 0.5 are considered MCI. All subjects undergo two MRI scans. After the first MRI, the subjects are trained to tap their jaws vertically at 1.6 Hz at home twice a day for 30 seconds every day during four weeks.</detailed_description>
