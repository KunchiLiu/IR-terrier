	<brief_title>NIV NAVA Versus NIV-PS in Pediatric Patients - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will be an observational no randomize study in which the NiNAVAped protocol will be applied solely to the NIV NAVA arm. Every PICU will have to include 3 patients in the Pilot study before starting the clinical trial, which means that the pilot study will involve a maximum of 60 patients. Should the Pilot study reveal deficiencies in the NiNAVAped design, the protocol would be improved accordingly. There will be a specific consent document during the Pilot study. The Pilot study will be published in a scientific journal.</detailed_description>
