	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effect of Abiraterone (JNJ-589485) on the Pharmacokinetics of Pioglitazone Following Administration of Abiraterone Acetate (JNJ-212082) and Pioglitazone HCl Tablets in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) single-dose drug-drug interaction study to assess the effect of abiraterone on pioglitazone. Approximately 16 healthy adult male participants will be enrolled in this study. The study consists of a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 2 single-dose treatment periods, end-of-study or withdrawal assessments done upon completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 11 of Period 2 or upon withdrawal, and a follow-up visit 5 to 7 days after the last study procedure. The total study length is 32 days. Participants will receive pioglitazone alone on Day 1 (Period 1) of the study. On Day 8 (Period 2), participants will receive a single dose of abiraterone acetate followed by a single dose of pioglitazone one hour later. Successive pioglitazone administrations will be separated by a washout period of 7 days. Participants will be confined to the study center from Day -1 to Day 4 of Period 1 and from Day 7 to Day 11 of Period 2, at least 10 hours before each study drug administration until completion of the 72-hour blood sample collection for each period. A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from all participants on Day -1. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
