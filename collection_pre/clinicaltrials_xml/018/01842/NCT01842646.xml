	<brief_summary>This study is being done to see how safe an investigational drug is and test how well it will work to help people with refractory/relapsed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Hedgehog Inhibitor for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this study is to see whether the participant's disease responds favorably to the investigational drug, PF-04449913. Post treatment Phase: After coming off of active treatment study drug (PF-04449913), participants will be followed monthly for survival only. No other data will be captured during this time.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis by World Health Organization (WHO) Criteria of MDS, CMML, or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (except acute promyelocytic leukemia) with &lt; 30% bone marrow blasts (RAEBt by French American British criteria) Hypomethylating agent (azacitidine and/or decitabine) failure, defined as lack of response, disease progression, loss of response, or intolerance as deemed by the study investigator Adequate renal function, as evidenced by a serum creatinine ≤ 2 times the institutional upper limit of normal Adequate hepatic function, as evidenced by a serum bilirubin &lt; 2 times the institutional upper limit of normal and an aspartic transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; 2 times the institutional upper limit of normal. Indirect hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbert's disease or hemolysis is permitted. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients with a history of prior therapy with another investigational agent within 4 weeks of the first planned dose of PF0444913 Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to PF04449913 Prior therapy with another hedgehog inhibitor Concurrent use of any other agent for MDS, CMML, or AML. Growth factor use with epoetin, darbepoetin, or granulocyte colonystimulating factor must be terminated at least 2 weeks before initiation of study treatment. Any uncontrolled concurrent illness that would, in the opinion of the investigator, limit compliance with study requirements Second malignancy requiring active therapy A prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) of ≥480 ms interval on electrocardiogram History of metastatic cancer diagnosed less than 2 years prior to the first planned dose of PF0444913 Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PF04449913 is smoothened inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with PF04449913. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with PF04449913. Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Therefore, HIVpositive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with PF04449913.</criteria>
