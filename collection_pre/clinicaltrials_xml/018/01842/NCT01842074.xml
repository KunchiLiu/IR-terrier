	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to study the role of bortezomib for desensitizing patients awaiting a living kidney donation who have a titer of Donor Specific anti HLA Antibody (DSA) between 1000 and 3000 MFI with a multicentre pilot study of 10 patients. The effect of bortezomib will be observed up to 6 month after bortezomib treatment prior to transplantation and 12 month after transplantation if performed. The living kidney donation will be performed only if the DSA level drops below 1000 MFI which means an efficacy of the desensitization.</detailed_description>
