	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a 6-month, parallel, single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) feasibility study of a self-management program to reduce sedentary time and increase physical activity (Sit Less to Move More) in women aged 55-70 years. The primary aim is to determine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention; and the secondary aim is to test the effect of the intervention on the primary health outcome, physical activity (mean daily step count by accelerometry) at 6 months. The investigators will also conduct an economic evaluation and a process evaluation to guide a future larger study and to inform a scaled-up implementation plan.</brief_summary>
