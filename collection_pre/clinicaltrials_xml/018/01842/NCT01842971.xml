	<brief_title>ALPPS (Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation) for Two-stage Hepatectomy for Colorectal Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In France, each year around 36,000 new cases of colorectal cancers are registered responsible in 16,000 deaths because of liver metastasis. In case of bilobar metastasis, classic two-stage hepatectomy with portal embolization could be performed. An alternative to the classic surgery, early two stage hepatectomy, could be proposed to simplify the patient's management and to improve the resectability.</detailed_description>
