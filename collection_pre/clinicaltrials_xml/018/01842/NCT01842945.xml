	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine the effects of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for procrastination, and to investigate whether it can be delivered via the Internet. Two treatment groups will be used, one with therapist contact and one without, as well as a wait-list control group. It is assumed that the treatment group with therapist contact will be superior to the treatment group receiving no therapist contact since procrastination can be partially explained as a self-regulatory failure. Both treatment groups are presumed to be superior to the wait-list control.</brief_summary>
