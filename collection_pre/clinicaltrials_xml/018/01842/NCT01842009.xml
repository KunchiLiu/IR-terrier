	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the mean number of stimulation (high definition-transcranial direct current stimulation) sessions (up to 26) needed to achieve a clinical response with this response defined as a 50% decrease in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. These data will be important in defining the optimal number of sessions for future fibromyalgia subjects in Phase III trials.</brief_summary>
