	<brief_title>Efficacy of Fish Oil in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current research findings suggest that Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as eicosahexanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) contained in fish oil may have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the efficacy of fish oil supplementation on serum proinflammatory cytokines levels, oxidative stress markers and disease progression in MS. 50 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were enrolled. The experimental group received orally 4 g/day of fish oil for 12 months. The primary outcome was serum TNFα levels; Secondary outcomes were IL-1β, IL-6, nitric oxide catabolites, lipoperoxides, progression on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and annualized relapses rate (ARR).</detailed_description>
