	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, single-center, randomized, 2-way crossover study to evaluate the bioequivalence of OXEMET™ 1000 mg coated tablets, relative to 1000 mg of the reference product administered as two 500 mg tablets, under fasting conditions, in 24 healthy adult subjects. Each subject will receive two treatments (Treatment A and Treatment B). In Period 1, subjects will be dosed with either one OXEMET™ 1000 mg tablet (Treatment A, Test) or two 500 mg tablets of reference product (GLAFORNIL™ 500 mg) (Treatment B, Reference). Following a washout of at least 7 days, subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 to receive the treatment that they did not receive in Period 1.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt; 35%). Single QTc &lt; 450 msec. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Male or female between 21 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of childbearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 7 days postlast dose. Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 27 kg/m2 (inclusive). Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. A positive test for HIV antibody. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an average weekly intake of &gt; 14 drinks for males or &gt; 7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 360 mL of beer, 150 mL of wine or 45 mL of 40% abv distilled spirits. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Subjects whose sitting blood pressure is less than 110/60 mmHg at screening or prior to dosing, or greater than 140/90 mmHg at screening. Subjects whose pulse is lower than 50 beats per minute or higher than 99 beats per minute at screening or prior to dosing. Subjects whose ECG PR interval is &gt; 220 msec at screening or prior to dosing. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or prior to dosing. Lactating females. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history of regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening. Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia.</criteria>
