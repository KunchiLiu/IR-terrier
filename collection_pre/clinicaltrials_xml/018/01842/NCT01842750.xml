	<brief_summary>This study aims to test the hypothesis that insertion of an endorectal balloon into a patient receiving radical prostate radiotherapy by treatment radiographers is feasible without the patient experiencing undue discomfort. In addition this study will test the hypotheses that insertion of the rectal balloon prior to radiotherapy delivery stabilises rectal volume during radiotherapy treatment and minimises organ motion within the pelvis.</brief_summary>
