	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of carfilzomib when given together with melphalan and to see how well they work in treating patients with multiple myeloma before stem cell transplant. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving carfilzomib together with melphalan may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib and Melphalan Before Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib that can be added to high dose melphalan as part of conditioning chemotherapy for myeloma. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the combination in patients with myeloma undergoing stem cell transplantation, as defined by achievement of complete response (CR). (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the toxicities associated with addition of carfilzomib to high dose melphalan in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). II. To determine the progression free rate at 1 and 2 years post registration. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status. II. To assess the HevyLite assay prior to and during treatment. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carfilzomib followed by a phase II study. CONDITIONING: Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -6, -5, -2, and -1. Patients also receive melphalan IV over 1 hour on days -4 and -3. TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplant on day 0. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30, day 100, and then every 90 days for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
