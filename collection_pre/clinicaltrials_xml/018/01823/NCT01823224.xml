	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to learn whether perioperative IV (intravenous) administration of acetaminophen (commonly referred to as Tylenol) shows any different clinical outcomes over the oral (by mouth) administration of acetaminophen for a patient having a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. If improved pain scores occur with the administration of IV acetaminophen, it may result in fewer requests for pain-related intervention such as other oral pain medications.</brief_summary>
