	<brief_summary>Patients patients enrolled in this study have a Lymphoma caused by EBV (after bone marrow transplantation, organ transplantation or patient immunodeficient. They will receive one to three injections of allogenic CTL specific EBV. The purpose of this study is to ensure that these injections can not cause a GVH and to study what the side effects are and to see whether this therapy might help patients with Lymphoma. Immunological monitoring will also be studied.</brief_summary>
