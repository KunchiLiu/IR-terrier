	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a combined use of non-invasive coronary angiography with multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in patients with obstructive lesions on MSCT and with low to intermediate pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) as compared to invasive coronary angiography (CAG) and Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) measurements.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with stable angina pectoris with low to intermediate pretest likelihood of CAD; 2. no previous history of CAD; 3. obstructive stenosis (â‰¥50% luminal narrowing) on MSCT coronary angiography; 4.informed consent. 1. patients with a previous history of CAD; 2. patients with contraindications for MSCT: a.cardiac rhythms other than sinus rhythm, b.pregnancy, c.allergy for contrast medium, d.renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 50ml/min), e.resting heart rate &gt;75 bpm plus contraindications for betablockade, f. weight &gt;100 kilograms; 3. contraindications for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging: a.MRincompatible implants, b. Claustrophobia, c. contraindications for adenosine: i. known or suspected hypersensitivity to adenosine, ii. known or suspected bronchoconstrictive or bronchospastic disease, iii. 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block, iv.
