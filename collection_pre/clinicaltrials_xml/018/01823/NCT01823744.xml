	<detailed_description>Despite the increasing incidence of overweight and obesity among children, nutritional deficiencies are still a concern. A low intake of vitamins and minerals is associated with a reduction in the antioxidant capacity. Some vitamins are associated with chronic diseases including overweight and obesity. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) are the substrate and product of essential reactions; the SAM:SAH ratio has been associated with health and is an indicator of cellular DNA methylation potential. Low level of this ratio may affect short and long term health. In this explorative knowledge building open interventional study, subject to be enrolled are children or adolescents 9 to 13 years of age per year (n=180 per year, over 2 years). The study consists of 6 weeks nutritional intervention followed by a 6 weeks follow up. In this study, genomics, proteomics, lipidomics analysis will be performed, in addition to biochemistry, hematology and vitamins analysis.</detailed_description>
