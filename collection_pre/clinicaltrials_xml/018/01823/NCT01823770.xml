	<brief_summary>Several studies report association between restless legs syndrome (RLS), HTA and cardiovascular diseases . The mechanisms involved in this relationship remained unknown, but several evidences favor the role of periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), patterns frequently associated with RLS. Sympathetic overactivity is associated with PLMS with increased pulse rate and blood pressure coincident with PLMS. PLMS-related repetitive nocturnal blood pressure fluctuations could contribute to the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke in patients with RLS, especially in the elderly. Several studies already reported that dopaminergic agonists reduce the severity of RLS and the PLMS index. Do dopaminergic agonists reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated autonomic dysfunctions in patients with RLS? Nocturnal BP (blood pressure) decline has major clinical implications, and the loss of normal reduction in BP during sleep is associated with high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of rotigotine patch treatment on validated cardiovascular risk factors ambulatory BP during night, day and night-to-day ratio, and endothelial function in patients with idiopathic RLS compared to placebo.</brief_summary>

Subject is informed and given ample time and opportunity to think about her/his participation and has given her/his written informed consent. 2. Subject understands the investigational nature of the study and is willing and able to comply with the study requirements. Subject is willing to accept that he/she might be treated with placebo during the Treatment Period. 3. Subject is able to apply/remove the study patches correctly. 4. Subject is male or female, and is ≥18 and ≤80 years of age. 5. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) of ≥18kg/m2 and ≤35kg/m2. 6. Subject has ferritin concentration of ≥50ng/mL at Screening. 9. Subject has a diagnosis of RLS based on the 4 cardinal diagnostic clinical features according to the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group 11. At Baseline, subject has a score of ≥15 points on the IRLS (indicating moderateto severe RLS). 12. At Baseline, subject scores ≥10 PLMs per hour on the PLMI based on PSG To be eligible to participate in this study, all of the following criteria must be present in the controls: 1. Subject is informed and given ample time and opportunity to think about her/his participation and has given her/his written informed consent. 2. Subject understands the investigational nature of the study and is willing and able to comply with the study requirements. 4. Subject is male or female, and is ≥18 and ≤80 years of age. 5. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) of ≥18kg/m2 and ≤35kg/m2. RLS patients are not permitted to be included in the study if any of the following criteria is met: 1. Subject has RLS associated with previous or concomitant therapy with dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, butyrophenones, metoclopramide, atypical antipsychotics (eg, olanzapine), antidepressants, mianserine, or lithium or H2blockers (eg, cimetidine). 2. Subject has a history of any sleep disorder other than RLS including a severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (Apnea hypopnea index &gt; 30/h) not treated by a controlled Continuous Positive Airway Therapy (CPAP) for at least 1 month prior to Screening, or has narcolepsy or other hypersomnia. 3. Subject has clinically relevant polyneuropathy which cannot be clearly differentiated from RLS symptoms in the opinion of the investigator. 4.
