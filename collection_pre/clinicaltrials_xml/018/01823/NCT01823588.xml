	<brief_summary>A number of strategies have been evaluated to improve the prevention and control of the main cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors. Nursing telephonic and tele-counseling individualized lifestyle educational programs were found to improve blood pressure (BP) control and adherence to healthy lifestyle. This study aims at evaluating for the first time the efficacy of a nurse-led reminder program through email (NRP-e) to improve CVD risk factors among hypertensive adults. Participants will receive usual care and a guideline-based educational program on BP control and healthy lifestyle habits. Subjects in the NRP-e group will also receive weekly email alerts and phone calls from a nurse care manager for 6 months. Emails contain a reminder program on the compliance with a healthy lifestyle based upon current guidelines for CVD prevention. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 1, 3 and 6 months after enrollment; randomization will be made centrally and blood samples will be evaluated into a single, accredited laboratory.</brief_summary>
