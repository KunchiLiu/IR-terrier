The investigators' goal is to treat or lessen the late effects of cancer treatment. The supplement to be used will be a combination of the following: (1) VitaBlue (40% polyphenolics, 12.5% anthocyanins from blueberries (BB) and (2) n-3 fatty acids - Lovaza.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of administration of the nutritional supplement and placebo in this patient population and performing cognitive function testing at baseline and post supplementation. This is a randomized, double-blind pilot study of COGNUTRIN vs. Placebo. Participants have an equal chance (like flipping a coin) of being in either of the study groups. Neither the participant nor the study doctor will be able to choose which study group the participant is in. Participants will not know and the study doctor will not know which study group the participants are in.</detailed_description>
