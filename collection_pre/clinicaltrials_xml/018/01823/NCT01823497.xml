	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of 2 morphine delivery systems for post-surgical neonates. The investigators hypothesize that this study will be feasible to conduct, and that neonates receiving morphine via a Parent/Nurse Controlled Analgesia pump will receive less morphine and experience fewer side effects than neonates receiving morphine via continuous opioid infusion.</brief_summary>
