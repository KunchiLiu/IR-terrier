	<brief_title>Metabolic and Cognitive Parameters Following Partial Sleep Deprivation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is predicted that partial sleep deprivation negatively affects the hormonal status, e.g. upregulating ghrelin and other hunger-promoting hunger hormones, while showing impaired memory functions. It is also predicted that participants will tend to increase their desired portion sizes after partial sleep deprivation, compared with after a normal night's sleep.</detailed_description>
