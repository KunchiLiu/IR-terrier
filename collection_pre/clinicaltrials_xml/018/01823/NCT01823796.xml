	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness characterized by persistent widespread muscle pain with generalised hyperalgesia and allodynia. It can be accompanied by other concomitant symptoms: fatigue, sleep disturbances, musculoskeletal disorders, distress and psychological disorders. The prevalence has been reported to be between 2 and 5%. The hypothesis of this study is that women with fibromyalgia present high risk of falls and balance disorders compared with healthy women. The objective of this study was to investigate wether gait pattern changes in single and dual task conditions were associated with the risk of falling in women with fibromyalgia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk of Falls in Patients With Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Falls and fall-related injuries are a common health problem. A fall is often a result of intrinsic physiological ageing and underlying chronic disease interacting with the external and challenging environment. Disturbances in physical function, muscle strength, range of motion, poor balance, affectation in sensory system, a loss of proprioception, alteration concerning visual and vestibular aspects, dizziness, decreased endurance and cognitive and mobility impairment are the most common risk factors for falls. Postural control in a dual task setting is especially relevant to daily life situations. Attending to that, we propose an assessment based on these parameters in women with fibromyalgia.</detailed_description>
