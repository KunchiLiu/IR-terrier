	<brief_summary>Eligible eyes are randomized to two groups. Group A will receive three intravitreal injections of bevacizumab at 4 week intervals. In group B, three intravitreal injections of combined bevacizumab and fasudil will be performed with the same frequency. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) will be evaluated prior to injections and then every 4 weeks for 6 months. Fluorescein angiography will be performed at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24. The two groups will be compared in terms of BCVA and CMT changes.</brief_summary>
