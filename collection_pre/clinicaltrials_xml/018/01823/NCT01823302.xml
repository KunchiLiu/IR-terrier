	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study was to compare the change in z-scores for growth during a 120-day study period in children with picky eating behaviors who were randomly assigned to receive nutrition counseling only (control group) or nutrition counseling plus an oral milk-based nutritional supplement (study group). The secondary objectives of the study were to compare the following between the control and study groups: a) dietary macro- and micro-nutrient intakes; b) quantitative ultrasound bone measurements of radius and tibia; and c) incidence of common illnesses (diarrhea, upper and lower respiratory tract). The safety objective of the study was to compare the frequency of adverse events (AE) among the control group and study group subjects.</brief_summary>
