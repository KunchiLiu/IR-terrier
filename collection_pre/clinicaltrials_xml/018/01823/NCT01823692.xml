	<brief_title>Evaluating Validity of Ultrasonography in Determining Distal Radius Fracture Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Distal radius fracture is one of the most common causes for visiting the emergency department. Nowadays, simple radiography is used as a control standard for evaluating reduction of distal radius fractures. The disadvantages include time wasting, frequent x-ray exposures and use of more sedation in determining adequate reduction, made scientists to evaluate alternative method such as ultrasonography which fast, easy and less dangerous were considered as advantages. The investigators goal was to identify whether ultrasonography guidance compare with the simple radiography aids in determining the adequacy of distal radius fracture reduction.</detailed_description>
