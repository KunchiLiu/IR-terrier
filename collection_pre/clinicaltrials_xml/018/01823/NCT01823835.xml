	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-institution, Phase Ia/Ib/IIa open-label, dose-finding, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and proof-of-concept study of GDC-0810 as a single agent and in combination with palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist. The study is divided into 3 phases: Phase Ia, Phase Ib, and Phase IIa. During Phase Ia (dose escalation phase), GDC-0810 single agent will be administered orally on a continuous daily dosing regimen with a Day -7 lead-in period for single dose PK evaluation prior to the start of daily treatment. The incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated from Day -7 through the first cycle (28 days) of treatment (35 days total). Depending on safety and tolerability, participants will be assigned sequentially to escalating doses of GDC-0810 using standard 3 + 3 design. During Phase Ib (dose escalation and expansion phase), participants will receive GDC-0810 with palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and assess the safety and tolerability of concomitant administration. During Phase IIa (dose expansion phase), participants previously treated with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) will be treated at the RP2D to further characterize the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of GDC-0810.</brief_summary>
