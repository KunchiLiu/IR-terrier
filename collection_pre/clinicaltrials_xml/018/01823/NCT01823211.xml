	<brief_title>Profitability Trial in Primary Preventive Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current criteria for risk stratification of patients in risk of sudden cardiac death are mainly based on left ventricular ejection fraction and NYHA class. This criteria are too robust, approximately 2/3 of ICD recipients do not profit from this treatment in the following 5 years, especially those with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. We plan to sub-stratify this group of patients with both ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy by: non-linear heart rate variability analysis, microvolt T-wave alternans, QRT-T angle and character and amount of left ventricular scarring assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Pre-implantation values will be correlated with numbers and character of ICD therapy (both anti-tachycardial pacing and ICD discharge). The results may allow to decrease the number of patients, who do not profit from ICD treatment.</detailed_description>
