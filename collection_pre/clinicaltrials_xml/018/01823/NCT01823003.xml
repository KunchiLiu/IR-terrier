	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the safety of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SBRT) in selected patients with stage I Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic lung cancer to demonstrate the feasibility and risks of using an ablative dose-adapted scheme with FFF beams. Other aims are To evaluate the incidence of acute and late complications; To evaluate tumour response to local radiation therapy by means of CT, PET/TC and MRI and To evaluate the impact of local therapy on overall and disease-free survival.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intervention (dose and fractions) depends on topographical parameters: lung disease (primary, peripheral nodes or mediastinal nodes), distance to chest wall, tumour size and distance to main bronchus.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed primary lung cancer or lung metastasis from another primary tumour or positive PET/CT suggestive for primary tumour(SUV MAX&gt; 4). Tumour size &lt; 5 cm in diameter prior to treatment. Medically inoperable patients as determined by the multidisciplinary thoracic tumour board, or medically operable patients who refuse surgery. Life expectancy of &gt;12 months. Criterion for medical inoperability include: Overall clinical assessment at the UCLA thoracic tumour board. Reduced Pulmonary Function (FEV1, DLCO, etc) based on one major or two minor criterion as described below: Minor Criteria: Age &gt; 75, FEV1 51 60% predicted, or FEV1 11.2L, DLCO 51%60% predicted, pulmonary hypertension, poor left ventricular function (EF &lt; 40% or less), resting or exercise arterial pO2 &lt; 55 mmHg, and pCO2 &gt; 45 mmHg. Age &gt; 18 years. KPS &gt; 70. Barthel score &gt;40 Baseline computed tomography scans of the chest, pulmonary test function, and positron emission tomography no more than 2 months before treatment. If a woman is of childbearing potential, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test must be documented. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Prior thoracic radiation treatment wich dose contribution can be expected in the new SBRT plan. More than two lesions per lobe. Active infections requiring systemic antibiotics. Age &lt;18 years old. KPs &lt; 70. Barthel Total Score &lt; 40.</criteria>
