	<brief_summary>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is believed to be the early stage of dementia. The investigators assume that some psychological and imaging risks may predict the conversion. In the current longitudinal study, psychological and imaging data of people with MCI will be obtained at baseline, and will be followed at 26 weeks and 52 weeks. The predictors will be found in comparison with controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting the Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment to Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MCI increases the risk of later developing dementia. About 10-15% of the amnestic form of mild cognitive impairment will progress to Alzheimer's disease in one year. But some people with MCI never get worse. Others with MCI later have test results that return to normal for their age and education. To develop a new drug for the prevention of dementia(dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia), investigators need a sensitive and specific tool for recognizing patients who will converse to dementia. The investigators want to establish an operational diagnostic criteria instead of a descriptive criteria for mild cognitive impairment.</detailed_description>
