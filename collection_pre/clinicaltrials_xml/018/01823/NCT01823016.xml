	<brief_title>A Study of JNJ-38518168 in Symptomatic Adult Participants With Uncontrolled, Persistent Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be randomized (treatment group assigned by chance, like flipping a coin), double-blind (study investigators and participants will not know what treatment is being administered), and placebo-controlled (a placebo is identical to the study agent, but contains no active ingredients). A total of 160 participants will receive either placebo or JNJ-38518168 once daily. The study duration will be approximately 32 weeks and will include a screening phase of approximately 4 weeks, a 24-week placebo-controlled treatment phase, and a 4-week follow-up phase. Participant safety will be monitored throughout the entire study period..</detailed_description>
