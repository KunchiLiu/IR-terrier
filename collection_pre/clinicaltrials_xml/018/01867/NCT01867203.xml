	<brief_summary>Patients needing lipid lowering therapy will be recruited before initiation of the treatment. For each patient, total and LDL cholesterol levels before start of therapy will be measured. One, three and six months after his/her first visit, when steady-state will be reached, for each included patient, the cholesterol levels will be re-assessed in order to evaluate the response to statin therapy calculated as the amplitude of cholesterol reduction. The aim is to assess the association between patient's genotype and the response to statin therapy.</brief_summary>
