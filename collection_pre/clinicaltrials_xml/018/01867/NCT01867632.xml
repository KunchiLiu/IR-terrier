	<brief_summary>The goal of the present study is to definitely determine whether the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) during primary cleft palate repair decreases the rate of fistula formation. Although individual studies have described promising advantages to its use in cleft palate surgery, no consensus currently exists. Without concrete evidence, one must question the whether the increased cost, time and potential patient risk (human derived tissue) to patients justifies its use in primary cleft palate repair.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acellular Dermal Matrix in Primary Furlow Palatoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational study composed of a prospective cohort group receiving ADM compared to a retrospective historical cohort group without ADM. Objectives of the study: Primary objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine whether ADM would lower the incidence of palatal fistula in patients undergoing primary cleft palate repair. Secondary objectives: 1. Incidence of wound dehiscence 2. Incidence of wound infection 3. Hospital length of stay</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children diagnosed as having Veau class II to IV cleft palates undergoing Furlow palatoplasty with ADM between the ages of 3 months and 3 years will be included in this study. Selection will be based on the parent's willingness to allow their child to participate in the study. Children with diagnosed craniofacial syndromes will be excluded from the study due their higher than usual incidence of palatal fistulas. Children with known wound healing defects, such as Ehler Danlos syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum, will be excluded from the study due to their inherent collagen defects and consequently on the incidence of palatal fistulas. Children with Veau class I cleft palates and those who will need/needed any surgical technique other then Furlow palatoplasty will be excluded from the study.</criteria>
