	<brief_summary>Ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) using pulmonary vein isolation is employed when patients do not respond favorably to medical therapy. Successful procedures are accomplished in the majority of patients, but the outcome after many years of follow-up after ablation is unknown.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ten-year Outcomes After AF Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospectively identified cohort of 445 patients who demonstrated freedom from AF for at least one year following ablation (single procedure in 391, 87.9%) was followed for 66.0 Â± 34.0 months. Patients were seen at least annually as outpatients, and underwent regular ECG monitoring, especially if there were symptoms suggestive of recurrent arrhythmia. Continued absence of arrhythmia was defined as freedom from AF or flutter &gt; 30 secs.</detailed_description>
