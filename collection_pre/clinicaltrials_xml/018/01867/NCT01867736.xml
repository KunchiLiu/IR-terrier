	<criteria>1. Subject has provided written informed consent. 2. Subject is willing and able to comply with followup evaluations. 3. Subject is ≥ 18 years old. 4. Single or sequential de novo or restenotic lesions (stenosis ≥ 70% diameter reduction or occlusion) in the infrapopliteal arteries ≥ 30 mm. Lesions should not extend beyond the ankle joint. 5. A maximum of 2 different vessels can be treated: successful wire crossing is required for the first target vessel before randomization occurs. 6. Subject with PAD or critical limb ischemia according to the current guidelines in need for urgent revascularization to relieve symptoms and improve walking capacity. 7. Reference Vessel Diameter (RVD) 2 4 mm, based on visual estimation. 8. Inflow free from flowlimiting lesion confirmed by angiography. Patients with flowlimiting inflow lesions (&gt; 50% stenosis) can be included if lesion(s) have been treated successfully before the index procedure, with a maximum residual stenosis of 30% per visual assessment. 9. At least one nonoccluded crural vessel with angiographically documented runoff to the foot. 10. Successful wire crossing of the lesion. 1. Flowlimiting (&gt; 50% DS) inflow lesion proximal to target lesion, left untreated. 2. Failure to obtain &lt;30% residual stenosis in a preexisting haemodynamically significant (&gt;50% DS) inflow lesion (DEB or DES not allowed for the treatment of inflow lesions). 3. Infrapopliteal lesions extending beyond the ankle joint and involving crural vessels. 4. Acute thrombus in the target vessel (eg complication of inflow lesion treatment) documented by angiogram, if not treated successfully prior to enrolment). 5. Planned major amputation above the ankle of target limb, or any other planned major surgery within 30 days postprocedure. 6. Previous bypass surgery of target vessel. 7. Previously implanted stent in target lesion. 8. Haemorrhagic diathesis or coagulopathy or other disorders such as gastrointestinal ulcerations or cerebral disorders that would restrict prescription of dual antiplatelet therapy. 9. Subject with hepatic failure, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, systemic lupus erythematous or subject is on immunosuppressant therapy. 10. Subject with acute MI ≤ 3 months. 11. Renal failure with a creatinine of ≥ 2,5 mg/dl, except patients currently on regular dialysis. 12. Phenprocoumon intake, except for patients who are treated for Arterial Fibrillation. For these patients Phenprocoumon treatment can be interrupted and restarted after treatment with Dual Antiplatelet Therapy for 4 weeks post procedure. 13. Known allergy to contrast media used for angiography that cannot be controlled by premedication with steroids and/or antihistaminica. 14. Allergy, intolerance or hypersensitivity to Paclitaxel or related compounds and/or to the delivery matrix nButyryl trinhexyl citrate(BTHC). 15. Co morbid conditions limiting life expectancy ≤ 1 year. 16. Patients that are under active treatment for cancer; Patients, who have been successfully treated for cancer in the past, can be included. 17. Subject is participating in another clinical device trial where the primary endpoint has not yet been reached. 18. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding females or females who intend to become pregnant during the time of the study.</criteria>
