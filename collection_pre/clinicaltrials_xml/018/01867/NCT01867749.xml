	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized pilot trial in a sample of 60 women who meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 1-18 months after a perinatal loss to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed recruitment methods and research design, of the therapist training methods, and of delivering the adapted Interpersonal Psychotherapy group treatment. The investigators would like to examine preliminary evidence for the following hypotheses: - Perinatal-loss specific IPT-G will be more acceptable to women who experience MDD following perinatal loss than will Coping with Depression (CWD). - Perinatal-loss specific IPT-G will result in reduced time to remission from MDD and reduced depressive symptoms relative to CWD. - Perinatal-loss specific IPT-G will result in increased social support and social functioning, reduced couple distress, and reduced grief relative to CWD.</brief_summary>
