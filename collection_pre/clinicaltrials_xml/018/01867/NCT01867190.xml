	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial infusion and intramuscular injection of an autologous, bone marrow-derived stem cell preparation (ASCT01) versus placebo in patients with critical limb ischemia who have exhausted all medical and surgical therapeutic options. The safety and tolerability will be evaluated by regular monitoring of the general physical condition, vital signs, and the occurrence of AE and SAE, respectively. Furthermore, the standard biochemical and blood variables (red and white blood cell counts, Hb, Ht, platelets, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphor, ASAT, ALAT, bilirubin, total protein, albumin, AP, cholesterol (LDL,HDL), triglycerides, urea and creatinine, immunoglobulins, HBA1c, C-peptide) will be checked before the treatment as well as 30 and 90 days after the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efficacy will be determined by number of collateral arteries as assessed magnetic resonance angiography at baseline and again at 3 months, rate of major amputation (above the ankle) of the affected limb within 3 months or an unchanged critical limb ischemia of the affected limb after 3 months defined as less than 15% change in tcPO2 or ABI or absolute ankle pressure.Efficacy endpoint is at 3 months. Clinical endpoints and safety will be measured through 12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male and Female patients in the age group of 1880yrs. 2. Established CLI (confirmed by Rutherford 4 to 5) with angiographic evidence of significant infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease 3. Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABI) ≤ 0.6 or the absolute ankle blood pressure &lt; 60 mm Hg or TcPO2&lt;20 mmHg without tissue loss or TcPO2&lt;40 mmHg if there is tissue loss or alternatively toe Brachial Pressure Index (TBI) less 0.5 or the absolute toe blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg 4. No surgical or interventional option for revascularization and no response to best standard care delivered as confirmed by a vascular surgeon and/or physician. 5. No immediate lifethreatening complication from CLI which would demand immediate amputation. 6. Patients who are able to understand the requirements of the study, and willing to provide voluntary written informed consent, abide by the study requirements, and agree to return for required followup visits. 7. On optimal medical therapy 8. If diabetic, HgbA1c &lt;10% 1. Acute life threatening complication of limb ischemia with the need for immediate limb amputation to avoid death or clinical deterioration 2. Patients with confirmed Rutherford 6 condition with extensive tissue damage 3. Patients with documented terminal illness or cancer or any concomitant disease process with a life expectancy of less than 6 months. 4. Patients with a history of severe alcohol or drug abuse within 3 months of screening. 5. Known bone marrow diseases which preclude transplantation. 6. Endstage renal failure on regular dialysis treatment. Creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dl 7. Patients already enrolled in another investigational drug trial or completed within 1month. 8. Pregnancy. 9. Patients tested positive for HIV screen1or2, Hepatitis C antibody Hepatitis B surfaceantigen, HepatitisBcore Antibody, Syphilis screen 10. Myocardial infarction / CVA / TIA within the past three months prior to enrollment 11. Revascularization procedure in target limb within 6 weeks prior to enrollment 12. Laboratory values as show below* 13. Currently taking immunosuppressive agents 14. If diabetic, diagnosis of proliferative retinopathy 15. Patients with infected ulcers or systemic infections *Laboratory Values: Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL Platelet count &lt;100,000/microL ALT &gt;60 U/L AST &gt;60 U/L Bilirubin &gt;1.0 mg/dL INR &gt;1.3 unless on Coumadin and at Investigator discretion APTT &gt;40 second unless on Lovenox or Heparin and at Investigator's discretion</criteria>
