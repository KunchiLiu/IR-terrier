	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Cardiac Safety of TAS-102 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, nonrandomized study to evaluate the cardiac safety of TAS-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study is conducted in 2 phases: the cardiac safety evaluation phase to investigate cardiac repolarization and the cardiac safety profile (Cycle 1) and the extension phase to assess the safety profile and antitumor activity (subsequent cycles).</detailed_description>
