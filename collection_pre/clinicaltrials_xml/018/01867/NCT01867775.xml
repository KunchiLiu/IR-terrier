	<brief_title>Mirtazapine for Sleep Disorders in Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mirtazapine has been used for depressed elderly with sleep disorders with good tolerability and efficacy. The study hypothesis is that mirtazapine could also be used in demented with sleep disorders. Sleep disorders (SD) affects 35 to 50 percent of patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD). These disorders often make caring for patients at home very difficult and It's also associated with higher risk of institutionalization and increases health care costs. Treatment of SD in people with dementia may benefit both patients and their caregivers. However, little is known about the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for treating sleep disturbances in AD.</detailed_description>
