	<brief_title>Portuguese Registry on Interventional Cardiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease remains the main cause of death in Portugal and approximately one quarter of these are directly to ischemic heart disease. In order to better characterize percutaneous coronary intervention in Portugal, the Portuguese Society of Cardiology has promoted the Portuguese registry on percutaneous coronary intervention. This will include all adult patients (â‰¥ 18 years), eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in accordance with PCI state-of-art recommendations (including unstable and stable coronary disease). The Cardiology department where the patient has been hospitalized is responsible for the patient inclusion in the study. Excluded patients are those in whom the preferred treatment is Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), age under 18 years or life expectancy of less than 12 months.</detailed_description>
