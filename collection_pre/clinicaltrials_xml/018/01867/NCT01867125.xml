	<brief_summary>This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in participants with asthma whose disease remains uncontrolled despite daily treatment with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy and at least one second controller medication. Participants will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive double-blind treatment with either lebrikizumab ("high" or "low") or placebo, administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, in addition to their standard-of-care therapy. This will be followed by a 52-week double-blind active treatment extension. During double-blind active treatment extension period, all participants will receive SC injection of lebrikizumab from Week 53 to Week 104. The anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks. After study treatment, all participants will complete a 20-week safety follow-up.</brief_summary>
