	<brief_title>An Effectiveness and Safety Study of Inhaled JNJ 49095397 (RV568) in Patients With Moderate to Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study), multicenter, parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time) study. Approximately 200 participants will be randomly assigned to JNJ 49095397 or placebo in the ratio 1:1. The study consists of 3 phases: screening (3 weeks), double-blind treatment (12 weeks), and follow up (4 weeks). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 19 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men and women of nonchildbearing potential, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2 or 3), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) greater than or equal to 40 less than 80 percent predicted, FEV1/ forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio less than 0.7 Clinical history of chronic bronchitis. Either two chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations in past two years or ability to produce a spontaneous sputum sample, treated with longacting beta2 agonist (LABA)/ longacting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), with or without inhaled corticosteroids for at least 12 weeks prior to study entry Smoker or exsmoker with at least a 10 packyear history No COPD exacerbation that requires change in COPD maintenance medications during the screening period Not experienced a significant worsening of COPD based on clinical symptoms and by investigations during screening period Has another pulmonary disease (eg, asthma) or an active infection (eg, tuberculosis) Has experienced lifethreatening COPD (eg, requiring intensive care unit [ICU] admission, intubation, or longterm noninvasive ventilation). Shortterm (less than five days), noninvasive ventilation during a hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD is permitted, provided that noninvasive ventilation was not continued at home Has right heart failure or oxygen saturation less than 90 percent at rest on room air at screening or requires oxygen therapy on a daily basis for chronic hypoxemia (deficiency of oxygen in blood) History of significant disease or medical illness within 12 months prior to screening Positive serology to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1 or HIV2, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus at screening</criteria>
