	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center trial involving the University of Minnesota, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Roswell Park Cancer. Cigarette smokers who are eligible will enter a Camel Snus sampling phase. Smokers interested in continuing with the study after the sampling phase will undergo a 2 week baseline assessment phase and will then be randomized to one of the five experimental conditions for 8 weeks. Tobacco use patterns, subjective responses to product, and nicotine and toxicant exposure will be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline smoking period: Subjects will be required to attend 2 baseline clinic visits where baseline assessments will be captured including a record of their cigarette or other tobacco intake on a daily basis using an interactive voice response system (IVR). Experimental Period: After the baseline assessment, subjects will be randomized to one of five experimental conditions: 1) smoking usual brand cigarette controls, who after 8-weeks will be offered Camel Snus to use as they will for 8 more weeks; 2) complete substitution (i.e., no smoking) and ad libitum use of snus; 3) complete substitution (i.e., no smoking) and specific instructions for snus; 4) partial substitution with ad libitum use of both snus and cigarettes; and 5) partial substitution with controlled use of snus and ad libitum smoking. Snus, but not cigarettes, will be provided to subjects at the clinic visits. Subjects will attend clinic visits over the next 8 weeks where tobacco use patterns and biomarker data will be collected.</detailed_description>
