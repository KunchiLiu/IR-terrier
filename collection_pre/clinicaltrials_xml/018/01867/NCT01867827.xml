	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to train patients with Parkinson's Disease to increase activity in a brain area that is involved in the control of motor functions with the use of a technique called real-time fMRI neurofeedback (NF) along with regular physical exercise. This will be a randomised and controlled clinical trial to evaluate the benefits of a novel treatment. The investigators expect NF training along with physical exercise practise to better improve motor functions compared to physical exercise alone.</brief_summary>
