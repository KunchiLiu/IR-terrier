	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to test a non-medicinal technique for chronic constipation. The core of the technique is to have subjects repeatedly press on and massage their perineum before defecation to fragment and soften the stool before it passes the lower rectum and anus. The technique will be evaluated as a complementary treatment to standard treatment of constipation (patient educational materials about treatments such as stool softeners, laxatives fiber supplements, and increased exercise). Although this technique has been studied for other conditions (for example in pregnant women to prevent birthing-related injuries), and it is recommended anecdotally by some physicians, this would be the first time it will be studied for chronic constipation in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. $50 dollars in compensation is provided for about an hour of participant's time.</brief_summary>
