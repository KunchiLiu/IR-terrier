	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II study of Vigil™ autologous tumor cell vaccine integrated with carboplatinum. All patients will have Vigil™ prepared and stored from ovarian tumor cells obtained at the time of primary surgical debulking. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive either carboplatinum alone (AUC 6/30 minute infusion) or carboplatinum (AUC 5/30 minute infusion) and taxol (175 mg/m2/3 hour infusion) one day prior to Vigil™ 1.0 x 10e7 cells/intradermal injection, once every 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
