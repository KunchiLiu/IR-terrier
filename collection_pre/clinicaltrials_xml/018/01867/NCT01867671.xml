	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study comparing peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) to placebo in the induction of tolerance and desensitization in peanut-allergic children. Eligible participants with peanut allergy will be randomly assigned to receive either peanut OIT or placebo for 134 weeks followed by peanut avoidance for 26 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An initial oral food challenge (OFC) to 1 g of peanut flour (500 mg peanut protein) will be conducted. Participants must have a clinical reaction during this OFC to initiate study dosing. After the initial OFC, the study design includes four phases: - Initial dose escalation (1 day): Peanut or placebo dosing will be given incrementally and increase every 20 minutes until a dose of 12 mg peanut flour (6 mg peanut protein) or placebo flour is given. - Build-up (30 weeks): Initial observed dose administration of highest tolerated dose, followed by daily OIT at home with return visit every 2 weeks for dose escalation. - Maintenance (104 weeks):The participant will continue on daily OIT with return visits every 13 weeks. At the end of this phase the participant will undergo a blinded OFC to 10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein). - Avoidance (26 weeks): In this final phase participants will be seen every 13 weeks. At the completion of this phase participants will have a final blinded OFC to 10g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein).</detailed_description>

History of severe anaphylaxis with hypotension to peanut; Documented clinical history of allergy to oat; Suspected allergy to oat and a wheal ≥7mm on skin prick test to oat extract compared to a negative control; Chronic disease other than asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinitis requiring therapy; e.g., heart disease or diabetes; Active eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease in the past 2 years; Participation in any interventional study for the treatment of food allergy in the 6 months prior to visit 1; Inhalant allergen immunotherapy that has not yet reached maintenance dosing; Severe asthma, as indicated by repeated hospitalizations or hospital emergency department visits; Moderate asthma defined according to National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert; Panel that requires more than fluticasone 440 mcg or its equivalent daily for adequate control; Inability to discontinue antihistamines for skin testing, OFC and the initial dose escalation; Use of omalizumab or other nontraditional forms of allergen immunotherapy (e.g., oral or sublingual) in the 12 months prior to visit 1; Any systemic therapy which in the judgment of the investigator could be immunomodulatory (e.g. rituximab) in the 12 months prior to visit 1, systemic corticosteroid therapy of up to a total of three weeks is allowed; Use of any investigational drug in 90 days prior to visit 1; Plan to use any investigational drug during the study period; The presence of any medical condition that the investigator deems incompatible with participation in the trial.</criteria>
