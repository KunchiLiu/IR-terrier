	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic operative procedures have revolutionized gynecological surgery. These have several advantages: a smaller and more cosmetic incision, reduced blood loss and shorter postoperative stay, which cuts down on hospital costs. However, postoperative pain continues to be one complication, which results in an unpleasant experience for the patient and at times causes a delayed discharge. Trigger point injection removes the pain developing point and block the pain signal. EMLA cream shows analgesic effect when being spread on the skin. An literature showed that patch of local anesthetics showed the effect of trigger point inject. The purpose of this study is to investigate the alleviation of shoulder pain, headache, abdominal pain, and back pain after trigger point injection or EMLA cream applying on shoulder in patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy.</brief_summary>
