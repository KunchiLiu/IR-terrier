	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether M2 macrophages are safe and feasible in the treatment of non-acute stroke patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of Autologous M2 Macrophage in Treatment of Non-Acute Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our primary hypothesis is that autologous M2 macrophage transplantation via intrathecal introduction is feasible and safe after non-acute stroke. Our secondary hypothesis is that autologous M2 macrophage transplantation is associated with improved neurological outcome after non-acute stroke</detailed_description>
