	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn if using statin in patients with nephrotic syndrome could lower the risk of blood clots. Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms that occur when the glomeruli -the tiny filters that work in the kidney- leak protein in the urine. One of the symptoms associated with nephrotic syndrome is hyperlipidemia: too much bad cholesterol (LDL). This bad cholesterol could be linked to the increased risk of blood clots in patients with nephrotic syndrome. The study doctors would like to see if taking a statin drug to reduce the amount of bad cholesterol could reduce the risk of blood clots.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lipid Lowering Agents to Limit Lipid Oxidation and Activation of Clotting System in Nephrotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events are common in the nephrotic syndrome (NS) occurring in up to 30% of patients when systematically screened. The investigator proposes to explore a novel mechanism for the increased clot formation in NS. To date, the only consistently identified underlying risk factor for VTEs is severe hypoalbuminemia related to the NS. The underlying pathophysiology related to VTE in NS remains poorly understood and has previously been ascribed to dysregulation of pro- and anticoagulant clotting factors due to urinary protein losses and reflected by the low serum albumin. However, the direct evidence for this mechanism is inconsistent and relatively poor. Another feature of NS is that of severe hyperlipidemia which also correlates with hypoalbuminemia. In other severely hyperlipidemic states (e.g. Familial Hypercholesterolemia), the level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is markedly elevated. Forms of oxidized LDL interact with monocytes and macrophages leading to expression of Tissue Factor (TF), a procoagulant molecule. Furthermore, monocytes and macrophages activated in this fashion also release microparticles, small cell-membrane derived vesicles, that also express TF and participate in initiating intravascular clot formation. the investigator hypothesizes that the hyperlipidemia of the nephrotic syndrome leads to elevations in oxidized LDL and in turn, elevations in microparticle Tissue Factor (MP-TF) and its activity. The investigator also hypothesizes that serum albumin levels will inversely correlate with hyperlipidemia as well as oxLDL levels and MP-TF activity. Here, the investigator will study the effect of treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on ox LDL and MP-TF activity patients with NS.</detailed_description>
