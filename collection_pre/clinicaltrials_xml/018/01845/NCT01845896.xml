	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a combined training programme and a high intensity interval training programme on insulin resistance, muscle strength/ muscle contractile properties, aerobic capacity and body composition in MS patients. It is assumed that the the above mentioned clinical parameters will improve due to physical exercise.</brief_summary>
