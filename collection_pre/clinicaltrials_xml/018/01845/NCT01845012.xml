	<brief_summary>HDQ 200 is an interventional multicenter study. This is a before-and-after design in which the patient is his own control. The main objective of the study is to determine the percentage of success of a procedure of daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow. All patients treated with conventional hemodialysis, for at least 3 months and clinically stable, can be included in the study. Their 3 months data prior to inclusion is collected retrospectively. These 3 months of conventional hemodialysis are the reference period. Patients are then treated with daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow for 3 months. During this 3 months period, the same data as during the period of conventional hemodialysis are collected prospectively.</brief_summary>
