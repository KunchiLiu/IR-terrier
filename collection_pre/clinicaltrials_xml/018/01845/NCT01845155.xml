	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is a nonspecific symptom of hearing disorder characterized by the sensation of buzzing, ringing, clicking, pulsations, and other noises in the ear. Despite a variety of treatments, many patients with chronic tinnitus ask for more active ways in coping with their tinnitus. Gold standard treatment in chronic tinnitus is a comprehensive directive counseling explaining the underlying mechanisms leading to the tinnitus percept. Therefore a neuro-music therapeutic treatment based on a bio-psycho-social framework was developed and compared to a counselling-only control group. INTERVENTION: two standardized protocols for tinnitus therapy were defined ("neuro-music therapy" vs. "counselling")</brief_summary>
