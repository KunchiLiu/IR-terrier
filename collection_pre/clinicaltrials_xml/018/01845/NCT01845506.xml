	<brief_summary>The primary outcome for this project will be the development of a small, non-invasive wireless sensor that is linked to a conventional computer that can be used in health care for monitoring of acute and chronic health problems. The advantages of developing this technology are threefold. First, monitoring can be conducted for a fraction of the cost of a bedside nurse. Second, monitoring can be done in real time and stored so that we can diagnose and manage critical events in a more timely manner. Lastly, many patients can be monitored simultaneously. The wireless sensors will be fitted to healthy volunteers of various ages. The data gathered from the sensor with respect to their vital signs will be compared to that of conventional tools such as nursing assessments and pulse oximetry.</brief_summary>
