	<brief_summary>Patients are being asked to take place in this research study because they have advanced prostate cancer that has gotten worse after other treatments. If they join this study they will receive a new combination of drugs that are used to treat prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone in Combination With Cabazitaxel in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abiraterone acetate and cabazitaxel have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body such as the lymph nodes or bone. These drugs are approved individually for use when the cancer has become resistant to other treatments, including chemotherapy with docetaxel. The combination of these two drugs has not been evaluated, so the research team will study the safety and effectiveness of the combination.</detailed_description>
