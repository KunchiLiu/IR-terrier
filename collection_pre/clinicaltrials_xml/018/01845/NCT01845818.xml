	<brief_summary>This observational study will document to what extend in daily clinical practice the work productivity is affected before and after the start of adalimumab treatment. Changes in the employment status and work productivity of patients with AS and PsA before and after the start of Adalimumab will be noted. The relationship between employment status, work productivity, disease activity and clinical evaluations will be evaluated. Since AS and PsA might be very invalidating diseases with a strong impact on the daily life of the patient, an evaluation will be performed to the effect of the disease on Quality of Life and work productivity.</brief_summary>
