	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of Intravitreally administered 0.3mg ranibizumab in subjects with persistent Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) after recent and frequent bevacizumab (at least 2 bevacizumab intravitreal injections within 2 months prior to enrollment and at least 6 bevacizumab injections within 9 months of enrollment).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ranibizumab For Persistent Diabetic Macular Edema After Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 eyes will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio (Group A= 10 patients; Group B= 20 patients) Group A: ("monthly group")- Consented patient with enrolled eye will receive 12 monthly required injections of 0.3mg ranibizumab over 1 year OR Group B: ("As needed (PRN) Group")- Consented patient with enrolled eye will receive 6 monthly required injections of 0.3mg ranibizumab for 6 months, followed by as needed (PRN) dosing (required ranibizumab if DME persistent on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Early Treatment Diabetic Retina Study (ETDRS) Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) &lt;20/20) for 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the full duration of the study. &gt;=18 years Type I/II diabetes mellitus Centralinvolved DME in study eye (OCT CSF &gt;=275um on Heidelberg Spectralis spectral domain OCT with evidence of intraretinal or subretinal fluid or cysts) Definite retinal thickening due to diabetic macular edema involving the center of the macula. Media clarity, pupillary dilation and individual cooperation for adequate fungus photography and fluorescein angiography. Visual Acuity score in study eye &lt;=80 and &gt;=20 (approximate Snellen equivalent 20/25 to 20/400). History of at least 6 intravitreal bevacizumab injections within the past 9 months and 2 intravitreal bevacizumab injections within the past 2 months. No history of an antiVEGF treatment for DME in the past 3 weeks. No other DME treatment for DME, other than bevacizumab, in the study eye at any time in the past 3 months. No history of major ocular surgery in the study eye within prior 3 months or anticipated within the next six months following randomization. Pregnancy or lactation Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated Participation in another medical investigation or trial within 30 days of randomization Known allergy to ranibizumab Acute cardiovascular event requiring hospitalization within the past 3 months Systemic antiVEGF or proVEGF treatment within 3 months prior to randomization or anticipated use during the study Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than DME An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual acuity loss would not improve from the resolution of macular edema History of intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (antiVEGF) agent other than bevacizumab within 9 months prior to randomization History of panretinal photocoagulation within 3 months prior to randomization or anticipated need for panretinal photocoagulation in the 6 months following randomization Yag capsulotomy performed within 1 month prior to randomization External ocular infection including conjunctivitis, significant blepharitis, etc.</criteria>
