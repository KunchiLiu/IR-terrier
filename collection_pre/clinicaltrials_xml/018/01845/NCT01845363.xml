	<brief_summary>Eighteen patients were given a dose of 2g Cefazolin in anesthetic induction, supplemented with 1g delivered through continuous infusion during surgery. Adipose samples, obtained at the beginning and end of surgery, were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. Some published studies suggest that the dose of 2g does not supply the minimum inhibitory concentration for principal causal agents of surgical site infection. To determine the concentration of Cefazolin in adipose tissue of patients undergoing bariatric surgery and to evaluate the relationship between concentrations obtained and body mass index (BMI).</brief_summary>
