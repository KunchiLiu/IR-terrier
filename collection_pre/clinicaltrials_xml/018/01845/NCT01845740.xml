	<brief_title>Phase Ib Study of SC Milatuzumab in SLE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Milatuzumab or placebo will be given subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks to determine if milatuzumab helps to control lupus (SLE). The treatment portion of the study lasts 4 weeks. Then patients are followed for disease activity for at least 12 weeks. If patients respond to the study drug, they may be eligible for one course of retreatment, again followed by 12 weeks of follow-up. Patients who showed a response will continue to be followed at timepoints up to one year after treatment to assess how long the response lasts.</detailed_description>
