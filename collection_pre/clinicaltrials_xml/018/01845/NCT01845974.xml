	<brief_summary>This study is examining data elements of hemodynamic, electrophysiologic and electrolyte trends comparing 2 different types of catheters used during a procedure to treat medication resistant atrial fibrillation- an irregular heart beat- called radiofrequency catheter ablation. A high flow catheter delivers a higher volume of saline during the procedure. The low flow catheter delivers a lower volume of saline during the procedure. The patient will be consented and randomized to one of the 2 groups using a computer generated randomization chart. Those that are put in the low flow catheter group will be considered the experimental group. All data will be collected before and after the procedure and each patient will act as their own control within each group. The hypothesis is that using a lower flow catheter will cause less hemodynamic, electrolyte, and electrophysiologic derangements resulting in better patient outcomes and fewer complications</brief_summary>
