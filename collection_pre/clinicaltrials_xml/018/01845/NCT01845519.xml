	<brief_summary>This study aims to recruit post-treatment breast cancer survivors for a 12-week 2-arm randomized walking intervention. All intervention materials will be delivered electronically. The investigators hypothesize that at the end of 12-weeks, participants randomized to the intervention group will engage in more weekly steps than those participants randomized to the comparison group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Step by Step: A Tailored Walking Intervention for Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More than two-thirds of breast cancer survivors are physically inactive. Inactivity is known to negatively impact both morbidity and mortality, and is especially pronounced among cancer survivors. Self-directed interventions targeting inactivity among breast cancer survivors often report clinically insignificant behavior change. More successful behavior change interventions have suggested that tailoring and, more recently, the fostering of intrinsic motivation, may have improved outcomes. However, no interventions to date have utilized these approaches to increase physical activity among sedentary cancer survivors. AIM 1: Develop and test intervention (tailored) and comparison group (targeted) messages in a sample of sedentary women to determine message acceptability. AIM 2: Determine the efficacy of a 12-week tailored intervention to increase the number of weekly steps taken among sedentary post-treatment breast cancer survivors compared to a 12-week, targeted intervention.</detailed_description>
