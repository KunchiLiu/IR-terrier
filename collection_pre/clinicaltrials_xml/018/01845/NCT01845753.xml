	<brief_summary>A clinically applicably strategy for molecular screening for Lynch Syndrome is being implemented in Denmark. Based on sequential analysis with immunohistochemistry and methylation analysis, patients with possible hereditary colorectal cancer are identified. These patients are offered genetic risk assessment and counselling. The study hypothesis is that molecular screening will identify more patients with Lynch Syndrome than the family history alone. Prospective data collection is performed using established clinical databases.</brief_summary>
