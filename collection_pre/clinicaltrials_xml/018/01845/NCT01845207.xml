	<brief_summary>Frailty is a state of decreased physiologic reserves and vulnerability to stressors. Several tools exist to measure frailty, some based on physical tests and others on questionnaires, yet there is no agreement on which tool to recommend. This multi-center prospective cohort study is aimed at comparing various frailty assessment tools to determine which best predicts death or major complications after cardiac surgery or transcatheter intervention. The population of interest is elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The frailty assessment tools under investigation include composite frailty scales, physical performance tests, muscle mass, and biomarker expression. The overall objective is to improve our ability to predict risk by measuring frailty using the optimal tool in elderly cardiovascular patients.</brief_summary>
