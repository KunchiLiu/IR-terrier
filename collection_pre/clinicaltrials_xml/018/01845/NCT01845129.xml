	<brief_summary>The present study assesses whether language functions in patients with residual post-stroke aphasia can be improved by transcranial direct current stimulation administered to the primary motor cortex in the language dominant (left) hemisphere.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Motor Cortex on Language Functions in Residual Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will participate in two tDCS sessions (atDCS; sham) in a cross-over within subjects design. tDCS or placebo will be administered during simulatneous fMRI to assess neural signatures of the stimulation. Order of stimulation will be counterbalanced between subjects</detailed_description>
