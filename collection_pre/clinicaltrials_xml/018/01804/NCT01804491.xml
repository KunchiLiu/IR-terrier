	<brief_summary>The aim was to investigate with a multi-segmental foot model the kinetic and kinematic in patients with a hallux rigidus, before and after different type of surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motion Analysis in Patients With Hallux Rigidus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>None of the patients received surgery BECAUSE of the study. We have only performed motion analysis in patients, who were already scheduled for one of the described type of surgery (prospective group) or who already previously received one the type of surgery (retrospective group).</detailed_description>
