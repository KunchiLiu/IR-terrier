	<brief_summary>Presently no generally effective treatments for tardive dyskinesia (TD) are available. D-serine is a naturally occurring amino acid that acts in-vivo as positive allosteric modulator at the glycine site associated with the glutamatergic NMDA receptor. Previous studies have suggested that D-serine may improve motor symptoms, including dyskinesias, which are caused by treatment with presently used antipsychotics drugs. The hypothesis under investigation in the present study is that D-serine adjuvant treatment may improve TD in schizophrenia patients diagnosed with this disorder.</brief_summary>
