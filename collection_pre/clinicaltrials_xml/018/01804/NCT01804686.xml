	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety and efficacy data for participants treated with PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) and to provide ongoing access to PCI-32765 for participants who are currently enrolled in PCI-32765 studies that have been completed according to the parent protocol, are actively receiving treatment with PCI-32765, and who continue to benefit from PCI-32765 treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Long-term Extension Study of PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study designed to collect long-term safety and efficacy data and provide PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) access to participants in completed PCI-32765 studies. PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) is a first-in-class, potent, orally-administered, covalently-binding small molecule inhibitor of bruton's tyrosine kinase. "PCI-32765" and "ibrutinib" refer to the same molecule; hereafter, "PCI-32765"will be used. Participants will continue with the current PCI-32765 dosing regimen established in the parent PCI-32765 study until the investigator determines that the participant is no longer benefitting from treatment (ie, disease progression or unacceptable toxicity has occurred), the study is terminated by the sponsor, the participant withdraws consent, alternative access to PCI-32765 is available and feasible, or for other reasons as defined in the protocol. Safety will be monitored throughout the study and summarized. Efficacy may be analyzed in combination with the data collected in the parent protocol. Blood samples and a lymph node biopsy sample for biomarker evaluations will be collected at the time of disease progression or at the End of Treatment visit for participants who discontinue treatment without disease progression (where local regulations and shipping logistics permit). There is no formal hypothesis testing planned for this long-term extension study. Participants can receive treatment with single-agent PCI-32765 and continue until end of study, which is defined as the time of the last End-of-Treatment safety assessment for the last subject participating in the study or 5 years after the last subject entered, or upon a decision by the sponsor to terminate the study, whichever occurs earlier.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must be currently participating in a PCI32765 clinical study considered completed and have received at least 6 months of treatment with PCI32765. At study entry, participants must be actively receiving treatment with singleagent PCI32765 or participants must have participated in a PCI32765 randomized clinical study in which they initially received comparator treatment and now crossover to ibrutinib. Note: A minimum of 6 months requirement for prior PCI32765 treatment will not be mandatory in this case and participants with less than 6 months will be required to have more frequent initial safety assessments Agrees to protocoldefined use of effective contraception Negative blood or urine pregnancy test at screening Requires anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists Requires treatment with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4/5 inhibitors, unless previously approved by sponsor Any condition or situation which, in the opinion of the investigator, may put the participant at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with volunteer's participation in the study</criteria>
