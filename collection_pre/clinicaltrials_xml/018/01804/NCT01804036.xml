	<brief_title>Two Contrasting Interventions for Sleep Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance in active duty military personnel is highly prevalent and contributes to reduced performance of military duties. Under extreme conditions, army personnel could endanger themselves and their comrades. Increasingly, non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia are showing promise as complementary and alternative medicine treatments. Many of these awareness training programs (ATPs) perform as well as, or even better than, medications. This study will determine whether Mind-Body Bridging (MBB), an ATP that teaches awareness/mindfulness and cognitive skills, is more effective than a common sleep medication, Zolpidem. The study will also determine whether MBB exhibits additional benefits in co-morbid mental health conditions, including, stress, PTSD, depression, etc, compared with that of Zolpidem. This will offer soldiers additional treatment options for insomnia in the hope that it will improve both sleep and other common comorbidities.</detailed_description>
