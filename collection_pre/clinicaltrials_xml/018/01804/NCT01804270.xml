	<brief_summary>This research proposal aims to better understand the neurobiology of depression in adolescents and how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may therapeutically impact brain function and mood. This study will be the first to use a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled approach to the investigation of rTMS therapy for depressed adolescents. This approach will allow for the validation of rTMS treatment outcomes in the depressed adolescent population in a scientifically rigorous manner. The magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy pattern of rTMS response will be analyzed according to previously established protocols.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS for Depressed Teens: A Sham-Controlled Trial, Part 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 of the study aims to: - Evaluate the antidepressant effects of daily, active rTMS (when compared with sham treatment) in adolescents meeting criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, single or recurrent episode. - Evaluate, by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at 3 Tesla(3T), neurometabolic biomarkers at the beginning and end of each study phase. - Define regional specificity [anterior cingulate (AC) and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC)] of cerebral metabolites(i.e. glutamate and glutamine) in adolescent depression. - Study whether specific neurochemical resonances are associated with response, remission, and/or maintenance of improvement of clinical depressive symptoms when rTMS is used to treat adolescent depression.</detailed_description>
