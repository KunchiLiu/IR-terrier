	<criteria>Up to two documented common or external iliac artery lesions (one on each side), with &gt;50% diameter stenosis, suitable for stenting iliac artery reference vessel diameter of 510 mm Rutherford Category 1, 2, 3, or 4. Less than 18 years of age lesion site &lt;10 or &gt;100 mm in length external iliac artery lesion visually estimated to be 100% occluded presence of infrarenal aortic aneurysm &gt;4 cm (treated or untreated) presence of any aneurysm (treated or untreated) within target vessel significant stenosis (&gt;50%) or occlusion of inflow tract (infrarenal aortic lesions) not successfully treated before this procedure (success is measured as &lt; 30% residual stenosis) absence of at least one patent runoff vessel with ≤ 50% stenosis throughout its course (i.e., confirmed inline patency to the level of the foot) angiographically evident thrombus within the target vessel (treated or untreated) lesion is in an iliac artery that has been previously stented</criteria>
