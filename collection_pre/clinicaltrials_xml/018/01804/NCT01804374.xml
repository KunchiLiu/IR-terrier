	<brief_summary>This is a trial for patients affected by metastatic or relapsed osteosarcoma which progressed after first or further line treatments. In this trial, all patients will be treated until progression or unacceptable toxicity with sorafenib and everolimus. The treatment with sorafenib and everolimus aimed to obtain a 50% rate of patients free from further progression of the disease after 6 months from study entry.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Open Label, Non-randomized Study of Sorafenib and Everolimus in Relapsed and Non-resectable Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients affected by metastatic or relapsed osteosarcoma which progressed after first or further line treatments still have a poor outcome. Standard chemotherapy has limited activity in these patients. In a previous study in patient affected by relapsed unresectable osteosarcoma, sorafenib alone demonstrated promising activity. In the preclinical setting, everolimus was able to improve the activity of sorafenib. Sorafenib and everolimus, by hitting crucial pathways which are essential for osteosarcoma cell proliferation and survival, with an entirely different approach aimed to overcome the resistance to standard chemotherapy showed by relapsed osteosarcoma. In this trial, all patients will be treated with sorafenib and everolimus at the dosage of 800 mg and 5 mg per day, respectively. Both drugs have to be taken orally. The treatment will be continued until progression or unacceptable toxicities. The objective of the present trial is to obtain a 50% rate of patients alive and free from progression of their disease 6 months after trial enrolment. The disease will be evaluated every 2 months with a CT scan.</detailed_description>
