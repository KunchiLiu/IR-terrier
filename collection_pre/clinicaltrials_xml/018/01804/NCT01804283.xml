	<brief_summary>1. Cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest could regulate expression of microRNAs in patients undergoing double valve replacement (aortic and mitral). 2. The modulation of myocardial microRNAs by cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest may be rescued by ischemic postconditioning. 3. Downstream effectors would also be affected.</brief_summary>
