	<brief_summary>There are two parts to this study: (1) an information gathering phase leading to the development of new educational materials; and (2) a study to test the newly developed material. The information gathering phase has been completed. The purpose of this part of the research study is to test the usefulness and acceptability of new educational materials investigators have developed. Investigators will compare the new educational material to another widely available educational brochure. The goal is to see if the new educational material will change knowledge and behaviors about colorectal cancer and colorectal screening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colorectal Cancer Awareness, Research, Education and Screening (CARES)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Colorectal Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Raciallyethnically diverse adult men and women Average risk individuals who have no personal diagnosis, or presumptive symptoms of colorectal cancer (CRC), or are not at high risk Selfreport as not current on screening Provide at least two forms of contact information and contact information of a relative (not living with respondent) to facilitate followup contacts Are able to speak, read and write English because the instruments and CARES intervention are available only in English at this time. We recognize that interventions are needed for nonEnglish speaking populations, therefore, once we find promise in the English language CARES intervention materials, we will move forward with conducting other studies that involve translation of measures and cultural adaptation of the CARES intervention materials into Spanish or Haitian Creole. Individuals who have participated in a CRCS research study in the past 1 year will not be eligible for this study. Recent screening criteria relates to not having had IFOBT within the previous year, flex sig within the previous 5 years, a doublecontrast barium enema (DCBE) xray with the previous 5 years, or a colonoscopy within the previous 10 years. Within the recruitment and intervention frame, high risk individuals (due to strong family history, ulcerative colitis, polyposis syndromes) are excluded because they may be eligible for CRC screening before age 50, and the preferred screening option is certainly colonoscopy which is beyond the primary focus of the current study.</criteria>
