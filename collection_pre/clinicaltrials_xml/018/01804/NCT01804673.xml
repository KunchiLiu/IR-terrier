	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal (through the skin) system (fentanyl-ITS) in daily clinical practice for management of acute (a quick and severe form of illness in its early stage) moderate to severe post-operative pain (pain after surgery) including the comprehensibility and usefulness of the accompanying information material.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Fentanyl Iontophoretic Transdermal System (Fentanyl-ITS) in the Management of Post-Surgery Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm, and multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study to evaluate safety and efficacy of the fentanyl-ITS for management of acute moderate to severe pain in post-operative participants' who have undergone elective surgery (surgery which could be postponed or not done at all without danger to the participant). The study will consists of 2 phases: screening phase (which comprises of pre-operative and post-operative stages) and an open label treatment phase. The participants will be treated with 40 microgram (mcg) of fentanyl transdermally per on-demand dose; each delivered over 10 minutes for a maximum of 6 doses (240 mcg) per hour for 24 hours and a maximum of 80 doses (3.2 milligram [mg]). Each system will inactivate at 80 doses or 24 hour, whichever occurs first. A new system will be applied every 24 hours unless the participant has used 80 doses in less than 24 hours. Maximum treatment duration of 72 hours is allowed. Participants will be expected to require parenteral (administration by injection) opioids (morphine like medications) for at least 24 hours post-operatively. This study will evaluate participant's, nurse's and physician's assessment of fentanyl-ITS under routine conditions. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
