	<brief_summary>This study is designed to collect tissue samples from the biopsy specimen that was used to diagnose HSTCL and, if possible, to obtain a single blood sample, a buccal swab sample and a bowel tissue sample. Samples obtained will be stored by the sponsor for future testing. In addition, demographic and clinical patient information will be collected. The study will be conducted in North America. The study population will include IBD patients in North America with HSTCL who are identified through the sponsor's adverse event reporting systems. Cases of HSTCL will be identified through postmarketing adverse event reporting (eg, spontaneous reports, reports from late phase clinical trials, reports from patient registries) or from the sponsor's new or ongoing clinical trials. Eligible for enrollment are male or female patients of any age who have a confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL. There is no study-related therapeutic intervention and this protocol will not restrict or introduce any therapeutic interventions, including medications. All patients will continue to be managed by their personal physicians. No healthy subjects will be enrolled in this study.</brief_summary>
