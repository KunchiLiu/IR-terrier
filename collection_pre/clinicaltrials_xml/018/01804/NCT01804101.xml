	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 in treating patients with untreated myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Cytarabine-Daunorubicin CPX-351 in Treating Patients With Untreated Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate whether the 32 units/m^2 or the 64 units/m^2 or both dose levels of CPX-351 (liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351) are likely to improve treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate while keeping the complete remission (CR) rate constant in patients with untreated high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at high risk of TRM. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Describe the CR/CR with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp) rate after up to 4 cycles of induction/re-induction therapy. II. Describe the event-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients who achieve CR/CRp. III. Estimate the frequency and severity of regimen-associated toxicities. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: INDUCTION/RE-INDUCTION: Patients receive lower-dose liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 40 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving CR or CRp continue on to consolidation. CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive lower-dose liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 40 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: (closed to accrual effective 4/21/14) INDUCTION/RE-INDUCTION: Patients receive higher-dose liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 40 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving CR or CRp continue on to consolidation. CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive higher-dose liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 40 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.</detailed_description>
