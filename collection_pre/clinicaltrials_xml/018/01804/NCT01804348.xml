	<brief_summary>Clinical diagnosis of amniotic fluid leak will be determined, according the hospital standard procedure, using pooling test and/or sterile speculum examination and /or pH test, and AmniSure, N-Dia, Inc. (immunoassay for diagnosis of ruptured fetal membranes (ROM)). Amniotic fluid leak test, using the AL- SENSE 1-Step device, will be considered positive in case of presence of a blue or green or grey stain on a yellow background of the AL-SENSE 1-Step, as observed by the patient and the clinician (positive/negative).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AL-SENSE 1-Step - Determination of Product Specificity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnant women arriving at the hospital and reporting unidentified wetness (undetermined whether they sense amniotic fluid leakage or urinary incontinence) will receive a single AL-SENSE 1-Step to use up to 12 hours or until they notice any wetness. The clinician will explain the proper use and handling of the AL-SENSE 1-Step and how to read the result. In each case, the subject and the clinician/midwife (non bias to the hospital standard procedure results) will be required to read and record any occurrence of color change of the AL-SENSE 1-Step immediately after removing the test to mark if it changes color to blue or to green or to grey on the designated form. The non bias physician, who is not aware to the AL-SENSE 1-Step result (other than the clinician/midwife who records the AL-SENSE 1-Step results) will perform a diagnosis tests for amniotic fluid leak detection, according to the hospital standard procedure. The investigator will compare the AL-SENSE 1-Step results reading of the patient to the clinical diagnosis.</detailed_description>
