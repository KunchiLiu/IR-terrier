	<brief_summary>This study intends to explore evolution of MSRV expression by analyzing the levels of MSRV transcripts in blood, as well as the levels of the MSRV-Env protein in serum of MS patients. The study will be conducted over one year in four cohorts of patients with different forms of MS (remitting-relapsing MS i.e. RRMS, primary-progressive MS i.e. PPMS and secondary-progressive MS i.e. SPMS) and in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients who have suffered a single clinical event but do not comply with diagnosis criteria for definite MS. The MSRV RNA and MSRV-Env protein levels will be correlated with the clinical evolution of patients and with the reverse transcriptase activity, inflammatory markers assessed by cytokines levels. A control group of healthy subjects will be included (the study, GN-E-003, is performed in parallel and is part of another dedicated protocol).</brief_summary>
