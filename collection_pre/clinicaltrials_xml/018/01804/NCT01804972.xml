	<brief_title>Efficacy of Patient Centred Information for Vascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hospitals and health care institutions attempt to provide information to patients through a variety of media including; written information, web-site based information and more recently through the use of smart phone based applications. Such educational campaigns have financial implications for hospitals and institutions. The level of knowledge among patients with vascular disease of their pathology and its associated risk factors has been shown to be poor (Lovell et al 2009, Hirsch et al 2007). The optimum tool with which to provide information to patients with vascular disease has not been determined to date.</detailed_description>
