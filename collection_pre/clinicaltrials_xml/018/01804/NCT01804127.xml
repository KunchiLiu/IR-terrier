	<brief_title>Interim PET/CT Guided Cycle Numbers of R-CHOP in DLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>R-CHOP is the standard regimen for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the standard number of cycles is uncertain. Recently, interim PET/CT was found to predict prognosis in DLBCL. The hypothesis of this study is to optimize the number of cycles based on the interim results of PET/CT in order to avoid treatment exposure.</detailed_description>
