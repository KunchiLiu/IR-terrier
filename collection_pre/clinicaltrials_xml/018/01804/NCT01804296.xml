	<brief_summary>This research proposal aims to better understand the neurobiology of depression in adolescents and how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may therapeutically impact brain function and mood. This investigation also proposes the first study to examine the efficacy of rTMS maintenance therapy in adolescents who have met clinical criteria following acute rTMS treatment. The magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy pattern of rTMS response will be analyzed according to previously established protocols.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS for Depressed Teens: A Sham-Controlled Trial, Part 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 2 of the study aims to: - Evaluate the benefit of daily, active, open-label rTMS in Part 1 non-responders. - Evaluate the benefits of bi-weekly, active, open-label maintenance rTMS treatment for Part 1 responders over the course of 12 months post acute treatment. - Evaluate, by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at 3 Tesla(3T), neurometabolic biomarkers at the beginning and end of each study phase. - Define regional specificity [anterior cingulate (AC) and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC)] of cerebral metabolites (i.e. glutamate and glutamine) in adolescent depression. - Study whether specific neurochemical resonances are associated with response, remission, and/or maintenance of improvement of clinical depressive symptoms when rTMS is used to treat adolescent depression.</detailed_description>
