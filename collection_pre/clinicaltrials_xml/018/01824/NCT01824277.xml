	<brief_summary>The Canadian Diabetes Association recommends optimizing glycemic control to achieve a glycated hemoglobin (A1C) of less than 7% in patients with diabetes. Despite these recommendations, approximately 25% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery have evidence of suboptimal glycemic control (A1C&gt;7%). Recent research has demonstrated that such patients experience a higher rate of post-operative complications and significantly worse short-term and long-term post-operative survival. Therefore, it is recommended that attempts should be made to improve glycemic control while patients wait for their elective surgery. However, at present processes of care that facilitate pre-operative glycemic control optimization do not exist in Canada. The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a comprehensive community-based pre-operative diabetes optimization program for patients awaiting elective cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized controlled trial and will investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a pre-operative diabetes optimization program for patients with suboptimal glycemic control awaiting elective cardiac surgery. Consenting patients will be randomized to a Standard Pre-Operative Diabetes Care Group (Group 1) and a Structured Pre-Operative Diabetes Optimization Group (Group 2).</detailed_description>
