	<brief_summary>Obesity is associated with reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover in skeletal muscle, a condition that can impair muscle metabolism. The proposed research will discover mechanisms responsible for decreased content in mitochondrial proteins as well as in protein β-F1-ATPase, which is directly responsible for ATP assembly, in the muscle of obese individuals. This research will further examine the effectiveness of interventions, such as increased plasma amino acid availability and exercise, to increase the rate of production of mitochondrial proteins as well as that of β-F1-ATPase in the muscle of obese individuals. The findings will help to develop appropriate interventions to improve muscle ATP turnover and metabolism in obese people.</brief_summary>
