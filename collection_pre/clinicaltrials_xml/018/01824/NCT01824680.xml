	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess the hormonal regulation of satiety by an intense exercise before and after a 3 month physical activity program. Hormones assessed are: leptin, grhélin, Cholecystokinin, Glucagon-Like-Peptid-1 (GLP-1), PYY. It is well known that in overweight adults and children also, an intense physical exercise diminish the food intake relatively to the total energy expenditure and this effect is persistent after a 6 weeks physical activity program. Our hypothesis are: a diminution of food intake after the intense physical exercise and a persistent diminution of food intake after the 3 month physical activity program, an augmentation of levels of GLP-1 and PYY during the intense exercise before and after the physical activity program, a diminution of the level of GLP-1 and leptin before and after the physical activity program</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There is two sequences, one before and one after the physical activity program. Each sequence contains one "rest" session and one "exercise" session. Each session contains : blood sample at regular interval (Leptin, Ghrélin, CCK, PYY, GLP-1), a sleeping assessment (Pittsburg scale), an assessment of hunger sensations at regular interval, an assessment of food intake in a "ad libitum" lunch and in the diner indirectly by the SU.VI.MAX. tool. During the " rest " session : Blood samples, assessment of hunger sensation, assessment of food intake are realized during the morning. Physical condition (VO2 max, DEXA, and muscular test), insulin-sensibility, lipid profile, are also assessed. During the "exercise" session: it is identical to the first session but an intense exercise of 40 minutes is realized at 70% of the patient's VO2 max. The peripherical blood output is measured by a non-invasive method: the Near-Infra-Red-Spectroscopy, during the exercise. The 3-months-physical activity program : there is 4 sessions of 30 minutes and 2 sessions of 1 hour per week. Most of exercises sessions are realized at home but one 1-hour session per week is controled with a sports educator.</detailed_description>
