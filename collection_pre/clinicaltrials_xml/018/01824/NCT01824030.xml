	<brief_summary>Whether to revascularize patients with angiographically-intermediate coronary lesions (AICL) is a major clinical issue. Intravascular techniques (assessing either the anatomy or the functional effect of coronary stenoses) are routinely used to better characterize coronary lesions. Among these,fractional flow reserve (FFR) provides validated functional insights while optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high resolution anatomic imaging. Both techniques may be applied to guide decisions regarding the opportunity to revascularize patients with AICL and to optimize the result of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We aim to compare the clinical and the economical impact of FFR versus OCT guidance in the percutaneous management of patients with AICL.</brief_summary>
