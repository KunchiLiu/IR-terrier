	<brief_summary>There has been much controversy surrounding the biologic behavior and prognosis of esophageal signet ring cell (SRCs) containing carcinomas. To clarify the biologic behavior of SRCs, the investigators compared the clinicopathologic features and prognosis of SRCs with other adenocarcinomas (ADC) of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is an aggressive neoplasm and has a poor prognosis. Surgical based treatment has been the treatment of choice for localized esophageal adenocarcinoma. Signet-ring cell carcinoma is a unique histologic subtype of adenocarcinoma characterized by abundant intracellular mucin accumulation and a compressed nucleus displaced toward one extremity of the cell (the so-called signet-ring cell (SRC)). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a true signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCca) is defined as an adenocarcinoma in which the predominant component (more than 50% of the tumor) consists of isolated or small groups of SRC in the stroma. If the tumor contains less than 50% of those cells, it is generally considered as an adenocarcinoma (ADC).</detailed_description>
