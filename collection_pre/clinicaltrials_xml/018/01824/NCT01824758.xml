	<brief_summary>90 American society of anesthesiology (ASA) physical status I and II patients undergoing general anesthesia for elective surgery will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized into three groups. Group E will receive esmolol (1 mg/kg), Group IL lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg)and Group C placebo(NaCl 0.9%, 5 mL), followed by a 0.05 mg/kg rocuronium. After intravenous induction with propofol, adequate muscle relaxation for intubation will be received by 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Esmolol on Pain Due to Rocuronium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be observed after injection of rocuronium 0.05mg/kg, then immediately asked if they have pain in the arm. The response are assessed; discomfort, pain, and withdrawal of the hand are recorded and graded using a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, or severe). After the intubating dose of rocuronium, withdrawal reactions are scored as follows: (a) no pain response, (b)pain limited to the wrist, (c) pain limited to the elbow/shoulder, or (d) generalized pain response.</detailed_description>
