	<brief_summary>The current proposal extends work done in mouse models evaluating the consistency of measuring RLIP76 in a clinical cohort (Aim 1) by using guidelines provided by the NIH for validating biomarkers. We will also proceed to estimate the effect size of a potential correlation of RLIP76 with standard MsY treatment measures such as hgbA1c, LDL, and triglyceride levels in a longitudinal prospective study ( Aim 2) that will follow a cohort of patients with MsY who seek care at the City of Hope Endocrine clinic over a 12 month period..</brief_summary>
