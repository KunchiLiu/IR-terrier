	<brief_summary>Difficult tracheal intubation is a cause of severe patient damage and death. There is not a good method to predict it. The McGrath Series 5 video laryngoscope can improve visualization of the glottic structures one to two grades. Moreover unlike a classical laryngoscope with a Macintosh blade, the McGrath provides a view of the glottis without requiring alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. In this study, the investigators will use it to compare the Cormack-Lehane score in sedation and anesthesia condition. It helps to know the role of videolaryngoscope in predicting difficult intubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Airway Evaluation by McGrath Videolaryngoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The enrolled patients were given a bolus of sufentanil 0.3-0.5Î¼g/kg to achieve Ramsay sedation score 2-3. The Cormack-Lehane score in sedation was evaluated by McGrath videolaryngoscope. - Then the patients were induced with propofol. A bolus of rocuronium was given to facilitate intubation. The Cormack-Lehane score in anesthesia was recorded when intubated by McGrath videolaryngoscope. - BMI, mouth opening, thyromental distance, intubation duration and ramsay sedation score were also recorded. - To compare the Cormack-Lehane score in sedate and anesthesia condition</detailed_description>
