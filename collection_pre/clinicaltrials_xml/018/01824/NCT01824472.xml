	<brief_summary>Nearly half of all patients with obstructive sleep apnea have insomnia symptoms, and in some, but not all cases, these insomnia symptoms are caused by the obstructive sleep apnea. The purpose of this study is to find out what type of insomnia symptoms are caused by obstructive sleep apnea and therefore most likely to respond to obstructive sleep apnea treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (also known as CPAP) and if additional treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is beneficial.</brief_summary>
