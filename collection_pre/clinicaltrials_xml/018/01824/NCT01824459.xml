	<brief_title>S-1+Oxaliplatin vs.S-1+Cisplatin First-line Treatment of Advanced or Recurrent Diffuse Gastric Adenocarcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint is Overall survival time (OS).Secondary is overall response rate (ORR), time to treatment failure (TTF),treatment to progression time (TTP)and the adverse reactions of the two groups (AE). Study design: This is a prospective randomized control study. Sample size: This is a non-inferior study. The planned sample size was 446 patients, allowing for a 5% dropout rate and assuming the 1-year median overall survival was 55% with a hazard ratio of 1.33, α=0.05, β=0.2. The planned enrolled time was 24 months and 3 years of follow up.</detailed_description>
