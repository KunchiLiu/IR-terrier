	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate proof of clinical concept that application of the Intrathoracic Pressure Regulator (ITPR) will result in an increase in Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) and a decrease in Intracranial Perfusion Pressure (ICP) in patients with head injury and elevated ICP, and to determine the optimal ventilation tidal volume (TV).</brief_summary>
