	<brief_summary>The Sponsor of this study, SANUWAVE, Inc., has developed an investigational device known as the dermaPACE® (Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression) device for the possible treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. This device generates acoustic (sound) pressure waves designed to act on the cells in your body to generate proteins that may lead to wound closure. The dermaPACE® device has not been approved for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers; therefore its use in this study is investigational. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of the dermaPACE® device to help diabetic foot ulcers heal more quickly. The active study device, the dermaPACE®, will be compared to an inactive look-alike device (called a "Sham") in this study. The sham device will not provide any treatment to your diabetic foot ulcer.</brief_summary>
