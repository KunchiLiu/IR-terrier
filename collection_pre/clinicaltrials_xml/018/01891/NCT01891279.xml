	<brief_title>Elemental Formula in Neonates Post Small Bowel Resection: Improved Weaning From Total Parenteral Nutrition?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates with short bowel syndrome (SBS) due to recent small bowel resection or congenital bowel anomalies (gastroschisis or omphalocele) can have inability to adequately digest and absorb enteral feedings resulting in prolonged Parenteral Nutrition (PN) dependence for nutrition and growth. Prolonged PN dependence can result in Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD) and intestinal failure requiring small bowel or small bowel/liver transplantation for survival. After bowel resection, the bowel has an ability to compensate for significant loss by going through a process called intestinal adaptation. Enteral feeding is the key factor for initiating and maintaining the adaptation of the intestine. Whole protein formulas or partially hydrolyzed formulas provide either the full protein or dipeptides/tripeptides respectively, and are thought to confer the best benefit in inducing intestinal adaptation and increasing paracrine stimulation. However, in small studies of adults and children with SBS,an amino acid based (elemental) formula demonstrated improved feeding tolerance and ability to wean off TPN. In a small study, babies fed breast milk or elemental formula appeared to have shorter duration of TPN. This is a randomized, blinded clinical trial to determine if elemental formula, Elecare® (vs. partially hydrolyzed formula, Pregestimil®) is better tolerated and allows a higher proportion of neonates with small bowel resection or congenital bowel anomalies to successfully wean off TPN.</detailed_description>
