	<brief_summary>Determine whether the mid-day suppression of hunger and amplified increase in the release of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) following morning exercise is due to increased fat content of the diet per se or a combination of high fat diet after morning exercise. The action of gut peptides, particularly GLP-1, on gastric emptying is likely to be important in mediating its effects on postprandial appetite and glycemia (Nauck et al. 1997). Our hypothesis is that exercise amplifies gut peptide secretion when diet is enriched with fat, and that this stimulus suppresses the hunger sensation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Effects on Insulin, Gut Peptides, and Appetite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific aim: Determine whether a change in macronutrient composition from 60% carbohydrate and 25% fat to 30% carbohydrate and 45% fat is responsible by itself for suppression of hunger and increased secretory response of glucose-dependent insulinotropic hormone (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), or whether these changes depend on preceding exercise. We will measure (a) concentrations of plasma GIP and GLP-1 by chemiluminescent multiplex assay, (b) concentrations of plasma ancetaminophen to assess the gastric emptying rate, (c) concentrations of plasma insulin, and glucagon by radioimmunoassay, and glucose, ketone bodies, and free fatty acids with appropriate spectrophotometric methods, (d) hourly appetite responses with visual analog scale under two conditions: sedentary (SED) and exercise (EX). Hypothesis: Hunger suppression and secretion of GIP and GLP-1 after the morning meal will be greater with slower gastric emptying rate when a meal consisting of 45% fat and 30% carbohydrate follows three hours after a 2-hour bout of moderate-intensity exercise than in the absence of exercise.</detailed_description>
