	<brief_summary>Urinary Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) has been recently reported to be related with the degree of acute kidney injury. We are trying to analyze whether it is related with the grade of acute kiney injury after partial nephrectomy and there is any difference between the kinds of surgery.</brief_summary>
