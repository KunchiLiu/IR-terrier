	<brief_title>Validation of the French Version of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) for Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Importance of measuring subjective aspects of the patient's health, often referred to as quality of life (QoL), become increasingly recognized and integrated into healthcare. For this purpose, The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a widely used questionnaire for QoL assessment specific for patients who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the IBDQ was originally developed in a cohort of Canadian patients in English language. Since QoL is impacted by underlying cultural trends, any translation of the IBDQ should be reassessed in relation to its validity, reliability, and sensitivity to detect change in the new language and cultural context. While the linguistic French translation of the original IBDQ has been validated, the French IBDQ has never been tested adequately on a French cohort of patient that we aim to perform.</detailed_description>
