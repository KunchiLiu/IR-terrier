	<brief_summary>The hypotension defined as 20 % less than the basal SBP (systolic blood pressure)and / or an absolute value &lt;90-100 mmHg, he presents an incident of 80-85% after an anesthesia intradural in the pregnant women, fact that worries for provoking undesirable effects so much in the mother and as in the fetus /newborn baby. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression system in the lower extremities in order to reduce the vasopressors drugs requirements to maintain hemodynamic stability in pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean sections with an spinal anaesthesia.</brief_summary>
