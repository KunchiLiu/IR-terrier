	<brief_title>Study to Demonstrate Equivalent Efficacy and to Compare Safety of Biosimilar Etanercept (GP2015) and Enbrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this confirmatory safety and efficacy study (GP15-302) was to demonstrate equivalence in efficacy and similarity in safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and Enbrel (EU-authorized) in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis and to evaluate the effects of repeated switching between GP2015 and Enbrel on efficacy, overall safety, and immunogenicity. Since only EU-authorized Enbrel was utilized in this study, the use of the term "Enbrel" throughout this report describes EU-authorized Enbrel only.</detailed_description>
