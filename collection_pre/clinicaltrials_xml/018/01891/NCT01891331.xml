	<brief_summary>CYP51 is an enzyme essential for fungal growth. Inhibition of CYP51 results in the accumulation of compounds toxic to the fungus. CYP51 is the target of the class of drugs referred to as 'azole antifungals'. The lack of selectivity by the azole antifungals is responsible for many of the side effects associated with these drugs. VT-1161 has been design to be safer and more active against the fungal species typically responsible for vaginal yeast infections (i.e. vulvovaginal candidiasis)</brief_summary>
