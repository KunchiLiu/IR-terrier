	<brief_summary>This study, driven on schizophrenic patients, is aimed at : 1. Measuring the efficiency of the cognitive remediation program RECOS (COgnitive REmediation in Schizophrenia) on the capacity of the patients suffering from schizophrenia to improve the integration in sheltered employment (ESAT and EA). 2. Comparing the efficiency of the program of cognitive remediation RECOS (RECOS arm) to the one of an usual program of coverage/care (TAU arm = Treatment As Usual) on integration in sheltered employment of patients suffering from schizophrenia. 3. Realizing a comparative analysis, in both arms, of : 1. the number of working hours achieved in sheltered environment during the 6 months following the two programs (reported to the working time planned by the contract of employment) 2. the duration of such employments in sheltered areas. 4. Estimating the impact of RECOS on the neuropsychological variables, the symptomatology, the consciousness of the disorders(insight), the quality of life and the social autonomy before the treatment (month M0), at the end of the treatment (month M3), and 6 months later (month M9), and looking for a correlation between the improvement of these parameters and sheltered employment. 5. Estimating the impact of cognitive remediation on integration in sheltered employment.</brief_summary>
