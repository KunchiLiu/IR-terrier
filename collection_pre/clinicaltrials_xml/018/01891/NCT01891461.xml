	<brief_title>Study to Compare the Addition of Floseal to Our Standard of Care to Control Post Operative Bleeding in TKR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial will be conducted at the Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal and Hôpital Jean-Talon. All patients admitted for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between January 2012 and September 2013 Outcome variable: Patient receiving Floseal or SOC Variables under study: Primary end point: Need of transfusion post-op (yes/no, how many) Patient will be transfused if : Hg &lt; 80 g/L plus if patient is symptomatic: orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia (pulse&gt; 100/min, hypotension (&lt; 90/60), hx : CVA, CAD) Secondary end point: 1. Efficacy (during hospital stay) - Pre-op and post-op Hg (&gt; 100; 80-100; &lt;80) - Hemovac blood drainage (ml) - Per operative bleeding (ml) 2. Safety (Follow up: 6wks, 6 ms, 12 ms, 24 ms) - Post-op complications: infection, pain, oedema, allergic reaction. - Functional outcomes: Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities questionnaire (WOMAC), International knee documentation committee form (IKDC)</detailed_description>
