	<criteria>For more information regarding BMS clinical trial participation, please visit www.BMSStudyConnect.com. Subjects who are newly diagnosed with symptomatic MM and who: Have not received any prior systemic antimyeloma therapy Have measurable disease And are not candidates for highdose therapy plus stemcell transplantation (SCT) because of age (â‰¥65 years) or coexisting conditions. Refusal to undergo high dose therapy with SCT is NOT sufficient for entry onto CA204006 for a subject &lt;65 years old. There must be a comorbidity that prevents SCT for a subject &lt;65 years old Subjects with nonsecretory or oligosecretory or free lightchain only myeloma Smoldering MM, defined as asymptomatic MM with absence of lytic bone lesions Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) Active plasma cell leukemia Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection or active hepatitis A, B, or C</criteria>
