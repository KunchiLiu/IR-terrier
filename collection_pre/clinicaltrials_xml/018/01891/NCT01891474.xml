	<brief_summary>Ubiquitous healthcare service for elderly patients with type 2 diabetes have been developed and improved glycemic control. However, previous U-healthcare service had some limitations, which needs specific devices to check blood glucose and send it to central system. Voice inception technique based U-healthcare service is expected to improve glycemic control without specific devices. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of this system, researchers plan to compare the improvement of glycemic control, self-management, and quality of life between U-health care group (intervention) and conventional treatment group (control).</brief_summary>
