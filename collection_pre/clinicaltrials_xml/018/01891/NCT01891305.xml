	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the novel oral agent VT-1161 is safe and effective in treating patients with moderate - severe tinea pedis (also referred to as athletes foot). VT-1161 has been designed to inhibit CYP51, an enzyme essential for fungal growth. Inhibition of CYP51 results in the accumulation of chemicals know to be toxic to the fungus. CYP51 is the molecular target of the class of drugs referred to as 'azole antifungals'. All currently approved azole drugs have poor selectivity for CYP51 and this results in many of the side effects associated with the azole antifungals. The safety profile of the class similarly limits use in chronic treatment of non-life-threatening fungal infections. A safer antifungal drug would improve treatment options for infections seen in otherwise healthy individuals where significant side-effect risks are unacceptable.</brief_summary>
