	<detailed_description>Albumin-bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen in advanced NSCLC especially in lung squamous cell carcinoma has a better tumor response rate and safety, therefore, this program is applied to neoadjuvant therapy, may obtain better tumor pathological remission rate, improve the operation resection rate, thus improve the prognosis.The main purpose of this study is to observe the safety and efficacy of albumin-bound paclitaxel / carboplatin in the treatment of lung squamous cell carcinoma of stage IIB and IIIA.</detailed_description>
