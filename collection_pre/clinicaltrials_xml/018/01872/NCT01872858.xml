	<brief_summary>Patients of vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCIND) in one group is prescribed cilostazol,in the other group is prescribed aspirin. Evaluate both of them in cognitive function, MRI and other sides at given time. The investigators hypothesize that cilostazol is more efficient and safer than aspirin in patients with VCIND.</brief_summary>
