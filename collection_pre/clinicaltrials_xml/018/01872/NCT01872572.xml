	<brief_summary>This was a Phase 1a, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single ascending doses of RB006 administered as an SC injection, with and without IV RB007 (an active control agent for RB006), in healthy young volunteers. The study originally planned to enroll 4 cohorts of 8 subjects each (N=32); however, upon review cohort (Cohort 1-A) was necessary in order to fully define the PK profile of SC RB006. Therefore, 36 subjects were enrolled in this study. Each cohort was balanced by sex with no more than 2/3 of one sex enrolled in any particular cohort (i.e., 5 of 8 subjects in each cohort). No subject participated in &gt;1 dose group, and progression to the next higher dose only occurred if the prior dose level was well tolerated, as assessed by a Safety Review Committee (SRC)</brief_summary>
