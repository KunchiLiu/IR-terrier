	<brief_summary>This clinical trial uses a laboratory test called a high throughput sensitivity assay in planning treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The aim is to try to identify drugs that may be effective in killing leukemia cells for those patients who will not be cured with conventional chemotherapy. This assay will test multiple drugs simultaneously against a patient's own donated blood sample. The goal is to use this laboratory assay to best match a drug to a patient's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment for Relapsed/Refractory AML Based on a High Throughput Drug Sensitivity Assay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain results from a high throughput drug sensitivity assay within 10 days, procure drug within 14 days and initiate treatment within 21 days. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To achieve a response (cytoreduction or at least partial response) greater that than expected for comparable refractory patient populations with other salvage regimens. OUTLINE: A patient receives a drug intervention based on the results of a high throughput sensitivity assay. This assay best matches a drug to the patient's disease.</detailed_description>
