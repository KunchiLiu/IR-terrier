	<brief_summary>The effect of breathing biofeedback training to influence the function of the cardiac autonomic nervous system at rest and in activity in children with cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy children suffer from a non-progressive damage of the brain. It is the most common injury that causes physical handicapped in childhood. There are a few researches that investigated the autonomic function in cerebral palsy children. Those researches found hyperactivity of the sympathetic autonomic system, including high resting heart rate compare to their typically developed pears. The recommended treatment for cerebral palsy is activity, muscle strengthening and mobility. The impairment in the autonomic system influences the everyday function and has correlation with secondary morbidity. As far as we know there are no researches who investigated the following issues. In this study we would like to: 1. Describe the autonomic cardiac function, Breathing function, motor function and the correlation between them in children with cerebral palsy. 2. Compare the autonomic cardiac function at rest in aerobic test and in diaphragmatic breathing. 3. Test the influence of breathing training on Heart rate variability parameters at rest, in aerobic test right after the breathing training program and one month after, in children with cerebral palsy</brief_summary>
