	<brief_title>Single and Multiple Dose Study in Japanese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While clinical studies of RDEA3170 to date have been limited to a Western population, it is recognized that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors may impact the PK, PD, safety, and dose response in different ethnic populations. The purpose of this study is to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) of single and multiple doses of RDEA3170 in healthy Japanese males, and to allow comparison of these parameters with the Western population.</detailed_description>
