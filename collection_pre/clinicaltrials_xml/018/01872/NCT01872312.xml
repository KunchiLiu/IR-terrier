	<detailed_description>IBV速 Valve System The Spiration速 IBV Valve System is a device to control prolonged air leaks of the lung, or significant air leaks that are likely to become prolonged air leaks following lobectomy, segmentectomy, or lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). An air leak present on postoperative day 7 is considered prolonged unless present only during forced exhalation or cough. An air leak present on day 5 should be considered for treatment if it is: 1) continuous, 2) present during normal inhalation phase of inspiration, or 3) present upon normal expiration and accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema or respiratory compromise. IBV Valve System use is limited to 6 weeks per prolonged air leak.</detailed_description>
