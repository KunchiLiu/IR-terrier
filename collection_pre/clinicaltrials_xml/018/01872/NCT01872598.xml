	<brief_summary>The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral masitinib 3 or 4.5 mg/kg/day in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine to placebo in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Masitinib in Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actual standard treatment for mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) and a NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease). These medications have shown to have an effect on some cognitive and non cognitive symptoms of the pathology. However, their efficacy remains limited and may decrease with time. There is an unmet medical need in this pathology. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, masitinib (AB1010) can be considered as a good candidate at the dose of 3 and 4.5 mg/kg/day.</detailed_description>

Patient with any other cause of dementia not due to Alzheimer's disease, based on specific examination including a brain neuroimagery exam within the last 6 months: Other central nervous condition causing progressive deficits in memory and cognition, e.g. cerebrovascular disease (patient with not more than 4 microbleeds and not more than 2 lacunes at the MRI could be enrolled in the study), Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, brain tumor… Systemic conditions known to cause dementia, e.g., hypothyroidism, untreated vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency, niacin deficiency, neurosyphilis, HIV infection… Substanceinduced dementia 2. Patient with Alzheimer disease with severe forms of delusions or delirium (patients with light and mild forms of delusions and delirium will be allowed in the study 3.
