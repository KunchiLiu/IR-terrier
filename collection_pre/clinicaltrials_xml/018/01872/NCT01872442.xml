	<brief_summary>Interferon alpha was a therapy used in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic phase prior to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Synergistic effect of the combination of Peg-IFNα2a with Imatinib was demonstrated in the clinical SPIRIT trial. In this study, the investigators address the question of the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in combination with low dose of Peg-IFNα-2b as frontline therapy for patients with newly diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic phase.</brief_summary>
