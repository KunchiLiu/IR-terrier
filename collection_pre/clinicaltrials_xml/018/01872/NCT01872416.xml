	<brief_summary>At present, there is no standard second-line treatment of refractory and relapsed SCLC, topotecan, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, irinotecan and drugs such as cyclophosphamide second-line treatment of small cell lung cancer currently being explored, Anthracycline antibiotics is a cell cycle non-specific anticancer drugs could inhibit the synthesis of DNA, DNA and dependent RNA, its wide antitumor spectrum, widely used in malignant hematologic diseases and lung cancer and other solid tumors. Jacot W, et al evaluated epirubicin combined with ifosfamide (EI) for treatment of refractory and recurrent SCLC in 70 cases, the objective response rate (ORR) reached 21.4%, including 1 cases of complete remission, 10% other patients obtained stable disease (SD), all the patients had a median survival of 3.9 months, most (71%) patients with neutropenia, platelet count and anemia are also common, showed that EI treatment of refractory and relapsed SCLC is effectively controlled, toxicity. In view of epirubicin combined with ifosfamide (EI) scheme is effective and safety in the treatment of refractory and relapsed SCLC, the investigators will use liposomal doxorubicin plus ifosfamide second-line treatment of refractory and relapsed small cell lung cancer, may obtain better tumor remission rate, improve the prognosis of the patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study of Liposomal Doxorubicin Combined With Ifosfamide Second-line Treatment in Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the investigators will evaluate the overall response rate (complete and partial responses) in first-line treatment failure or relapse after first-line therapy SCLC treated with Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and ifosfamide We will evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) i in receiving first-line treatment failure or relapse after first-line therapy SCLC treated with Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and ifosfamide</detailed_description>
