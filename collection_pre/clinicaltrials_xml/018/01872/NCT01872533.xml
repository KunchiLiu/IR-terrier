	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at how a reduction in oxygen levels (hypoxia) influences insulin sensitivity and carbohydrate metabolism. It is expected that 10 nights of exposure to moderate hypoxia (~ 15% O2, similar to conditions at an altitude of ~7500 feet) will improve glucose metabolism.</brief_summary>
