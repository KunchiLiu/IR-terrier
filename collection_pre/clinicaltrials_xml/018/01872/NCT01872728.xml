	<brief_summary>A bilateral facial block (infraorbital and infratrochlear) will be performed immediately after intubation in patients undergoing outpatient rhinoplasty with 2.5% levobupivacaine (intervention group) or saline as control. Intravenous saline or morphine will be administered at the end of surgery in intervention or control groups, respectively. In case of pain in post-anesthesia care unit (numerical pain score &gt;3 on a 0-10 scale), both groups will receive intravenous morphine titration. The total perioperative morphine consumption (intraoperative and in post-anesthesia care unit) will be compared between groups. Pain intensity, presence of nausea/vomiting and patient's satisfaction will be compared between groups.</brief_summary>
