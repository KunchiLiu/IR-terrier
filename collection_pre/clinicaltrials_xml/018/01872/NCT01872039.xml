	<brief_title>Post Marketing Study to Evaluate the Two Dose Regimens of Nicardipine Injection in Hypertensive Emergency Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, randomized and controlled study. Subjects are selected from hypertensive emergency patients with a BP (Blood Pressure) of &gt;180/120mmHg (SBP/DBP) and accompany with end target organ damage. All subjects are randomized into two groups receiving the Nicardipine Injection: Control Group (at a weight-based dose adjustment, i.e. according to the current Package Insert approved by SFDA) and Study Group (at a non-weight-based dose adjustment, i.e. according to the Package Insert approved by FDA). Patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are randomly allocated at 1:1 proportion to Control Group and Study Group. Before the treatment, investigators should define the target BP value for every subject according to different illness state, According to the BP, the dose of Nicardipine Injection is adjusted through different methods until reaching of target BP value. After reaching target BP value or 60min after the dosing initiation, BP and pulse rate are measured every 5~15min for 2h. Two to six hours after dosing, BP should be controlled at 160/100~110mmHg, and the maintenance dose is determined by the investigators according to the illness state.</detailed_description>
