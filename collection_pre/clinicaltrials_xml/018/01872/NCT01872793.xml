	<brief_summary>Despite the importance of nutritional status in patient's outcome, there is no gold standard for nutritional assessment. Traditional techniques used in healthy subjects to assess nutritional status cannot be used in cirrhotic patients due especially to ascites and peripheral edema, and altered rates of biochemical markers due to liver failure. Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis has emerged as a useful method to assess body composition and nutritional status especially in patients at the extremes of body weight (fluid overload, excess of adipose tissue, etc.). With previous results from our research group, BIVA showed to be useful for evaluating cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study is to validate our previous results and validate BIVA for nutritional assessment in patients with liver cirrhosis</brief_summary>
