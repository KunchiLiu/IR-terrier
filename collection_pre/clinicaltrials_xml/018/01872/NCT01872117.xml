	<brief_summary>The deep heat therapies are increasingly frequent in daily physical therapist for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases. The use of such procedures is justified by their analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiespasmolíticos and hiperemiantes. However, studies on the cardiovascular effects of these therapies are still incipient. Therefore, this study has as objectives: map the skin temperature changes in the lower limbs in different areas and positions after applying shortwave diathermy and microwave; assess hemodynamic and autonomic cardiovascular parameters, and investigate the occurrence of changes in conduction velocity superficial blood resulting from the application of these thermal features. The study will be conducted on 40 female volunteers between 18 and 30 years, university, healthy, that fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. The analysis by infrared thermography will be held in a room with temperature maintained at 23 ± 1°C and humidity average 50%. The volunteers will stay in prone position, with the legs bare, resting for 20 min to stabilize skin temperature with temperature of the room. After this period will be held applying diathermy of shortwave or microwave for 20 minutes at moderate heat on the lower limb regions of the hamstrings and triceps surae in extension and flexion to 180° to 90°. The records beat to beat blood pressure and heart rate to autonomic and cardiovascular hemodynamic evaluation will be performed by means of equipment Finometer (Finapress Medical Systems, Inc.) and electrocardiogram (ADInstruments, Inc.), respectively, before and after application of diathermy. On the other hand, the images will be processed using FLIR ThermoScan and blood flow data will be collected through the Doppler ultrasound. The results will be processed and analyzed using descriptive statistics, submitted to a linear regression model with mixed effects (random effects and fixed), with p≤0.05.</brief_summary>
