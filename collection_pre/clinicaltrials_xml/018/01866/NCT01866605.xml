	<brief_title>A Study of Methods to Reduce Anxiety in Preoperative Elective Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are randomising patients aged 18-70 having elective surgery to 1) a cotton blanket and reassurance as required; 2) midazolam, a cotton blanket and reassurance as required; and 3) forced-air warming, a cotton blanket and reassurance as required.
