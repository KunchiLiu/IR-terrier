	<brief_summary>Natural IVF study patients will undergo an IVF cycle with trigger shots of Lupron &amp; hCG. Patients will not be given any other stimulating medications during the cycle. They will have 2 uterine aspirations and an endometrial biopsy at designated times. The first uterine aspiration will be randomized to one of four days (day before retrieval, day of retrieval, day after retrieval or 2 days after retrieval). The second uterine aspiration and endometrial biopsy will be performed 6 days after retrieval. Any embryo(s) obtained will be biopsied for Comprehensive Chromosome Screening (CCS) and frozen for use in a subsequent thaw cycle.</brief_summary>
