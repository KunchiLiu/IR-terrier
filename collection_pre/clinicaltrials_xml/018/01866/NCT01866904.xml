	<brief_summary>THis study is intended to provide contemporary data on the burden of disease in patients 1 to 3 years post-MI, including a description of patient characteristics, current treatment patterns, rate of major CV events, and healthcare resource utilization in a 'real world' patient population at high atherothrombotic risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term rIsk, Clinical manaGement and Healthcare Resource Utilization of Stable CAD in Post MI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TIGRIS is a multinational, multi-centre, observational, prospective, longitudinal cohort study which will include stable CAD patients with history of MI 1-3 years ago and high risk of developing atherothrombotic events in a real world setting. The follow-up period is 3 years. Patients will undergo clinical assessments and receive standard medical care as determined by the treating physician. Patients will not receive experimental intervention or experimental treatment as a consequence of their participation in the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stable CAD patients aged 50 years or older with documented history of presumed spontaneous MI with their most recent MI occurring 1 to 3 years prior to enrollment and have at least 1 of the following risk factors: age â‰¥ 65 years; diabetes mellitus requiring medication; documented history of a second prior presumed spontaneous MI (&gt;1 year ago); documented history of angiographic evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease; chronic renal dysfunction. Presence of serious comorbidities in the opinion of the investigator which may limit life expectancy (&lt;1 year) Current participation in a blinded randomized clinical trial. Presence of any condition/circumstance which in the opinion of the investigator could significantly limit the complete follow up of the patient Patients receiving treatment of ticagrelor beyond 12 months, or off label use of ticagrelor.</criteria>
