	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with high level of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This could lead wounds, infections then amputations or deaths by impairment of the peripheral cutaneous perfusion. Medical therapies are presently unable to cure, but only slow down these disorders. Impact of exercise and lower extremity PAD rehabilitation is decreased by the significant inactivity of the chronic hemodialysis patients. Recently, many studies have shown several various favorable effects of the perdialytic physical activity. There is currently no data about effects of the perdialytic activity on the lower extremity perfusion. The aim of this clinical study is to show the impact of three months perdialytic cycling on the microcirculation, in chronic hemodialysis patients. Primary outcome will be the increase of cutaneous perfusion, assessed by measuring transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) on about twenty patients.</brief_summary>
