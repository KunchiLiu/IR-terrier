	<brief_summary>Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and radiographic outcomes of 23 edentulous jaws treated with 3D software planning, guided surgery, immediate loading and restored with Cad-Cam Zirconia and titanium full arch frameworks. Material &amp; methods: This study was designed as a prospective clinical trial. Twenty patients have been consecutively rehabilitated with an immediately loaded implant supported fixed full prosthesis. A total of 120 fixtures supporting 23 bridges (8 mandible, 15 maxilla) were placed , 22 of which in fresh post extraction sockets. All the implants were inserted with an insertion torque of 35/45 Ncm. 117 out of 120 implants were immediately loaded the other 3 were delayed loaded. Outcome measures were implants survival, radiographic marginal bone-levels and bone remodeling, soft tissue parameters and complications.</brief_summary>
