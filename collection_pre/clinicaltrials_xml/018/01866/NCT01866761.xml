	<brief_summary>Objective: We aimed at analyzing the relationship between periodontal disease and atherosclerosis in medical treatment and periodontal treatment under medical and dental care across borders in a local cooperation system of Japanese medical services. Materials and methods: - A prospective multi-center case cohort study was conducted on 37 ambulatory medical patients (with lifestyle-related diseases under consultation in either of the medical clinics registered as collaborative investigation facilities) and 79 periodontal patients (who were seen by the dental clinics registered as collaborative investigation facilities). - Medical treatment and clinical periodontal treatment were provided on the subjects under medical and dental care across borders by each internal medicine and dental clinics. - Systemic examination of lifestyle-related disease and periodontal examination were performed before and after periodontal treatment, and the relationships between periodontal and atherosclerosis-related clinical markers were analyzed before and after periodontal treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Periodontal disease: inflamed gingiva with positive for bleeding on probing or teeth with probing pocket depth more than 4 mm Lifestylerelated disease: Plaques are included when maximum IMT is measured. Furthermore, hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of more than 140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure of more than 90 mm Hg, or both, or patients already being treated by antihypertensive agents. Hypercholesterolemia was defined by serum concentration of LDLC of more than 140 mg/dL, or patients already being treated by lipidlowering agents. Diabetes mellitus was defined by HbA1c of more than 6.9 % (NGSP value) or fasting blood sugar of more than 126 mg/dl or both, or patients already being treated by agents for diabetes. At initial consultation and examination (Baseline), patients with less than 6 months after the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and with a past history or complication of serious heart disease were excluded. Similarly, those with less than 6 months after cardiovascular revascularization surgery, less than 6 months after the onset of cerebrovascular disorder, or serious liver disease or renal disease were also excluded.</criteria>
