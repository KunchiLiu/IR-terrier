	<brief_summary>The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the baroreceptor function in relation to surgical inflammation and orthostatic intolerance after elective hip arthroplasty. The main hypothesis is that baroreceptor function is attenuated after surgery and related to surgical inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on Baroreceptor Function in Relation to Orthostatic Blood Pressure Regulation After Hip Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Orthostatic intolerance and hypotension is prevalent during early mobilization after major surgery. This observational study aims to evaluate the baroreceptor function during using a standardized evaluation protocol before, 6- and 24 hours after elective primary unilateral hip-arthroplasty. The study hypothesis is that baroreceptor function as expressed by the valsalva ratio is attenuated after surgery and related to surgical inflammation.</detailed_description>
