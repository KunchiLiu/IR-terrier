	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 different dosing schedules of pembrolizumab (MK-3475), every 2 weeks (Q2W) and every 3 weeks (Q3W), and compare the 2 schedules to treatment with ipilimumab in ipilimumab-na√Øve participants with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Participants assigned to treatment with pembrolizumab could receive up to 2 years of treatment; if participants stopped treatment at 2 years and later experienced progression, they were eligible for a second course of treatment for up to 1 additional year. With Amendment 05, all Second Course participants will be treated with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W.</brief_summary>
