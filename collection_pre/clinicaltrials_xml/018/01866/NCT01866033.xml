	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Absolute Bioavailability of Oral PCI-32765 and the Effect of Grapefruit Juice on the Bioavailability of PCI-32765 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), sequential and 2-way crossover design, pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) study to assess the absolute bioavailability of oral (by mouth) PCI-32765 and the effect of grapefruit juice on the absorption of PCI-32765 in approximately 8 healthy adult participants. The duration of the study is approximately 45 days (screening, treatment, and follow-up). All patients will receive PCI-32765 560 mg (Treatment A) administered by mouth in the first period and Treatment B (560 mg administered by mouth without grapefruit juice) and Treatment C (140 mg administered by mouth with grapefruit juice) according to a randomization schedule in Periods 2 and 3. Participants will fast overnight for at least 10 hours prior to study drug dosing. Participants will stay in the study center for pharmacokinetic sampling. Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected before dosing and over 72 hours after dosing and safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
