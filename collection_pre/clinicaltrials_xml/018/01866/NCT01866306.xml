	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) human rhinovirus 16 (RV16UB) in healthy and asthmatic participants, and to identify an appropriate dosage of RV16UB in order to study biomarkers in asthmatic participants. The study is divided into 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose-finding study where healthy participants, and asthmatic participants, who were either treated or not treated with a class of long-acting beta antagonists (LABA) will be recruited to undergo nasal challenge with increasing doses of RV16UB. Part 2 is a biomarker study where mild to moderate asthmatics undergo challenge with the most appropriate dose of RV16UB identified in Part 1, based on tolerability and viral effects. .</brief_summary>
