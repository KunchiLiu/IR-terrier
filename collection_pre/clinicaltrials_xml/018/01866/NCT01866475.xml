	<brief_title>Continuous Intraosseous Vascular Access Over 48 Hours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, study to determine the safety of intraosseous (IO) access for a period up to 48 hours, in healthy adult volunteers and volunteers with a history of being health-compromised, including patients with mild to moderate renal disease (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Stage 1 to 3) and/or patients with controlled diabetes. Subjects will be randomized to receive IO access in the proximal tibia insertion site or the proximal humerus insertion site using the EZ-IO intraosseous vascular access system. The hypothesis is that there will be no serious complications for the subjects during a 48 hour IO catheter dwell time in either place.</detailed_description>
