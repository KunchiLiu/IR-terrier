	<brief_title>Follow-Up Study Validating a Blended Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2012, the investigators from Vidacare evaluated 4 techniques commonly used to identify the proximal humerus IO insertion site to determine if one technique resulted in more consistent successful placement of the IO needle set with a higher level of confidence among device operators performing the techniques. Results suggest that a combination of the best features of the 4 techniques may lead to optimal IO needle set placement more consistently. This study is needed to validate the "Blended" proximal humerus IO insertion technique to confirm that use of the technique results in proper site identification among device operators and results in increased confidence.To most closely evaluate the Blended proximal humerus insertion technique and how it is received by clinicians who perform these procedures in actual patients, device operators will include licensed/certified clinicians including, emergency medicine technicians/paramedics and nurses.</detailed_description>
