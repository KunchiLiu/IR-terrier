	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well orteronel works in treating patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Orteronel may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Orteronel in Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the relationship between circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based androgen receptor (AR) expression level and &gt;=-50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline following 12 weeks of therapy with TAK-700 (orteronel). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess changes in PSA and CTC levels and time to PSA progression (best response, decline at 12 weeks as continuous variable, etc.) with or without prior docetaxel-based treatment. II. To assess measurable disease response and time to radiographic disease progression for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with or without prior docetaxel-based treatment. III. To explore relationships between endocrine and clinical responses. IV. To confirm the safety of TAK-700 administered without prednisone in patients with metastatic CRPC. OUTLINE: Patients receive orteronel orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
