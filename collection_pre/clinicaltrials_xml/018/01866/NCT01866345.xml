	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is intended to evaluate the efficacy of surgically facilitated orthodontic treatment (SFO) in terms of treatment time, incidence of root shortening, and occurrence of mucogingival side effects compared to conventional orthodontic therapy in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment to correct crowding and/or retroclination of their mandibular anterior dentition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized, Blinded, Controlled Clinical Trial of Surgically Facilitated Orthodontic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The null-hypothesis for this research project is that there will be no difference in the rate of orthodontic movement among patients requiring proclination or alignment of their mandibular anterior teeth with SFO (TEST group) as compared to conventional orthodontic treatment (CONTROL group). A null-hypothesis is that there will be no difference between both treatment groups in the occurrence of dental (root shortening) or periodontal (mucogingival defects, alveolar bone resorption) complications associated with orthodontic treatment.</detailed_description>
