	<brief_title>Evaluation of Asymmetrical Lateral Decubitus for Rotation of Occipitoposterior Fetal Position</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of fetal occipitoposterior position during labor is 20%. Compared to anterior positions, they are known to be at higher risk of complications (cesarean section, instrumental delivery, severe perineal laceration). Maternal posturing is used during labor to facilitate the rotation of the fetal head in anterior position. Asymmetrical lateral decubitus is used frequently, without having ever been evaluated. Our study aims to evaluate the efficacy of this maternal posturing, through a randomized open trial. We hypothesized that posturing women in asymmetrical lateral decubitus allows increasing frequency of anterior fetal position after 1 hour.</detailed_description>
