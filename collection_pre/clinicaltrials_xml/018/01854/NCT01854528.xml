	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of 3 direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs; ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 [ABT-450/r/ABT-267; ABT-267 also known as ombitasvir] and ABT-333 [also known as dasabuvir]) plus ribavirin (RBV) compared with telaprevir (TPV) with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (HCV GT1) infection without cirrhosis who were previously treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of the 3-DAA regimen (ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 [ABT-450/r/ABT-267] and ABT-333) plus ribavirin (3-DAA/RBV) compared with the combination of telaprevir (TPV) with RBV and pegIFN (TPV/RBV) in noncirrhotic participants with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (HCV GT1) infection who were previously treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV). Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 3-DAA/RBV (ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 plus RBV for 12 weeks) or TPV/RBV (TPV co-administered with pegIFN and RBV for 12 weeks, followed by followed by pegIFN and RBV for either 12 or 36 weeks, per local prescribing information).</detailed_description>
