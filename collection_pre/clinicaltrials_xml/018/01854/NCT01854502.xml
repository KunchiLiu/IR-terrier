	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesized that the training of the dental professionals involved in children's examinations could improve the quality of the counseling, raise the level of commitment, and give them a new kind of perspective on early childhood oral health counseling. Health promotion programs with clinical guidance aimed also at the parents themselves might commit the families to maintain their children's good oral health. All programs (two new and the control program) consisted of the basic elements of oral health counseling for the children. The counseling included regular oral hygiene, i.e. tooth brushing with fluoride-containing toothpaste twice a day, advice of a healthy diet with proper timing and composition of meals avoiding sugary snacks, and to use xylitol products on regular basis. Additionally, in the program of oral hygiene and fluoride, the parents were given counseling on how to brush their own teeth with fluoride-containing toothpaste and clean between them. In the program of diet and xylitol parent was asked to fill in one-day diary of his or her own diet in the waiting room, and the dental professional pointed out the frequency of meals and snacks, as well as suggested the use of xylitol 5 grams per day. The children, accompanied by their parents, were clinically examined in various health clinics of the Vantaa public dental service. At the regular two-year visit, the dental hygienists and in-service trained dental nurses tested the children for mutans streptococci in plaque. The transtheoretical model and the motivational interviewing were introduced to the dental hygienists and in-service trained dental nurses to use in preventive counseling. The results of this study will be published in three articles.</detailed_description>
