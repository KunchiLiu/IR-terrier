	<brief_summary>Perioperative goal directed fluid therapy may reduce complication rate after surgery. Minimal invasive cardiac output monitoring is a key method to guide fluid therapy. More operations are being performed by keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). For laparoscopy, the abdomen is filled with carbon dioxide. Increased pressure in the abdomen may influence minimal cardiac output monitoring, therefore minimal cardiac output monitoring is not recommended during laparoscopy. This study aims to validate minimal cardiac output monitoring during laparoscopy and therefore facilitate for goal directed fluid therapy.</brief_summary>
