	<brief_summary>The present study was aimed at investigating the efficacy of nebulizing Budesonide sin comparison with intravenous Dexamethasone before extubation in prevention of post-extubation complications amongst patients admitted in intensive care unit. In this double-blind randomized clinical trial study, 90 patients (age between 18 to 65) who are intubated (at least for 48 hours) and now are ready for extubation will be enrolled in the study after obtaining a written informed consent from their parents or guardians. The investigators divide our patients randomly into two equal groups. -In the budesonide group patients underwent a therapy with nebulizing Budesonide at a dose of 1 mg diluted in 4 cc of sterile water for 20 minutes, one hour preceding extubation. After extubation patients received nebulizing budesonide via oxygen mask at the same dose every 12 hours for 48 h.i In dexamethasone group intravenous dexamethasone was administered to patient at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg before extubation. After extubation, the administration of intravenous Dexamethasone continued at the same dose every 12 h. for 48 h. Another anesthesiologist who is unaware about kind of medication, will evaluate the patients for severity of stridor. We will record the vital sings and grade of stridor every 6 hour. Respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) were recorded for each patient immediately before aerosol administration (time 0) and at 30 and 60 min; and 2,4,8,12,24,36 and 48 hrs. After extubation then the presence of stridor (heard with the aid of stethoscope) was recorded within 48 hr of extubation</brief_summary>
