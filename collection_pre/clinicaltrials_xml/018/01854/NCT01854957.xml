	<brief_summary>A double-blind, randomized, cross-over phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the intravenous administration of autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) to patients with active multiple sclerosis (MS) resistant to currently available therapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MEsenchymal StEm Cells for Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanism of action of MSC relies on their ability to modulate pathogenic immune responses and provide neuroprotection through the release of anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant and trophic factors as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Patients will be randomized to receive immediate vs. delayed treatment with either a dose equal to 1-2 millions/kg of body weight of autologous MSC, or equivalent volume of suspension media at baseline. At 6 months treatments will be reversed. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate - treatment's safety within one year from MSC administration by measuring the the number, time-frame and severity of adverse event and - treatment's activity in terms of reduction in the total number of contrast-gadolinium enhancing lesions (GEL) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Secondary outcomes are to gain preliminary information on the efficacy of the experimental treatment in terms of combined MRI activity and clinical efficacy (incidence of relapses and disability progression).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of MS a. Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) not responding to at least a year of attempted therapy with one or more of the approved therapies (betainterferon, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, fingolimod) as evidenced by one or more of the following: i. ≥1 clinically documented relapse in past 12 months ii. ≥2 clinically documented relapses in last 24 months iii. ≥1 GEL at MRI performed within the last 12 months b. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) not responding to at least a year of attempted therapy with one or more of the approved therapies (betainterferon, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, fingolimod) as evidenced by both: i. an increase of ≥1 point of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) (if at randomization EDSS ≤ 5.0) or 0.5 EDSS point (if at randomization EDSS ≥ 5.5) in the last 12 months ii. ≥1 clinically documented relapse or ≥ 1 GEL at MRI within the last twelve months. c. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients with all the following features: i. an increase of ≥1 EDSS point (if at randomization EDSS ≤ 5.0) or 0.5 EDSS point (if at randomization EDSS ≥5.5), in the last twelve months ii. ≥ 1 GEL at MRI performed within the last 12 months iii. positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (oligoclonal banding 2.
