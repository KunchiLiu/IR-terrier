	<brief_title>Comparison Study of Insulin Glargine and NPH Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study the investigators will be comparing two long-acting insulins, insulin glargine and NPH insulin. The trial will be evaluating differences in effectiveness, safety and cost between the two agents when used in patients on more than 80 units or 1unit/kg long-acting insulin. The investigators hypothesis is that patients switched from lantus to NPH will have improved blood glucose control.</detailed_description>
