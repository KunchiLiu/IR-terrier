	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Specialized Therapeutic Care of Patients Presenting an Intolerance Attributed to Electromagnetic Fields</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>110 patients suffering from Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) are expected in this trial. Type of trial: Interventional multicenter study, non-randomized, with measurement before and after intervention. Each patient is his own control. Primary outcome: Efficacy of an individual medical care on electro sensitive (IEI CEM) patients evaluated from the improvement of health status, sensitivity to electromagnetic fields (EMF) exposure, and quality of life. Scheme: Visit 1(T0): Patients undergo a specialized medical examination: a standardized medical record is filled in. Physicians evaluate the psychological impact of IEI-EMF and a psychotherapeutic care is proposed if necessary. Patients fill in 2 self-questionaries: quality of life (SF-36) and EMF exposure sensitivity. After the visit 1, a symptoms self-administrated questionary n°1 is completed during 7 days. 1 month after inclusions (T1), radiofrequencies (RF) are recorded by a dosimeter worn by patients for 7 days; patient fill-in the symptoms self-administrated questionary n° 2 during the same time. Visit 2: 6 months after inclusion, analysis of symptoms and RF exposure is restituted at patient. An adapted care is proposed. 12 months after inclusion (T12), patients complete the symptoms self-administrated questionary n°3. Visit 3: 14 months after inclusion (T14), patients have medical examination and complete the quality of life and EMF exposure sensitivity self-questionaries. Standardized medical record is filled in by physicians. Patient and physician discuss the global and comparative analysis of individual results. Inclusion duration: 24 month; Follow-up: 14 months; Study duration: 38 months.</detailed_description>
