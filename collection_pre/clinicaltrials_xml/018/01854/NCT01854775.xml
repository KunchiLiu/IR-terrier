	<brief_summary>There will be 2 cohorts in this study, each consisting of Part A and Part B. The primary objectives of Cohort 1 are to evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) for elvitegravir (EVG) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and confirm the dose of the elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) single tablet regimen (STR) (Part A) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of E/C/F/TAF STR through Week 24 (Part B) in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naive adolescents. The primary objectives of Cohort 2 are to evaluate the PK of EVG and TAF in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected children 6 to &lt; 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg administered E/C/F/TAF STR (Part A) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of E/C/F/TAF STR through Week 24 in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected children 6 to &lt; 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg.</brief_summary>
