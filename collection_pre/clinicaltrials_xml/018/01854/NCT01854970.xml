	<brief_summary>Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is the retrograde movement of gastric contents into the larynx, pharynx and upper aerodigestive tract. The symptoms and manifestations are very changeable and non specific. Pharyngeal and Oesophageal pH-impedance may help to detect these reflux and to identify patients with abnormal LPR. To compare and describe the results of pharyngeal and oesophageal pH-impedance of patients with high suspicion of laryngopharyngeal reflux, with the results of healthy patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefit of Pharyngeal and Oesophageal pH-impedance of Patients With High Suspicion of Laryngopharyngeal Reflux</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a monocentric, prospective descriptive study. Patients will be recruited in otolaryngology and gastroenterology departments of Bordeaux teaching hospital. A first clinical, endoscopic and pH-impedance evaluation will be made, after at least 15 days of interruption of any proton pump inhibitors (PPI). After 8 weeks' treatment by double PPI doses (esomeprazole 40 mg bid), another clinical and pH-impedance evaluation will be realized. The characteristics of the patients who respond to the treatment will be compared to non responders. The subjects will also have an initial laryngoscopy, an oesophageal manometry allowing the location of the lower sphincter of the oesophagus and the upper sphincter of the oesophagus for positioning the catheters.</detailed_description>
