	<brief_summary>Liver cirrhosis (LC) is the final destiny in chronic liver disease.The quality of life in liver cirrhosis patients with refractory ascites are very wretched. The objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transplantation via liver artery in Child-Pugh B and C stage of liver cirrhosis patients with refractory ascites. The immunomodulatory impact of MSCs in fibrosis was confirmed, and several clinical studies have applied MSCs to eliminate the progression of fibrosis. In this research the investigators will study the affect and influence of MSCs in the patients,include assay of liver function,variation of ascites,Child-Pugh score etc.</brief_summary>
