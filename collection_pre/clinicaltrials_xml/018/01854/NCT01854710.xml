	<brief_summary>It has been shown in a pre-marketing clinical study that clinically relevant QT prolongation does not appear to be associated with a single dose of ADASUVE. The potential risk of QTc prolongation following repeat dosing is unknown. Therefore the current study will assess the potential effects on the QT interval of 2 consecutive doses of ADASUVE administered 2 hours apart, in relation to placebo and an active control in healthy volunteers. The study hypothesis H0: Placebo-subtracted max mean dQTc &gt; 10 msec</brief_summary>
