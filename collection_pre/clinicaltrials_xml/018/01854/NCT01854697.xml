	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Three Experimental Drugs Compared With Telaprevir (a Licensed Product) in People With Hepatitis C Virus Infection Who Have Not Had Treatment Before</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that treatment with ABT-450/ritonavir (r)/ABT-267 and ABT-333 administered with or without ribavirin (RBV) has non-inferior efficacy compared to treatment with telaprevir and pegylated interferon alpha-2a (pegIFN) and RBV and to compare the safety of these regimens in treatment-naive hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1a- and 1b-infected adults.</detailed_description>
