	<brief_summary>Malignant ascites and pleural effusion are common symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. Currently, the management of malignant ascites and pleural effusion is a considerable clinical challenge. The investigator hypothesized that tumor cell-derived microparticles packaging chemotherapeutic drugs might be a useful means to treat malignant ascites and pleural effusion. Thirty malignant ascites or pleural effusion patients will be recruited for Phase II clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness Study of Tumor Cell-derived Microparticles to Treat Malignant Ascites and Pleural Effusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ascites or pleural effusion were first removed from patients. The patients were then locally injected with microparticles packaging chemotherapeutic drugs 4 times a week. The therapeutic effects and side effects were recorded.</detailed_description>
