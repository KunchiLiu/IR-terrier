	<brief_summary>Study design: a randomized, crossover trial. Each patient performed three different airway clearance techniques (Autogenic drainage, slow expiratory with glottis opened in lateral posture [ELTGOL], temporary- positive expiratory pressure [T-PEP] with not similar autonomy degree in a randomized order. Each technique were applied in 3 sessions during one week at alternate days (Monday /Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday). The time spent in each bronchial session was 40 minutes. Seven days were the wash-out time period between the different techniques.</brief_summary>
