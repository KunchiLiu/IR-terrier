	<brief_title>Study of Analgesics Drug and Human Milk Transfer in Mature Milk, to Avoid Breastfeeding Cessation Without Scientific Probes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Analgesics are frequently used to prevent and treat pain and inflammatory disease. Due to a lack of information on drug's human milk transfer, breastfeeding is sometimes contraindicated. Mothers are advised to either stop breastfeeding or if they don't, not to treat themselves. Since the fatal neonatal case with codeine during breastfeeding, analgesics are being reviewed. Ibuprofen seems to have the best benefit-risk ratio during the post-partum period. However there are no pharmacologic data about the use of ibuprofen during breastfeeding, after the colostrum phase. This study aims to determine the relative infant dose (RID) of ibuprofen in human mature milk. Considering the increased interest in NSAIDs in light of the codeine case, this is an important information. It will help health practitioners when advising and treating breastfeeding women.</detailed_description>
