	<brief_summary>Failure of extubation after mechanical ventilation is a frequent and deleterious issue. Main reasons for failure are hypoxemia, secretions retention, lung collapse and excessive work of breathing. Most of this issues can be partly counterbalanced by a device named "High flow conditioned oxygen therapy (HFCO)". Then, our hypothesis is that HFCO may reduce the incidence of respiratory failure after extubation in patients with high risk for failure.</brief_summary>
