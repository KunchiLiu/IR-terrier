	<brief_summary>In multiple myeloma "cancer stem" cells can be defined and quantified with flow cytometry. More, these cells can be related to treatment response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cancer Stem Cells in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators' hypothesis is that, multiple myeloma plasma cells derivate from principal cells that is called "cancer or progenitor stem cell". In multiple myeloma to define immunophenotyping features of these "cancer stem cells" with flow cytometry and to show their prognostic value and check for any relationship between cancer stem cell quantification and chemotherapy response are main aims of this study.</detailed_description>
