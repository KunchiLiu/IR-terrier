	<brief_summary>This phase 1 study tests whether use of the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) can improve motor impairment after stroke. It is based on the hypothesis that after stroke, the brain's utilization of glucose, it's primary source of energy, is disrupted. The MAD is a low-carbohydrate diet that has can switch the body's metabolism from using glucose to using products of fat metabolism, so-called ketones. Ketones may act as an alternative energy substrate for the brain. Ketones also have several neuroprotective effects after stroke.</brief_summary>
