	<brief_title>Efficacy of Non Contrast DWI(Diffusion Weighted Imaging) Imaging Compared to DMR-DE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To discover new information about MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) called DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) and its ability to diagnose cardiac scarring. CMR-DE (cardiac MR with delayed contrast enhancement) evaluates if there has been scarring in the heart muscle following a heart attack. Subjects are injected with a contrast medication that makes the scarring visible if present. To prove the efficacy of DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) to provide the same images that CMR-DE (cardiac magnetic resonance with delayed contrast enhancement) provides.</detailed_description>
