	<brief_summary>Oral hypoglycemic medications sometimes do not control type 2 diabetes well. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as adjunctive therapy might improve diabetes control and could enhance the hypoglycemic activity of DPP4, but there is little clinical data on efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. The investigators sought to examine the effect of PPI lansoprazole, DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, and their combination therapy on insulin and glucose regulation in healthy subjects in oral glucose tolerance (OGTT).</brief_summary>
