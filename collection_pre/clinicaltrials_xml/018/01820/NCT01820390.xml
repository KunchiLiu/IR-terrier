	<brief_summary>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become the primary surgical therapy for the treatment of motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), and for essential tremor (ET). Although an effective and relatively safe procedure with expanding indications, opportunities exist for the optimization of the current procedure. The investigators therefore propose, in a group of patients undergoing DBS surgery for the treatment of PD or ET, to use a combination of high‚Äêfield imaging modalities, intraoperative electrophysiology, external sensor interfaces, and computational modeling, to gather information on the utility of using these techniques to optimize DBS electrode placement and programming.</brief_summary>
