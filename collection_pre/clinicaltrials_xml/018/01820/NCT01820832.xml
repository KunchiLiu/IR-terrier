	<brief_title>Oral Calcitriol for Reduction of Mild Proteinuria in Patients With CKD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proteinuria is not only a capital sign of kidney disease, but also a marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. Emerging evidence in patients with CKD show that vitamin D and its analogs can reduce proteinuria or albuminuria in the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibithion. While some of the studies reported that vitamin D receptor activation has been associated with increased serum creatinine and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rates. Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct a randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Calcitriol in the treatment of mild proteinuria (&lt;1.0g/d) CKD patients,which has no specific treatment at present.</detailed_description>
