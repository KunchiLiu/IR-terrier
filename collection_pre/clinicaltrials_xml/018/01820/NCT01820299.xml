	<brief_summary>This study is for subjects with solid cancers (gastrointestinal, lung, breast, prostate, lymphoma or cancer of the lymph nodes). The overall goal of this study is to identify plant-derived phytochemicals that can safely reduce systemic inflammation (inflammation throughout the entire body) in subjects with advanced cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Assay-guided Trial of Anti-inflammatory Phytochemicals in Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will look at oligomeric procyanidin complex (OPC) and vitamin D3. OPC is the major part of Grape Seed Extract (GSE). Researchers are in looking at the combination of GSE and vitamin D in subjects with solid cancers (gastrointestinal, lung, breast, prostate, lymphoma or cancer of the lymph nodes). Researchers will examine the safety of the GSE and vitamin D when GSE is given at different doses. Researchers will also look at the effects of GSE and vitamin D on your quality of life and your body. In particular, they will look at differences in biomarkers in your blood and urine.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must have a histological diagnosis of cancer Subjects must be 21 or more years of age Subjects must have metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable cancer. Cancer must be "active" (i.e. demonstrable by physical examination, blood tests, or radiographical procedures). Subjects may not initiate a new form of cancer therapy, nonsteroidal or steroid antiinflammatory agents, or antibiotics during the study period or for 4 weeks prior to the start of study agents. Subjects must be able to give written consent to the study. Subjects must have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function at baseline, as follows: Hematology parameters: ANC &gt;1500/mcL, platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL, Hgb &gt;8.0gm/dL Renal Function: Creatinine &lt;1.8mg/mL Liver Function: Total bilirubin ≤ULN, AST and ALT &lt;1.5xULN, Alk phosphatase &lt;2.5xULN Subjects must have normal serum phosphate and serum calcium levels: Serum Phosphate &gt; 2.3 and &lt; 4.8 mg/dL Serum Calcium &gt; 8.5 and &lt; 10.5 Subjects may be receiving anticancer treatment, but this treatment should be have been instituted at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment, and may not change during the study period. Uncontrolled cancer requiring the institution of new anticancer therapy during the study period. Presence of any severe or uncontrolled concurrent medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would increase the risk of serious toxicity from the study drugs. Any uncontrolled systemic inflammatory disease or infection requiring antibiotics, nonsteroidal, or steroidal antiinflammatory agents. Initiation of strong antioxidant supplements during treatment, or ongoing use of supplements containing concentrated plantderived polyphenols (pine bark, grape seed, green tea, milk thistle extracts; resveratrol; ellagic acid) Pregnancy or breast feeding Any history of allergies to grapes or grape seed. Current treatment with lenalidomide, thalidomide, imipquimod, interferon, cytokines (GCSF, GMCSF, IL1Rα), TNFα antagonists, or Lithium. History of sarcoidosis History of hypercalcemia Use of any nonprotocol vitamin D supplementation. Uncontrolled hypertension Current treatment with warfarin</criteria>
