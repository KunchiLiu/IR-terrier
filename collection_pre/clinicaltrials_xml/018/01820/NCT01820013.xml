	<brief_summary>This blinded randomized comparative trial aims to determine the effectiveness of a customized Dynamic Elastomeric Fabric Orthoses (DEFO) compared to a standard pelvic belt in: a) reducing pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP), b) optimizing activity levels in pregnant women with PGP, c) improving quality of life for pregnant women with PGP d) cost effectiveness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Centre Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Effectiveness of Two Pelvic Support Garments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) occurs in an estimated 70% of pregnant women, of whom 25% have severe pain and 8% significant disability. Current methods of management, such as the use of rigid pelvic belts, are limited in their effectiveness. The Dynamic Elastomeric Fabric Orthoses (DEFO) has recently proven beneficial in managing PGP in athletes. There is a need to explore the potential use of DEFO for managing PGP during pregnancy. The primary aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of a DEFO to a rigid 'off the shelf' pelvic support belt in terms of its effectiveness in reducing PGP during pregnancy. The secondary aims of the study are to compare the effectiveness of the DEFO to the rigid 'off the shelf' pelvic support belt in (a) optimizing activity levels in pregnant women with PGP, (b)improving quality of life for pregnant women with PGP. The relative cost effectiveness of these two interventions will also be compared.</detailed_description>
