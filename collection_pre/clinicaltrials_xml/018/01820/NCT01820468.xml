	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled study tests an adapted critical time intervention model for veterans discharged from a psychiatric inpatient unit. It is hypothesized that veterans on the inpatient unit who are assigned to such a community-based team will have shorter lengths of inpatient stay and better mental health. There have been few developments of community-based models of care in the post-deinstitutionalization era of short inpatient stays and the results of the study may inform how inpatient stays can be further reduced.</brief_summary>
