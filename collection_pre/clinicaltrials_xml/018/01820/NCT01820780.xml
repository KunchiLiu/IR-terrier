	<brief_summary>After decompensated heart failure, a number of patients have high risk of early rehospitalization as well as death. Specialized medical management for a short period but very early after discharge could be critical for optimizing care and improving early outcome. This study aims to compare such early intensive medical management with usual care in high-risk patients after discharge.</brief_summary>
