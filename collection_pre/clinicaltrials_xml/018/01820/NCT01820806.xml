	<brief_summary>This will be a study in 6 healthy male subjects, each receiving a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C]-radiolabeled GLPG0634. The study aims to establish the elimination pathways of GLPG0634 and their relative significance and to assess the metabolite profile of GLPG0634 in plasma and in excreta. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the main metabolites in plasma relative to GLPG0634 will be evaluated. This study will also provide safety and tolerability information for GLPG0634.</brief_summary>
