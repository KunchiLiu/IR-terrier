Nonchildbearing potential, i.e. postmenopausal or have a confirmed clinical history of sterility (e.g. the subject is without a uterus) or, 2. Childbearing potential, provided there is a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test prior to trial treatment, to rule out pregnancy Female subjects of childbearing potential1 must be willing to use effective contraception at trial entry and until completion Location of the treatment area (full face, full balding scalp or chest) within 5 cm of an incompletely healed wound, within 10 cm of a suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC Prior treatment with ingenol mebutate gel within the treatment area Lesions in the treatment areas that have: atypical clinical appearance (e.g., hypertrophic, hyperkeratotic or cutaneous horns) and/or, recalcitrant disease (e.g., did not respond to cryotherapy on two previous occasions History or evidence of skin conditions other than the trial indication that would interfere with the evaluation of the trial medication (e.g., eczema, unstable psoriasis, xeroderma pigmentosum) Use of cosmetic or therapeutic products and procedures which could interfere with the assessments of the treatment areas. Clinical diagnosis/history or evidence of any medical condition that would expose a subject to an undue risk of a significant AE or interfere with assessments of safety and efficacy during the course of the trial, as determined by the investigator's clinical judgment Any abnormal laboratory tests that are medically significant and would impact the safety of the subjects or the interpretation of the trial results, as determined by the investigator's judgment Anticipated need for hospitalisation or outpatient surgery during the first 15 days after the first trial medication application. Note that cosmetic/therapeutic procedures are not excluded if they fall outside of the criteria detailed in Prohibited Therapies or Medications Known sensitivity or allergy to any of the ingredients in ingenol mebutate gel Presence of acute sunburn within the treatment areas Current enrolment or participation in an investigational clinical trial within 30 days of entry into this trial.
