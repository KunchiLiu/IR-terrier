	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of PCI-32765</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (individuals will be assigned by chance to study treatments), open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), 4-way crossover study to compare the effect of food and two fasting regimens on the pharmacokinetics of PCI-32765 in healthy adults. There will be approximately 52 (at least 25% women) participants (11 in each sequence in the 4-way crossover and 8 in an optional cohort). A screening phase will be followed by an open-label treatment phase consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods of 420 mg PCI-32765 administered with or without food. Doses in successive open-label treatment periods will be separated by a washout period of 7 days. Participants will be confined to the study center from Day -1 of each treatment period (at least 10 hours before each study drug administration) until completion of the 72 hour pharmacokinetic blood sample collection on Day 4 of Period 4. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of PCI-32765 and metabolite PCI-45227 will be collected before dosing and over 72 hours after dosing in each treatment period. A follow-up visit approximately 10 days after the last dose will be made to measure lymphocyte count and to capture any additional adverse events. After completion of the 4-way crossover portion of the study, and in absence of significant safety observations at the 420 mg PCI-32765 dose, an additional separate cohort of 8 participants may be enrolled to participate in one treatment period and receive a dose of 840 mg in combination with a high-fat breakfast. Safety will be assessed throughout the study. The total study duration is a maximum of 85 days.</detailed_description>
