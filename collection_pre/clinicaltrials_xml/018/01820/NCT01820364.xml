	<brief_title>LGX818 in Combination With Agents (MEK162; BKM120; LEE011; BGJ398; INC280) in Advanced BRAF Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II two part multi-center, open-label study. Part I: LGX818 single agent treatment until progression Part II: Combination treatments of LGX818 + MEK162, or BKM120, or BGJ398, or INC280, or LEE01 to assess the clinical efficacy, to further evaluate the safety of the drug combinations in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma after relapse on LGX818, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combinations (when not established previously). These drug combinations are selected and assigned to patients based on documentation of molecular resistance mechanism. Patients with BRAF mutant melanoma treated by LGX818 single agent in other studies can be enrolled directly in Part II of CLGX818X2102 after relapse. Dose-escalations in the combination arms for which no MTD has been established will be based on the recommendations of a Bayesian logistic regression model guided by an escalation with overdose control criterion. After careful evaluation of slow enrollment and the BRAF-mutant melanoma treatment landscape, recruitment was permanently halted on 26-Jul-2014. This recruitment halt was not a consequence of any safety concern and patients who were ongoing in the study continued to be treated as per protocol.</detailed_description>
