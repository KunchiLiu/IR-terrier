	<brief_summary>This single-center, randomized controlled trial is to investigate the impact of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on the risk contrast-induced acute kidney injury and its long-term impact on renal function for patients with diabetes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remote Ischemic Preconditioning and Risk of Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Coronary Stent Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with diabetes undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention in Beijing Anzhen Hospital were enrolled, and all the eligible participants were randomized to either remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) group or control group. Those randomized to RIPC group had a pneumatic medical tourniquet cuff (width , 5 cm ; length , 40 cm) placed around their upper arm at &lt; 2 hours before the PCI procedure. The pneumatic medical cuff was inflated to a pressure of 200 mm Hg for 5 minutes , followed by 5 minutes of deflation to allow reperfusion. This procedure was repeated for 3 times. Control participants did not experience this procedure of transient upper-limb ischemia.</detailed_description>
