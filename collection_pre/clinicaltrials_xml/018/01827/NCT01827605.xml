Occult carriers: must receive treatment with Lamivudine 100 mg for the duration of treatment program and at least 12 months after treatment cessation; HBVDNA levels and HBsAg will be monitored every month HCV positivity with elevated transaminases or INR or APTT or active virus replication HIV positivity Any concurrent medical condition requiring long term use (&gt; one month) of systemic corticosteroids Active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection requiring systemic therapy Any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition which might impair administration of therapy or preclude the ability to give informed consent Treatment with an experimental agent within 30 days prior to study entry Myelosuppressive chemo or biological therapy within three weeks before study entry (use rituximab course delivered as maintenance is not an exclusion therapy) Major surgery other than diagnosis within 4 weeks prior to study entry</criteria>
