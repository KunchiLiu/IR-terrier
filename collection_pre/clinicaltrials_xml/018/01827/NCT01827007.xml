	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate whether fluid responsiveness of the critically ill patient can be assessed by analysing the PEEP-induced hemodynamic effects to systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, aortic blood flow, aortic time-velocity integral and left ventricular end diastolic area measured with transesophageal echocardiography (PEEP-test). The chances are compared to increase of CI after volume expansion (gold standard). In clinical practise, it would be especially relevant if PEEP-induced changes in arterial pressure variations could be used in evaluation of volume status and fluid responsiveness. However, as ECHO-derived variables are used in greater extent to guide the treatment with inappropriate evidence, the simultaneous registration of ECHO-derived hemodynamic measurements is essential in the study design.</brief_summary>
