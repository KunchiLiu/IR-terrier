	<brief_title>Effect of American Ginseng on Exercise-induced Muscle Soreness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy men and women will consume either 2000 mg of American ginseng daily (four 500 mg pills will be taken at four different times during the day always with food/meals) or a placebo (4 cellulose) for four weeks prior to engaging in a 40 minute downhill treadmill jog (12% decline) at a speed of 7 miles per hour. Participants will consume one pill with breakfast, one pill with lunch, one pill with dinner and another pill with a snack either between meals or prior to bedtime. The exercise will be consist of five, eight minute bouts of jogging with two minutes of rest/recovery in between. The degree of muscle soreness will be assessed using a Biodex strength testing machine (isometric and concentric isokinetic torque), and a self-rating of perceived soreness on a scale from zero to ten. All of the above measures will be taken before and several times after the downhill jogging protocol.</detailed_description>
