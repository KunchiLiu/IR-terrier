	<brief_title>Phase III Trial Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Dose Adjustment of Imatinib Mesylate on the Molecular Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Imatinib Mesylate at a dose of 400 mg / day is the standard treatment for patients with CML-CP. Recent studies show that the quality of response rate (complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response rate) is dependent on the residual plasma Imatinib. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a strategy for dose adjustment of Imatinib Mesylate based on the measurement of the residual plasma imatinib in patients treated for at least 2 years Imatinib 400 mg / d in complete cytogenetic response for at least 1 year.</detailed_description>
