	<brief_title>Sutent Rechallenge In mRCC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A sample size of n = 40 patients will allow to estimate of the median PFS with a precision around 1.8 months (based on data from Rini et al.) This retrospective and prospective study is designed to estimate the effect of Sutent rechallenge. The PFS (estimated from Kaplan-Meier estimate) will be the primary endpoints. In addition, the effects of sunitinib at the 2 periods of treatment (i.e. first line sunitinib vs. rechallenge) will be compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank test for PFS values and by McNemar test for overall response rate (ORR).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically documented metastatic RCC containing predominantly clear cell component. Previously received sunitinib in first line, 2 or more antitumor therapies subsequently and then received sunitinib for a second time. At least 1 cycle of sunitinib rechallenge (1 cycle= 4 weeks on/2 weeks off). At least 1 measurable lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension with the longest diameter (LD) ³ 10 mm when measured by spiral computerized tomography (CT) (5mm slice thickness contiguous) or ³ 20 mm when measured by conventional CT (10mm slice thickness contiguous). The lesion must be ³ 2 times the size of the slice thickness per RECIST criteria. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. Patient who didn't receive Sunitinib in first line. Patient who received less than one line of treatment .</criteria>
