	<brief_summary>This is a single-dose, open-label, two part, parallel group study. This study is being conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of GSK2336805 in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Part 1 of the study will enroll subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and healthy control subjects matched to the subjects in the moderate hepatic impairment category. The decision to commence Part 2 will be based on a review of the preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data from subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Part 2 will enroll subjects with severe hepatic impairment. Additionally, based on emergent data from Part 1, matched controls to the severe hepatic group may be enrolled (optional). Due to the potential difficulty in identifying eligible subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the study may be stopped prior to full enrollment in Part 2, provided that a minimum of 4 evaluable subjects with severe hepatic impairment have been enrolled. The study will consist of a Screening visit, a single dose Treatment Period and a Follow-up visit. Subjects will be screened for eligibility criteria within 30 days of enrolment. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1; each subject will receive a single dose of GSK2336805 on Day 1 and will remain in the clinical unit for 5 days (check-out on Day 4). The follow-up visit will be conducted within 7-10 days after Day 1 dosing.</brief_summary>
