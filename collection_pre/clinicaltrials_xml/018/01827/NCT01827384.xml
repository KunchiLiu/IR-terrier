	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot phase II trial studies molecular profiling-based targeted therapy in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775, everolimus, and trametinib are drugs that each target a specific variation in tumors by blocking different proteins needed for cell growth. Veliparib blocks an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaged by chemotherapy, which may help chemotherapy drugs work better. It is not yet known whether testing patients for variations in their tumor and assigning treatment targeting the variation is more effective than standard non-targeted therapy in treating advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the response rate (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) and 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) for treatment with agents chosen based on the presence of specific mutations in patient tumors with the response rate for treatment with agents chosen from the complementary set of agents not identified to target the mutations of interest. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment regimens corresponding to one of their mutation/amplification categories. Patients may cross over to a second mutation/amplification determined regimen within Arm A, if there is one, upon disease progression. REGIMEN I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. REGIMEN II: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 PO BID for 5 doses starting on day 1 and carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. REGIMEN III: Patients receive everolimus PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. REGIMEN IV: Patients receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: Patients are assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment regimens as in Arm A from the complementary set (not corresponding to one of their mutation categories). Patients may cross over to Arm A upon disease progression. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days. Patients with unacceptable toxicities that have not resolved by day 30 are followed up biweekly until stabilization or resolution.</detailed_description>
