	<brief_title>Ibuprofen Versus Acetaminophen vs Their Combination in the Relief of Musculoskeletal Pain in the Emergency Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen, is more effective than either single agent alone in treating pain from acute musculoskeletal injuries in the emergency department. We hypothesize that the combination will be more effective than either agent alone in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute pain from musculoskeletal injuries such as sprain, and bruises. While each agent alone is effective to some degree, many patients do not find complete relief with them and often narcotic agents (with all of their potential side effects) are added. In this study patients experiencing any pain will be randomly given either ibuprofen OR acetaminophen OR their combination and their degree of pain severity will be measured every 15 minutes up to one hour. At the end of this 1 hour patients still experiencing pain and requiring additional pain relief will receive additional analgesics at the discretion of their treating physician. We will not only measure how much the pain severity was reduced but also the percentage of patients that require some form of additional or "rescue" medication.</detailed_description>
