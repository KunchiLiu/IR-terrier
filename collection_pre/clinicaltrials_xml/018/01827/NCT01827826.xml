	<brief_summary>It is estimated that 30 million U.S. adults will have type 2 diabetes by 2050. Contributing to this national trend is the obesity epidemic. Three randomized trials have demonstrated that intensive behavioral interventions can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. The purpose of this pilot study is to inform a future randomized, controlled Phase III trial of a population-based, telephonic, exercise and weight loss intervention to translate the findings of the Diabetes Prevention Program into practice. The telephonic intervention will be compared to usual care (30 participants in each group). The investigators will deliver the intervention in 12 weekly, 20-minute calls, with four subsequent maintenance calls, for a total of 16 calls over 24 weeks. Study outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks. For this planning grant the investigators do not have an overall hypothesis. The investigators' goal is to develop and test whether it is possible to do exercise and weight loss</brief_summary>
