	<brief_summary>Clinical studies have demonstrated long term relief from dentine hypersensitivity with twice daily brushing of a toothpaste containing stannous fluoride in comparison to marketed (negative) controls. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a stannous fluoride dentifrice in the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity compared to a marketed (negative) control, over a period of 56 days (8 weeks) with twice daily brushing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants with selfreported history of dentinal hypersensitivity lasting more than 6 months but not more than 10 years. Participants with minimum of 20 natural teeth. At screening, a minimum of two accessible teeth (incisors, canines, premolars) that meet all of the following criteria. 1. Teeth showing signs of facial/cervical gingival recession and/or signs of erosion or abrasion. 2. Teeth with Gingival Index score ≤1 and a clinical mobility of ≤1. 3. Teeth that are determined to be sensitive by the subject following a 1 second air blast to the cervical margin. Presence of chronic debilitating disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect study outcomes. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes dry mouth. Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay in 12 months of screening. Participant using of a desensitising dentifrice within 6 weeks of screening</criteria>
