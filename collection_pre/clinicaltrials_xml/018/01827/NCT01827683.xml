	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen and Fibromyalgia: Randomised Prospective Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, randomized, cross-over trial. Patients will be randomized into two groups (test and control) to receive the HBOT at the beginning of the trial or 2 months afterwards. The control group will receive its treatment after the elapsed two months. This study will be a prospective, randomized cross over study. After signing a written informed consent, all patients will be invited to a 2 hour examination, including pain sensitivity examination and a series of questionnaires. In addition, prior to the beginning of the treatment all patients will have chest X-ray, neurological examination, cognitive evaluation and brain metabolism evaluation (SPECT scan). A similar evaluation will be done after the 8 weeks, test versus control time period, and another evaluation will be held after 16 weeks. The HBOT procedure will be performed in the hyperbaric chamber at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Israel. The following HBOT protocol will be applied for the treated group: 8-week, 5 times a week administration of 100% O2 for 90 minutes at a pressure of 2 ATA. After 8 weeks the control group, that did not received HBOT, will receive the same HBOT protocols. At baseline, after 2 months and after 4 months all patients will undergo complete neurologic and pain evaluation and brain SPECT scan (total of 3 evaluation and scan per patient).</detailed_description>
