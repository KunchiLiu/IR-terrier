	<brief_summary>Patients diagnosed with Multifocal Motor Neuropathy were confirmed based on the European Federation of Neurological Societies/ Peripheral. Nerve Society Guideline. Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and do not conflict with the exclusion criteria will receive NPB-01 (intravenous immunoglobulin) 400mg/kg/day for five consecutive days. Subsequently, patients receive NPB-01 1g/kg every 3weeks and evaluate the Medical Research Council（MRC） score and the Guy's Neurological Disability Scale（GNDS） et al. As a safety endpoint, the safety of NPB-01 will be investigated the occurrence of adverse events by one year after the start of the study treatment.</brief_summary>
