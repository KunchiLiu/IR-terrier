	<brief_title>Neratinib With and Without Temsirolimus for Patients With HER2 Activating Mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, therapeutic-exploratory, adaptive design, open-label, multicenter, multinational study evaluating neratinib monotherapy and neratinib plus temsirolimus combination therapy in patients with NSCLC who have documented somatic HER2 mutations. Patients will be randomized at study entry into 1 of 2 treatment arms: - Arm A: neratinib 240 mg orally once daily, - Arm B: neratinib 240 mg orally once daily plus temsirolimus 8 mg once weekly by intravenous (IV) infusion. In the case of disease progression, patients initially assigned to the neratinib monotherapy arm will be given the option to add temsirolimus 8 mg IV once weekly. All patients on combination therapy may be dose-escalated with respect to temsirolimus dose to 15 mg/week at the end of first cycle of treatment with the combination, if well tolerated and at the physician's discretion. In the event that the neratinib 240 mg/day plus temsirolimus 15 mg/week dose is not well tolerated, the patient will be subsequently dose reduced back to neratinib 240 mg/day plus temsirolimus 8 mg/week. Dosing will be continuous on nominal 3-week cycles until evidence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal of consent. All eligible patients enrolled will have their disease measured radiographically at baseline. Patients will undergo radiographic evaluation of their disease every 6 weeks until disease progression or withdrawal from the study.</detailed_description>
