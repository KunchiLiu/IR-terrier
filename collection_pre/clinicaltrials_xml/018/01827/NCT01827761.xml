	<brief_title>Assessment of the Effectiveness of Chemotherapy Teaching: BrUOG 258</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy teaching sessions, often coordinated in the outpatient setting by nursing personnel, are meant to educate patients about the chemotherapy they will be receiving. Education topics include an understanding of side effects, treatment schedule, medications to treat side effects and how to contact the oncology team if adverse events develop. Some of these issues are addressed in the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI). This study will perform an analysis of the teaching process that is provided prior to chemotherapy administration. This study will provide data for each participating hospital to individually assess their teaching process. Multivariate analysis can be performed to evaluate whether age, sex, native, language, race highest level of education, cancer type, chemotherapy regimen, institution where chemotherapy will be administered, and type of personnel performing the teaching visit, influences the effectiveness of the teaching visit. In addition, results can be compared across different hospitals.This analysis may lead to improvements in each hospital's chemotherapy teaching practices and lead to advances in patient's cognitive and emotional preparedness.</detailed_description>
