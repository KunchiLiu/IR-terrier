	<brief_summary>A study to determine if transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS, the device that regulates brain activity, can improve pain in people with neuropathic facial pain and compare which modality (inhibitory tDCS over the somatosensory cortex or excitatory tDCS over the motor cortex) can result in better pain-relief.)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Stimulation (tDCS) For the Treatment of Neuropathic Facial Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study designed to collect preliminary data on safety and efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)to relieve pain in subjects with neuropathic facial pain,and to compare two pain-treatment tDCS modalities: inhibitory tDCS stimulation over the somatosensory cortex and excitatory tDCS over the motor cortex.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Spontaneous facial neuropathic pain due to any of following: 1. Trigeminal neuralgia, type 1, (TN1): facial pain of spontaneous onset with predominantly episodic pain. 2. Trigeminal neuralgia, type 2, (TN2): facial pain of spontaneous onset with predominantly constant pain. 3. Trigeminal neuropathic pain, (TNP): facial pain resulting from unintentional injury to the trigeminal system from facial trauma, oral surgery, ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery, root injury from posterior fossa or skull base surgery, stroke, etc. 4. Trigeminal deafferentation pain, (TDP): facial pain in a region of trigeminal numbness resulting from intentional injury to the trigeminal system from neurectomy, gangliolysis, rhizotomy, nucleotomy, tractotomy, or other denervating procedures. 5. Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia, (STN): facial pain resulting from multiple sclerosis. e) Postherpetic neuralgia, (PHN): facial pain resulting from trigeminal Herpes zoster (shingles) outbreak in the trigeminal distribution. Pain intensity score for "worst pain in the last 24 hours" &gt;4 on a numeric scale 010 at the time of enrollment and before the first stimulation of each treatment block. Pain intensity score for "pain right now" &gt;4 on a numeric scale 010 before the first stimulation of each block of treatment. Uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease Other painful conditions than neuropathic facial pain, that are not related to and can't be distinguished from the neuropathic facial pain Pregnancy Implanted neurostimulation devices (e.g. a spinal cord stimulator, a deep brain stimulator, etc) Active illegal drug/alcohol abuse Unable to follow directions or complete tools in English.</criteria>
