	<brief_summary>Background Physical as well as psychosocial complaints are frequently present in patients with a neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Adequate information is seen as an essential aspect of supportive care. The aim of the current study is to test the effectiveness of a web-based tailored information and support system targeting patients' information and care needs. Key features of this system are self-screening of physical and psychosocial problems, tailored education on reported problems and self-referral to professional health care. Objective To detect whether a web-based tailored information and support system improves patients' perception and satisfaction of received information. The investigators hypothesize that after having received web-based tailored information and support patients feel more informed and are more satisfied with the received information than when receiving standard care. Study design The present study is a randomized prospective longitudinal experimental multicenter pilot study. In this study, we want to examine the effect sizes on the perception and satisfaction by the patient of received information (primary objective) and secondary objectives after having used web-based tailored information and support. Eligible are newly diagnosed NET-patients (N=40) (diagnosed less than 3 months ago). Patients will be asked to fill out questionnaires at baseline and after 12 weeks, on socio-demographic features (only at baseline), internet use (only at baseline), health care use, patients' perception and satisfaction of received information, distress, quality of life and empowerment (only after 12 weeks). Study population Patients diagnosed with a NET (any type of NET, any phase of disease) who are under treatment at the Department of Medical Oncology in the University Medical Center Groningen or Hospital Medisch Spectrum; twenty will be invited to participate in the study. Intervention During 12 subsequent weeks, a personalized website (with a surname/password) will become available to patients in the experimental group beside the usual standard care. Key features of the website are self-screening, tailored patient education and self-referral. Self-screening will be performed by an online version of the Dutch Distress thermometer (DT) and Problem List (PL). Patients will receive automated feedback on their DT score immediately after test completion together with information regarding problems reported on the PL, options for (self)-help and possibilities for referral to professional care. Contact information will also be available to discuss questions, problems and/or referral needs. Patients may also request a telephone call. Main study endpoint The primary endpoint is to detect an improvement in patients' perception and satisfaction of received information after having received web-based tailored information and support.</brief_summary>
