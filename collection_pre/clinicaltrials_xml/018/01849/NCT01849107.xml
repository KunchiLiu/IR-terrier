	<brief_summary>Small bowel irradiation results in epithelial cell loss and consequently impairs function and metabolism. A metabolic end product of small bowel enterocytes is plasma citrulline. The investigators evaluate the correlation between plasma citrulline level, dose-volume histogram of small bowel, and small bowel toxicity grade by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE ver.4.0) to investigate whether citrulline can be used as a biomarker for quantifying radiation-induced epithelial cell loss.</brief_summary>
