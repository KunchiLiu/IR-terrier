	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, parallel study will evaluate the effect of multiple doses of vemurafenib on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of phenprocoumon in patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic malignancies. Patients will be randomized to receive either treatment A: a single oral dose of phenprocoumon 6 mg on Day 1 (Eligible patients will have the option to continue treatment with vemurafenib as part of an extension study (NCT01739764).), or treatment B: vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily on Days 1-29 plus a single oral dose of phenprocoumon 6 mg on Day 22 (with the option to receive vemurafenib in the extension study after completion of pharmacokinetic assessments).</brief_summary>
