	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that aspiration will be more prevalent at two to four hours post-extubation but will resolve in the majority of patients by 24 to 26 hours post-extubation. The purpose of the research is to investigate whether there is a difference in swallow function two to four hours after extubation (removal of breathing tube) compared to 24 hours after extubation. This information will help healthcare providers decide if it is necessary for people to wait 24 hours after extubation before they start eating and drinking.</brief_summary>
