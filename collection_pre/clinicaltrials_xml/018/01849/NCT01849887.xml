	<brief_summary>Stroke is a major cause of adult disability. Currently approved reperfusion therapies are provided to only a small percentage of patients in the U.S. New therapies are needed that improve outcome and that can be accessed by a majority of patients. Animal studies suggest that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, administered intravenously days after a stroke, safely improve long-term behavioral outcome. A large human experience suggests the safety of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The current study aims to assess the safety of this therapy in patients with recent ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory, with onset 2472 hours prior to the time that the therapy transfusion is initiated, radiologically confirmed, and with either diameter &gt;15 mm or volume &gt; 4cc. 2. The index stroke has clinical deficits that are moderatesevere (NIHSS score 720), did not require hemicraniectomy or invasive intracranial pressure monitoring, and was not associated with a concomitant STelevation myocardial infarction. 3. Age 1880 years, inclusive 4. Reasonable likelihood of receiving standard poststroke medical care, as well as standard physical, occupational, and speech therapy. 1. No substantial prestroke disability (prestroke modified Rankin Scale score 02). 2. Females of childbearing potential will be excluded unless (1) a negative urine pregnancy test is obtained and (2) the patient has been effectively using contraceptive method with known failure rate &lt;1 % for at least 90 days. 3. Lactating mothers 4. If thrombolytic therapy has been administered, at least 24 hours have passed between completing thrombolytic dosing and initiating the current study's transfusion. 5. Known allergy to penicillin or to fetal bovine serum 6. Active coexistent major neurological or psychiatric disease that could significantly interfere with patient compliance or study assessments, including drug or alcohol abuse. 7. Any diagnosis that makes survival to 1year poststroke unlikely. 8. Participation in any other experimental therapeutic clinical trial concurrently or in the prior three months. 9. Contraindication to undergoing MRI scanning.</criteria>
