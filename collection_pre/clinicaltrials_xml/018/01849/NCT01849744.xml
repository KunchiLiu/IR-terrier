	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation trial of VS-4718, a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, in subjects with metastatic non-hematologic malignancies. This clinical study is comprised of 2 parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Expansion). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety (including the recommended Phase II dose), pharmacokinetics (the amount of VS-4718 in your blood) and the anti-cancer activity of VS-4718. The pharmacodynamic effects (genes or proteins that may predict or show how your body may respond to VS-4718) will also be examined in tumor biopsies and blood samples.</brief_summary>
