	<brief_summary>This research study is a Phase IV clinical trial. Phase IV trials are used to further test and monitor the safety of a drug approved by the FDA and to see if the drug has any other indications that can be used to treat different diseases. Sorafenib is a new drug, which is approved under the brand name Nexavar for the treatment of liver cancer. It is also currently being tested in various other cancers. Sorafenib works by slowing down and/or stopping the development of new cancer cells and new blood vessels. By slowing down and/or stopping the growth of new blood vessels around a tumor, it is believed that sorafenib prevents or slows down the growth of tumors. The researchers of this study would like to study the effects of sorafenib on hepatitis C by drawing additional research blood samples from people infected with hepatitis C who are receiving sorafenib treatment for liver cancer. These tests will measure certain proteins in the blood (HCV-RNA) which may indicate if sorafenib has any effect on the hepatitis C virus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HCV-RNA Kinetics During Sorafenib for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label, non-interventional trial to evaluate HCV-RNA levels during treatment with Sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Participants will receive Sorafenib 400mg orally twice daily. HCV-RNA (Hepatitis C Virus - Ribonucleic Acid) levels will be measured at baseline, week 2 of sorafenib, week 4 of sorafenib, week 6 of sorafenib, week 8 of sorafenib, week 12 of sorafenib, and 2 weeks after discontinuing sorafenib. HCV-RNA levels will be measured by drawing about 2 tablespoons of blood During the study period, tumor assessments will be done by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) scans at baseline and every 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
