	<brief_summary>Accelerometric Assessment of neuromuscular block during anaesthesia is routinely performed at the M. adductor pollicis. However, many operations require positioning of the patients with arms attached to the body. In these situations, the anaesthesiologist has no access to the m.adductor pollicis. In this study, a new position of accelerometry at the neck is evaluated: Stimulation of the n. accessorius with accelerometry of the m. trapezius.</brief_summary>
