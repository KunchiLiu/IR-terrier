	<brief_title>ESBA1008 Microvolume Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 4-cohort study was conducted in 2 stages. Stage 1 consisted out of 2 Cohorts. In each cohort subjects were randomized 10:3 to either receive ESBA1008 (Cohort 1 : 2 injections, Cohort 2 : 1 infusion and 1 injection) or 2 Lucentis injections. Stage 2 was conducted similarly with a different dosing level for ESBA1008 (Cohort 3 and 4). Subjects had follow-up visits at Day 7 and Day 14. All cohorts receiving ESBA1008 on Day 0 also received ESBA1008 6mg/50 μL via injection on Day 28. After the Day 28 visit (all cohorts), subjects returned for follow up visits at Day 42 and Day 56.</detailed_description>
