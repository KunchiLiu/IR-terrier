	<brief_summary>MicroRNAs (miRNA) are molecular biomarkers that post-transcriptionally control target genes. Deregulated miRNA expression has been observed in diverse cancers. In high grade gliomas, known as glioblastomas, the investigators have identified an oncogenic miRNA, miRNA-10b (mir-10b) that is expressed at higher levels in glioblastomas than in normal brain tissue. This study tests the hypothesis that in primary glioma samples mir-10b expression patterns will serve as a prognostic and diagnostic marker. This study will also characterize the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of glioma subclasses. Furthermore, considering the critical function of anti-mir-10b in blocking established glioblastoma growth, the investigators will test in vitro the sensitivity of individual primary tumors to anti-mir-10b treatment. Tumor, blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples will be obtained from patients diagnosed with gliomas over a period of two years. These samples will be examined for mir-10b expression levels. Patient survival, as well as tumor grade and genotypic variations will be correlated to mir-10b expression levels.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion/ 18 years of age Brain tumor(s) to be resected for clinical reasons. Histological pathology confirmation that tumor is of glial origin, WHO Grade II, III or IV. Adequate tissue available for processing as determined by Pathology. Adequate decision making ability to review, discuss and sign a consent form to allow their tumor samples to be used for future human brain tumor biology laboratory research. Determination of capacity to consent is made by one of the coinvestigators based on clinical assessment. Patients opting for the standard treatment regimen for their disease as well as ongoing clinical trials will be are eligible to participate in this study. Standard care for newlydiagnosed glioblastomas typically consists of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide, followed by adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy.</criteria>
