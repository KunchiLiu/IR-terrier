	<brief_summary>We are doing this research study to evaluate whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a treatment for sleep apnea, will also help treat fatty liver disease. Sleep apnea is a disease where a person has interruptions in their breathing while they are sleep. This can lead to low oxygen levels in the blood. CPAP is a mask that delivers oxygen at high pressure to the lungs to prevent a decrease in blood oxygen levels. CPAP is a known treatment for sleep apnea.</brief_summary>
