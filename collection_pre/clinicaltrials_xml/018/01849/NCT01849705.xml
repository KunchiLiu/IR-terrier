	<brief_summary>Mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) are the most common form of monogenic obesity, and can explain 2-6% of severe obesity. Studies have shown that mutations in MC4R are associated with increased fat mass, height-for-age, appetite and insulin resistance among children. In adults, mutations in MC4R are less penetrant for these phenotypes but it has been observed that individuals with MC4R mutations have a smaller than expected blood pressure for their degree of obesity. The purpose of this study is to explore the association between functional MC4R mutations and obesity, insulin resistance and blood pressure.</brief_summary>
