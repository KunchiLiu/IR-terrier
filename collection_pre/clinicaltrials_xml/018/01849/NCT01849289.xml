	<criteria>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed clinically) for at least 6 months Insulin naïve subjects (Allowed are: previous short term insulin treatment up to 14 days; treatment during hospitalisation or during gestational diabetes is allowed for periods longer than 14 days) Current treatment: metformin monotherapy or metformin in any combination with an insulin secretagogue (sulfonylurea or glinide), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitor, alfaglucosidaseinhibitors (acarbose) with unchanged dosing for at least 3 months prior to randomisation (Visit 2) with the minimum doses stated: metformin: alone or in combination (including fixed combination) 1500 mg daily, or maximum tolerated dose (at least 1000 mg daily), insulin secretagogue (sulfonylurea or glinide): minimum half of the daily maximal dose according to local labelling, DPPIV inhibitor: minimum 100 mg daily or according to local labelling, alfaglucosidaseinhibitors (acarbose): minimum half of the daily maximal dose or maximum tolerated dose HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) 7.010.0% (both inclusive) by central laboratory analysis BMI (Body Mass Index) below or equal to 40.0 kg/m^2 Treatment with TZDs (thiazoledinedione), or GLP1 (glucagonlike peptide 1) receptor agonists within the last 3 months prior to Visit 1 (screening) Anticipated change in concomitant medication known to interfere significantly with glucose metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids, betablockers, MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitors Cardiovascular disease within the last 6 months prior to Visit 1 (screening) defined as stroke; decompensated heart failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) class III or IV; myocardial infarction; unstable angina pectoris; or coronary arterial bypass graft or angioplasty Any clinically significant disease or disorder, except for conditions associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which in the Investigator's opinion could interfere with the results of the trial Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as randomised. Rescreening of screening failures is allowed only once within the limits of the recruitment period Known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products</criteria>
