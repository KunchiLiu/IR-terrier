	<brief_summary>This phase II trial investigates whether patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age diagnosed with myeloma or another plasma cell malignancy will have better outcomes with transplant followed by maintenance therapy, as primarily measured by progression-free survival, versus non-transplant approaches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Followed By Maintenance Therapy in Treating Elderly Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) from the start of dexamethasone, cisplatin, Adriamycin (doxorubicin),Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), etoposide (DPACE) for all participants who have had at least one day of protocol treatment. II. To evaluate how well such therapy is tolerated in patients mainly over the age of 65 years by assessing severe complications (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, death) and the percentage of participants able to complete the full course of therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate Quality-Of-Life post-transplant using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire QLQ-C30 and QLC-MY20. OUTLINE: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1-4 and 8-11, cisplatin intravenously (IV) continuously, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously, cyclophosphamide IV, and etoposide IV on days 1-4. Patients then receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SQ) on days 6 and 13 and undergo collection of stem cells when white blood cell (WBC) and cluster of differentiation (CD)34 counts are within program range. Following stem cell collection, patients may receive interim dexamethasone PO on days 1-4, every 14 days at the discretion of the treating physician. TRANSPLANT: Beginning between 4 weeks to 6 months after the first day of induction therapy, patients receive as transplant conditioning regimen dexamethasone PO on days -4 to -1 and days +2 through +5, bortezomib IV bolus on days -4, -1, 2, and 5, thalidomide PO on days -4 to 5, and melphalan IV on days -4 and -1. Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) on day 0. Between transplant and consolidation therapy, patients receive dexamethasone PO on days 1-4 every 21 days and thalidomide PO daily. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: If administered, post-transplant consolidation may begin 4-6 weeks after transplant but should occur no more than 4 months later. Most patients will not receive consolidation. Those that do will receive dexamethasone PO on days 1-4 and 8-11, thalidomide PO on days 1-11, bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, cisplatin IV continuously, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously, cyclophosphamide IV continuously, and etoposide IV continuously on days 1-4. MAINTENANCE THERAPY YEAR 1: Beginning 6 weeks-6 months after consolidation therapy or 4 weeks to 6 months after transplant if consolidation is skipped, patients receive bortezomib IV bolus on days 1, 4, 15, and 18, thalidomide PO QD on days 1-28, and dexamethasone PO on days 1-4 and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE THERAPY YEAR 2: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 15, and 18, cyclophosphamide PO or IV on days 1 and 15, and dexamethasone PO QD on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least once annually at the study center, but serum for MM marker results will be sent to the study site for close monitoring of PFS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must have had a diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), MM + amyloidosis, or POEMS (osteosclerotic myeloma: polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, skin changes) requiring treatment; participants with a previous history of smoldering myeloma will be eligible if there is evidence of progressive disease requiring chemotherapy; Note that study participants do not need to have active disease at the time of study entry, as participants may have received up to 12 months of prior chemotherapy, which might have induced a response Protein criteria must be present at diagnosis (quantifiable Mcomponent of IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE and/or urinary kappa or lambda light chain, BenceJones protein, or Free Kappa Light Chain or Free Lambda Light Chain) in order to evaluate response. Nonsecretory participants are eligible provided the participant has &gt; 20% plasmacytosis OR multiple (≥3) plasmacytomas or lesions on MRI at the time of diagnosis or study enrollment , OR the presence of lesions on PET/CT scan or skeletal survey at diagnosis or study enrollment. Participants must have received ≤12 months of prior chemotherapy for this disease without evidence of progressive disease with treatment. Participants may have received prior radiotherapy provided approval has been obtained from the PI. Participants with a history of radiation who have a platelet count &lt;150,000 due to radiation (disease, chemo, and other factors have been ruled out) will be excluded from this study. Participants must not have had a prior transplant Participants must be 6585 years of age at the time of study entry.
