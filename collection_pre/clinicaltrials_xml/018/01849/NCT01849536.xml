	<brief_summary>Ocular hypertension and its fluctuations is a major risk factor of glaucoma onset and progression. In normal eyes, IOP presents a circadian rhythm, but in glaucomatous eyes IOP circadian rhythm is altered and varied widely between patients. To date, the only way to evaluate 24 hour IOP fluctuations is a regular GAT-IOP measurement during a 24-hour hospitalization. This method is expensive and does not reflect physiological conditions because it requires IOP measurements during sleeping periods that may potentially produce artifacts. Sensimed AG has developed a new medical device SENSIMED Triggerfish® that enables a 24-hour continuous monitoring of IOP fluctuations. As any IOP measurements methods, this medical device might be influenced by corneal properties of the cornea as central corneal thickness, keratometry or biomechanics. We, therefore, investigate the corneal lens tolerance, potential modifications of corneal parameters after a 24-hour wear of the lens, and its influence on data collected during the whole period of analysis. Then we will also analyze the influence of corneal parameters on continuous IOP fluctuations measured with the contact sensor and finally the correlation between data collected and the rate of progression (severity) of glaucoma evaluated with visual field test or optic nerve head damages.</brief_summary>
