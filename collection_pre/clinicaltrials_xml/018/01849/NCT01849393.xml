	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this project is to assess the study population's acceptance of two medication adherence support strategies: incentive-based programs and electronic medication monitoring. The study population is adolescents (ages 16 - 24) positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) currently undergoing treatment with antiretrovirals at St. Jude's HIV clinic. Participation in the study will involve completion of a survey: an Audio Computer Assisted Self Interview (ACASI). The duration of the survey is anticipated to be 10-20 minutes. Patient identifiers will not be attached the survey.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Rewards-Based Adherence and Electronic Medication Monitoring in HIV-Positive Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whether or not patients take their medications is one of the most noticeable and important predictors of treatment success or failure for HIV infection. Ways to improve compliance, specifically rewards-based programs and electronic medication monitoring, have shown some success in limited clinical research studies focused on adult subjects. Because the social and developmental factors in adolescents are different from adults, adolescents may not respond to these interventions in the same way as adults. This study will investigate adolescent acceptance and the effectiveness of these programs.</detailed_description>
