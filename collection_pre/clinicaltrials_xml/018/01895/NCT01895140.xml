	<brief_title>A Study of Renal Denervation in Patients With Treatment Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pragmatic randomized trial of renal nerve denervation for treatment resistant hypertension. This is part of a ministry sponsored MaRS-EXCITE program, to conduct early market health technology assessment, in order to determine appropriateness for provincial funding. We will assess the effectiveness, safety, economic attractiveness and feasibility of implementation of renal nerve denervation for treatment resistant hypertension. This will involve a new model of care which will include a multi-disciplinary team approach to these patients. Treatment resistant hypertension is defined as patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite being on optimal doses of 3 or more anti-hypertensive medications. Patients will be randomized to either standard treatment or renal nerve denervation and followed for 6 months to determine impact on blood pressure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ontario residents Aged 18 and over Diagnosis of treatmentresistant hypertension after assessment and optimization by a hypertension specialist following recommended evaluation and diagnosis as outlined by the American Heart Association Office systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg (≥ 150 mmHg for patients with type II diabetes mellitus) prior to optimization by a hypertension specialist Baseline average systolic 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure of ≥ 135 mmHg after optimization and prior to randomization Prescribed 3 or more antihypertensive medications of different classes, both prior to optimization and at randomization, one of which must be a diuretic (a medication can be counted more than once if it acts on different receptors) Suitable renal artery anatomy based on CT/MRI/renal angiography imaging: both renal arteries &gt; 20 mm in length and &gt; 4 mm in diameter without significant fibromuscular disease or renal artery stenosis (&gt;50%) Secondary causes of hypertension: 1. Primary aldosteronism (secondary to adrenal adenoma) 2. Chronic kidney disease: creatinine clearance or eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min/1.73m² (measured on 24 hour urine preferably or MDRD) 3. Pheochromocytoma 4. Cushing's syndrome 5. Aortic coarctation (differential in brachial or femoral pulses, systolic bruit) Type 1 diabetes mellitus Pregnancy</criteria>
