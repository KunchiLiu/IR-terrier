	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the investigational drug SelG1 when given to sickle cell disease patients either taking or not taking hydroxyurea is effective in preventing or reducing the occurrence of pain crises. SelG1 prevents various cells in the bloodstream from sticking together. By stopping these cell-cell interactions, SelG1 may prevent small blood vessels from becoming blocked and therefore reduce the occurrence and severity of pain crises. Other effects of SelG1 will also be evaluated, as well as the safety of the drug and how long it stays in the blood stream.
