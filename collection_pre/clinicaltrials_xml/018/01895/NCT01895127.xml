	<brief_summary>This is an open-label analysis that will compare eculizumab versus Plasmapheresis (PP) and Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for the treatment of AMR in renal transplant recipients. All patients will be evaluated from the time of AMR diagnosis for 12 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Adult renal transplant recipients, men and women between 18 and 75 years of age. 2. Any patient with acute graft dysfunction (elevation of creatinine above post transplant nadir) AND, two out of three, of the following 3. Presence of circulating anti HLA antibody (DSA). 4. Histological findings compatible with Banff Class II or III AMR on transplant biopsy. 5. Peritubular capillary c4d positivity on transplant biopsy. 1. Patients that have received eculizumab prior to enrolling in the study. 2. Patients with ongoing nonacute antibody mediated rejection. 3. Patients with predominantly chronic antibody mediated rejection or interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy. 4. History of severe cardiac disease (e.g., New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III or IV, myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months of randomization, ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring ongoing treatment, unstable angina or other significant cardiovascular diseases) 5. Prior splenectomy 6. Has a known bleeding disorder 7. Has any active bacterial or other infection which is clinically significant in the opinion of the Investigator and is a contraindication to transplantation 8. Has participated in any other investigational drug study or was exposed to an investigational drug or device within 30 days of screening 9. Has received rituximab (Rituxan®) ≤ 3 months prior to screening 10. Has received bortezomib (Velcade®) ≤ 3 months prior to screening 11. Has received alemtuzumab (Campath®) ≤ 6 months prior to screening 12. Need for concurrent treatment with anti thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin®) 13. Hypersensitivity to murine proteins or to one of the product excipients 14. History of illicit drug use or alcohol abuse within the previous year 15. Unresolved meningococcal disease 16. Pregnancy or lactation 17. Current cancer or a history of cancer within the 5 years prior to screening with the exception of patients who have successfully treated nonmetastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; carcinoma in situ of the cervix; or breast carcinoma in situ 18. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the patient's participation in the study, poses an added risk for the patient, or confounds the assessment of the patient Active infection with Hepatitis B (HBV), Hepatitis C (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</criteria>
