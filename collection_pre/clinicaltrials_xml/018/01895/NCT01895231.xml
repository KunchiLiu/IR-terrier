	<brief_title>A Study of Intravenous Iron Isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) Administered by Infusions to Iron-deficient Blood Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present, clinical efficacy and safety data is available for iron isomaltoside 1000 administered to patients with IDA requiring iron therapy. However, there is a need for clinical efficacy and safety data within iron deficiency without anaemia which is e.g. observed in blood donors. Thus, this study is planned to compare the efficacy and safety of parenteral iron isomaltoside 1000 with placebo in female blood donors with a p-ferritin below 30 µg/L.</detailed_description>

Iron overload or disturbances in utilisation of iron (e.g. haemochromatosis and haemosiderosis) 2. Known hypersensitivity to any excipients in the investigational drug products 3. History of drug related allergies 4. History of severe asthma 5. Decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatitis (defined as ALAT &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal) 6. Active acute or chronic infections (assessed by clinical judgement supplied with White Blood Cells (WBC) and CReactive Protein (CRP)) 7.

In order to avoid pregnancy, women have to be postmenopausal (at least 12 months since last menstruation), surgically sterile, or use one of the following contraceptives during the whole study period and after the study has ended for at least 5 times plasma biological halflife of the investigational medicinal product: intrauterine devices and hormonal contraceptives (contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, vaginal devices, or hormonal injections with prolonged release) 9. Participation in any other clinical study where the study drug has not passed 5 halflives prior to the screening 10. Untreated vitamin B12 or folate deficiency 11. Treated with other IV or oral iron products within 4 weeks prior to the screening 12. Treated with Erythropoietin (EPO) within 4 weeks prior to the screening 13. Any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may cause the subject to be unsuitable for the completion of the study or place the subject at potential risk from being in the study</criteria>
