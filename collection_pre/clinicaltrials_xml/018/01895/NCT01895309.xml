	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of SB4 compared to Enbrel in subjects with moderate to severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) despite Methotrexate (MTX) therapy. In some countries, after 52 weeks of treatment with either SB4 or Enbrel, subjects will be enrolled into an open label extension period. Subjects will receive SB4 for an additional 48 weeks.</brief_summary>
