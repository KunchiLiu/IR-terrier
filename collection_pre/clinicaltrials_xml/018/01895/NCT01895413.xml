	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent joint disease, create articular cartilage defects is a frequent cause of joint pain, functional loss, and disability. Osteoarthritis often becomes chronic, and conventional treatments seek to ameliorate pain or improve mobility. However, these treatments rarely modify the course of the disease.Recent studies cell-based have shown encouraging results in both animal studies and a few human case reports. We designed a study to assess the safety and efficacy of osteoarthritis treatment with intra-articular injection of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.</detailed_description>
