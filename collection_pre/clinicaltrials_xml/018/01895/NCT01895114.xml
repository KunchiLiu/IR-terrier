	<brief_title>Assessment of Renal Function in Cirrhotic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Serum cystatin C, creatinine clearance based calculations, and 125I-Iothalamate clearance (Glofil) will be obtained in 220 patients with cirrhosis. Utilizing this information, the correlation between cystatin C and 125I-Iothalamate clearance will be obtained. In addition, the current serum creatinine based calculations and true creatinine clearance will also be correlated with 125I-Iothalamate clearance. The results of this study should help to determine whether serum cystatin C is a more sensitive laboratory measurement of renal function in patients with cirrhosis.</detailed_description>
