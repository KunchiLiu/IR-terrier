	<brief_summary>We determined the effects of dietary intervention (replacement of refined rice with whole grains and legumes and a high intake of vegetables) on circulating Lp-PLA2 activity and enzyme activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ninety-nine patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a control group (usual diet with refined rice) or the whole grain group.</detailed_description>
