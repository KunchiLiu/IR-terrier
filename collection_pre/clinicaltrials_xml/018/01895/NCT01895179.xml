	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to find out what eating meals in a short time period early in the day (time-restricted feeding) versus eating meals spread out during the day (grazing) does to the body's ability to control blood sugar and to the health of its blood vessels. The investigators hypothesize that time-restricted feeding will be more effective at improving glucose tolerance and vascular condition (inflammation and micro- and macro-vascular function) than grazing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each participant will eat according to one of the two eating schedules (grazing or time-restricted feeding) for 5 weeks, have a 7-week washout period, and then eat according to the other eating schedule for 5 weeks. Measurements of glucose homeostasis and vascular condition will be performed before and after a participant follows each eating schedule.</detailed_description>
