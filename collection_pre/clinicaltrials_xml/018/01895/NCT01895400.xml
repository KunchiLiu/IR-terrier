	<brief_title>Effect of Renexin Tablet in Patients With Recurrent Vestibulopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Study design - Among patients who visitied for recurrent vertigo more than 3 months, patients will be included after ruling out other peripheral vertigo through history taking, physical examination, Dix-Hallpike test, head-thrust test. - Included patients will go through permission, laboratory tests (CBC, chemical battery, coagulation battery, urine HCG (only women of childbearing age), posturography. During patients selection period for inclusion(2 weeks), taking medication for vertigo is prohibited. - Included patients will be randomized to Treatment group (Renexin) and Placebo group. - All patients before treatment will do dizziness handicap inventory(DHI), visual analogue scale (VAS) for vertigo, questionnaire for quality of life (SF36). - After 4 weeks(+-~ 3 days) of drug administration, DHI, VAS for vertigo, SF36 will be done for drug compliance and side effects. - After 8 weeks(+-~ 3 days) of drug administration, posturography, DHI, VAS for vertigo, SF36 will be done for drug compliance and side effects. - For control of severe vertigo during drug administration, Valium 2mg can be used as a salvage treatment, and number of valium administration will be checked at every visit. 2. Statistical analysis - As a statistical analysis, paired T-test will be used to compare equilibrium score, DHI, VAS, SF-36. When p-value is &lt;0.05, it will be considered as significant difference.</detailed_description>
