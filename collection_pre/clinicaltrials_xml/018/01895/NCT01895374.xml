	<brief_title>Clinical Efficacy of Bovine Freeze-dried Amniotic Membrane on Wound Healing in Laser Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bovine amniotic membrane as a biological dressing can be applicable to wound after laser treatments. Comparing with hydrocolloid dressing material, which is the most widely used after laser treatment now, amniotic membrane will show better efficacy. Thus, with amniotic membrane, epithelization time will shorten and redness which is usually left after laser will disappear quickly.</detailed_description>
