	<brief_summary>1. Expanding and priming Bone Marrow (BM)- Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to a clinical scale according to Good Laboratory Practice using xenogenic free media instead of the previously used FCS. 2. Assessing the safety of injecting autologous BM-MSCs to Multiple Sclerosis (MS)patients who fail to respond to conventional treatment. 3. Assessing the therapeutic benefits on the participants in the trial as per established methods.</brief_summary>
