	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of delivering continuous negative external pressure (cNEP) to the upper airway as a means of preventing episodes of respiratory impairment (RI) such as hypoxemia, apnea and hypoventilation associated with the use of intravenous sedation in elective colonoscopy in adult patients.</brief_summary>
