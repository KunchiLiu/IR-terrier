	<brief_summary>The disparity between supply and demand for organs has stimulated the development of strategies to increase the availability of kidney grafts. Such strategy involves the use of kidneys with expanded donor criteria (EDC). This is a study initiated by the investigator, open, prospective, randomized, single center designed to compare the safety and efficacy of two immunosuppressive regimens based on thymoglobulin, tacrolimus and everolimus versus thymoglobulin, tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium in renal transplant recipients with donor criteria expanded.</brief_summary>
