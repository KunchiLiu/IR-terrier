	<brief_summary>Subjects being evaluated for suspected or known Coronary artery Disease (CAD) based on signs and/or symptoms, will be invited to participate in the study. The duration for a subject in the study may range from 2 days to 4-6 weeks. One to four visits to the study doctor will be required. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that sensitivity and specificity of gadobutrol-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) exceed pre-specified minimum performance thresholds of 60% and 55%, respectively, and to show superior sensitivity over unenhanced wall motion CMRI at vasodilator rest/stress for the detection of significant CAD. The CMR images acquired with a uniform imaging acquisition software will be evaluated either against the results from routine clinical Coronary Angiography (CA) or Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), which are the standard of reference. CMRI and CA/CTA images will be collected for an independent image review (blinded read).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects aged ≥18 years Subjects with suspected or known CAD based on signs and/or (typical or atypical) chest pain who have routine CA without intervention within plus/minus 4 weeks of gadobutrolenhanced CMRI or subjects at low risk of CAD with / or scheduled to get a CTA for the prupose of exclusion of CDA within plus/minus 6 weeks of gadobutrolenhanced CMRI Willingness to undergo unenhanced wall motion and gadobutrolenhanced CMRI at stress/rest and GSPECT (if GSPECT will be a study procedure) Women of childbearing potential (e.g. age &lt; 60y, no history of surgical sterilization or hysterectomy): use of contraception and a negative pregnancy test Subjects who are scheduled for / have undergone routine GSPECT or undergo GSPECT as a study procedure at stress and at rest within ± 4 weeks of gadobutrolenhanced CMRI Suspected clinical instability or unpredictability of the clinical course during the study period Contraindication to the cardiac MRI examination (e.g. inability to hold breath; severe claustrophobia, metallic devices such as pace makers) History of severe allergic or anaphylactoid reaction to any allergen including drugs and contrast agents according to the investigator's assessment / judgment Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 derived from a serum / blood creatinine result within 2 weeks prior to gadobutrol injection. Any subject on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is excluded from enrollment. Acute renal insufficiency Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Acute myocardial infarction (&lt; 14 days prior to inclusion), unstable angina / acute coronary syndrome, severe congestive heart failure Irregular heart rhythm Condition that precludes the safe administration of pharmacological stressor according to the respective approved label such as sinus node disease, 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block, obstructive lung disease</criteria>
