	<brief_summary>Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) techniques offer a novel treatment approach for depression and have shown promising efficacy. However, there is no published data to date on their effectiveness as a maintenance treatment. This study will investigate ways of using TES as a maintenance treatment to prevent relapse in depression.</brief_summary>
