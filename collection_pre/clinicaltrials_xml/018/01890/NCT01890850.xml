	<brief_summary>This study aims to estimate the risk factors associated with pertussis/whopping cough infection among infants less than one year of age in a United States (U.S.) commercially insured population. The study will utilize a large research data base associated with a geographically diverse U.S. health plan not limited by one geographic area or disease outbreak to evaluate pertussis in infants between 2005 and 2010. Healthcare costs and utilization among infants with a reported diagnosis of pertussis/whooping cough stratified by the number of DTaP vaccinations received prior to infection will also be reported.</brief_summary>
