	<brief_summary>The use of deep sedation may improve the quality of recovery of patients undergoing minor gynecologic procedures. These patients may also have shorter hospital stays and potentially lower healthcare costs. Additionally, the use of deep sedation for second trimester pregnancy termination may be associated with less bleeding, a smaller decrease in perioperative hemoglobin and better quality of recovery.</brief_summary>
