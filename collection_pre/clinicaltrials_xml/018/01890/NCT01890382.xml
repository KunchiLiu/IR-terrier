	<brief_summary>The combination of protein and resistance exercise seems to be one of the most effective tools to counteract sarcopenia. Randomized controlled trials supporting this possibility are still scarce. These series of clinical trials aim to investigate the therapeutic role of protein ingestion combined with resistance training in frail elderly participants. These studies will mainly address the following research questions: Is the protein source (i.e., whey versus soy) a factor in inducing a differential anabolic response? Does dietary protein consumption dictate a whey/training-induced anabolic response? Does leucine supplementation promote anabolic response? Does co-supplementation of creatine and whey protein foster an anabolic response?</brief_summary>
