	<detailed_description>Participants will be recruited and categorized based on screening labs into 1 of 2 groups: Low or moderate risk of developing cardiovascular disease within 10 years based on risk factors. The low risk group will be advised to take the blood test results furnished by the study to their primary care doctor to discuss managing cholesterol. The moderate risk group will see the study physician for 4 visits about high cholesterol. Both groups complete a total of 4 blood draws over 9 months. Both groups will be randomized at consent into 2 groups: 1 who uses the Interactive Cholesterol Advisory Tool (ICAT) and 1 that does not use the ICAT. Because recruitment goals for the low risk group were met, a third group was created: low risk who both the study physician for 4 visits about high cholesterol and use the ICAT.</detailed_description>
