	<brief_title>Study of Changes in Total Cholesterol Levels as a Function of Consuming a Supplement Designed to Improve Cardiovascular Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a food-source nutrient by comparing changes in total cholesterol levels, 44 other blood chemistries, and self-reported quality of life as a function of consuming two different functional-food supplements versus a placebo in a 60-day study. Upon completion of the pre-study screening, and after having received an explanation of the requirements, risks and benefits, and completing the informed consent interview with the research coordinator, subjects will execute a written informed consent. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three study groups. Relevant Background Information. A factor leading to development of vascular disease, a leading cause of death in industrialized nations, is elevated serum cholesterol. It is estimated that 19% of Americans between the ages of 20 and 74 years of age have high serum cholesterol. However, in an analysis of 10,000 test results in our database from subjects similar to those who are likely to participate in this study, we found 37% of subjects had TC scores between 200 and 250 and 10.3% above 250. The most prevalent form of vascular disease is arteriosclerosis, a condition associated with the thickening and hardening of the arterial wall. The regulation of whole-body cholesterol homeostasis involves the regulation of intestinal cholesterol absorption, cellular cholesterol trafficking, a modulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, bile acid biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis and the catabolism of the cholesterol-containing plasma lipoproteins. Regulation of intestinal cholesterol absorption has proven to be an effective means by which to regulate serum cholesterol levels. Ad-Chol-Pre (ACP) is a functional food ingredient designed to inhibit cholesterol absorption. ACP is a freeze dried defatted egg powder containing specific Anti-NPCIL1 (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) IgY. NPC1L1 is known as a biological target of the cholesterol-uptake inhibitor, Ezetimibe. In previous unpublished pilot studies examining the safety and efficacy of ACP include: - ACP was shown to produce a statistically inhibition of [3H]-Cholesterol absorption from 50 ug/ml (P&lt;0.05) in NPC1L1 over-expressing HepG2 cell lines as compared to an inhibition of 10ug/ml with Ezetimibe alone. - I preliminary unpublished animal studies, ACP was shown to significantly inhibit radiolabelled cholesterol. ACP was found to significantly lower total cholesterol (38% ~56%) and LDL cholesterol (46~57%) in bloods from animals fed who had been fed a high fat diet for 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
