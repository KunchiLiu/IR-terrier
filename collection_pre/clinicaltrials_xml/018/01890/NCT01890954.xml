	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to use a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system in adolescents with type 1 diabetes in an outpatient setting, and to evaluate the CTR system's ability to significantly improve blood glucose levels when an insulin bolus is omitted for a 30 gram carbohydrate snack and when insulin bolus is insufficient for the amount of carbohydrates consumed for a meal. The primary objective of this study is to use a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system to significantly reduce the post-prandial blood glucose excursion in adolescents with type 1 diabetes who omit and/or under-bolus insulin for either snacks or meals. Up to 20 subjects aged ≥13 and ≤18 years old will be tested.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to use a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system in adolescents with type 1 diabetes in an outpatient setting, and to evaluate the CTR system's ability to significantly improve blood glucose levels when an insulin bolus is omitted for a 30 gram carbohydrate snack and when insulin bolus is insufficient for the amount of carbohydrates consumed for a meal. The CTR system is comprised of two algorithmic layers: (i) A Safety Supervision Module (SSM) which contains a predictive insulin request dampener (or brakes); (ii) a Range Correction Module (RCM), consisting in (a) a Hyperglycemia Mitigation System, and (b) Insulin on Board controller. Both modules will receive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and historical insulin delivery data. The SSM will monitor the safety of the subject's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII) to prevent hypoglycemia. The RCM will be responsible for optimizing blood glucose (BG) control and mitigating postprandial hyperglycemic excursions through a mix of increased basal rate and, potentially, isolated insulin boluses. To run CTR, we will use our wearable artificial pancreas platform, known as DiAs (Diabetes Assistant) which consists of a smart phone running CTR and connected to standard insulin delivery and CGM devices.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. ≥13 and ≤18 years old 2. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least 2 years as noted by the following: Criteria for documented hyperglycemia (at least 1 criterion must be met): Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL confirmed Twohour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) ≥200 mg/dL confirmed Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5% documented by history confirmed Random glucose ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms No data at diagnosis is available but the participant has a convincing history of hyperglycemia consistent with diabetes Criteria for requiring insulin at diagnosis (at least 1 criterion must be met): Participant required insulin at diagnosis and continually thereafter Participant did not start insulin at diagnosis but upon investigator review likely needed insulin (significant hyperglycemia that did not respond to oral agents) and did require insulin eventually and used continually Participant did not start insulin at diagnosis but continued to be hyperglycemic, had positive islet cell antibodies consistent with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) and did require insulin eventually and used continually 3.
