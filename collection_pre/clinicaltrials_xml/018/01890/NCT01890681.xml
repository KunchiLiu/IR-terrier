	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of a six-month-long intervention in improving the nutrition and physical activity environments of child care centers serving racially and ethnically diverse children from birth to two years of age and the family home. The focus of the intervention will be on center policies, provider and parent practices, and children's home environments that influence dietary intake and physical activity. Outcomes for this study include child dietary intake, physical activity, and two adiposity measures: weight-for-length and skinfold thicknesses. Child care centers and children's home environments will also be measured to evaluate how well they support healthy behaviors.</brief_summary>
