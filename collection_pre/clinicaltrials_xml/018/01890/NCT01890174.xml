	<brief_title>Repeatability and Reproducibility of Cirrus HD-OCT Macular Retinal Pigment Epithelium Elevation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single site study. Ocular history and examination will be conducted on consented subjects to determine further participation in the study. The study will be divided into two phases. In Phase 1, the inter-device variability of Cirrus HD-OCT measurements of drusen area and volume will be determined. In Phase 2, the inter-operator variability of Cirrus HD-OCT measurements of drusen area and volume will be determined. In each of these phases, the Macular Cube 200 x 200 scan and the Macular Cube 512 x 128 scan will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Males or females 50 years of age or older diagnosed to have dry AMD with macular drusen. 2. Drusen should not be combined with other lesions such as geographic atrophy (GA) or choroidal neovascularization. 3. Able and willing to make the required study visits. 4. Able and willing to give consent and follow study instructions. 1. History of retinal surgery, laser photocoagulation, and/or radiation therapy to the eye. 2. Evidence of other retinal diseases of the eye, including wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, or significant vitreomacular traction. 3. Thick media opacity or inability to fixate that precludes obtaining acceptable scans. 4. Concomitant use of hydrochloroquine or chloroquine. 5. Unable to make the required study visits. 6. Unable to give consent or follow study instructions.</criteria>
