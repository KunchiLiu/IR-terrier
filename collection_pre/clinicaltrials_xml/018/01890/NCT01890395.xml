	<detailed_description>The rationale for doing this study is the recognition that mitochondrial DNA Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (mtDAMPs) accumulate in the circulation after severe injury. Furthermore our own studies in severely injured patients identify that the mtDAMPS are increased 3-28 fold in those patients who eventually develop multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) compared to those severely traumatized patients who did not develop MODS. The relative risk of death from MODS after severe trauma was increased 8-20 times in those patients with elevated mt DAMP levels. This study is then being done to correlate mitochondrial damp levels in surgical trauma to assess the time course and the levels of mtDAMPs with the type of surgical procedure. We believe that this information will help us to determine the time course of events and the triggers for development of multiple organ dysfunction seen after surgery.</detailed_description>
