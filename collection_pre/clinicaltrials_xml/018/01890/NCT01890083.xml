	<brief_summary>Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) is an efficacious treatment for Hepatitis C (HPC); however, IFN-α treatment results in a significant increase in depressive symptoms. The aim of this project is to compare two health interventions (exercise vs. health education) to prevent depression in HPC patients receiving IFN-α. Participants will be recruited from the Clinical Center for Liver Diseases at UT-Southwestern and randomized to 26 weeks of either: aerobic exercise or a health education control group.</brief_summary>
