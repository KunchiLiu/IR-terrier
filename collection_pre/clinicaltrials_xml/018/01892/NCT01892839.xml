	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis keeps patients with renal failure alive but does not restore normal health. Retention of chemicals that bind to plasma proteins and are therefore poorly removed by dialysis may contribute to ill health in patients receiving conventional treatment. This proposal will test the effect of a new method designed to improve the removal of protein-bound solutes during dialysis. The effects on blood chemical levels of two different dialysis prescriptions will be tested in patients already undergoing nocturnal in-center hemodialysis three times weekly.</brief_summary>
