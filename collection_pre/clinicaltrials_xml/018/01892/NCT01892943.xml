The survey will collect historically documented visual acuity data for all patients at participating sites with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of LHON. No exclusion criteria apply. Patients are not required to attend the clinic for the survey. Data will be collected in a completely anonymous manner. Ethical approvals and data release agreements will be obtained as required by local regulations.</brief_summary>
