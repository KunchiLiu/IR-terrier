	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether levels of inflammatory markers in circulating blood can correlate with risk for dangerous heart rhythms. Patients with systolic heart failure, which has been shown to increase risk for dangerous heart rhythms, will be enrolled. All subjects will have an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place, which allows regular evaluation of heart rhythm.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to the following things: - you will come into the EP device clinic every three months for one year to have your device interrogated and will complete an EKG - you will have labs drawn to measure levels of certain markers of inflammation in the body. This information will be used to identify new ways to test for risk of abnormal heart rhythms and other heart disease - you will review your medications with the study coordinator and along with any recent illnesses or hospitalizations</detailed_description>
