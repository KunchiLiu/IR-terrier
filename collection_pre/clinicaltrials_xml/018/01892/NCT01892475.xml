	<brief_title>TAKing Steps for Incentives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part of the 4-month Randomized Controlled Trial, participating taxi drivers will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups where they will receive either cash or taxi rental credits for meeting specified monthly step goals measured via a step counter. Subsequently, for an additional 3 months, drivers will be incentivized to wear step counters to test if effects of the rewards are sustained once the reward is no longer in place. Effects will be quantified in terms of step activity; and in terms of changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), Resting Heart Rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), self-reported General Health, Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QOL) and work productivity.</detailed_description>
