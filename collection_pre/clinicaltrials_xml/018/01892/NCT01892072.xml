	<brief_title>VEGF Signaling Promotes Cell Growth and Metastasis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a VEGF Receptor Mediated Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have documented the elevated expression of VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in HCC cell lines and tumor tissues. Another study observed a sequential elevation of VEGF in low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and early stage HCC. Clinical analyses have discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the VEGF signaling in HCC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating HCC growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in HCC growth,proliferation and apoptosis.</detailed_description>
