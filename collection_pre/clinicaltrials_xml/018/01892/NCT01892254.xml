	<brief_summary>This study investigates the incretin effect in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) before and after removal of their insulin resistance by metformin. The investigators' hypothesis is that insulin resistant women with PCOS have a reduced incretin effect and elevated glucagon responses as measured by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and isoglycemic i.v. glucose infusion. The investigators hypothesise that both can be improved when their insulin resistance is removed.</brief_summary>
