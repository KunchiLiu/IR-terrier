	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesise that measuring biomarkers of oxidative damage could better inform investigators on the potential merits (and pitfalls) of CoQ10 supplementation in PD subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of High-dose Coenzyme Q10 on Biomarkers of Oxidative Damage and Clinical Outcome in Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with idiopathic PD will be recruited to a 10-week dose escalation study. Each dosage (400mg/day, 800mg/day, 1200/day and 2400mg/day) will be consumed daily for two weeks. Information on safety and fasting blood/urine samples will be collected. Primary endpoint is plasma F2-isoprostanes (adjusted for arachidonate) while secondary endpoint is the change in the total Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) before and after treatment. Serum phospholipase A2 activities, plasma all trans-retinol, plasma total tocopherol (sum of α-, δ- and γ-tocopherol) and serum uric acid will be measured.</detailed_description>
