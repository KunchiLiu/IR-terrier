	<brief_summary>In a combat situation the need for safe and high-quality blood products is increasing. WB (Whole Blood) is used in many trauma situations, but we wish to investigate whether there is an even better whole blood product. The purpose of this study is to examine the quality of leucoreduced, cold-stored whole blood. We also wish to examine the effects of filtration of whole blood without a 1-2 hour holding-time (warm-filtration) and the effects of forced filtration. We also wish to explore the possibility of using cold-stored WB for production of RCC. Analyses are performed with a main focus to investigate function and quality of red blood cells and platelets.</brief_summary>
