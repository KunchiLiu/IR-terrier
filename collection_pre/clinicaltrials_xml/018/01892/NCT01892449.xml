	<brief_summary>The steep trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery have the potential to cause an adverse effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. Previous studies have proposed that a prolonged I:E ratio ventilation improved respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate whether a prolonged I:E ratio ventilation improves gas exchange and respiratory mechanics in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
