	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer undergoing surgery. Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the impact of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on the immune system in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess changes in immune parameters prior to radiation, post radiation and post nephrectomy. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess surgical parameters for partial or radical nephrectomy post SBRT. OUTLINE: Patients undergo SBRT on day 1 and undergo partial or radical nephrectomy on day 29. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.</detailed_description>
