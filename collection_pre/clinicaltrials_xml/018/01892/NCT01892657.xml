	<brief_title>CetaphilÂ® Daily Facial Moisturizer With Sunscreen SPF 50+ - Human Repeat Insult Patch Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design for this study is standard for human repeat insult patch tests. To test the moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 50+ for the potential to induce contact sensitization by repetitive applications, healthy subjects received 9 applications at 48 to 72 hour intervals of the moisturizer to the upper back. Patches were remained on the skin for approximately 48 to 72 hours. Twelve to 24 days after the previous applications, subjects were patched with the moisturizer at the original site and an alternative site for 48 hours.</detailed_description>
