	<brief_summary>The potential role of vitamin D on disease susceptibility, activity and severity has been considered for several autoimmune rheumatologic diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) . Although, there are few studies of vitamin D supplementation in SLE patients, especially in Juvenile Onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (JoSLE). The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol 50.000 international units (IU)/week for 24 weeks) on disease activity (clinical and laboratory parameters), fatigue and bone mass.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cholecalciferol Supplementation on Disease Activity, Fatigue and Bone Mass on Juvenile Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study 24-week, two arm, double blinded randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation compared with placebo, on activity disease, fatigue and bone mass. Sixty JoSLE patients will be randomized to receive placebo or vitamin D3 (50.000 IU/week) for 24weeks. The patients return to visits in week 12 and week 24 for evaluation. Study will record clinical history, drugs in use, disease activity, and bone mass parameters.</detailed_description>
