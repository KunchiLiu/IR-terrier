	<brief_title>Study of Segmental Renal Artery Clamping During Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal tumor patients,for whom laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is suitable, will be randomly divided into two groups,segmental artery clamping group and main artery clamping group. All procedures were performed by the same laparoscopic surgeon. Blood loss, operation time, warm ischemia time, complications and affected renal function before and after operation will be recorded and compared. The safety and efficiency of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with segmental renal artery clamping will be evaluated in comparison with the conventional main renal artery clamping technique.</detailed_description>
