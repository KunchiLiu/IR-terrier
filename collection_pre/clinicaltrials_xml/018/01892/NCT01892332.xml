	<brief_summary>Epidural lidocaine is widely used in anesthesia for urologic or lower abdominal surgery because of its rapid onset. But the epidural anesthesia using high concentration of lidocaine may cause excessive motor block and unwanted side effects such as nausea, vomiting and hypotension. This is a study to determine the effective concentration of lidocaine with fentanyl in lumbar epidural anesthesia for transurethral resection of prostate in elderly patients.</brief_summary>
