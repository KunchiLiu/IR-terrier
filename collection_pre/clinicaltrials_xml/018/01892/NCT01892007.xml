	<brief_summary>A double-blind randomised active-controlled trial aims to assess whether Cogmed (adaptive) working memory training results in improvements in untrained measures of cognition, speech perception and self-reported hearing abilities in older adults (50-74 years) with mild-moderate hearing loss who are existing hearing aid users, compared with an active placebo Cogmed (non-adaptive) control. It is hypothesised that improvements on trained Cogmed tasks, representing increased working memory capacity, will result in improved performance on cognitive and speech perception tasks that engage working memory. We also measure self-reported hearing ability to assess self-perceived benefit of Cogmed training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Cogmed Working Memory Training for Adult Hearing Aid Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One in ten people aged between 55-74 years have a significant hearing impairment in their better hearing ear (as defined by audiometric hearing thresholds). Yet, it is becoming increasingly clear that the challenges faced by older listeners cannot be explained by the audiogram. The ability for people with hearing loss to use cognition to support context allows for compensation of degraded auditory input, which in turn offers promise for new cognitive-based rehabilitative interventions. Working memory is known to be highly associated with language and recent evidence has shown significant generalisation of on-task learning from Cogmed working memory training to improvements in sentence-repetition skills of children with severe to profound hearing loss and use cochlear implants. This evidence offers support for further investigation into the potential benefits of working memory training to improve speech perception abilities in other hearing impaired populations. This study aims to assess whether Cogmed (adaptive) working memory training improves the listening abilities of adults with mild to moderate hearing loss as assessed using untrained measurers of cognition, speech perception and self-reported hearing ability, compared with an active control (Cogmed, non-adaptive) group. A 6 month follow-up will assess retention of any training-related improvements in outcomes for the adaptive training group.</detailed_description>
