	<brief_summary>Investigators propose to develop methods to improve early identification of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) among HIV-infected individuals. Investigators hypothesize that earlier identification of acute exacerbations through in-home monitoring of respiratory symptoms, lung function and medication usage will allow appropriate intervention to reduce the morbidity associated with AECOPD. Therefore, the investigators propose using innovative mobile health (mHealth) applications to Respond Early to Acute exacerbations of COPD in HIV (mREACH). COPD is a co-morbidity of HIV with growing recognition, but remains greatly under-recognized among HIV-infected persons. In this application, among HIV-infected individuals with spirometry-confirmed COPD, investigators will conduct a pilot randomized trial of mHealth monitoring compared to usual care to reduce the symptom and clinical burden of AECOPD.</brief_summary>
