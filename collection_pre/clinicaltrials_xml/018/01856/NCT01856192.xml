	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well rituximab and combination chemotherapy with or without lenalidomide work in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage II-IV diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Lenalidomide may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. It is not yet known whether rituximab and combination chemotherapy are more effective when given with or without lenalidomide in treating patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab and Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II-IV Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Progression-free survival (PFS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Response rate (RR). II. Complete remission (CR) rate as defined by positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) criteria. III. Overall survival (OS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Impact of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) molecular subtype on outcome. II. Interim PET scan results in relation to treatment outcome. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV), cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1; prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5; and lenalidomide PO on days 1-10. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: Patients receive rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone as in Arm A. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for up to 7 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PREREGISTRATION (STEP 0) Histologically confirmed DLBCL expressing CD20 antigen; patients with transformed lymphoma are excluded; in this regard, patients with composite lymphoma in the diagnostic tissue (concomitant DLBCL and follicular or other lowgrade lymphoma component) are excluded; however, patients with DLBCL in primary diagnostic tissue but a bone marrow that shows low grade or indeterminate lymphoma are eligible; patients with known primary mediastinal large Bcell lymphoma (PMLBCL) are excluded; similarly, patients with known cmyc translocation (by fluorescence in situ hybridization) positive DLBCL are encouraged to participate in trials specifically designed for these patients; however patients with known cmyc DLBC positive are NOT excluded from this study; cmyc testing prior to study enrollment is NOT required Stages II bulky disease (defined as mass size of more than 10 cm), stage III, or IV (Ann Arbor staging); patients with stage I and stage II nonbulky disease are excluded from this study A paraffinembedded tumor tissue specimen from the initial diagnostic biopsy has been located and ready to ship to the Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Laboratory following preregistration; Note: excisional tumor biopsy is preferred; core needle biopsies will be considered adequate if there is enough tissue for the mandatory central pathology review immunohistochemistry and Genomics Education Partnership (GEP); submission of a tumor block is preferred, but if unavailable submit alternative materials Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 Previously untreated and not receiving any other agent that would be considered as a treatment for the lymphoma; for subjects with severe systemic symptoms, compressive disease, or rapidly progressing symptomatic adenopathy, are allowed for lymphoma associated symptom treatment with up to 1 mg/kg/day prednisone, or equivalent, for a maximum of 7 days is permitted prior to beginning the treatment, at the discretion of the investigator; a washout period does not apply No known central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or cerebrospinal fluid involvement with malignant lymphoma cells; these patients are usually treated with CNS directed therapy; screening for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/CNS involvement is NOT required but can be performed per treating medical doctor (MD) discretion; intrathecal (IT) methotrexate or IT cytarabine prophylaxis in patients with negative CSF who are felt to be at high risk of CNS relapse is allowed per local MD discretion; this should be noted on the treatment form Absence of history of myocardial infarction =&lt; 6 months, or congestive heart failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias Absence of history of deep venous thrombosis/embolism, threatening thromboembolism or known thrombophilia; patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis(DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE) or thrombophilia may participate if they are willing to be on full anticoagulation during the treatment if randomized to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone (R2CHOP) arm A; full anticoagulation is defined as warfarin, factor X inhibitors, or low molecular weight heparin at therapeutic doses Patient must be able and willing to receive anticoagulation therapy with aspirin 70325 mg daily prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin, factor X inhibitors or warfarin; patients unable or unwilling to take any prophylaxis are NOT eligible Absence of history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)related conditions (other than the presenting DLBCL) or posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in immunocompromised patients; patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on antiretroviral therapy other than zidovudine (AZT) and/or stavudine and without prior AIDS defining conditions and adequate CD4 count (&gt; 400) are eligible No other active malignancy requiring therapy such as radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy; exceptions to this are as follows: localized nonmelanotic skin cancer and any cancer that in the judgment of the investigator has been treated with curative intent and will not interfere with the study treatment plan and response assessment No history of radiation therapy to &gt;= 25% of the bone marrow for other diseases or history of anthracycline therapy Patients must not be receiving erythroid stimulating agents (EPO: Procrit, Aranesp) RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1) Patient meets the eligibility criteria outlined above Site has received notification from Mayo Clinic Rochester Division of Hematopathology of the central confirmation of diagnosis and tissue adequacy for mandatory research studies Patients must have measurable disease (at least 1 lesion of &gt;= 1.5 cm in one diameter) as detected by computed tomography (CT) or the CT images of the positron emission tomography (PET)/CT International Prognostic Index (IPI) of 2 or greater Ejection fraction of &gt;= 45% by either multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) Absence of comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500 Platelets (PLT) &gt;= 100,000 Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or if total bilirubin is &gt; 1.5 x ULN, the direct bilirubin must be normal Alkaline (Alk.) phosphatase =&lt; 3 x ULN unless evidence of the direct liver involvement by lymphoma then =&lt;
