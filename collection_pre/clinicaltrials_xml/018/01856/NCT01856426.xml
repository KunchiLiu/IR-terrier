	<criteria>Subjects must have chronic genotype1 hepatitis C virus infection and plasma HCVRNA ≥ 105 IU/mL at the time of screening. Subjects must have chronic HCV infection as determined by any of the following: be antiHCV (+) for at least 6 months per subject history or medical records an antiHCV test, viral load, or genotype &gt; 6 months ago In the setting of a recent positive antiHCV test (&lt; 6 months), liver biopsy demonstrating chronicity Subjects must have IL28b genotype "CC" Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg to participate in the study, and must have a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 36 kg/m2. BMI = Body weight (kg) / [Height (m)]2 Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 halflives of enrollment, or within 30 days (for small molecules) whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations. Previous treatment, including the use of any investigational agents, for the treatment of HCV infection. Women of child bearing potential. Subjects with IL28b genotype "CT or TT". ALT γGT, and AST must be below 5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). Serum bilirubin must not exceed ULN. The PT (INR) must be within normal limits. If necessary, laboratory testing may be repeated on one occasion (as soon as possible) prior to randomization, to rule out any laboratory error. Use of drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4.</criteria>
