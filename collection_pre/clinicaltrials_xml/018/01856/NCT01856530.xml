	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the hormone, oxytocin, impacts social behavior in terms of cooperation with others, attention processing, and reward processing, among patients with social anxiety disorder. Based on available research, the investigators predict that in patients with social anxiety disorder, oxytocin will improve social cooperation during an online ball-tossing game called Cyberball, reduce attention toward socially threatening cues during a dot-probe task, and lead to greater willingness to work for monetary rewards for others rather than themselves during an effort expenditure task.</brief_summary>
