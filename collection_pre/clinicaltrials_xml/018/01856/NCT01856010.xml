	<brief_summary>Agitation/aggression is one of the most common and serious behavioral complications of dementia. If the behavior is refractory to standard care (behavior approaches and off label use of psychotropic medications), other evidence based treatment options are not currently available. Retrospective reviews and preliminary studies have indicated Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) may be a safe, effective intervention in this patient population. This study will measure the impact of open-label ECT on symptoms of agitation, aggression, cognition, mood and psychosis for patients referred for ECT who accept this intervention vs. those patients referred for ECT but decline this intervention (i.e. standard care controls). It will also assess adverse events, activities of daily living and caregiver burden during study participation. The hypothesis is that subjects with dementia related aggression/agitation who receive ECT will show significantly greater reductions in these behaviors than subjects who do not consent for ECT and continue with standard care. Pine Rest is partnering with McLean Hospital (Massachusetts) to answer this question. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine whether patients receiving ECT or standard care differ in reduction of aggression and agitation symptom severity and changes in cognition pre- and post- treatment.</brief_summary>

A therapeutic decision will have already been made by the treating psychiatrist in consultation with the ECT team to use ECT treatment for agitation and aggression associated with dementia, with or without depression/mania. Patients will be included in the ECT treatment group if their legal representative consents to ECT treatment. Patients whose legal representative does not consent to ECT treatment will be included in the Standard Care (NonECT) treatment group.
