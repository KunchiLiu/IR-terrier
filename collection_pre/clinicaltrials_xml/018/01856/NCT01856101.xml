	<brief_summary>The mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) protein is the center of the mTOR pathway that plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation, survival and angiogenesis through sensing and integrating energetic signals from cellular environment. The mTOR protein is composed of two complex, mTOR complex 1 (mTOR C1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTOR C2). In regards of mTOR pathway dysregulations observed in TCC development, there is a rational to test BEZ23 in advanced TCC. BEZ235 is a pan-class I PI3K inhibitor that, in addition, binds to the catalytic site of mTOR, inhibiting mTOR C1 and mTOR C2.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed locally advanced or metastatic TCC not amenable to curative surgery or radiation. 2. Documented disease progression (according RECIST 1.1 criteria) after first line platinumbased therapy (given in neoadjuvant/adjuvant or palliative setting). 3. An interval of &gt;4 weeks since last anticancer treatment. 4. Archival paraffinembedded tumor tissue (block or at least 20 unstained slides) of the primary tumor and/or metastases. The most recent archival tissue is mandatory. Recidive of the disease should lead to perform if possible novel biopsies, as major oncogenic differences are found between primary tumor and secondary lesions. 5. At least one measurable lesion by MRI or CTscan 6. ECOG performance status 01, in stable medical condition 7. Patients must have adequate organ function: Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/100 ml, neutrophils ≥ 1,000/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm, INR ≤ 1.5, total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN (or &lt;5.0 x ULN if hepatic metastases are present), creatinine £1.5 x ULN, fasting plasma glucose &lt;140mg/dl, HbA1c &lt; 8%. 8. Patients must be over 18 years old and able to give written informed consent. 9. Signed informed consent prior to beginning protocol specific procedure 1. Non TCC bladder cancer 2. More than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens given for palliation. 3. Concurrent malignancy or previous malignancy in the last 3 years prior to start the study treatment (with the exception of a history of adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ or nonmelanoma skin cancer) 4. Patient with active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS metastases). 5. Significant active cardiac disease including uncontrolled high blood pressure, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, or serious cardiac arrhythmias. 6. Other uncontrolled medical condition (active infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders, uncontrolled diabetes …) 7. Other concomitant anticancer therapy. 8. Previous therapy with PI3K and/or mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus) 9. Concomitant drugs such as coumarin and warfarin, and drugs known to induce torsade de pointe, drugs known to be moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 10. Pregnancy or risk of pregnancy.</criteria>
