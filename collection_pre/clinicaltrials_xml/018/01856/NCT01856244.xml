	<brief_summary>Persons with Morbus Parkinson commonly develop gait and balance disorders leading to dependence, loss of mobility and a high risk of falling. This study investigates the effectiveness of a sensorimotor treadmill intervention to improve walking and balance abilities in persons with early stages of Parkinson's disease. The sensorimotor treadmill training is conducted on a special treadmill device which is challenging the participants by small oscillations. This intervention, which is supposed to simulate walking on natural, uneven surfaces, is compared to a conventional treadmill training. Hypothesis: Sensorimotor treadmill training leads to larger improvements in walking and balance abilities as compared to conventional treadmill exercise.</brief_summary>
