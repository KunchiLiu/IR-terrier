	<criteria>Males and female subjects of nonchildbearing potential between the ages of 18 and 70 years, inclusive of age at the time of the screening visit. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential must meet at least one of the following criteria: 1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as: cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause; and have a serum FSH level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females; 2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy; 3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. 4. All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations and females that do NOT have a documented hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy and/or ovarian failure) will be considered to be of childbearing potential. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.0 to 45.0 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. PART A ONLY: Subjects treated with metformin monotherapy for at least 3 months at the time of the screening visit; and have been on a stable dose of metformin for at least 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug on Day 1. Subjects must be taking a minimum total metformin daily dose of least 1000 mg. Subjects treated with a dipeptidyl peptidase4 inhibitor (DPP4i), a sulfonylurea or a sodiumglucose cotransporter2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) in combination with metformin may be eligible if washed off the DPP4i, sulfonylurea or SGLT2i for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to dosing. Subjects being washed off a DPP4i, sulfonylurea or SGLT2i will still need to meet the fasting glucose requirements as defined in the Inclusion Criteria. PART B ONLY: Subjects treated with metformin plus a sulfonylurea for at least 3 months at the time of the screening visit; and have been on a stable dose of metformin and a sulfonylurea for at least 6 weeks prior to first dose of study drug on Day 1. Subjects must be taking a minimum total metformin daily dose of least 1000 mg and a total daily dose of sulfonylurea that is at least the minimum recommended starting dose found in the product label. Subjects treated with a DPP4i or SGLT2i in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea may be eligible if washed off the DPP4i or SGLT2i for a minimum of 4 weeks before dosing. History of Type 1 diabetes mellitus or secondary forms of diabetes. One or more selfreported hypoglycemic episodes of severe intensity within 3 months of screening; or two or more selfreported hypoglycemic episodes of severe intensity within the last 6 months. Recent [ie, within six (6) months prior to screening] evidence or medical history of unstable concurrent disease such as: clinically significant hematological, endocrine,pulmonary, gastrointestinal (including severe gastroparesis), cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or clinically significant allergic disease (excluding treated and untreated seasonal allergies at time of dosing). Subjects who have chronic conditions other than T2DM (for example, hypercholesterolemia or hypertension) but are controlled by either diet or stable (for the last 4 weeks prior to screening) doses of medications may be included as well (for example, a subject with hypercholesterolemia on appropriate treatment is eligible).</criteria>
