	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Safety Trial to Determine the Appropriate Dose for Pediatric Patients With Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of delamanid administered for 10 days to pediatric patients aged birth to 17 years who are also on therapy with an optimized background regimen. The purpose of the trial is to determine which dose in pediatric MDR-TB patients will result in delamanid plasma exposure similar to efficacious plasma exposure in adult MDR-TB patients. This is an age de-escalation trial in four groups: Group 1: 12 to 17 years (100 mg BID; n=6) Group 2: 6 to 11 years (50 mg BID; n=6) Group 3: 3 to 5 years (25 mg BID; n=12) Group 4: Birth to 2 years (Dose based on patient's body weight, n=12) - Patients &gt; 10 kg will receive 10 mg BID - Patients &gt; 8 kg and ≤ 10 kg will receive 5 mg BID - Patient ≤ to 8 kg will receive 5 mg QD Enrollment is complete for patients in Groups 1, 2 and 3.</detailed_description>
