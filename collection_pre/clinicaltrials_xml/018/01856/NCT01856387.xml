	<brief_summary>Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a marker of systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. In recent years, it has been reported that the individual components of the differential white cell count, specifically the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts,may have clinical utility in predicting diseases. An elevated NLR has been shown to be a prognostic indicator in various malignancies. İn the literature, many studies have been shown that NLR have predictive value in determining the prognosis of various diseases (cardiac or noncardiac diseases ). However, little is known about the predictive values of NLR in pregnancy complications. This study aimed to evaluate the potential predictive value of NLR in preeclampsia- eclampsia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In recent years, have been reported that the individual components of the differential white cell count, specifically the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, may have clinical utility in predicting diseases. An elevated NLR has been shown to be a prognostic indicator in various malignancies. İn the literatüre have been shown that NLR have predictive value in determining the prognosis of various diseases (cardiac or noncardiac diseases.However, little is known about the predictive values of NLR and PLR in gestational DM, preeclampsia and the other pregnancy complications. Retrospective data were collected for patients who was diagnosed with , preeclampsia- eclampsia, The NLR was defined as the absolute neutrophil count divided by the absolute lymphocyte count.</detailed_description>
