	<brief_summary>This randomized study will examine the effectiveness of two types of pregnancy tests (a semi-quantitative test and a high sensitivity test) to identify continuing pregnancy at home at various time points after early medical abortion. The first test a semi-quantitative panel test marketed under the brand name dBest (AmeriTek, Seattle WA, USA). This urine-based, one-step kit has been used in two previous studies in Vietnam (12, 13). The second test is a locally available urine dipstick (Quickstick one-step hCG Pregnancy Test, Phamatech, San Diego, CA, USA). 1. The investigators hypothesize that 99% of the SQPT and 35% of the HSPT will correctly identify ongoing pregnancy at day 14. 2. The investigators hypothesize that 99% of the SQPT and 25% of the HSPT will correctly identify ongoing pregnancy at day 7. 3. The investigators hypothesize that 75% of the SQPT and 10% of the HSPT will correctly identify ongoing pregnancy at day 4.</brief_summary>
