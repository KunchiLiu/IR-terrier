	<brief_summary>Omega 3 in the form of phospholipids are the main component of nerve cells and their oral intake is known to have a positive impact on behavior disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder. Their consumption would improve brain function while increasing the ability to concentrate. The study aims to determine the effect of an increase in Omega 3 in the form of phospholipids on the processing of visual information in the brain and in particular the attention and perceptual-cognitive learning in a three dimensions environment. Eighty subjects (40 young (18-35 years) and 40 older (60-75 years)) divided into four groups, two Omega-3 (20 young and 20 older) and two other placebo (20 young and 20 elderly ), will in this study, performing a complex perceptual-cognitive task such as the pursuit of moving objects in a 3D space. This stimulus was chosen because it is very similar to the situations of daily life, but also because it involves a mechanism of perceptual-cognitive level. The main objective is to demonstrate the positive effect of Omega-3 phospholipids on the perceptual-cognitive training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Omega-3 Phospholipids on Perceptual-cognitive Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improve visual skills through training and perceptual-cognitive learning could be a method aimed to repair partial neurophysiological deficits or produce new brain networks. Studies suggest that the mechanisms of attention and cortical plasticity have a role to play in information retrieval. In addition, he has been shown that Omega 3 in the form of phospholipids are the main component of nerve cells and taken orally makes a positive impact on behavior disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder. Their consumption would also help improve brain function while increasing the ability to concentrate. The perceptual-cognitive ability is a very high level treatment of complex visual information. However, this ability only has our brain seems to be driven by the fact that the brain has great plasticity. This means that there is a neuronal reorganization in learning new capacity. 3D-MOT, or 3-Dimensional Multiple Object Tracking is a technique that allows the study of the visual system for tracking moving targets in 3D. It is a task of multifocal attentional pursuit which assesses the ability to keep the position of different moving targets from other similar objects. Performance is measured based on the number of objects that have been successfully followed. Previous studies have also shown that most young patients can typically take four objects simultaneously. In addition, this tracking capability, when speed is used as the dependent variable seems drivable. Therefore, Faubert and Sidebottom have shown that young people could significantly increase their speed thresholds. Legault and Faubert (2012) have demonstrated that training with the method of 3D-MOT generates significant improvements in visual-cognitive abilities as the perception of movement of the human body, a crucial index to avoid collisions when we navigate in a dense crowd for example. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the impact of taking Omega-3 phospholipid form on perceptual-cognitive abilities, on the learning rate (curve) of young and older adults. The sample is composed of 40 young people (20 to 35) and 40 older adults (60-75) divided into two groups. The stimulus will be a task of multiple objects or 3D-MOT that consist to simultaneously track multiple moving objects among distractors, all will be presented on a 3D television screen . The performance of the observer (speed thresholds) will be evaluated based on three elements followed without error.</detailed_description>
