	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective open-labeled, randomized study to compare the neointimal coverage at 3 months and 12 months and its serial changes between 3 months and 12 months according to the implanted DES and evaluate the serial changes in the proximal portions of 3 epicardial coronary artery and left main artery including the assessment of fibrous cap thickness and lipid pool for vulnerable plaques by OCT. In addition, the investigators will compare the changes such as plaques and neointimal coverage from serial OCT follow-up according to the different statin strategy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient is ≥ 20 years old Patients with typical angina who are considered for coronary revascularization. Multivessel diseases: more than 2 significant coronary de novo lesions (&gt; 70% by quantitative angiographic analysis); one of the target lesions is the most significant tight stenotic lesion causing the ischemic symptom and requiring the immediate revascularization but the others are significant but nontight lesions to be delayed or observed for 3 months and not requiring immediate PCI for the complete revascularization of all coronary arteries. STelevation MI Cardiogenic shock or hemodynamically unstable status Lesions requiring the immediate complete revascularization of all coronary stenotic lesions Contraindication to antiplatelet agents Treated with any DES within 6 months at other vessel Creatinine level ≥ 2.0 mg/dL or ESRD Severe hepatic dysfunction (3 times normal reference values) Pregnant women or women with potential childbearing Life expectancy 1 year Complex lesion morphologies (bifurcation lesions treated with 2stent techniques, untreated significant unprotected left main diseases, chronic total occlusion, instent restenosis, and vein graft lesion)</criteria>
