	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between body weight and serum anti mullerian hormone levels in adults with polycystic ovary syndrome. For this purpose the investigators designed a prospective study including three groups. The group I is defined as adults with polycystic ovary syndrome and body mass index is greater than 25. The group II is defined as adults with polycystic ovary syndrome and body mass index is less than 25. The group III is defined as adults with non-polycystic ovary syndrome and body mass index is less than 25. The all three groups are compared considering their serum AMH levels,lipid profiles, sex steroids and glycemic analyses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study the investigators aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between body weight and serum anti mullerian hormone levels in adults with polycystic ovary syndrome. For this purpose the investigators designed a prospective study including three groups. The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome was made in the presence of ;oligo- and/or anovulation,clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. Clinical hyperandrogenism was defined by the presence of hirsutism , acne, or the presence of androgenic alopecia , biochemical hyperandrogenemia was defined as a serum level of total testosterone higher than 2.60 nmol/L, body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. The patients were classified as obese with BMI â‰¥ 25 kg/m2 , adolescent patients were diagnosed 2 years after menarche in order to avoid the misdiagnosis of transitory functional hyperandrogenism and menstrual disorders during puberty. The all three groups are compared considering their serum AMH levels,lipid profiles, sex steroids and glycemic analyses.</detailed_description>
