	<brief_summary>These pilot studies are designed as open label studies to investigate the acceptability of 200 mg mifepristone followed 24-48 hours later by either 1) 800 µg misoprostol administered buccally or 2) 800 µg misoprostol administered sublingually for medical abortion in gestations 78-84 days' LMP. They will be done consecutively. Findings from the pilot studies will guide the development of a larger, multi-site study to investigate the efficacy of outpatient medical abortion regimens for women with gestations from 78 - 84 days LMP. In that end, the pilots seek to collect information on the acceptability of an outpatient medical abortion regimen of 200 mg oral mifepristone followed by either 800 mcg misoprostol delivered either buccally or sublingually safe acceptable? Women's rating of the tolerability of any side effects will also be documented.</brief_summary>
