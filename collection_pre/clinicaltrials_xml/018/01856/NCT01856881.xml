	<criteria>Male and female subjects ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years of age at the time of randomization Female subjects must be of documented nonreproductive potential Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and ≤ 10% Fasting Cpeptide value ≥ 0.8 ng/mL Body mass index (BMI) between ≥ 25.0 and ≤ 40.0 kg/m2 at screening Female subjects who are lactating/breastfeeding or who plan to breastfeed while on study through 4 weeks after receiving the last dose of study drug. Male subjects with partners who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant while the subject is on study through 4 weeks after receiving the last dose of study drug Evidence or history at screening of diabetic complications with significant endorgan damage, eg, proliferative retinopathy and/or macular edema, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) or macroalbuminuria (ie, ≥ +1 proteinuria on urinalysis), diabetic neuropathy complicated by neuropathic ulcers, or severe autonomic neuropathy with gastroparesis, chronic diarrhea, or hypoglycemic unawareness Significant cardiac disease, including but not limited to, evidence or history of coronary artery disease, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, known arrhythmias of atrial or ventricular etiology, unexplained syncope, or syncope/seizures related to arrhythmia Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg) either on or off therapy at screening Triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL (5.64 mmol/L) at screening Hepatic liver enzymes ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or total bilirubin (TBIL) levels &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening Fasting blood glucose &gt; 270 mg/dL at the screening visit Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibodies (HepCAb) An unstable medical condition, defined as having been hospitalized within 28 days before day 1, major surgery within 6 months before day 1, or otherwise unstable in the judgment of the investigator (eg, risk of complications or adverse events unrelated to study participation)</criteria>
