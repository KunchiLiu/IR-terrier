	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of stent Inspiron ™ sirolimus-eluting and coating the abluminal biodegradable stent Biomatrix Flex ™ lesions in native coronary arteries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DESTINY TRIAL (Inspiron x Biomatrix)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study of non-inferiority, multicentre, prospective, randomized into two treatment arms: I) Inspiron ™ stent eluting sirolimus or II) ™ Biomatrix stent eluting biolimus. Are a total of 165 randomized patients. Patients will be followed for 60 months after the procedure. All new patients will be undergoing angiography for evaluation at 9 months. A subgroup of 60 patients will be evaluated with volumetric intravascular ultrasound at 9 months. Also, a subgroup of 21 patients will be evaluated with optical coherence tomography at the end of the index procedure and 9 months. It is anticipated that the total study duration is 72 months: 12 months to complete the admission of patients and 60 months of follow-up.</detailed_description>

Known allergies to aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, paclitaxel, sirolimus, heparin or stainless steel; 11. Patient with a life expectancy less than 12 months; 12. Any significant medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the ideal of patient participation in this study; 13. Participation in other research in the last 12 months, unless there is direct benefit to the research subject; 14. Coronary angioplasty (with or without stenting) for less than 6 months anywhere in the target vessel; 15. Coronary angioplasty (with or without stenting) prior to any time in that segment Diste less than 5 mm (proximal or distal) of the lesion; 16. Coronary angioplasty (with or without stenting) scheduled in the first 12 months after the index procedure in any segment of the target vessel. EXCLUSION CRITERIA angiographic 1. Restenotic target lesion; 2. Need for treatment for more than one lesion in the same vessel; 3. Need for treatment with three or more lesions in the same procedure; 4. Target vessel diameter &lt;2.5 mm or&gt; 3.5 mm (visual); 5. Target lesion long not susceptible to treatment with a single stent to 29mm in length, according to the judgment of the operator; 6. Lesion of the coronary artery unprotected ( &gt; 50% stenosis); 7. Angiographic thrombus; 8. Target lesion in surgical graft; 9. Total occlusion (TIMI anterograde flow 0 or 1); 10. Ostial lesion; 11. The target lesion bifurcation with side branch that may require intervention during the procedure, with or without stenting; 12.
