Has lesional skin areas of moderate severity characterized by modified local SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) of at least 4, with an erythema score ≥2, and confirmed by a qualified investigator. 3. Has an index/target lesion of moderate severity approximately 20 cm^2, suitable for topical treatment. 4. Is willing to wash out from AD current active therapy prior to entry in the study. 5. Is willing and able to apply the study medication as directed, comply with study instructions and commit to all followup visits for the duration of the study. 6. If a male who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential, agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after last dose. 7. If a female of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner, agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after last dose. 8. Is capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements in the opinion of the investigator. 9. Signs and dates a written informed consent form and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 1. Has received any investigational compound within 30 days, or within 5 halflives of the compound (whichever is longer) prior to the Screening visit. 2. Has a history of AD unresponsive or poorly responsive to topical treatments. 3. Has a history of hypersensitivity to phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 inhibitors or to drugs of similar chemical classes or any inactive ingredients of the trial medication. 4. Has clinically significant abnormal hematological parameters of hemoglobin, hematocrit or erythrocytes at Screening, in the judgment of the investigator. 5. Has a history or current clinically relevant allergy or idiosyncrasy to drugs or food. 6. Had extensive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light in the 4 weeks prior to first application of study medication, including tanning and sun beds or is intending to have such exposure during the study treatment that may interfere with the study assessments as judged by the investigator. 7. Has evidence of oozing of target lesion. 8. Has a current skin complication such as erythroderma or overt bacterial or viral infection for which treatment with antiinfectives are indicated. 9. Had systemic treatment with corticosteroids or retinoids for studied condition within 3 months prior to the first application of study medication. 10. Had topical or transdermal treatments, such as but not limited to retinoids, nicotine or hormone replacement therapies, on or near the intended site of application within 4 weeks prior to first application of study medication. 11. Had treatment with systemic/locally acting medications/procedures that might counter or influence the study aim within 4 weeks prior to first application of study medication and during the study (e.g., antihistamines). 12. Has used emollients/moisturizers on areas to be treated within 24 hours prior to the first application of study medication. 13. Has used biologics at any time for treatment of AD. 14. Is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study. 15. Has any clinically significant illness that may influence the outcome of the trial from 4 weeks before Day 1 through trial completion. 16. Has alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values greater than 2.0 × upper limit of normal (ULN), or other clinically significant abnormal laboratory test that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the participant's ability to safely complete the trial. 17. Has a significant medical condition and/or conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the treatment, safety or compliance with the protocol. 18.

This criterion does not apply to those participants with successfully resected basal cell or stage I squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 22. Has a chronic or clinically relevant acute infection. 23. Has a history of depression associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. 24. Has hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias or heart valve deformations. 25. Is an immediate family member, a study site employee, in a dependent relationship with a study site employee who is involved in conduct of this study (e.g., spouse, parent, child, sibling) or at risk for consenting under duress. 26.
