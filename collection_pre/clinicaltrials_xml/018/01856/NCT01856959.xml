	<brief_summary>As a non-selective bronchodilator, magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is effective when administered intravenously in the treatment of the patients with acute severe asthma not responding to conventional therapy (oxygen, nebulized salbutamol, and corticosteroids), which can resulted in earlier improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of asthma and PEF. However, the use of intravenous MgSO4 administered is not common in clinical practice, because it's prone to have adverse effects and side effects such as nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, hypotension, decreased tendon reflexes and so on with this treatment. The aerosolised route offers the advantage of lower dosage, a shorter time of drug being delivered to the airway smooth muscle and lower incidence of side effects when compared to the intravenous route. At present, there are only a few studies about the effects of nebulized MgSO4 in the treatment of acute asthma in children, and the conclusions are controversial.</brief_summary>
