	<brief_summary>The purpose of this preliminary study is to examine the effects of a program that includes two-months of structured lab-based training. The proposed study will examine the effects of a lifestyle physical activity intervention designed to increase PA in people with moderate and severe COPD. The intervention includes a combination of (a) structured laboratory-based exercises with a behavioral intervention, (b) structured home-based exercises and (c) lifestyle physical activities performed at home. The subjects will be followed for a total of 18 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lifestyle Physical Activity for People With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience a gradual decline in physical activity (PA). Exercise training in a structured pulmonary rehabilitation program can generate substantial gains in functional capacity, but increases in functional capacity do not necessarily lead to improvements in daily PA. The proposed study will examine the effects of a lifestyle physical activity intervention designed to increase PA in people with moderate and severe COPD. The intervention includes a combination of (a) structured laboratory-based exercises with a self-efficacy enhancing intervention, (b) structured home-based exercises and (c) lifestyle physical activities performed at home. The intervention gradually transitions subjects from the structured laboratory-based exercises that focus on walking and circuit training to fully integrated lifestyle physical activities that integrate structured home-based exercises and lifestyle physical activities into daily life. The purpose of this preliminary study is to examine the effects of a program that includes two-months of structured lab-based training and subjects will be followed for a total of 18 weeks.</detailed_description>
