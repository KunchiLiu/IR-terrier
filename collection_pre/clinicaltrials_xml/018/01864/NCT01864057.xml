	<brief_summary>Thiamine deficiency causes beriberi and is common in parts of rural Cambodia, where it appears to be a leading cause of infant death. The change in maternal and infant thiamine level after administration of thiamine to either Cambodian mothers or their infants is unknown. Normal human breast milk thiamine levels in thiamine-replete mothers are poorly characterized. The aim of this study is to determine if thiamine administered to nursing Cambodian mothers normalizes maternal and infant thiamine levels. Levels will also be obtained in nursing Caucasian mothers residing in the United States.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Thiamine in Breastfeeding Mothers and Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this pharmacokinetic study, thiamine hydrochloride 100 mg will be administered to nursing Cambodian mothers and thiamine levels will be measured in their blood and breast milk before and after supplementation. Their infant's blood thiamine levels will also be measured. A control arm of American breast feeding mothers taking prenatal vitamins will also be enrolled, to allow comparison of maternal blood and breast milk levels between Cambodian and American mothers. Ethics committee approval was obtained in Cambodia (National Ethics Committee for Health Research #208, 2011) and in the United States (Mayo Clinic Rochester IRB #12-004047)for the Cambodian and American portions of the protocol, respectively.</detailed_description>
