	<brief_title>A Multi-Center Study To Evaluate Multiple Doses of NT100 Following IVF In Women With Repeated IVF Failures (Thrive-IVF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NT-03 will be a randomized, double blind, multi-center, placebo controlled study of multiple doses of subcutaneous NT100 following IVF in women with a history of repeated IVF failures. Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous NT100 low dose, NT100 high dose, or placebo, qd for up to 4 weeks. Screening will include a standard IVF stimulation protocol, followed by fertilization and culture of embryos. If the subject remains eligible, she will be randomized to receive study drug. All subjects will be followed for 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. At Week 10 of gestation, subjects who are pregnant will roll over into a follow-up study (NT-04) to assess subsequent pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes.</detailed_description>
