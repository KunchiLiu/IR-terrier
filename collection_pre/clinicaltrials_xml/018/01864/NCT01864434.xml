	<brief_summary>This study will compare the kinematics data collected from patients with implants created by different manufacturers to see which of these implants provides a more normal-like kinematic pattern compared to the normal knee.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo Kinematics Comparison of Stryker or Zimmer Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A better understanding of knee joint kinematics is important to explain premature polyethylene wear failures within knee implants and to help design a prosthesis that most closely approximates the normal knee. Therefore, the objectives for this study are to compare the in vivo kinematic patterns for subjects implanted with either a Stryker Triathlon Posterior Cruciate Retaining (PCR) Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) or Zimmer NexGen PCR TKA design to determine if there are any kinematic differences between these TKA designs. Each subject will be asked to undergo a fluoroscopic evaluation while performing weight-bearing activities under surveillance using the University of Tennessee's new mobile tracking fluoroscopic unit while performing deep knee bend and ramp up and ramp down activities. The mobile fluoroscopy unit is approved for use by the State of Tennessee on a study-by-study basis after IRB approval is obtained for each study.</detailed_description>
