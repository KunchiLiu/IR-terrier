	<brief_summary>The PENELOPEB study is designed to demonstrate that in the background of standard anti-hormonal therapy palbociclib provides superior invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) compared to placebo in pre- and postmenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-normal early breast cancer at high risk of relapse after showing less than pathological complete response to neoadjuvant taxane- containing chemotherapy. Considering the high risk of recurrence in patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a high CPS-EG score, palbociclib appears to be an attractive option with a favourable safety profile for these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Palbociclib in Addition to Standard Endocrine Treatment in Hormone Receptor Positive Her2 Normal Patients With Residual Disease After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About one third of patients with hormone-receptor (HR)-positive, HER2- normal breast cancer and residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a substantial risk of relapse. The clinical-pathologic stage - estrogen/grade (CPS-EG)1 combining clinical stage before neoadjuvant treatment, pathological stage after neoadjuvant treatment, grading and estrogen-receptor status can be used to identify these high-risk patients. The CPS-EG score was additionally validated in 2454 patients with HRpositive/ HER2-normal tumors from the German neoadjuvant studies' metadatabase. Patients who had a score of 3 or higher or Score 2 and ypN+ disease show a 3-years iDFS of 77% despite adequate local therapy and adjuvant endocrine treatment. Cyclin dependent kinases (CDK), a group of serine/threonine kinases, play a key role in regulating cell cycle progression by interacting with specific cyclin proteins in luminal-type tumors.2,3 PD-0332991 (palbociclib) is an oral, highly selective inhibitor of CDK4/6 kinase activity that prevents cellular DNA synthesis by prohibiting progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase through blocking retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation.4 Preclinical studies identified luminal ER subtype, elevated expression of cyclin D1 and Rb protein, and reduced p16 expression as being associated with sensitivity to palbociclib.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Based on protocol E version 10 dated 12 April 2016 Inclusion Criteria 1. Written informed consent prior to beginning specific protocol procedures, including expected cooperation of the patients for the treatment and followup, must be obtained and documented according to the local regulatory requirements. 2. Willingness and ability to provide archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block or a partial block from surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and from corebiopsy before start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which will be used for centralized retrospective confirmation of hormone and HER2status and to evaluate correlation between genes, proteins, and mRNAs relevant to the endocrine and cell cycle pathways and sensitivity/resistance to the investigational agents. In case of bilateral breast cancer, tumor tissue of both sides needs to be assessable. 3. Histologically confirmed unilateral or bilateral primary invasive carcinoma of the breast. 4. Residual invasive disease postneoadjuvant either in the breast or as residual nodal invasion. 5. Centrally confirmed hormonereceptorpositive (≥1% ER and/or PR positive stained cells) and HER2normal (IHC score 01 or FISH negative (insitu hybridization (ISH) ratio) &lt;2.0 status) assessed preferably on tissue from postneoadjuvant residual invasive disease or core biopsy of the breast, or if no other tissue is available the residual tumor of the lymphnode can be assessed. In case of bilateral breast cancer hormonreceptor positivity and HER2normal status has to be centrally confirmed for both sides. 6. Centrally assessed Ki67, pRB, and Cyclin D1 status assessed preferably on postneoadjuvant residual invasive disease of the breast, or if not possible, of residual nodal invasion or core biopsy. In case of bilateral breast cancer, tumor tissue of both sides needs to be assessable. 7. Patients must have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy of at least 16 weeks. This period must include 6 weeks of a taxane containing neoadjuvant therapy (Exception: For patients with progressive disease that occurred after at least 6 weeks of taxanecontaining neoadjuvant treatment, a total treatment period of less than 16 weeks is also eligible). 8. Adequate surgical treatment including resection of all clinically evident disease and ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection. Histologically complete resection (R0) of the invasive and ductal in situ tumor is required in case of breast conserving surgery as the final treatment. No evidence of gross residual disease (R2) is required after total mastectomy (R1 resection is acceptable). Axillary dissection is not required in patients with a negative sentinelnode biopsy before (pN0, pN+(mic)) or after (ypN0, ypN+(mic) neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 9. Less than 16 weeks interval since the date of final surgery or less than 10 weeks from completing radiotherapy (whichever occurs last) and date of randomization. 10. Completion of adjuvant radiotherapy according to standard guidelines (e.g. AGO Mamma, NCCN) is strongly recommended. If radiotherapy is not performed the reason for this needs to be documented in the eCRF. 11. No clinical evidence for locoregional or distant relapse during or after preoperative chemotherapy. Local progression during chemotherapy is not an exclusion criterion. 12. A clinicalpathologic stage estrogen/grade (CPSEG) score of ≥3, or score 2 if nodal status at surgery is ypN+, calculated using local estrogen receptor status and grade assessed on either core biopsies taken before start of neoadjuvant treatment or surgical specimen (see chapter 21.1). 13. Age at diagnosis at least 18 years. 14. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1 (see Appendix 21.2). 15. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti cancer therapy or surgical procedures to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 Grade ≤1 (except alopecia or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion). 16. Estimated life expectancy of at least 5 years irrespective of the diagnosis of breast cancer. 17. The patient must be accessible for scheduled visits, treatment and followup. Patients registered on this trial must be treated at the participating center which could be the Principal or a Co investigator's site. Exclusion Criteria 1. Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to compounds similar to palbociclib or palbociclib/placebo excipients or to endocrine treatments. 2. Inadequate organ function immediate prior to randomization including: Hemoglobin &lt;10g/dL (100g/L); ANC &lt; 2000/mm³ (&lt; 2.0 x 109/L); Platelets &lt;100,000/mm³ (&lt; 100 x 109/L); AST or ALT &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN, total serum bilirubin &gt; 1.25 x ULN; serum creatinine &gt;1.25 x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min as calculated using the method standard for the institution; severe and relevant comorbidity that would interact with the participation in the study 3. Evidence for infection including wound infections, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or any type of Hepatitis 4. QTc &gt;480 msec 5. Uncontrolled electrolyte disorders (eg, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypo¬magnesemia). 6. Any of the following within 6 months of randomization: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE version 4.0 Grade ≥2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack, or symptomatic pulmonary embolism. 7. Active inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, or any upper gastrointestinal surgery including gastric resection. 8. Prior malignancy (including invasive or ductal insitu breast cancer) within 5 years prior to randomization, except curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 9. Current severe acute or uncontrolled chronic systemic disease (e.g. diabetes mellitus) or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. 10. Recent (within the past year) or active suicidal behavior. 11. Pregnancy or lactation period. Women of childbearing potential must implement adequate nonhormonal contraceptive measures (barrier methods, intrauterine contraceptive devices, sterilization) during study treatment and for 90 days after discontinuation. A serum pregnancy test must be negative in premenopausal women or women with amenorrhea of less than 12 months. 12. Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to randomization. 13. 10 weeks or more have passed since completion of radiotherapy at day of randomization. 14. Prior treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor. 15. Patients treated within the last 7 days prior to randomization and/or concurrent use of drugs known to be strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (see appendix 21.3) 16. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational not marketed drug within 30 days prior to randomization. 17.
