Subject has had prior prostatic surgery including TUNA, TURP, TUIP, laser treatment, thermotherapy, balloon dilatation, prosthesis, and ultrasound ablation within 3 months of screening 9. Participation in any investigational or marketed drug trial within 30 days prior to screening or anytime during the study period. This includes any interventional or exercise trials 10.
