	<brief_summary>The primary goal in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is to reperfuse the ischemic myocardium to reduce infarct size. Animal data and human data suggest that whole-body cooling to temperatures below 35°C before revascularisation can additionally reduce infarct size and therefore improves outcome in these patients. The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility and safety of a combined cooling strategy started in the out-of-hospital arena for achieving pre-reperfusion hypothermia in patients with acute st-elevation myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>
