	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of focused family planning counseling on the uptake and continuation of highly effective contraceptive methods (defined as the intrauterine device, implant, and both male and female sterilization methods including vasectomy, tubal ligation and Essure) during the postpartum period in women who have recently experienced a preterm delivery. The investigators hypothesize that women with a recent preterm birth (PTB) will be more likely to initiate and continue using a highly effective method of contraception when provided with focused family planning counseling.</brief_summary>
