	<brief_summary>This protocol is for a phase 1, randomized, single-blinded study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 5 mcg dose of GLA-SE administered intramuscularly and GLA-AF administered subcutaneously. The second focus will be to detail the global immune response by measuring systemic cytokines, chemokines, and global gene regulation. The third focus will be to investigate the effects of GLA on the peripheral blood immune cells including monocytes and dendritic cells. The results of this trial will generate supportive human data to use GLA as an adjuvant in a dendritic cell-targeted vaccine strategy.</brief_summary>

Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition requiring care of a physician (e.g., diabetes, coronary artery disease, rheumatologic illness, malignancy, substance abuse) that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation; 6. Any laboratory value outside of reference range other than CRP, with the exception of any nonclinically significant Grade I elevations of liver function tests (AST, ALT, direct/total bilirubin), electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, CO2), CBC, urinalysis as determined by the Principal Investigator or his designee. 7. Within the 12 months prior to enrollment, the subject self reports excessive daily alcohol use, frequent binge drinking or chronic marijuana abuse (defined as greater than 2 times a week) or any other use of illicit drugs; 8. If female, pregnant, planning a pregnancy during the trial period, or lactating; 9. Receipt of a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days or other vaccine within 14 days prior to study drug; 10. Prior receipt of GLA in another research study; 11. Participation in another clinical study of an investigational product currently or within past 16 weeks, or expected participation during this study; 12. In the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to comply with protocol due to medical, social or psychiatric reasons; 13. Allergy to eggs 14. A glomerular filtration rate that is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by study team based on laboratory creatinine values.</criteria>
