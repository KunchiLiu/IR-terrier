	<brief_summary>Dry eye syndrome is a highly prevalent ocular disease with an increasing incidence in the elderly population. Topically administered lubricants are the basis for treatment of this disease. However, information about the corneal residence time of topical lubricants is still sparse, therefore no ideal treatment regimen has been found. Recently a new method for assessment of tear film thickness based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become available. The aim of the present study is to assess corneal residence time of three different formulations of topical lubricants, in particular Thealoz Duo® Eye Drops, Hyabak® Eye Drops and Hydrabak® Eye Drops in patients with moderate dry eye disease. In addition, standard tests for dry eye syndrome, such as the ocular surface disease index (OSDI©), Schirmer I test and determination of tear break up time (BUT) will be performed..</brief_summary>
