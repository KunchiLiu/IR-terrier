	<brief_summary>Nearly 90% of all spinal fractures occur in the thoracolumbar region, and burst fractures are composed of 15% of such injuries. But the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial. Treatment varies from the conservative management to various types of surgery. Internal fixation with spinal fusion is a surgical treatment method that is generally accepted for patients with thoracolumbar fracture. In this department, the investigators treat thoracolumbar burst fracture with posterior fixation alone and combined with articular process fusion. To evaluate the result of the two kinds of treatment, the investigators design this clinical trial. So, the investigators compared the radiological and clinical outcomes between patients who underwent posterior fixation alone and supplemented with fusion following the onset of thoracolumbar burst fractures.</brief_summary>
