	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the recovery from copperhead snake bite in patients with mild or moderate venom effect. Potential subjects will receive CroFab antivenom or placebo. The trial is conducted by emergency room doctors, toxicologists, or surgeons at hospitals in regions where copperhead bites are common. After blinded treatment and discharge, the subject returns to the clinic for follow-up assessments at day 3, 7, 14, and 28 after snake bite. The subject will also be called by telephone for follow-up assessments on day 10, 17, and 24 after snake bite. The purpose of this study is to compare recovery in copperhead snake bite patients treated with antivenom versus placebo (no active drug) as measured by the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) at Day 14 follow-up.</brief_summary>
