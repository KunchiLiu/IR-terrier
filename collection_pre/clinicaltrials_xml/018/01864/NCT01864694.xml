	<brief_title>Improving Dietary Behavior Through Tailored Messages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to compare a Web-based system (WEB-DIET) and a computer telephone system (TLC [Telephone Linked Communications]-DIET) for affecting dietary behavior change. These interventions will target the same dietary behaviors (consumption of fat and fruits and vegetables). The behavior change strategies and content will be derived from the same behavior change theory (the Transtheoretical Model [TTM]). A representative sample of ~1200 adults from a large urban area will be recruited through a list-assisted telephone list which will be bought by the University of Rhode Island so that subjects can be randomized into one of three groups: a Web-based system (WEB- DIET), a computer telephone system (TLC [Telephone Linked Communications]-DIET), or assessment only control. The study hypotheses, which will be evaluated both at the end of the 6-month intervention period and at the end of 18-month follow-up (post-baseline) observation period, are: 1. TLC-DIET&gt; Control 2. WEB-DIET&gt; Control 3. WEB-DIET&gt; TLC-DIET.</detailed_description>
