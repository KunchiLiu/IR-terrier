	<brief_summary>Balneotherapy is a physiotherapy technique which allows patients to work out in a weightless environment and which is often used in patients with spinal cord injury. In normal subjects, water immersion generates a reduction in lung volumes. The effects of water immersion on the respiratory function of spinal cord injury patient (who are liable to present a respiratory failure secondary to paralysis) are not well known. They could be deleterious (by majoring respiratory failure)or beneficial (by mimicking the effect of a corset and improving respiratory function). Therefore, we are planning to study the effect of different water immersion levels on the respiratory function of spinal cord injury patients.</brief_summary>
