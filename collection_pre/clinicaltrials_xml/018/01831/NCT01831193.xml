	<brief_title>Effect of Oral Supplementation With Curcumin (Turmeric) in Patients With Proteinuric Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Curcumin is a potent antioxidant found in extracts of the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa L. Different studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent biological activity and therefore is an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of various ailments. This compound acts as a bifunctional antioxidant: ه is capable of reacting directly with highly reactive oxygen species. ه acts indirectly by its ability to induce the expression of various cytoprotective proteins through Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway. Although RAAS blockade is the cornerstone to prevent the progression of proteinuric nephropathy, a significant number of patients remained with proteinuria and progress to end-stage renal disease. Due to the low cost and few side effects of curcumin, this could become an adjuvant treatment of proteinuric nephropathy purposes attenuate the progression of chronic kidney disease.</detailed_description>
