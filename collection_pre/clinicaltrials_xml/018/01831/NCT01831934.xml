	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, will evaluate the safety and metabolic responses to a licensed inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV). This single arm study will consist of two cohorts: MELAS syndrome volunteers (a specific identified disorder of mitochondrial dysfunction: mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) between 13-60 years for OR adult control volunteers between 18-65 years of age. Both cohorts will receive the same treatment: a single vaccination with an FDA-licensed intramuscular seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Responses to Influenza Vaccine in Patients With Mitochondrial Disorders (MELAS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mitochondrial disease constitutes the most common neurometabolic disease of childhood with an estimated minimal lifetime risk of developing this disorder of 1 in 5000 live births. This pilot study will for the first time prospectively assess the safety of seasonal flu immunization in a subgroup of patients with MELAS syndrome. Comparing their responses to those of healthy young control volunteers will provide new information about the safety and immunogenicity of flu vaccination in this important sub-population and help guide the design of future studies that can be carried out in younger children. All participants will receive a single administration of a licensed influenza vaccine. Prior to vaccination, participants will provide information regarding health history and responses to health questionnaires. Vital signs will be assessed. A blood sample and urine specimen will be collected prior to vaccination, and at 6 hours, 5-7 days and 26-30 days post-immunization. Volunteers will be asked to keep a diary of symptoms post-vaccination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria include: Age between 1360 years for MELAS volunteers OR age between 1865 years for adult control volunteers. Control volunteers will be agematched +/5 years to enrolled MELAS volunteers. If the MELAS volunteer has diabetes and uses insulin daily, their control will be an adult with diabetes who uses insulin daily. General good health at time of enrollment Willing and able to sign Informed Consent Available for followup for the planned duration of the study Acceptable medical history by screening evaluation and brief clinical assessment All female participants of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of contraception and not become pregnant for the duration of the clinical phase of the study (approximately 1 month to completion of Visit 4). (Acceptable contraception may include but is not limited to implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, effective intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner). Exclusion criteria will include: Allergy to egg or egg products or allergy to vaccine components, including thimerosal Active systemic or serious concurrent illness, including febrile illness, within the 3 days prior to study vaccination History of immunodeficiency, known or suspected impairment of immunologic function, including, but not limited to, clinically significant liver disease, moderate to severe renal disease, or any other chronic disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the protocol. Blood pressure &gt;150 systolic or &gt;95 diastolic at Visit 1. Hospitalization in the past year for congestive heart failure or emphysema. History of chronic Hepatitis B or C. Recent or current use of immunosuppressive medication, including glucocorticoids (corticosteroid nasal sprays are permissible). Malignancy, other than squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer (includes solid tumors such as breast cancer or prostate cancer with recurrence in the past year, and any hematologic cancer such as leukemia). Autoimmune disease (including rheumatoid arthritis treated with immunosuppressive medication such as Plaquenil, methotrexate, prednisone, Enbrel) which, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the protocol. History of blood dyscrasias, renal disease, or hemoglobinopathies requiring regular medical follow up or hospitalization during the preceding year Receipt of blood or blood products within the past 6 months Medical or psychiatric condition or occupational responsibilities that preclude subject compliance with the protocol Inactivated vaccine 14 days prior to vaccination or live, attenuated vaccine within 60 days of vaccination History of GuillainBarr√© Syndrome Pregnant or lactating woman Use of investigational agents within 30 days prior to enrollment Donation of the equivalent of a unit of blood within 6 weeks prior to enrollment Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with volunteer safety, study objectives or the ability of the participant to understand or comply with the study protocol.</criteria>
