	<brief_summary>Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common condition affecting 3-10% of the general population, especially in women older than 50 years old. It is controversial whether SCH can lead to increased risks of cardiovascular (CV) disease and whether treatment with L-thyroxine reverses these risks. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of L-thyroxine treatment in SCH on lipid profile, atherosclerosis, endothelial function, serum inflammatory factors and adipocytokines.</brief_summary>
