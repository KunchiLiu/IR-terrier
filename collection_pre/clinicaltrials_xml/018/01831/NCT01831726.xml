	<brief_title>Dovitinib for Patients With Tumor Pathway Activations Inhibited by Dovitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a phase II, open label study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with dovitinib (TKI258) in patients with a diagnosis of select solid tumors or hematological malignancies that have been pre-identified (prior to study consent) to have mutations, translocations or amplifications and whose disease has progressed on or after standard treatment. Genomic profiling is becoming more accessible to patients and their physicians. As such, more patients have been identified with potentially-actionable mutations, translocations or amplifications but do not have access to targeted drug treatment. This is a signal-seeking study to match patients with tumor pathway activations inhibited by dovitinib to the RTK inhibitor dovitinib. Pre-identification of mutations, translocations, or amplifications will be performed locally at a CLIA certified laboratory prior to participation on the trial. For the purpose of this study, genomic profiling is not considered part of screening. Informed consent must be signed before any screening activities take place. Once eligibility (screening criteria met) has been confirmed by Novartis, the patient will initiate therapy with dovitinib single-agent. The patient may not receive any additional anti-cancer therapy during treatment with dovitinib. Patients received study treatment until disease progression (assessed by investigator per RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematologic response criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from study treatment for any other reason (e.g., withdrawal of consent, start of a new anti-neoplastic therapy or at the discretion of the investigator), otherwise known as End of Treatment. All patients who discontinue from study treatment due to disease progression must have their progression clearly documented. Disease assessment (by RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematological response criteria) will be performed every 8 weeks (±4 days) after first dose of study drug (Day 1 of every odd cycle), until disease progression or end of treatment, whichever occurs first. The frequency of disease assessment may be reduced to every 12 weeks for patients who have at least 4 post-baseline disease assessments and are clinically stable (except AML patients). Scans was assessed locally by the investigator. After discontinuation of treatment, patients, regardless of reason for treatment discontinuation, will be followed for safety for 30 days after the last dose. All patients will be followed for survival status every 3 months for 2 years after the last patient has enrolled in the study,regardless of treatment discontinuation reason (except if consent is withdrawn or patient is lost to follow-up)</detailed_description>

Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection: acute or chronic infection as depicted by a positive HCV RNA testing (note: in a patient with known antiHCV but with a negative test for HCV RNA, retesting for HCV RNA 46 months later was requested to confirm the resolution of HCV infection). 2. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection: acute infection (HBsAg+ with or without HBeAg+ or detectable serum HBV DNA), HBV carriers as evidence by ongoing presence of HBsAg and detectable serum HBV DNA levels. 25.

Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test. 29. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they were using highly effective methods of contraception (defined below). Highly effective contraception had to be used by both sexes (female patients and their male partners) during study treatment and for 30 days after the last doseof study medication. Highly effective contraception methods included: Total abstinence (when this was in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation methods) and withdrawal were not acceptable methods of contraception Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman was confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the study the vasectomized male partner was the sole partner for that subject. Combination of the following (a+b): 1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository 30. Oral, implantable, or injectable hormone contraceptives might be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and were therefore not considered effective for this study Women of childbearing potential (sexually mature women) who had not undergone a hysterectomy or who were not naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), were required to have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 14 days prior to starting study drug. 31. Postmenopausal women were allowed to participate in this study. Women were considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks prior to entry in the study. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman was confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment, then she was considered not of child bearing potential. 32. Fertile males not willing to use contraception. Fertile males must use condom with spermicide. Highly effective contraception, as defined above, was to be used by both sexes (male patients and their female partners) during study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study medication and was not to father a child in this period. A condom was required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.</criteria>
