	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies idarubicin, cytarabine, and pravastatin sodium in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as idarubicin and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Pravastatin sodium may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving idarubicin and cytarabine together with pravastatin sodium may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Idarubicin, Cytarabine, and Pravastatin Sodium in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the rate of achieving a "good complete response (CR)" after treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with idarubicin, cytarabine and pravastatin (pravastatin sodium) (IAP). II. To determine the toxicity (death within 28 days of starting therapy = treatment related mortality or "TRM") with IAP in newly-diagnosed AML. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine rates of complete remission (CR), remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), relapse-free survival and overall survival. II. To identify biomarkers (ie. changes in serum cholesterol) associated with clinical responses. OUTLINE: Patients receive pravastatin sodium orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-8, idarubicin intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes on days 4-6, and cytarabine IV continuously on days 4-7. Treatment repeats every 28-56 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.</detailed_description>
