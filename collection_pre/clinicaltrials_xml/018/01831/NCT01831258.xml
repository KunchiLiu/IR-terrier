	<brief_summary>Conceptually, awareness of pressure occurs only during wakefulness. Thus reducing the pressure during wakefulness may improve therapy comfort and potentially adherence without compromizing therapy efficacy. SensAwake™ is a unique pressure relief technology developed by Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare which detects irregularity in the flow signal indicative of the transition from sleep to wake. When the transition from sleep to wake is detected the device promptly reduces the pressure to help facilitate a return to sleep. The purpose of this study is to compare adherence and sleep quality outcomes in patients treated by CPAP with and without SensAwake technology. It is hypothesised that participants with SensAwake on will have improved adherence and sleep quality.</brief_summary>
