	<brief_title>Mildronate for Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical study was made on mildronate injection for treating acute cerebral infarction. 113 cases in the experimental group were given with mildronate injection, while 114 cases in the active-control group were given with cinepazide maleate injection. In addition, both groups were given aspirin as basic treatments. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 2 weeks and 3 months, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and Barthel Index score at 2 weeks after treatment, vital signs and adverse events were evaluated.</detailed_description>
