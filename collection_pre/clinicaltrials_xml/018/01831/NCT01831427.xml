	<brief_summary>This is a staggered, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose (SAD/MAD) study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GS-5745 in participants with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. This study will provide valuable data that can help establish the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of GS-5745 in participants with ulcerative colitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of GS-5745 in Adults With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will test the safety of the drug and a system has been built into the trial design to ensure participant safety. Participants will be given different concentrations of the drug (known as "cohorts") starting from a lower dose to a higher dose. Single-Dose Treatment: A thorough assessment of safety and tolerability will be performed before escalating to the next higher dose. For example, the first 2 participants will be dosed in a staggered fashion 24 hours apart. Provided that there are no significant safety signals up to 24 hours post-dose for the first 2 participants, the remaining 4 participants will be dosed. A thorough assessment of safety and tolerability (through day 14 post-dose) will be performed by the safety review committee before escalating to the next higher dose. Participants enrolled in a SAD cohort will be eligible to participate in a MAD or adaptive MAD cohort if eligibility criteria are met. Multiple-Dose Treatment: This design follows the same set-up as the Single-Dose Treatment. Dosing will not commence in the first MAD cohort until safety data from the second dose level SAD cohort has been reviewed through Day 15. Successive MAD cohorts will only be dosed after safety data from the previous, lower dose MAD cohort through Day 43 and the next higher dose SAD cohort through Day 15, have been reviewed by the safety review committee. An additional Adaptive MAD cohort will explore a subcutaneous dosing of GS-5745 150 mg prefilled syringe once a week for 5 weeks.</detailed_description>
