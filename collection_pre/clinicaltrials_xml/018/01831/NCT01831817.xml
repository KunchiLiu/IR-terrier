	<brief_summary>The purpose of this exploratory study is to compare the treatment effect on dentinal hypersensitivity of a tubule occluding dentifrice as measured by Schiff and Tactile sensitivity. This proof of concept study will compare the test dentifrice with three other treatment groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of an Occlusion Based Dentifrice in Relief of Dentinal Hypersensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single center, eight week, randomized, controlled, examiner blind, four treatment arms, parallel design study in participants with at least two sensitive teeth that meet all the criteria at the Screening and Baseline visit. Participants will be assessed at baseline, four and eight weeks to monitor clinical efficacy and safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants between 18 and 55 years of age, in good general health, with preexisting selfreported and clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity are required for entry into the study. Participants will be required to have at least four teeth with facial/cervical erosion, abrasion and/or gingival recession which respond to qualifying evaporative (air) assessment at the Screening visit and have at least two teeth (incisors, canines or premolars) demonstrating signs of sensitivity, measured by qualifying tactile threshold (Yeaple ≤ 20 gram (g)) and evaporative (air) (Schiff Sensitivity Score ≥ 2) assessments at the Baseline visit. Specific Dentition Exclusions for Test teeth 1. Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay in 12 months of Screening. 2. Tooth with exposed dentin but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, teeth with full crowns or veneers, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel. Sensitive teeth with contributing etiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed dentin. 3. Sensitive tooth not expected to respond to treatment with an overthecounter dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator Use of a sensitivity dentifrice within 8 weeks of screening Individuals who require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures</criteria>
