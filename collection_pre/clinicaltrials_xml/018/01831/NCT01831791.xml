	<brief_summary>This is a multicentre, open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 0.5 mg Dutasteride administered once daily for 52 weeks in men with Androgenetic Alopecia types III vertex, IV and V per the Norwood-Hamilton classification. The study consists of a Screening Phase (3 weeks prior to Baseline) and a Treatment Phase (52 weeks). A subject who completes the full course of study treatment and the final study visit (Week 52; Visit 7) will be considered as study completion.</brief_summary>

Unstable liver disease (chronic stable hepatitis B and C are acceptable if subject otherwise meets entry criteria). History of renal insufficiency or Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN at Screening. History of malignancy within the past 5 years, except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. History of prostate cancer before the age of 50 years in a first degree relative. Serum PSA level &gt;2.0 nanogram/millilitre (ng/mL) at Screening. History of breast cancer or clinical breast examination suggestive of malignancy.

History or current evidence of any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical or psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK medical monitor, interfere with the subject's safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance with study procedures. Note: the investigator may consult with GSK medical monitor if a condition could interfere with the subject's safety. Clinically relevant abnormal finding on the Screening electrocardiogram (ECG). Global scalp hair thinning, including occipital areas. Scarring of the scalp, including prior hair transplant or scalp reduction, or any other condition or disease of the scalp or hair, including diseases of the hair shaft (e.g., tinea infection, nonandrogeneticcause of alopecia, psoriatic dermatitis or other psoriatic lesions, or uncontrolled seborrheic dermatitis). History of hair transplantation at any time to correct AGA or use of hair weaving within 6 months prior to Screening. History or evidence of hair loss other than AGA (e.g., due to an autoimmune, endocrine, mechanical or infectious process, or secondary to a scalp dermatological disorder). Use of any cosmetic product aimed at improving or correcting the signs of hair loss (e.g., scalp preparations with claims aiming at improved hair growth) within 2 weeks prior to Screening. Use of light or laser treatments on the scalp (e.g., light emitting diode [LED] lamps) within 3 months prior to Screening.

Use of ketoconazole shampoo on the scalp is prohibited during the study, but use before Screening is not a reason for exclusion. Cimetidine is prohibited during the study, but use before Screening is not a reason for exclusion, Topical estrogen or progesterone, Topical prostaglandin analogs on the scalp, Tamoxifen, Drugs potentially causing hypertrichosis (e.g., cyclosporine, diazoxide, phenytoin, psoralens), Drugs potentially causing hypotrichosis or telogen effluvium (e.g., valproic acid), Anabolic steroids, Lithium or phenothiazines. Participation in any investigational or marketed drug or device trial within 1 month prior to Screening for this study. Including participation in any trial for Dutasteride and administration of active drugs (Dutasteride or finasteride) prior to Screening for this study. In addition, subjects must not participate in any other drug or device trials during the course of this study.</criteria>
