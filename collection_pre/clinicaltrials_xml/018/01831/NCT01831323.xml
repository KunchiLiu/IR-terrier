	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Metabolome in Diverticular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of diverticular disease of the colon has increased over the last few years. Since it presents potentially severe complications (both in terms of morbidity and mortality), the most recent studies are focusing on the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic options. Diverticular disease of the colon presents important etiopathogenetic events. The first is that the severity of microscopic inflammation is correlated to the disease activity. The second is the bacterial overgrowth which is observed in the colon, where the diverticula form "recesses" where bacteria can proliferate. The third is that the "metabolome" plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (and not only). An extensive combination of microbial species live permanently in the human gut and participate in the metabolic activities of the gastro-intestinal tract (such as the synthesis of certain vitamins, improvement of the immune system, and balance of the resident bacterial species). There is little published clinical evidence suggesting a direct link between microbiota and diverticular disease; however, an altered microbiota in the flora of patients with colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and IBD has been described. It is clear that human metabolism and inflammatory response are influenced by genetic information outside our genome. Insights into the influence of microorganisms on the pathogenesis in gastrointestinal function and diverticular disease are in their infancy and often rely on extrapolation from other disease states. Microbiological analysis of fecal microbiota can provide important information on the role that the microbial-mammalian axis might have on the pathogenesis of diverticular disease. Alteration of the metabolome play an important role in some pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract, from Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Most likely, it plays the same role in diverticular disease. In fact, the current western diet is poor in fibers and can cause an alteration of the resident bacterial species, with a reduction of bifidobacteria and an increase of clostridia. This alteration might be present in diverticular disease and the manipulation of the microbial flora might represent both a treatment option for diverticular disease and the prevention of its complications. Recent studies showed that the treatment with probiotics can help reduce the activity index in patients with DDS and as well as reduce the recurrence of the disease. A new method has now been validated to assess the microbiota: the analysis of the faecal and urinary metabolome by high resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The microbioma is the combination of the DNA of the microorganisms that compose the intestinal microflora (microbiota). Metabolomics allow to assess the metabolic activity of the microbiota and its possible interactions with the host. The metabolomic analyses of stools and urine offer a new approach to evaluate the metabolome of diverticular disease, and compare it in patients who take a probiotic, fibers, non-absorbable antibiotics or an anti-inflammatory drug.</detailed_description>
