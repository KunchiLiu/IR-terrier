	<brief_summary>INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT: TLC388 (Lipotecan*) *Lipotecan is a drug product of TLC388 HCl. PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: Phase II No. OF PATIENTS: Approximately 40 (Stage I: 15 evaluable patients, Stage II: 25 evaluable patients) STUDY OBJECTIVES: Primary • To evaluate non-progression disease (non-PD) rate at the end of cycle 6 Secondary - To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) - To evaluate overall survival (OS) - To evaluate the duration of non-PD - To evaluate objective response rate (ORR; where ORR= CR+PR) and duration - To evaluate the safety profile of TLC388 - To evaluate change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at the end of cycle 6 STUDY DESIGN: This is a Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study to evaluate TLC388 monotherapy in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patients defined by age ≥ 18 years Histologically confirmed Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) Locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Locally advanced RCC: defined as a stage . . T3/T4 disease, not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy, with involvement of renal vein/vena cava/peripelvic and perirenal fat/adrenal gland, or invasion beyond Gerota's fascia (Moch et al., 2009). Metastatic RCC: equivalent to Stage IV RCC, according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2. An ECOG of ≤ 1 for the patient with failure of &gt;= 2 prior target therapies is acceptable Documented RCC disease with measurable or nonmeasurable lesion on imaging by RECIST v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria Documented treatment failure of at least 1 prior target therapy (sorafenib, sunitinib pazopanib or other VEGF TKI, bevacizumab, temsirolimus, everolimus or other mTOR inhibitor) for advanced or metastatic RCC. If treatmentnaïve, . patients with poor prognosis features according to Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) risk criteria are acceptable Any acute or chronic adverse effects of prior therapy have resolved to &lt;Grade 2 as determined by CTCAE v4.0 criteria Laboratory values at screening: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 /mm3; Platelets ≥ 100,000 /mm3; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; AST (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal; ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal; Serum creatinine ≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal; Pregnancy or lactation. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrolment. Male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use appropriate birth control (barrier methods with spermicides, oral or parenteral contraceptives and/or intrauterine devices) during the entire duration of the study, or the patient must be surgically sterile (with documentation in the patient's medical records) Receipt of any chemotherapy for RCC Had cardiac angioplasty or stenting event, myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 3 months of study entry Persistent QTc &gt;450 ms for males, or &gt;470 ms for females, according to Fridericia's correction Patients with Grade 3 or greater hyponatremia at screening History of Class III or IV congestive heart failure according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification History of another malignancy, except for nonbasalcell carcinoma of skin or carcinomainsitu of the uterine cervix, and not disease free ≥5 years History or presence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis or leptomeningeal tumors as documented by CT or MRI scan, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid or neurological exam History of human immunodeficiency virus infection Presence of active, uncontrolled infection Radiotherapy received within 4 weeks prior to baseline Use of any investigational agents within 4 weeks of baseline Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to baseline Receipt of radiotherapy to &gt;25 % of bone marrow Concomitant treatment with, or anticipated use of, pharmaceutical or herbal agents which are potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes (Appendix D1), unless approved by the Sponsor Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would jeopardize patient safety, or interfere with the objectives of the protocol, or limit patient compliance with study requirements, as determined by the Investigator</criteria>
