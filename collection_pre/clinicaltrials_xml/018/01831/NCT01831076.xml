	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well exemestane before surgery works in treating postmenopausal patients with newly diagnosed estrogen receptor positive stage II-III breast cancer. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using exemestane may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Hormone Therapy for Postmenopausal Women With ER+ Clinical Stage T2-4 Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will develop preliminary data regarding the efficacy and safety of exemestane in the preoperative treatment of postmenopausal women with ER+ or PR+ tumors. This trial is also designed to develop a predictive model to correlate expression of the known isoforms of ER and progesterone receptor (PR) and the aromatase enzyme with response to estrogenic deprivation using exemestane.</detailed_description>
