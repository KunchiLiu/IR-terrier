	<brief_summary>The purpose of FACE study is to provide in routine practice complementary long-term data on the mortality and morbidity of Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) patients with Central Sleep Apnea eligible for Adaptative Servo-Ventilation (ASV) treatment (PaceWave, AutoSet CS; ResMed).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>French Cohort Study of Chronic Heart Failure Patients With Central Sleep Apnoea Eligible for Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (PaceWave, AutoSet CS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of Central Sleep Apnea (CSA) and/or Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR) in patients with Chronic Heart Failure (HF) is 15-46% and it is associated with worse prognosis. Adaptative Servo-Ventilation (ASV) suppresses sleep apnoea and reduces hyperventilation, and is more effective than continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for treating CSA/CSR. Short-term studies show that ASV improves cardiac function and quality of life in CHF patients. The SERVE HF multinational randomized trial is assessing the effects of addition of ASV (PaceWave, AutoSet CS; ResMed) to optimal medical management compared with medical management alone in symptomatic CHF patients with altered Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction and predominant CSA/CSR. The FACE study is a French prospective, multicentre, observational cohort that will provide complementary data to SERVE HF trial by characterizing CHF population eligible for ASV indications and evaluating the treatment management on long term follow-up of CHF patients with CSA/CSR in routine practice.</detailed_description>
