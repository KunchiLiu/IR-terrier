	<detailed_description>Objective:At present, clinical remission of depression is defined as a final HAMD score of less than 7. However, in clinical practice, the psychosocial functions of patients who reach remission are far from complete recovery. The recovery of psychosocial functions lags behind the disappearance of symptoms.so,we aim to determine the level of residual symptoms and psychosocial factors affecting recovery of psychosocial functions in MDD patients who reach remission, and investigate the recovery process of psychosocial functions. Method:200 MDD patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into CBT group and control group.All of subjects would complete the psychological assessment at 0,1st,2nd,6th and 12th months for CBT group and 0,2nd,12th months for control group.ALL participants would undergo magnetic resonance imaging at 0,2nd,12th months.The scanning sequence is 3D,resting-state,task-state and diffusion tensor imaging（DTI）.During the magnetic resonance imaging（MRI） scans, subjects performed the facial and gender recognition tasks with three different facial stimuli(positive/neutral/negative).</detailed_description>
