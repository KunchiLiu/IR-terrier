	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of the trial is to investigate efficacy and safety of FIAsp (faster-acting insulin aspart) compared to insulin aspart, both in combination with insulin detemir in adults with type 1 diabetes. This trial consists of two periods: a 26 week treatment period followed by a 26 week additional treatment period.</brief_summary>
