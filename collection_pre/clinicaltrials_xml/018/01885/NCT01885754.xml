	<brief_summary>Rationale: With 1.6 million new cases diagnosed each year and 1.3 million deaths, lung cancer is the leading cancer-related death worldwide and it represents a pressing health issue. Patients with lung cancer are more likely to experience cachexia, a severe debilitating disorder causing fatigue, weight loss, muscle wasting and associated with reduced physical function, increased chemotherapy toxicity and reduced survival. This syndrome occurring in about 80% of advanced cancer patients is the direct cause of death in about 20% of cases. However, despite the importance of cachexia in lung cancer, its mechanisms ans its relation with muscle function and effort tolerance are still unknown. Aim: To explore muscle function, signaling pathways and its relationship to impaired functional capacity of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC); depending of whether they have cachexic state at diagnosis. Methods: This study will be conducted at the Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Qu√©bec. 56 patients newly diagnosed of NSCLC will be recruited and separated whether or not they have a cachexic state. The evaluation will need two visits separated by 5 days. During the evaluation the following tests will be done: - Anthropometric measures - Level of daily physical activity - Pulmonary function test - Maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test on ergocycle - Endurance test on ergocycle - Muscle function tests - Magnetic stimulation - Quadriceps biopsy</brief_summary>
