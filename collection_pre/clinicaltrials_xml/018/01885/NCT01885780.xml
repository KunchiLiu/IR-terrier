	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Femtosecond Laser-assisted Refractive Astigmatic Keratotomy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this prospective phase IV study acts to address the predictability and effectiveness of astigmatic keratotomy in eyes after femtolaser-assisted cataract surgery. Within this prospective data collection the laser-assisted Arcuate Incisions are performed by the VICTUS™ Femtosecond Laser Platform. This study will be conducted at Gemini eye clinic in Zlin, Czech Republic by Dr. Pavel Stodulka who will treat up to 50 eyes. Patients will be recruited according to the study inclusion/exclusion criteria.</detailed_description>
