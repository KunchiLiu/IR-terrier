	<brief_summary>Objectives: This study evaluates the efficacy of eScreen for internet psychiatry patients treated for major depressive disorder, panic anxiety and social phobia. The eScreen brief Internet intervention for problematic alcohol and drug use offers self-screening, in-depth self-reporting, personalized feedback and treatment recommendations as well as an electronic diary. Progress over time is shown in diagrams detailing consumption levels. Method: This is a two-armed randomized controlled design, measuring outcomes in terms of changes in problematic alcohol use up to one year after study recruitment. Participants with problematic alcohol use (AUDIT &gt;7 for men and &gt;5 for women) and/or problematic drug use (DUDIT &gt; 1 for both men and women) are randomized into one of two groups: T1, eScreen referral or Control group. Outcomes on alcohol and drug use as well as health-related symptoms are assessed after 3, 6 and 12 months. The hypothesis is that the group receiving the eScreen intervention will reduce their alcohol/drug use to a larger extent than the control group at follow-up compared to the baseline level.</brief_summary>
