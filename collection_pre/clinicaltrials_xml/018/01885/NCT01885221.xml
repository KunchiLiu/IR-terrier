	<brief_summary>In an earlier study, the investigators developed a guidebook that taught women supportive behaviors to help their husbands/partners quit smokeless tobacco. This study will create a website using the information in the guidebook, along with interactive features, videos, and forums. The investigators will then conduct a randomized trial comparing an intervention group (receiving website access and the printed guidebook) with a delayed treatment control condition, to learn if the support intervention can effectively teach women supportive behaviors and thereby increase their partners' smokeless tobacco cessation rates.</brief_summary>
