	<brief_summary>Objective: A randomized clinical trial in order to evaluate the efficacy of a specific exercise strategy for patients with subacromial pain. Hypothesis: H1 - The three month specific exercise strategy has a satisfactory effect improving shoulder function and/or shoulder pain. H0 - No difference between the two exercise strategies (specific exercise strategy and active control exercises). Method: Patients attending primary care with subacromial pain are offered participation. If accepted, they will participate in a three month rehabilitation program. The duration of symptoms can vary from 2 weeks and longer. The patients will be randomized to either rehabilitation; the specific exercise strategy or active control exercises. All patients has an equal number of sessions with the physical therapist (PT) to offer similar attention and support with exercise performance. A blinded physical therapist evaluates the following outcomes at baseline and after three-, six and twelve months: Primary outcomes: Constant-Murley shoulder assessment (CM-score). Secondary outcomes; Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH), different aspects of pain by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), EuroQol-5D index (EQ-5D) and EuroQol-VAS (EQ-VAS), The Patient Specific functional Scale, and Patients' global impression of change (PGIC). Also sick-leave and return to work will be recorded. All patients are evaluated with a diagnostic ultrasound to reveal the status of the rotator cuff. Additional to the analysis of treatment effect on shoulder function and pain, factors influencing and explaining the CM-score at follow-ups will be analyzed. This study is warranted in order to evaluate if an earlier reported positive effect on shoulder function and pain with the specific exercise strategy, in patients on waiting list for subacromial decompression, can be repeated in the primary care population of patients with subacromial pain. There is no consensus about first-line exercises for patients with subacromial pain, and these positive results on pain and shoulder function need to be reproduced in primary care before they can be recommended and implemented. Further, knowledge about which factors that can be used in prediction rules for patients that will respond to the exercises or needs surgery is lacking.</brief_summary>
