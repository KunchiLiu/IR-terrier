	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is verify glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and HOMA behavior in pregnant women with gestational diabetes or chronic hypertension after an aerobic training in cycle-ergometer. The sample is composed by 64 pregnant and sedentary women, 20 weeks' pregnant. Two experimental groups (gestational diabetes and chronic hypertension, n = 16 each) will perform a low-intensity aerobic training in cycle-ergometer, three times/week, for 45 minutes each session. Two control groups (gestational diabetes and chronic hypertension, n = 16 each) will perform an unique session/week of relaxation and stretching. Outcomes: first ventilatory threshold, HbA1c,HOMA, type of delivery, weight and height of the newborn.</brief_summary>
