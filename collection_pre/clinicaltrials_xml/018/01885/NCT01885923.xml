	<brief_summary>THE AIM OF THE PROJECT The main aim lies in the prevention of frequent relapses typical for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder by means of simple, highly cost-effective information technology-aided approach RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS A the end of 18 months study duration, patients in the active group enrolled in ITAREPS will demonstrate statistically significantly reduced risk of hospitalization, decreased number of hospitalization days and reduced direct inpatient costs in comparison to control group not using the program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A RCT Study in Schizophrenia Relapse Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ITAREPS 2.0 program employs telecommunication and information technologies in order to detect fluctuations in longitudinal mental health status of patient with schizophrenia and thus signalize the very early stages of prodromes preceding relapse. This approach opens an avenue towards early pharmacological intervention. Subjects (150 patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and their family members) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the active or control group. Participants from the active group will be completing two separate versions of the 10-item Early Warning Signs Questionnaire (EWSQ) upon a weekly SMS request generated automatically by the system during 18 months study duration. In this group, automatically generated e-mail alert message feedback to the investigator will be activated in case of prodrome detection, prompting investigator to antipsychotic dose increase by 20%. The control (treatment-as-usual) group will not use ITAREPS system.</detailed_description>
