	<brief_summary>The management of patients with Obstructive Chronic BronchoPneumopathy (OCBP) is based on a progression of therapeutic options and on a sensitization to physical activity. For these patients selected on OCBP stage 2, the treatment options include Long Acting Beta-Agonist Bronchodilator (LABA) or Long Acting Muscarinic Antagonist Anticholinergic (LAMA) or both (LAMA+LABA). The purpose of this study is to observe in common clinical practice the benefit of physical activity on quality of life, dyspnoea and walking distance for these patients under treatment (LABA and/or LAMA) and to determine whether these 3 medical strategies (LABA/LAMA/LABA+LAMA) benefit from physical activity.</brief_summary>
