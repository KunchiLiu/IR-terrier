	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to test the feasibility of iSHIFTup (Internet Skin Health Intervention For Targeted Ulcer Prevention) for adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) to prevent serious pressure ulcers (PrUs) and promote protective health behaviors. This protocol is Phase 2 of a three phase project. In Phase 1, the investigators developed iSHIFTup. In Phase 2, the investigators will test the intervention by partnering with Woodrow Wilson Rehabilitation Center (WWRC) to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 18 participants. In Phase 3, the investigators will focus on optimizing the intervention based on our outcome findings and feedback, sustaining the program at WWRC, and seeking future funding for a larger RCT. The investigators will conduct an RCT of up to 18 participants (9 participants in treatment as usual (TAU) group, 9 participants in TAU + iSHIFTup intervention group) (18 participants are needed to obtain statistically significant results). The investigators will meet with potential participants in-person to complete the informed consent process and confirm eligibility. Participants in the TAU+iSHIFTup group will use the program during the study period. Participants randomized to TAU will have usual treatment during the study period and an opportunity to use the program following trial participation. The investigators will collect information from participants at two times during the study, at enrollment and post-intervention at 6-weeks (42 days). The investigators will also collect qualitative information from participants in the TAU+iSHIFTup group, during an optional focus-group setting, to learn users' experiences with the program. The investigators expect participants in the TAU+iSHIFTup group as compared to the TAU group, to display greater awareness of personal risk for pressure ulcers; increased preventive behaviors; and increased skin care self-efficacy and knowledge.</brief_summary>
