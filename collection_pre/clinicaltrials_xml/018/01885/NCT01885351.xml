	<brief_summary>This study involves 3 phases that modifies current Interactive Preventative Health Record-Colorectal Cancer Screening (IPHR-CRCS) modules to address each patient's individual colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) knowledge, attitudes, preferences, and test-specific barriers. The study will engage patients, ages 50-75 years who are non-adherent to CRCS, to assess their CRCS test preferences and corresponding test-specific barriers in "real time". Based on patient characteristics (e.g. age, personal and family history, physician CRCS recommendation, CRCS test preferences, top test-specific barriers), tailored messages/videos will appear in the pop-up screens to address/reduce the top patient-reported, test-specific CRCS barriers while incorporating an action plan for CRCS adherence. The investigators hypothesize that modifying the IPHR-CRCS module to address each patient's individual CRCS knowledge, attitudes, preferences, and test-specific barriers will further increase CRCS.</brief_summary>
