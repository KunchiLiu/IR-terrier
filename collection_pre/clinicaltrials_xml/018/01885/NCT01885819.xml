	<brief_title>Autologous Adipose Tissue Stromal Vascular Fraction Cells for Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will assess primarily safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells administered to 20 patients with disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-resistant Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have been nonresponsive to at least one course of one DMARD selected from a group comprising of: gold salts, leflunomide, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine. The primary objective of safety will be defined as freedom from treatment associated adverse events for the period of one year. The secondary objective of efficacy will include evaluation at baseline and at months 1, 2, 3 and 6 of efficacy endpoints of CRP, ESR, anti-citrulline antibody, RF, Quality of Life Questionnaire, 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28), European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria and immunological parameters.</detailed_description>
