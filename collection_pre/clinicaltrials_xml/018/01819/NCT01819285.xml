	<brief_summary>Objectives I. Compare, in a randomized Phase III multi-institutional setting, symptom-free survival time of patients with asymptomatic carcinoma of the prostate (T0-4, N0-2, M0) not suited for local curative treatment who are randomly assigned to immediate vs. delayed endocrine intervention (orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy). II. Compare the overall survival of these two groups of patients. III. Compare the time to first evidence of distant progression (N4 or M1) of these two treatment groups. IV. Evaluate the prognostic significance of pretreatment laboratory data and monitor these parameters following endocrine therapy. V. Study the prognosis of various sub-groups of patients stratified according to performance status, local tumor extent, nodal status, and choice of endocrine treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically proven, newly diagnosed asymptomatic (with the exception of voiding disturbances) carcinoma of the prostate T04 N02 M0 which is not suitable for local treatment with curative intent (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy). All T stages are acceptable (UICC 1982). The stage is determined by rectal palpation. Patients with regional lymph node metastases smaller than 5 cm (N02), determined either by CT or ultrasonography, preferable with cytologic confirmation. Life expectancy of at least six months. WHO performance status score 01. Informed consent. Patients must be prepared to undergo an orchiectomy or continuous treatment with a depot LHRH analogue. Continuous followup until death if possible. Other malignancies diagnosed during the last 10 years, apart from treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Prostate cancer known for longer than one month before entering the study. Pain caused by the prostate cancer or its metastases. Any previous treatment for prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, endocrine treatment, etc.) Note: TURP for voiding disturbances is allowed at any time and is not an exclusion criterion. Patients with ureteric obstruction caused by local infiltration of prostatic cancer and other evidence of locally advanced disease which could cause fatal complications if untreated (e.g. rectal stenosis, thrombosis of pelvic veins). Patients with palpable or juxtaregional lymph node metastasis (paraaortic, supraclavicular, inguinal, N34). Patients with evidence of distant metastases (bone, lung, liver). Age over 80 years. Performance status WHO score 2, 3 and 4 (any reason). Patient who refuses orchiectomy or longterm subcutaneous implants of LHRH analogue in two monthly intervals. Expected difficulties with followup for any reason.</criteria>
