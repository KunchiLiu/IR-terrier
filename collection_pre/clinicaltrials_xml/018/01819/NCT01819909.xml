	<brief_summary>There are very few level 1 or level 2 evidence studies that examine postoperative rehabilitation of rotator cuff repair and shoulder arthroplasty. A systematic review of level 1 or level 2 evidence studies was performed (Baumgarten et al., Sports Health, 2009) that found only four studies that examined rotator cuff repair rehabilitation. The current study was performed to determine if there is a significant difference in passive glenohumeral joint range of motion, active glenohumeral joint range of motion, scapular substitution, and subjects measured outcome scores (clinimetrics) in patients who undergo rotator cuff repair when treated postoperatively with pulley exercises compared to Jackins' exercises. Null Hypothesis: There will be no significant difference in passive range of motion, active range of motion, scapular substitution, and subject measured outcomes scores in subjects who undergo rotator cuff repair when treated with pulley exercises compared to Jackins' exercises.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study of Postoperative Rotator Cuff Repair Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scapulothoracic substitution for forward elevation is seen clinically when patients have shoulder pain. The patient uses the trapezius musculature to superiorly elevate the upper extremity instead of using the deltoid and the rotator cuff for upper extremity elevation. Scapulothoracic substitution does not occur in healthy shoulders. Excessive scapular movement can be due to an attempt to substitute for poorly functioning shoulder musculature or tightness of the capsular structures of the glenohumeral joint. Pulleys have been used in postoperative shoulder rehabilitation to improve passive as well as active range of motion and develop strength. Jackins described a series of exercises that are used to improve active range of motion and develop strength without the use of pulleys. The use of pulleys in the post-operative care for patients who have had shoulder surgery is thought to contribute to excessive scapular motion. To date, there has not been any study that compares the use of pulleys and Jackins' exercises with respect to active range of motion, scapulothoracic substitution, and objective patient outcomes measures. Due to the lack of level 1 or 2 evidence postoperative rehabilitation studies, a prospective randomized study should be performed on patients that have underwent rotator cuff repair.</detailed_description>
