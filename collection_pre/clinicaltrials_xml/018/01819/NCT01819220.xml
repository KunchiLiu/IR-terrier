	<brief_summary>Recent studies have demonstrated that RAS inhibitors/calcium channel blockers are superior to RAS inhibitors/diuretics for reducing cardiovascular outcomes in hypertension. As such, RAS inhibitors/calcium channel blockers are recommended as first line combination treatment for hypertension. However, the mechanism for the superior efficacy of RAS inhibitors/calcium channel blockers are not well defined. This study will compare the efficacy of RAS inhibitors/calcium channel blockers vs RAS inhibitors/diuretics in terms of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. The primary endpoint will be that RAS inhibitors/calcium channel blockers will be more efficacious in reducing 2hour post prandial glucose compared to RAS inhibitors/diuretics.</brief_summary>
