	<brief_summary>This study compared the effect of delayed-release metformin (Met DR) to placebo and extended release metformin (Met XR) on glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c) and body weight, and assessed the safety and tolerability of a range of doses of Met DR when administered in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).</brief_summary>
