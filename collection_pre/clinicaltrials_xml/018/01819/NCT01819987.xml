	<brief_summary>About 17% of Chinese American preschool children are obese, compared to 12.4%of all children from age three to five years residing in the US; the prevalence of obesity is expected to increase in the future. Therefore, the proposed study will adapt a home-based and technology-centered childhood obesity prevention program for low-income Chinese American mothers of children three to five years old. The aims of the study are to assess the feasibility of the intervention and estimate the effect sizes on children's and mothers' outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HomeTech Healthy Lifestyle Program for Mothers With Young Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to adapt and implement a family-centered and technology-based intervention to prevent obesity in young Chinese American children from low-income families with overweight mothers. The proposed study framework is based on the Information Motivation Behavioral Skills Model, which includes the mothers' gained knowledge/information, increased personal and social motivators, and acquired behavioral skills towards behavioral changes. The intervention will be developed with a Community Advisory Committee and validated for cultural appropriateness through a beta-testing process. The validated intervention will be implemented thereafter. Eligible overweight mothers with young Chinese American children (ages three to five years) will be recruited from local day care settings, low-income housing and Head Start programs to participate in the study. Participants will be randomized into either the intervention (N=15) or control group (N=15). Participants in the intervention group will receive the 8-week online interactive sessions and activities delivered through tablet computers. Participants in the control group will receive general health promotion topics relevant to preschool-age children via mailing materials weekly for eight weeks.</detailed_description>
