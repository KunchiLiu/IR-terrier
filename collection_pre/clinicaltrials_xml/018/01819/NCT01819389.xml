	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if low-dose imatinib and nilotinib combination, will improve treatment results in CML patients with failure, suboptimal response or intolerance to imatinib therapy. The hypothesis is that with low-dose imatinib and nilotinib combination, major molecular response will be achieved in patients not previously obtained with imatinib monotherapy.</brief_summary>
