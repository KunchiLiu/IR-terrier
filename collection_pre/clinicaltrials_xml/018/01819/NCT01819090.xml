	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation is one of the only treatment that has improved survival of patients with neuromuscular respiratory failure. As disease progresses, some patients may require longer ventilation period. Non invasive mechanical ventilation is the preferred method of ventilation but it may interfere with speech and communication of patients who require ventilation throughout the day. The investigators are evaluating the effect on speech and communication of a ventilation device which allows patients to momentarily and voluntarily withhold ventilation if they want to speak. This should allow the patients to have a more fluid speech.</brief_summary>
