	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to quantify the association between tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) during the donor management phase of the Death by Neurological Criteria (DNC) organ donor and the number of organs transplanted per donor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Organ Donor Tissue Oxygen Saturation as a Predictor of Number of Organs to Transplant Per Donor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically the study aims to: 1. Evaluate the association between StO2 level in the DNC organ donor and the number of organs transplanted per donor; 2. Evaluate whether or not tissue perfusion in the DNC organ donor population correlates with currently measured macro-hemodynamic variables during the donor management phase. 3. Assess if StO2 in the DNC organ donor is related to the number of organs with normal end-organ function, and with the number of organs predicted to be transplanted using the organ donor calculator. 4. Assess if StO2 in the DNC organ donor is related with intravenous thyroid hormone treatment. Investigators will conduct an observational study, including 60 DNC organ donors, in Lifebanc's Donor Service Area (DSA). Investigators will monitor and record blindly the StO2 with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in the DNC organ donor from the beginning of the OPO (Organ Procurement Organization) organ donor management period until cardiac arrest in the operating room at the time of recovery.</detailed_description>
