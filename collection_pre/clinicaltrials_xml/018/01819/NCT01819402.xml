	<brief_summary>Excess visceral fat is associated with chronic systemic inflammation and cardiovascular complications. Pioglitazone has been reported to variably influence visceral fat volume, but it its effect on metabolic activity of the visceral fat remains uncharacterized. To evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on glucose metabolism of fat tissue by using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) imaging.</brief_summary>
