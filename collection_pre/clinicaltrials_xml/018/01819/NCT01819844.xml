	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test an experimental medical device designed to automatically control blood sugar. This device was designed for use by patients with diabetes while they are in the hospital, and others who may develop high blood sugar as a result of their medical problems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inpatient Closed-loop Glucose Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this first-in-man trial is to test the safety and efficacy of the automated, closed-loop control system in insulin sensitive subjects with type 1 diabetes, insulin sensitive subjects with type 2 diabetes (TTD &gt; 1u/kg/day), and subjects with type 2 diabetes and substantial insulin resistance (&lt;2 u/kg/day). The results of this study will help to design future studies, exploring the use of the closed-loop system for BG control in hospitalized patients, including those with diabetes or hyperglycemia of critical illness.</detailed_description>
