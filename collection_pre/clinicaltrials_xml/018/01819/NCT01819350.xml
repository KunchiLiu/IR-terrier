	<brief_title>In Vivo Study of Sucrose and Liquid Oral Pediatric Medicines of Long-term Effect on Dental Biofilm pH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Te study was carried out with 12 subjects that were refrained from brushing their teeth for 28 h and did not eat or drink for at least 3 h prior to each appointment. Dental biofilm pH was measured in the cervical and proximal regions of anterior teeth with beetrode-type microelectrode coupled to a potentiometer. The biofilm was submitted nine paediatric medicines a long term and sucrose (negative control). pH measurements were taken at baseline to determine resting plaque pH and at time interval 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes.</detailed_description>
