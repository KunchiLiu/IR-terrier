	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well desipramine hydrochloride and filgrastim works for stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing stem cell transplant. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim, and other drugs, such as desipramine hydrochloride, helps stem cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Desipramine Hydrochloride and Filgrastim For Stem Cell Mobilization in Patients With Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study efficacy, safety, harvest kinetics and engraftment kinetics of patients undergoing autologous stem cell mobilization, mobilized with a combination of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) (filgrastim) with desipramine (desipramine hydrochloride) (G+D). II. To analyze polymorphisms of adrenergic receptor beta 2 (ADRB2) and adrenergic receptor beta 3 (ADRB3) genes that correlate with mobilization efficiency. OUTLINE: Patients receive desipramine hydrochloride orally (PO) daily on days -3 to +4 and filgrastim PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-4. Stem cell collection begins on day 6. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 1 week after completion of stem cell collection.</detailed_description>
