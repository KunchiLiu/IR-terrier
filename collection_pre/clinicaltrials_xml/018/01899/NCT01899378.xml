	<brief_summary>Here the investigators propose to preliminarily investigate the safety and effects of probiotics in infants in Bangladesh through a pilot randomized clinical trial. The investigators hypothesize that two probiotics are safe for infants in Bangladesh and may have an effect on biomarkers of gut health and immunity. The specific aims of this pilot are: i) to confirm the safety of administering probiotic strains to infants in low-income countries, ii) to determine the effects of dosing frequency on colonization and persistence of probiotics in the GI tract, iii) to measure markers of intestinal and immune function and microbiota structure.</brief_summary>
