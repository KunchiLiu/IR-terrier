	<brief_summary>The effectiveness of surgical fundoplication in treating classical reflux symptoms is well documented, but the role of surgery in alleviating extra-esophageal symptoms allegedly secondary to gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GORD) is far to be assessed. The effectiveness of anti-reflux surgery on extra-esophageal reflux symptoms varies from 15% to 95%; the spread of these data is largely attributable to disparate study design and methodology, patient selection, and outcome metrics. In order to assess whether anti-reflux surgery may have beneficial effects on chronic cough allegedly secondary to GERD and to eventually identify the preoperative clinical profile which could predict those positive effects, we considered two groups of patients presenting with 1) GERD associated to chronic cough, 2), typical GERD who underwent anti-reflux surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-operatively, patients routinely underwent the symptoms assessment, barium swallow, upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy and esophageal manometry. The type and severity of symptoms and the grade of reflux oesophagitis were scored using a questionnaire with semi-quantitative scales. The upper gastro-intestinal (GI) endoscopy, barium swallow and esophageal manometry were performed according to standard techniques; reflux esophagitis was reported according to the Los Angeles classification. In the absence of Los Angeles grade A or higher esophagitis, patient underwent a 24h pH-recording or intraluminal impedance/pH monitoring. Patients complaining of chronic cough were submitted to a specific work-up consisting of a chest High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan, methacholine challenge test and spirometry in order to exclude pulmonary diseases. Surgery was performed in patients negative for pulmonary diseases on chest HRCT scan, on methacholine challenge test and spirometry, in consideration of the fact that patients had been referred mainly for the therapy of chronic cough. The study was started in 1995 and it was closed in 2010.</detailed_description>
