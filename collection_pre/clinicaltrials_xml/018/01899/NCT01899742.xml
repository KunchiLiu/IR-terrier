	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder (62.5/25 mcg) once-daily with tiotropium (18 mcg) once-daily over 12 weeks for the treatment of subjects with COPD who have received tiotropium and continue to have symptoms while on tiotropium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Purpose of the This Study is to Evaluate the Spirometric Effect (Trough FEV1) of Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg Once Daily Compared With Tiotropium 18mcg Once Daily Over a a 12-week Treatment Period in Subjects With COPD Who Continue to Have Symptoms on Tiotropium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase IIIb multicentre, randomized, blinded, double-dummy, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder (62.5/25 mcg) when administered once-daily via ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) [note: the ELLIPTA DPI may also be referred to as the Novel DPI (NDPI) or the DPI] compared with tiotropium (18 mcg) administered once-daily via the HandiHaler over a treatment period of 12 weeks in subjects with COPD who continue to have symptoms while on tiotropium. The target population of the study will include those subjects who continue to have symptoms while on tiotropium. The study will screen approximately 650 subjects who continue to have symptoms whilst on tiotropium. After a 4 week run-in period on open label tiotropium, those subjects who continue to have symptoms and have adhered to the treatment schedule will progress into the treatment phase. At the end of the run-in phase approximately 490 subjects will be randomised 1:1 to UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder (62.5/25 mcg), or tiotropium (18 mcg). During the treatment phase, each subject will receive two inhalers, a preloaded ELLIPTA DPI and a HandiHaler dry powder inhaler with capsules, for once-daily administration of one active treatment and one placebo treatment for 12 weeks. There will be a total of 8 study visits. Subjects will sign the informed consent form (ICF) at either Visit 0 or Visit 1 and will be assigned a subject identifier. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will enter the open label tiotropium run-in phase. After 4 weeks all subjects will be reviewed (Visit 2) and if they satisfy the randomisation criteria they will be randomised and enter the treatment phase. After Visit 2, there will be a further 6 study clinic visits. Further visits are scheduled at Day 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 12 +1 day (Visits 3 to 7 respectively). Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) will be obtained at all clinic visits. Trough FEV₁and trough FVC will be performed at Visit 3 and Visit 7. Pre-dose and post dose FEV₁and FVC measurement at 5 and 15 mins and 1 and 3 hrs will also be performed at Visit 2, Visit 4, Visit 5 and Visit 6. At selected study sites, a subset of approximately 200 subjects will perform 24-hour serial spirometry at Visit 2 and Visit 6 for evaluation of lung function over the dosing period. An assessment of dyspnea will be obtained using the Baseline and Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI). At Visit 2, the severity of dyspnea at baseline will be assessed using the BDI. Change from baseline will be assessed using the TDI at Visit 4, Visit 5 and Visit 6. In addition to the baseline assessment at Visit 2, health status will be captured using the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQ-C) scale at Visit 4 and Visit 6. The impact of COPD on the subject's wellbeing and daily life will be measured using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and the the Euroqol-5D (EQ5D).. In addition to the baseline assessment at Visit 2, the CAT and the EQ-5D will also completed at Visit 4 and Visit 6. Furthermore, the CAT is also completed during screening. The Patient Global Rating of COPD Severity and Change of COPD Severity is a selfreported global assessment of severity of illness will be performed at Baseline during Visit 2 and at Visit 4 and Visit 6. Visits 0/1 through 7 will be clinic visits conducted on an outpatient basis. A safety Follow-Up assessment (Visit 8) will be conducted either by phone call or clinic visit where required approximately 7 days after the end of the study treatment (Visit 7 or Early Withdrawal, if applicable). The total duration of subject participation, including follow-up, will be approximately 18 weeks. All subjects will be provided with albuterol/salbutamol for use on an "as-needed" basis throughout the run-in and study treatment periods. For determination of subject disposition, subjects will be considered to have completed the study upon completion of Visit 7 (the last on-treatment clinic visit). There are no plans for compassionate use of the study medications.</detailed_description>

Gender: Male or female subjects. A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is postmenopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Postmenopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, &gt;45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy. OR Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of the following acceptable contraceptive methods used consistently and correctly (i.e. in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study screening to followup contact): Abstinence Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen Implants of levonorgestrel Estrogenic vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patches Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria as stated in the product label Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. For this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records. Double barrier method: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) Bronchodilator Treatment: Subjects must have been prescribed tiotropium either via the HandiHaler device or Respimat for at least 3 months prior to screening (Visit 1).

Previous smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate packyear history Severity of Disease: A pre and postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV₁/FVC ratio of &lt;0.70 and postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV₁ of ≤70% and ≥50% predicted normal values calculated using reference equations at Visit 1 [Quanjer, 2012].

A subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has any other significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, or interstitial lung disease. Allergic rhinitis is not exclusionary. Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer in remission for &lt;5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has been resected for cure is not exclusionary).

Exacerbations: Has had more than 1 moderate or severe COPD exacerbation in the past 12 months. Subjects with a moderate exacerbation within 6 weeks or severe exacerbations within 10 weeks prior to Visit 1 are excluded from study. A moderate COPD exacerbation is defined as worsening symptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. A severe exacerbation is defined as worsening symptoms of COPD that require inpatient hospitalization. Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2agonist, lactose/milk protein or magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrowangle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the study physician contraindicates study participation or use of an inhaled anticholinergic.
