	<brief_summary>Accumulating data in the literature suggests that radiolabeled-choline (18F-choline) is a sensitive molecular tracer for PET-CT imaging that is taken up in activated cells and, as such, is able to identify active inflammatory sites.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Accumulation and subsequent activation of inflammatory cells in the atherosclerotic plaques play an essential role in transforming a stable plaque into a vulnerable plaque at risk to rupture. On this basis, the study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 18F-choline PET-CT in identifying ongoing inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques. We hypothesize that 18F-choline is efficient in detecting intraplaque inflammation.</detailed_description>
