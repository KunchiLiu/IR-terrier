	<criteria>Age &gt;18 years Subjects with clinically significant mitral regurgitation (MR 2+ and above) Ejection Fraction ≥ 25% Stable cardiac medical regimen for heart failure for at least 1 month Stable NYHA Classification for at least 1 month Subject is eligible for cardiac surgery The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions, and has provided written informed consent Myocardial infarction within 90 days of the intended treatment with the device Prior surgical, transcatheter, or percutaneous mitral valve intervention Any intervention for coronary artery disease (CAD) within the last 30 days prior to treatment, or unrevascularized multivessel coronary disease Hemodynamic instability or the need for emergent surgery Nonambulatory NYHA Class IV symptoms of heart failure or subjects requiring IV inotropic support Subjects in whom sufficient quality of echocardiography (TTE and TEE) cannot be obtained Echocardiography evidence of primary mitral valve disease causing MR or MS, Evidence of mitral valve stenosis with an estimated valve area less than 3.0 cm2 Mitral valve prosthesis or pathology that would prevent adequate function of the GDS Accucinch System Estimated GFR of &lt;30ml/min/1.73m2 Greater than mild mitral annular calcification observed by fluoroscopy Presence of aortic valve prosthesis Moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis or calcification observed by echocardiography or fluoroscopy Severe aortic arch calcification or mobile aortic atheroma observed by echocardiography or fluoroscopy Active bacterial endocarditis History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy History of stroke within the prior 6 months Subjects in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated Any clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the subject at increased risk with the placement of the device. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months Currently participating in an investigational study Comorbid conditions that place the subject at an unacceptable surgical risk (e.g. severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic failure, immunological abnormalities, and hematological abnormalities) Subjects with indication for concomitant surgery such as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic valve reconstruction or replacement, tricuspid repair or replacement, left ventricular remodeling surgery and congenital repair Any cardiac resynchronization therapy within the last 3 months prior to treatment Subjects on high dose steroids or immunosuppressant therapy Female subjects who are pregnant, of child bearing potential or lactating Subjects who are unable or unwilling to comply with the followup schedule and requirements</criteria>
