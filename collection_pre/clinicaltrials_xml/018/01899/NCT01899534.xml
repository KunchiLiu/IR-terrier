	<brief_summary>To compare e-screening versus usual screening on: 1) women's and healthcare providers' views on feasibility and acceptability; 2) rates of detection of prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety; 3) perceived risk and benefit of disclosure; 4) cost-effectiveness; 5) psychometric properties. We also aim to identify factors associated with feasibility of e-screening.Compared to usual screening:1) e-screening is as feasible; 2) e-screening yields similar rates of prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety; 3) the mean score for risk of disclosure is significantly lower and benefit of disclosure is significantly higher in the e-screening group; 4) e-screening is as or more cost effective in detecting prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety; 5) features of e-screening are significantly associated with feasibility and acceptability, whereas demographic factors are not; and 6) reliability and validity indices of ALPHA and EPDS are strongly correlated for both administration modes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Given that it is critical to conduct screening within a system that links referral and treatment, our IMPACT pilot trial is evaluating integrated screening and care (see Summary of Progress) versus usual prenatal care. The proposed trial engages 2 unique clinics with experienced staff who conduct routine screening (with referrals and treatment in place) to evaluate different modalities of screening. Since widespread screening is unlikely to be successfully implemented if it entails additional human resources, this trial assesses the potential for a sustainable, e-health alternative.</detailed_description>
