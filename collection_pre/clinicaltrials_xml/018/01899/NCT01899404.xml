	<brief_summary>The standard treatment for cervix cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital is external radiation with chemotherapy followed by internal radiation, called brachytherapy. Currently, brachytherapy treatment is planned on a type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) called T2-weighted (T2W) MRI. The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the following imaging tests can visualize the tumor better for planning the brachytherapy treatment: 1. special types of MRI called diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) and dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI); and 2. an x-ray test called positron emission test (PET) performed with a sugar dye called FDG. MRI-guided brachytherapy is resource-intensive and not widely available.</brief_summary>
