	<brief_summary>1. To investigate the hard and soft tissue adaptation and maintenance to the Laser-Lok® microchannels permanent abutment/ new Laser-Lok® implant assembly by performing clinical and radiographic evaluations. 2. To investigate the effect of inter-implant spacing (minimum of 2 or 3 mm) on hard and soft tissues. 3. To perform clinical and radiographic evaluations on these abutment/implant assemblies up to 2 years.</brief_summary>
