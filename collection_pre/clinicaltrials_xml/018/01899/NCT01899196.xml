Methodology multicentric, comparative study Estimated enrollment 31 participants in total 1. st group of- 15 people living with HIV undergoing CABG (coronary heart disease HIV+ group) 2. nd group of- 16 people without HIV- undergoing CABG (coronary heart disease HIV- group) People without HIV-will be matched to people living with HIV+ by : age (± 5 years) and sex Outcomes Primary outcome: Comparative analysis of the inflammatory profile of the EAT : expression profile of the pro and anti inflammatory cytokines and adipokines within the EAT in both groups of participants : coronary heart disease HIV+ and HIV- groups Secondary outcomes : - Determination of the EAT volume by echocardiography and cardiac scanner for both groups - Macroscopic profile of the EAT : adipocytes, fibrosis, endothelial cell density) - RT-PCR analyses : renin, adiponectine, PPARɣ - Comparatison of the inflammatory and macroscopic profiles between the EAT and the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the two groups by ARN messagers analysis. Eligibility Inclusion criteria HIV+ group - Men or women above the age of 18 years old, HIV1 seropositive for more than 6 months - Individual undergoing, for the first time, cardiac surgery for CABG - Affiliated with a social security regimen (the AME is not a social security regimen) - Signed the consent form HIV- group - Men or women above the age of 18 years old, HIV seronegative - Individuals undergoing, for the first time, cardiac surgery for CABG - Affiliated with a social security regimen (the AME is not a social security regimen) - Signed the consent form Non-inclusion criteria History of surgery for CBAG and/or congenital heart defect- being under the tutorship or guardianship of the state or in custody of the justice system. Statistical methods Categorical variables will be compared using Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables will be compared using the Student's t-test (parametric) and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric) as appropriate considering the data distribution. (statistical analysis software STATA 11 (StataCorp, Texas, USA)) Provisional study planning and timetable Study start date: July 2013 Enrollment period: 32 months Subject participation duration: 24 hours Total study duration: 32 months Estimated study completion date: end of March 2016</brief_summary>
