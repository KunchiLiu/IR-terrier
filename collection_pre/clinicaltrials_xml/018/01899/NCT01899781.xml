	<brief_title>Prophylactic Antibiotic Treatment for Hand Lacerations Involving Flexor and/or Extensor Tendon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hand lacerations are divided to "complicated" which involves tendons, nerves, bones, and joints, and "simple" which involves only cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. prophylactic antibiotic should not be given in a clean simple lacerations, and should be given when a bone is involve (open fracture). But there is not enough data, weather prophylactic antibiotic treatment should be given when only tendons are involved. The investigators will examine 2 groups of 30 patients each with clean hand lacerations involving tendons. One group will be treated with prophylactic antibiotic and the other wont be treated, randomly. The investigators assume that the rate of wound infection wont be different between the 2 groups.</detailed_description>
