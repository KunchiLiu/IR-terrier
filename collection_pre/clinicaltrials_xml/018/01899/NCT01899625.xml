	<detailed_description>This study is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an MI-based program for weight loss in young adults. Participants will be assigned to either the MI Behavioral Weigh Loss or Behavioral Weight Loss arms - both arms will receive a 12-week Behavioral Weight Loss program, including 2 individual in-person sessions, followed by weekly Behavioral Weight Loss modules, reporting of key behaviors, and feedback on progress relative to goals, all via email. Session content will be quite distinct between the two arms, with an increased emphasis on personalized feedback relative to healthy norms, enhancing autonomous motivation, and choice surrounding diet and activity goals in the MIBWL arm. Assessments will take place at 0, and 3 months, followed by exit interviews to help refine the protocol.</detailed_description>
