	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess safety and tolerability of GSK2330672 administration in subjects with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and symptoms of pruritus. It is a double-blind, crossover study with subjects receiving placebo or GSK23306772 in random order during two 14-day treatment periods. Additionally, the study will determine GSK2330672 exposure and interactions with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The total duration of subject participation will be 14 weeks for screening (45 days) and the treatment period. Subjects who are eligible for enrolment will participate in a 2-week placebo run-in period. Subjects will be randomized in a crossover fashion (Sequence 1 / Sequence 2) to receive placebo or GSK2330672 treatment during two consecutive 2-week study periods. Subjects will then participate in a 2-week placebo dosing period ending in follow-up assessments. Study results will be utilized to form a benefit: risk profile for GSK2330672 in PBC that will determine plans for progression to exploratory efficacy trials</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female aged between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Proven or likely PBC, as demonstrated by the subject presenting with at least 2 of the following: history of sustained increased alkaline phosphatise (AP) levels first recognized at least 6 months prior to Day 1; positive antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) titer (&gt;1:40 titer on immunofluorescence or M2 positive by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) or PBCspecific antinuclear antibodies (antinuclear dot and nuclear rim positive); liver biopsy consistent with PBC. Screening AP value between &lt;=10 Ã— upper limit of normal (ULN). Subjects should be on stable doses of UDCA for &gt;8 weeks at time of screening. Subjects not taking UDCA due to intolerance may be enrolled into this study following agreement by the GSK medical monitor. Symptoms of pruritus as follows (one of the following): PBC subjects with severe symptoms of pruritus that significantly impact daily life and have proven refractory after at least one previous therapy has been discontinued due to inadequate clinical response, poor tolerability or adverse events. Temporary response to cooling, 1% menthol in aqueous cream, nasobiliary drainage or molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) therapy is still compatible with refractory itch; PBC subjects with unresolved symptoms with use of a single antipruritic agent who can tolerate washout of current therapy for the duration of the trial; PBC subjects seeking treatment for pruritus that is newly diagnosed or previously untreated. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test or at least one of the following conditions applies: Nonreproductive potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milliinternational units per milliliter and estradiol &lt;40 picograms per milliliter (&lt;147 picomole per liter) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods along with either a second form of highly effective contraception or barrier protection (condoms with spermicide) if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment; Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the contraception options methods for the specified duration of time. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form Screening total bilirubin &gt;1.5x ULN. Isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%. Screening alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt;4x ULN. Screening serum creatinine &gt;2.5 milligrams per decilitre (221 micromole/liter). History or presence of hepatic decompensation (e.g., variceal bleeds, encephalopathy, or poorly controlled ascites). History or presence of other concomitant liver diseases including hepatitis due to hepatitis B or C virus (HCV, HBV) infection, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), alcoholic liver disease, definite autoimmune hepatitis or biopsy proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Administration of the following drugs at any time during the 3 months prior to screening for the study: colchicine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or systemic corticosteroids. Current or chronic history of inflammatory bowel disease, chronic diarrhea, Crohn's disease or diarrhea related to malabsorption syndromes. Fecal occult blood positive test at screening. Based on averaged corrected QT interval (QTc) values of triplicate ECGs obtained at least 5 minutes apart: QTc &gt;=450 milliseconds (msec); or QTc &gt;=480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a halfpint (approximately 240 milliliter [mL]) of beer, 1 glass (125 mL) of wine or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day.</criteria>
