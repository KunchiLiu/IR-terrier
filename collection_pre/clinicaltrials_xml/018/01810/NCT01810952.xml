	<brief_title>The Management of Glucocorticoid-Induced Hyperglycemia in Hospitalized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The target fasting serum glucose (FSG) and pre-meal SG was 90-140 mg/dL, and the random SG was less than 180 mg/dL, taking into consideration the ADA/AACE target glucose levels in non-ICU patients (15). The Glargine/Lispro Protocol included 0.2 unit/kg/day as insulin glargine once daily if the dose was between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose was less than 40 or more than 80 units; plus 0.2 unit/kg/day as lispro divided between three meals for all insulin-naïve patients. A "coverage" dose of 0.1 unit/kg/day of lispro for each 10 mg of prednisone or its equivalent was divided between 3 meals. The maximum starting "coverage" dose was 0.4 units/kg per day. The prandial dose of lispro was increased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or bedtime SG was between 141-200 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime SG is &gt;200 mg/dL. The prandial dose of lispro was decreased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or bedtime SG is between 70-89 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime SG was less than 70 mg/dL. The Glargine/Lispro/NPH Protocol included 0.2 unit/kg/day as insulin glargine as per G/L; plus 0.2 unit/kg/day as lispro divided between three meals for all the insulin-naïve patients. A "coverage" dose of 0.1 unit/kg/day of Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) for each 10 mg of prednisone or its equivalent was given twice daily with the administration of the glucocorticoid. The maximum starting "coverage" dose was 0.4 units/kg per day. The NPH dose was increased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or bedtime SG is between 141-200 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime SG was greater than 200 mg/dL. The NPH dose was decreased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or bedtime SG was between 70-89 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime SG was less than 70 mg/dL. In both protocols glargine dose was increased by 10% if the fasting glucose value is 141-200 mg/dL and by 20% if the fasting glucose value was more than 200 mg/dL, and decreased by 10% if the FSG was 70-89 mg/dL and by 20% if the FSG was less than 70 mg/dL. If the patient had an outpatient regimen which includes a total daily dose of insulin (TDI) that exceeded 0.4 unit/kg/day, then the same TDI was continued with 50% given as glargine once daily if the dose was between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose was less than 40 or more than 80 units; and 50% given as lispro divided between three meals. The patient was still randomly assigned to either one of the two protocols as described previously. If the patient were on a TDI less than 0.4 unit/kg/day in addition to oral antidiabetic medications as an outpatient, then all the oral antidiabetic medications were discontinued and the patient was started on 0.5 unit/kg/day divided as 50% glargine given once daily if the dose was between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose was less than 40 or more than 80 units; and 50% lispro divided between three meals. The patient was randomly assigned to either one of the two protocols based upon even and odd hospital numbers.</detailed_description>
