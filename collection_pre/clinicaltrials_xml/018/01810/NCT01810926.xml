	<brief_summary>• The primary aim of the present trial is to assess in a randomized fashion the benefit on standard graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis of the addition of ATG-Fresenius S ® in transplants from matched related donors (MRD) and of anti-CD20 rituximab in transplants from matched unrelated donors (MUD). Both safety and efficacy of the treatment will be assessed, in particular in respect to the clinical status of the patient, i.e. prevention of graft failure and chronic GvHD and of Ebstein Barr virus (EBV) viremia for MUD patients. The conditioning proposed combines myeloablative drugs with a favorable safety profile such as treosulfan, thiotepa (Tepadina®) and fludarabine with the intent to reduce the traditional immediate and late toxicity of busulfan and cyclophosphamide.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For patients transplanted from a MRD The primary end-point is the cumulative incidence of a combined end-point defined as the time from randomization to: - primary and secondary graft failure, - aGVHD II-IV, - cGVHD, - death, whichever occurs first. For patients transplanted from a MUD The primary end-point is the cumulative incidence of a combined end-point defined as the time from randomization to: - aGVHD II-IV, - EBV viremia, whichever occurs first.</detailed_description>
