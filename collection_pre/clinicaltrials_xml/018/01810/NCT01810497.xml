	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the possible influence of different durations of use of postoperative elastic bandaging (seven days vs. thirty days) in the results of otoplasty. We hypothesize that the duration of elastic bandage use has no significant influence on the incidence of relapse of prominence of the ears and need for reoperation.</brief_summary>
