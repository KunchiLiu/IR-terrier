	<brief_title>Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography for Selective Cardiac Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, randomized controlled multicenter trial to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of a "selective catheterization" strategy versus a "direct catheterization" strategy for stable patients with suspected but without known CAD and clinical indication for non-emergent invasive coronary angiography. Subjects in the "selective catheterization" arm will be followed for a primary endpoint of non-inferiority for rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as compare to subjects in the "direct catheterization" strategy.</detailed_description>
