	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether tactile stimulation for reduced sensibility of the affected extremities after stroke has effect. Hypothesis: Stimulation of sensibility after stroke will have a significant contribution for improved sensibility. Without any stimulation, no signal is sent to the brain and there is no need for the healthy parts of the brain to adapt this function. Stimulation of the sensibility over a period of time on both sides of the body, gives the brain signals and the opportunity to compare how the signals should be recognized. New connection will be able to interpret signals correctly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SlagSens (Effect of Tactile Stimulation After Stroke)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through stroke rehabilitation, function from damaged areas can be replaced by healthy parts of the brain. It is important for rehabilitation to take advantage of this compensatory qualities whit early intervention and mobilization. Only small gains can lead to big improvements. About half of stroke survivors gets reduced sensibility caused bye the stroke, and sensibility is considered to be an important part of rehabilitation of function and activities. A Norwegian guideline concludes that the scientific knowledge is to week to recommend this kind of treatment. There is some evidence for improvement of sensibility when specific training and stimulation is given. Achievements in sensibility can lead to some improvement in function. The project will be carried out as a randomized controlled trial. In this project, the intervention group receive tactile senses stimulated twice daily over a period of 3 months, while the control group receives standard treatment. The results from both groups are measured before and after treatment.</detailed_description>
