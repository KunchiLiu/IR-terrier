	<brief_summary>Recent evidence has shown that kidney volume predicts the likelihood of developing renal insufficiency over a finite length of time in ADPKD, suggesting a linkage between the growth of cysts and the harm they do to kidney function. Recent studies indicate that the rate of kidney volume increase is hastened by excess dietary protein, salt, and potential net acid precursors, and slowed by increased water intake sufficient to lower plasma vasopressin levels. Diets are commonly prescribed to treat ADPKD and other renal patients with disease near the end-stage, but there is currently no specific diet prescription that takes potentially harmful dietary elements into account for ADPKD patients in the earliest stages of the disease. This study will examine a novel diet for ADPKD created by the researcher termed the ADPKD diet.</brief_summary>
