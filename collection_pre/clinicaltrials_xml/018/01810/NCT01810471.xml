	<brief_summary>Untreated ankle sprains often remain symptomatic and may end in chronic instability. The aim of our study is to quantify the stabilizing effect of different devices. Through the use of a foot measurement model in 3D motion analysis the influence of the devices with respect to a mechanical effect is examined by means of different tests. The dynamic postural control is quantified. The hypothesis was that the devices would stabilize differently the foot segments.</brief_summary>
