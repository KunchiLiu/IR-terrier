	<brief_summary>This study will look at which, if any, active stretching procedure is most effective at correcting posterior shoulder tightness (PST) in the post-operative population. Posterior shoulder tightness can influence shoulder mobility and function within both a symptomatic and an asymptomatic population. There are previous studies that have examined the effectiveness of different active stretching procedures and their ability to correct PST but only in the asymptomatic population. As clinicians it will be helpful to investigate their effect within a symptomatic population in order to prescribe appropriate and effective stretches within an individual's home exercise program. The study design is a double blinded randomized control trial. During evaluation a passive measurement of PST and internal rotation will be performed. Another therapist, blinded to the measurements, will randomly select which subgroup the individual will be placed in for the first three individuals and this sequence will be followed for the remainder of the participants. At this time the therapist will instruct the individual on the corresponding exercise which they will perform in front of that therapist. The individual will perform this exercise one more time that day and twice the following day and once again upon follow up prior to having internal rotation and PST measured once again. At this point this will be the conclusion of that individuals involvement in the study. Null Hypothesis1: Stretches are no more effective than no treatment for reducing PST acutely in the post-operative shoulder population. Hypothesis1: Stretches are more effective than no treatment for reducing PST acutely in the post-operative population. Null Hypothesis2: There is no significant difference in the reduction of PST between the horizontal adduction stretch and the modified sleeper stretch acutely in the post-operative shoulder population. Hypothesis2: There is a significant difference in the reduction of PST between the horizontal adduction stretch and the modified sleeper stretch acutely in the post-operative shoulder population.</brief_summary>
