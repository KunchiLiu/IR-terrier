	<brief_summary>Working hypothesis and aims: 1) To explore the pathophysiology of postoperative troponin elevations and 2) whether ranolazine, a new anti-ischemic drug that has no effect on blood pressure or heart rate, prevents postoperative myocardial injury.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High-risk patients undergoing non cardiac surgery will be randomized to receive either Ranolazine or placebo perioperatively and troponin will be measured on the first 3 days after surgery.</detailed_description>
