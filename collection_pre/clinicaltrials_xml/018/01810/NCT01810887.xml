	<brief_title>A Phase 4 Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Darunavir Along With Ritonavir in Healthy Male Japanese Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single oral-dose and post-marketing study of darunavir administered in combination with low-dose ritonavir in healthy adult Japanese male participants. The total study duration will be approximately of 14 days per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment (that is, Day 1-5); and Follow-up (that is, up to Day 13). The participants will be hospitalized for 6 nights and 7 days. All the eligible participants will receive Darunavir oral tablet on Day 3 and ritonavir capsule orally twice daily from Day 1-5. Participants will keep upright position until 4 hours after study drug administration. Both the drugs will be administered within 15 minutes after completion of meal. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
