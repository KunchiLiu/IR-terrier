	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that individuals with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency have ongoing liver injury which is not detected by the usual blood tests used to look at liver function. This ongoing liver injury leads to cirrhosis in a significant number of adults with AAT deficiency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Fibrosis in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our overarching hypothesis is that liver disease in adults with AAT deficiency is the result of the accumulation of the abnormally folded protein within the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocyte. In some individuals, the intrinsic cellular mechanisms of the hepatocyte are sufficient to clear adequate amounts of the abnormally folded protein such that liver disease does not occur. In AAT deficient individuals who develop liver disease, environmental and other genetic factors stress the hepatocyte, and the normal cellular mechanisms that maintain homeostasis are disrupted, leading to liver disease. For this proposal, our hypothesis is that the prevalence of liver disease in adults with AAT is higher than previously reported because liver injury and fibrosis is not accurately detected by available routine liver testing. Testing this hypothesis will require an initial evaluation for liver disease with liver function testing and imaging, and then histologic confirmation by liver biopsy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Alpha1 Antitrypsin deficiency confirmed to be PI*ZZ by both genotype or another identified rare allele; Age range from 1870; Willingness to consent to liver biopsy; Ability to travel to UF as necessary by protocol; and Platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000/mm3 and an INR less than or equal to 1.5. Hemophilia, anticoagulant therapy that cannot be interrupted briefly, malignancy, or any other condition that would compromise the safety of a liver biopsy; Any known preexisting medical condition that might interfere with the patient's participation in and completion of the study or any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient unsuitable for enrollment; Active substance abuse including, but not limited to, alcohol, intravenous or, inhaled drugs; History of adverse reactions or allergy to the local anesthetic, sedative, or premedication used for the percutaneous liver biopsy; Poor venous access making the subject unable to complete the required laboratory testing schedule; and Females who are pregnant or lactating at time of enrollment. Should a female subject become pregnant during the follow up period after the initial liver biopsy, continued participation would be allowed if the following conditions are met: the subject desires to continue; a discussion of risk and benefits of participation between the principal investigator and the subject has occurred; and no liver biopsy would be performed in the follow up period.</criteria>
