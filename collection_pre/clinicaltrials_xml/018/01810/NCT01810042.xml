	<brief_summary>Exudative age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is complicated by choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment is the gold standard treatment, recurrence is the main limitation of the treatment. The changes of the CNV vascular structure is expected to provide information regarding recurrence. In the eyes that the vascular structure is clearly seen in indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), the vascular changes after ranibizumab injections will be investigated prospectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Indocyanine Angiographic Changes of Choroidal Neovascularization by Ranibizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patients having exudative ARMD with CNV, whose vascular structures are clearly demonstrated in ICGA , ranibizumab is injected monthly three times, then pro re nata to 6 months. Vascular structures of CNV is investigated at baseline, 3 and 6 months using ICGA. Expected number of patients are 48 eyes from 4 centers, competitively.</detailed_description>
