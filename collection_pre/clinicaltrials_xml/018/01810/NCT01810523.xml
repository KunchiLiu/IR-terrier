	<brief_summary>Study will test the use of narratives on patient satisfaction and translation of an evidence-based approach to the use of X-rays for leg injuries in the Emergency Department (ED). The investigators will identify patients with foot, ankle, or knee injuries for whom X-rays are determined to not be needed. On discharge, patients will receive the current fact-based sheet or that plus a narrative explaining the work-up and treatment of these injuries. Outcomes will be assessed by a survey measuring patient satisfaction and understanding.</brief_summary>
