	<brief_title>Hip Viscosupplementation: What is the Best Dosage?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraarticular injections have long been used to treat osteoarthritis. Viscosupplementation is a relatively new approach comprising the injection of hyaluronic acid into diarthrodial joints. Any osteoarthritic joint is eligible to this treatment modality, but the great majority of studies are for knee viscosupplementation. The dosis regimen is well established for the knee joint, but there is still no consensus regarding the optimal dosage for hip viscosupplementation. We will prospectively enroll 80 patients with hip osteoarthritis and will randomize them into four groups: Group zero will receive joint lavage with saline injection. Group 1 will receive joint lavage with saline injection and 2 ml of Hylan GF-20 (1 ampoule of Synvisc Classic速). Group 2 will receive joint lavage with saline injection and 4 ml of Hylan GF-20 (2 ampoules of Synvisc Classic速). Group 3 will receive joint lavage with saline injection and 6 ml of Hylan GF-20 (3 ampoules of Synvisc Classic速). The Visual Analogic Scale of Pain (VAS), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (WOMAC速), and Lequesne questionnaires were completed at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 12, and 24. Our objective is to determine the optimal dosis for hip viscosupplementation</detailed_description>
