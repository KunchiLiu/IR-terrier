	<brief_summary>Peri-operative mortality depends on the patient's co-morbidities. ASA Physical Status (American Society of Anesthesiology) is the most commonly scale to assess this parameter and has yet been repeatedly criticized in the past for its discriminatory power. Few studies have shown both the ASA physical status and the more detailed and more time-consuming Charlson Comorbidity Index to be equivalent in certain patient populations. The purpose of this observational study is to compare the predictive value of both scales with regards to all-cause in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay.</brief_summary>
