	<brief_summary>The prevalence of HBsAg carriage in pregnant women varies in France, according to the native country, with highest rates in those originating from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia (5 to 8 % in Parisian area). The level of HBV-DNA varies according to HBe status and geographical origin, and is strongly predictive of the risk of HBV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). It has been shown that the rate of vertical transmission (Chinese study by Yuan J et al) was 0 % in newborns to mothers whom HBV-DNA was &lt; 105 copies/mL and up to more than 40 % in newborns to mothers with high viral loads &gt; 108 copies/mL, despite HBIg and vaccine at birth. Thus, data are needed concerning the current practices about the prevention of HBV MTCT in France, and their results.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This monocentre, observational study will include pregnant women whom HBV-DNA is &gt; 105 IU/mL. HBV MTCT rates will be evaluated, according to the level of HBV-DNA in the women during the last three months of pregnancy and at childbirth (between 105 and 108 IU/mL, or &gt; 108 IU/mL), and according to the clinical practices of serovaccination in the participating center. The evaluation will be based on the rate of HBsAg positivity in infants at 9 months, despite a correct immunization at birth. The rate of detectable HBV-DNA will be also evaluated in infants at the same date.</detailed_description>
