	<detailed_description>Infants with congenital heart disease have more frequent infections and exposures to antibiotics than healthy infants. Probiotics may prevent pathogen colonization in infants with CHD. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that synbiotics may reduce the rate of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in infants with CHD</detailed_description>
