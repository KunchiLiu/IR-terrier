	<brief_summary>This is prospective, randomized, multicenter, multinational, randomized (1:1) study. The aim of this study is to assess the importance of functional assessment of coronary artery disease prior to bypass surgery. In particular, an FFR-guided strategy will be compared to the traditional Angio-guided strategy in the guidance of surgical revascularization by aorto-coronary bypass grafting.</brief_summary>
