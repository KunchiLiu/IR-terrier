	<brief_summary>This study's objective is to obtain preliminary data to test the hypotheses that percutaneous liver biopsy in brain death donors is safe and provides reliable histological information. Furthermore, that information when disseminated fully and widely many hours before organ recovery would not only decrease economic costs of wasteful recovery of livers that are not ultimately transplanted but also increase transplantation and decrease cold ischemia times of recovered livers.</brief_summary>
