	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, controlled trial involving kidney and kidney pancreas transplant patients. There will be 2 groups and patients will be randomized to one of the two; one will receive standard of care IPC or TED stockings to help with circulation, the other group will use the geko device which is a newer device with Health Canada approval. Clinical outcomes will be compared for those in each group and clinical differences between patients who receive routine medical therapy with IPC/TEDS versus the Geko device will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
