	<brief_summary>This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of bevacizumab or placebo treatment to lomustine in second-line treatment and standard of care (SOC) in third-line treatment following disease progression after first-line treatment in participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. All enrolled participants will receive first-line treatment with radiotherapy, temozolomide and bevacizumab (10 milligrams per kilogram per week [mg/kg/week] intravenously [IV] every 2 weeks). At the first disease progression (PD1), eligible participants will be randomized to receive lomustine plus either bevacizumab (10 mg/kg/week IV every 2 weeks) or placebo for 2nd-line treatment. After further disease progression (PD2), participants will receive a standard of care agent and continued bevacizumab or placebo for 3rd-line treatment.</brief_summary>
