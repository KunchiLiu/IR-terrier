	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators will examine the effects of buprenorphine, as compared to placebo, upon physiological, subjective, and hormonal responses to a stressful speech task and a non-stressful control task in healthy adults. There is strong evidence in support of the role of endogenous opioids and opiates in mediating social behavior in humans and other animals, and particularly, in social distress. Recently it has been shown that buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, reduces sensitivity to recognition of fearful facial expressions in humans. Here, the investigators propose to further explore the role of the opioid system in mediating stress responses in humans through the use of buprenorphine. The investigators hypothesize that buprenorphine with reduce both physiological and subjective measures of stress.</brief_summary>
