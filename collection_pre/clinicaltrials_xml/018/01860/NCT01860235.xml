	<brief_summary>Injectable anesthesics previous to subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) presents some disadvantages like fear of the needle insertion, long-lasting effect and prolonged dampening of adjacent tissues. This study will compare the intrapocket anesthetic effectiveness of a skin topical anesthesic EMLA with intrapocket 2% benzocaine, intrapocket placebo and injectable anaesthesia for SRP in a Split-mouth, double-blind, clinical trial study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a eutectic mixture containing 25 mg/g of lidocaine and 25 mg/g of prilocaine (EMLA®) with injectable 2% lidocaine, topical benzocaine, and 2% placebo for reducing pain during subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) procedures. Methods: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in this split-mouth, double-blind randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to a sequence of four anesthetics: 25 mg/g lidocaine and 25 mg/g of 5% prilocaine (EMLA®), injectable 2% lidocaine, topical 2% benzocaine, or placebo. Pain and discomfort were measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Verbal Scale (VS). Patient satisfaction with anesthesia was also determined at the end of each treatment session.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>eligible individuals for the study were selected from those requiring SRP with at least 2 experimental teeth in four of the six sextants. each experimental teeth had to present ≥ 1 site with probing depth ≥ 5 mm associated with BP after treatment of gingivitis (without marginal bleeding). furthermore, individual should present ≥ 18 yearsold, have not ever done periodontal treatment and be able to understand Verbal Scale (VS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Exclusion criteria: patients that related allergy history or sensitivity reaction to any used amide or ester anesthetics form, who received anesthesia or sedation 12 hours before SRP, who presented ulcerated lesions or abscesses in the oral cavity, who presented oral pathologies with immediate surgical, who had prior abuse alcohol history, pregnant women, who presented uncontrolled hypertension or who had participated in a clinical trial of investigational drug before four months from the beginning of this study.</criteria>
