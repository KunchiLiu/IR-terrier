	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the operative complication and short-/long-term therapeutic effects of percutaneous local ablative therapy (PLAT) versus surgical resection(SR) on small hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) patients with clinically significant portal hypertension(CSPH) so as to lend clinical and theoretical basis of the therapeutic schemes for the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Resection Versus Percutaneous Local Ablative Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCC is a major health problem worldwide, with an estimated incidence ranging between 500,000 and 1,000,000 new cases annually. It is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third most common cause of cancer-related death,especially in East-Asia countries.SR remains the first therapeutic option for a cure but is suitable only for 9%—27% of patients.The presence of significant background cirrhosis often precludes liver resection for HCC.Even though these HCC patients undergo SR，the incidence of posthepatectomy liver failure(PHLF) and death would be high，especially to HCC patients complicating CSPH，whose corresponding risk of PHLF and persistent PHLF were 59.02%and 14.75%respectively in our past study. It is extremely urgent to search a safe and effective means in this subgroup of HCC patients.PLAT, a recently developed local ablative technique, has attracted the greatest interest and popularity because of its effectiveness and safety,with a 3-year survival rate of 62-77%,a low treatment complication rate of 8-9% and a low treatment mortality rate of 0-0.5%.However, there is still debate on whether PLAT or SR is the most suitable therapy for HCC.To our knowledge,there have been no study on the therapy of HCC complicating CSPH.</detailed_description>
