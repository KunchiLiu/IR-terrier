	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that the bioactive compounds of sea buckthorn berries (Hippophaë rhamnoides), their fractions, and bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus). have positive effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and will thus reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Berries and Berry Fractions on Metabolic Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the project was to investigate whether it is possible to reduce the risk of metabolic diseases with supplementing the diet with sea buckthorn berries (Hippophaë rhamnoides), their bioactive fractions, and bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus). The study design was a randomized cross-over clinical trial. The participants were slightly and moderately overweight female subjects. In total, 110 female volunteers were recruited, and they followed four different berry diets (bilberry, sea buckthorn, sea buckthorn phenolic extract and sea buckthorn oil) in a randomized order for 33-35 days. Each intervention was followed by a wash-out period of 30-39 days. Blood samples were drawn and physical measurements were performed after each period. Eighty volunteers completed the study. Different markers of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and inflammation were measured form the blood samples.</detailed_description>
