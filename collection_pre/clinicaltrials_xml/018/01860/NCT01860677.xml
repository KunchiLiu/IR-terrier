	<brief_title>Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) to Treat PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The advent of an appreciation that alternative and complementary practices can have some beneficial effect on health has prompted the question of whether there are empirical measures of improvement that do not rely solely on subjective reports. The present study proposes to explore whether transcranial stimulation (or cranial electrotherapy stimulation; CES) using an FDA-approved device can alter brain function, mood and responses to cognitive tasks in patients diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, the study will test whether such changes parallel clinical improvement in signs and symptoms. The dependent variables of interest will be magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Secondarily, we will assess the effects of CES on brain chemistry through the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy procedures in normal, healthy control participants.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Meets DSMIV criteria for PTSD 21 to 40 years old Otherwise physically healthy (normal physical exam, ECG, blood and urine chemistries) Female participants must use medically approved method of contraception. If barrier method is used, they must agree to using two methods simultaneously (e.g., diaphragm and condom). If on antidepressant or antianxiety medication, must be on a stable prescription regimen with no intentions to change drugs or dose during the next 11 weeks. Opiate maintenance (e.g., methadone or buprenorphine) Drug use (other than nicotine, alcohol, or marihuana) greater than 50 lifetime uses. Meets criteria for current drug abuse or dependence (other than nicotine, alcohol, or marihuana). Past abuse/dependence (greater than 3 years) is acceptable. Meets criteria for alcohol dependence. Past abuse/dependence (greater than 3 years) is acceptable. They may meet criteria for alcohol abuse.
