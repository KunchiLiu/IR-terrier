Pilot project, without control group - Comprehended six sessions of educational videos covering basic concepts of mental health stigma and the main disorders that affects children and adolescents followed by discussion forums, quizzes and a conclusion web conferencing with a specialist. 2. A randomized controlled trial with a sample of 176 teachers from nine elementary schools were randomly divided in three groups: a web-based interactive educational group (WBIE), a text and video-based educational group (TWBE) and a waiting list group (WL). Outcome measures: knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of teachers in mental health and satisfaction with the training received.

Indeed, comparing the three groups of study participants (WBIE, TVBE and WL), was verified that TVBE group compared with WL group did not show a significant statistical difference (B = 0.957, p = 0.127). Comparing WBIE with WL group, the WBIE answers correctly 1:44 (B = 1.44, p = 0.015). Regarding beliefs and attitudes, WBIE group increased significantly in the ability to identify children with mental health problems, search for mental health information, the ability to recognize colleagues with mental health problems. The average confidence in helping a student with mental health problems also showed increased after psychoeducational intervention in WBIE group.
