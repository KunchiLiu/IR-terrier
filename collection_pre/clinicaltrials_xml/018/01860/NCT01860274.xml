	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that a meshed conduit made of safen vein allows a better patency at mid-long term than a safen vein alone. To test this hypothesis the investigators plan a prospective, randomized study, comparing grafts to the diagonal, in cases of vessel diameter under 1.5mm. A control angiography will be performed one year after the operation.</brief_summary>
