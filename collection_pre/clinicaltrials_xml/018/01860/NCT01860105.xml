	<brief_summary>Following a first, dose ascending study that enrolled 144 normal healthy volunteers (NHVs), this study, to be conducted in approximately 36 NHVs, will provide pertinent information in determining the dose-response of MDCO-157 for platelet aggregation inhibition and P2Y12 receptor inhibition effects and in selection of doses that match the antiplatelet effects of 300 mg PLAVIX® ®. The study will also provide additional data for pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of single doses of MDCO-157.</brief_summary>
