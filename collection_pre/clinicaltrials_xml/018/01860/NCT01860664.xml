	<brief_title>Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Ointment 0.5% for Treatment of Allergic Conjunctivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compare the safety and efficacy of Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Ointment 0.5% vs. Placebo for the reduction of signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Demonstration of efficacy is a statistically significant improvement in itching on a 0 to 4 patient subjective assessment itch score compared to the vehicle arm and at least a 25% (or 1 full unit or more) improvement in itch scores. Efficacy for bulbar redness scores would be indicated by a statistically significant improvement in redness on a zero to 4 based on the investigators objective assessment compared to the vehicle group. Differences of at least 25% on the four point scale would be considered clinically significant when attained at the majority of time points.</detailed_description>
