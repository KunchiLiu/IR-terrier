	<brief_summary>This study compares three techniques of uterine closure on myometrium thickness evaluated by ultrasound six months after the primary cesarean. The three techniques include: 1) locked single layer closure; 2) double layer closure with a first continuous locked suture and a second imbricating continuous suture; 3) double layer closure with a first continuous unlocked suture of the deep portion of the myometrium avoiding the inclusion of the decidua and a second unlocked continuous suture that approximate the upper portion of the myometrium. The primary outcome is the mean myometrium thickness at the site of the uterine scar evaluated by transvaginal ultrasound at six months after cesarean.</brief_summary>
