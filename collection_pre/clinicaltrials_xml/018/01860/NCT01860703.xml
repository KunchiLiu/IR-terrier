Medically healthy with clinically insignificant screening results (e.g., laboratory profiles, medical history, vital signs, physical examination). 5. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &gt;1.5x109/L. 6. 12lead ECGs which have no clinically significant findings as judged by the Principal Investigator (PI) or the PI's designee at screening and checkin of each study period,including: 1. Normal sinus rhythm (heart rate between 45 and 100 bpm); 2. QTcF interval ≤ 450 msec; 3. QRS interval ≤ 110 msec; and 4. PR interval ≤ 220 msec. 7. Subject must be capable of providing written informed consent, and must voluntarily consent to participate in the study. 8. Willing to answer inclusion and exclusion criteria questionnaire at checkin. Main 1. History or presence of significant respiratory, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic,neurologic, or psychiatric disease. 2. Disorders or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract which may interfere with drug absorption or may otherwise influence the PK of the investigational medicinal products (e.g. cholecystectomy, resections of the small or large intestine, febrile conditions, chronic diarrhea, chronic vomiting, endocrine disease, severe infections,acute inflammations, etc.). 3. Presence of liver impairment: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) above the normal reference range. 4. Presence of significant kidney impairment: serum creatinine higher than the normal reference range. 5. Allergy to band aids, adhesive dressing or medical tape. 6. Clinically significant history or presence of ECG abnormalities such as second or thirddegree atrioventricular block; evidence, or family history, of prolonged QT syndrome. 7. Sustained sitting systolic blood pressure of &lt;90 mmHg or &gt;140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure of &gt;95 mmHg at screening or checkin of Period 1. 8. History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to deferiprone, moxifloxacin, iron chelators, or quinolone antibiotics. 9. History or presence of: agranulocytosis; asthma; chronic bronchitis; diabetes; migraine; hypertension; hypotension; hypokalemia; seizures or epilepsy; anaemia. 10. History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years. 11. Used tobacco/nicotinecontaining product for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of study. 12. Used DepoProvera® or levonorgestrel implant within 90 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study. 13. Participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to the first dose of the study. 14. Had a clinically significant illness during the 4 weeks prior to checkin on Day 1 of Period 1.</criteria>
