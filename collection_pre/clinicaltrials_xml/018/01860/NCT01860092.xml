	<brief_summary>This post-approval study is being implemented to monitor the use of Argus II System in a larger US population than available within pre-approval studies. An attempt will be made to include all eligible and willing subjects implanted with Argus II System in the United States. Safety data will be monitored to ensure continued acceptability of risks to study subjects. The utility (i.e. visual function and functional vision) and reliability of Argus II System will also be evaluated. There is no study hypothesis.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Retinitis</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Retinitis Pigmentosa</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Are adults, age 25 year or older; Have severe to profound retinitis pigmentosa; Bare light or no light perception in both eyes; if the patient has no residual light perception, then evidence of intact inner layer retina function must be confirmed; Have previous history of useful form vision. Aphakic or pseudophakic. (If the patient is phakic prior to implant, the natural lens will be removed during the implant procedure.) Patients who are willing and able to receive the recommended postimplant clinical followup, device fitting, and visual rehabilitation; Have consented to the implantation of an Argus II Retinal Prosthesis and subsequently consent to participate in this study; At the time of the Baseline Visit, do not suffer from nonophthalmic serious adverse events (e.g. myocardial infarction, etc.) and Ocular diseases or conditions that could prevent Argus II System from working (e.g. optic nerve disease, central retinal artery or vein occlusion, history of retinal detachment, trauma, severe strabismus); Ocular structures or conditions that could prevent the successful implantation of the Argus II Implant or adequate healing from surgery (e.g. extremely thin conjunctiva, axial length &lt;20.5 mm or &gt;26 mm, corneal ulcers, etc.); Ocular diseases or conditions (other than cataracts) that prevent adequate visualization of the inner structures of the eye (e.g. corneal opacity, etc.); Inability to tolerate general anesthesia or the recommended antibiotic and steroid regimen associated with the implantation surgery; Metallic or active implantable device(s) (e.g. cochlear implant) in the head; Predisposition to eye rubbing; Any disease or condition that prevents understanding or communication of informed consent, study demands, and testing protocols, including: cognitive decline including diagnosed forms of dementia and/or progressive neurologic disease, psychiatric disease including diagnosed forms of depression; does not speak a principal language associated with the region, and deafness; Pregnant or wish to become pregnant during the course of the study; Participating in another investigational drug or device study that may conflict with the objectives, followup or testing of this study; Conditions likely to limit life to less than 1 year from the time of inclusion.</criteria>
