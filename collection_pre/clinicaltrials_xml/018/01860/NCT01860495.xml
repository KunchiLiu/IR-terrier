	<brief_summary>One of the most important elements suggested to be provided through membrane perforations to augment regeneration are cell released growth factors from the overlying periosteal and gingival cells. A direct correlation could exist between the number of such cells and their available released growth factors. To test this assumption, this study was designed to evaluate levels of bone morphogenetic protein-2 in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) during the early stages of healing for sites treated by MPM compared to that of the occlusive barrier membranes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subjects were recruited consecutively from the list of patients seeking care for periodontal problems at the Department of Periodontology of the Faculty of Dental Medicine, Al Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt, between March 2012 to December 2012. The criteria implemented for patient inclusion were: 1) no systemic diseases which could influence the outcome of the therapy; 2) good compliance with the plaque control instructions following initial therapy; 3) teeth involved were all vital with score 0 mobility ; 4) each subject contributed matched pairs of two or three walled intrabony interproximal defects in premolar or molar teeth 5) the selected 2- or 3-wall intrabony defect depth ranged from 3-5 mm as detected in diagnostic periapical radiographs; 6) selected pocket depth (PD) ≥ 6 mm and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 5 mm at the site of endosseous defect four weeks following initial cause-related therapy 7) endosseous radiographic defect angle ≤55 and ≥15 8) availability for the follow-up and maintenance program; 9) absence of periodontal treatment for the previous year; 10) absence of systemic medication or antibiotic treatment for the previous 6 months; 11) absence of a smoking habit and 12) absence of occlusal interferences. Pregnant females were excluded from participating in the study. Patients were also excluded from the study if they presented with opened interproximal contact, or inadequate compliance with the oral hygiene maintenance schedule. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of El Azhar University (OMD - 45 - 2012, clinical trial registration number: Al Azhar University 22-31). Research procedures were explained to all patients and they agreed to participate in the study and signed the appropriate informed consent form of Al Azhar University.</detailed_description>
