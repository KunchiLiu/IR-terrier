	<brief_summary>This study will assess efficacy, safety , tolerability and PK in uncomplicated adult malaria patients with acute P. falciparum infection after single dose with KAE609 at 75 mg, 150mg, 225mg and 300mg/day</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess Efficacy, Safety of KAE609 in Adult Patients With Acute Malaria Mono-infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the study is comprised of 4 sequential cohorts, in total there will be up to 48 patients enrolled in the study. cohort 1: 6-12 patients receive 75mg single dose. cohort 2: 6-12 patients receive 150mg single dose. cohort 3: 6-12 patients receive 225mg single dose. cohort 4: 6-12 patients receive 300mg single dose. After approximately every 6 patients in any cohort have been treated with a given dose and complete the first 15 days, a safety and tolerability data review will be conducted by a Data Monitoring Committee(DMC). Consensus agreement of DMC is required to either escalate to the next dose level or expand a given cohort with an additional 6 patients in order to obtain more safety data.</detailed_description>
