	<criteria>1. Patients ≥ 18 years of age with either a mass suspicious for or histologically confirmed AJCC stage IBIIIA NSCLC. For those without histologic confirmation of NSCLC, a biopsy will be done and only those patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC meeting all other eligibility criteria may proceed on protocol. 2. Mass must be determined to be surgically resectable 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score &lt; 1 and a life expectancy &gt;3 months. 4. Participants must have at least one evaluable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1 5. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500 mm3, platelet count ≥ 100×109 L, hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL 6. Serum creatinine ≤1.3 mg/dL (candidate for cisplatin chemotherapy), total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, AST/ALT ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal range 7. No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for NSCLC 8. At least 5 years from diagnosis of another cancer except treated insitu disease or surgically resected nonmelanoma skin cancer with clear margins. 9. Willingness to provide permission to biopsy NSCLC for collection of frozen pretreatment sample. 10. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are premenopausal or not surgically sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method (abstinence, oral contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug, and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial 1. Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 2. 2. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. 3. Major contraindication to surgical resection of NSCLC 4. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to the protocol treatment plan and followup requirements. 5. Concurrent severe illness such as active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit safety and compliance with study requirements. 6. Patients receiving any other investigational agents. 7. Pregnant or lactating females</criteria>
