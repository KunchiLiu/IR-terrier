	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, therapeutic exploratory clinical trial of branched chain amino acids (BCAA's) in the treatment of sports-related concussion. The aim of the study is to determine whether, compared to placebo treatment, administration of BCAA's, at one or more doses, after a sports-related concussion improves neurocognitive recovery at one or more time-periods post concussion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BCAA's in Sports-related Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Centers for Disease Control now estimates that 1.6 - 3.8 million sports related concussions occur each year in the United States. A large proportion of these athletes have enduring cognitive and neurobehavioral problems. Concussion is a heterogeneous insult to the brain that precipitates a complex pathophysiological process that can result in a cascade of deleterious side effects. At present, there are no proven therapies to mitigate or prevent the neurocognitive and neurobehavioral consequences of sports-related concussions. The limbic hippocampus, a brain structure crucial for learning and memory, is often damaged in concussion. In preclinical studies, analysis of hippocampi isolated from mice after traumatic brain injury demonstrated that only the concentrations of the three branched chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, and leucine) were significantly altered (reduced) after injury. When these brain-injured animals received dietary supplementation with branched chain amino acids (BCAA's), the concentrations of these amino acids were restored in the injured hippocampus and the injured animals demonstrated significant cognitive improvement to levels comparable to those obtained in non-injured control animals. In light of these results and the increasing awareness and morbidity associated with concussion, we are conducting a therapeutic exploratory clinical trial to determine the effects of BCAA's in reducing the neurocognitive side effects of sports-related concussion injury.</detailed_description>
