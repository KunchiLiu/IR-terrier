	<brief_summary>Opioids are the mainstay of analgesia in hospitalized children but opioid therapy is associated with life-threatening respiratory depression requiring antagonism with naloxone. Hence, it is hypothesized that naloxone requirement can be used as a quality measure of opioid safety. A retrospective medical chart review of 95 patients, who received naloxone for life threatening events, from June 2006-2012, is planned, to identify significant factors associated with risk for opioid induced respiratory depression and formulation of preventive strategies.</brief_summary>
