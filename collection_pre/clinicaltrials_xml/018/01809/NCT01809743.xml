	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to test the accuracy of Regadenoson to induce maximal and steady state hyperemia as compared to central venous infusion of adenosine for assessing fractional flow reserve. (adenosine is considered to be the gold standard)and to investigate the time intervals of maximum hyperemia induced by centrally and peripherally administered Regadenoson.</brief_summary>
