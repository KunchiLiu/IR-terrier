	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the absorption of a niacin metabolite (1-methylnicotinamide, 1-MNA) from TRIA-662 (1-methylnicotinamide chloride)relative to the production of 1-MNA from Niaspan. The 1-MNA information obtained from this study will be used to adjust the top dose of a planned TRIA-622 efficacy study.</brief_summary>
