	<brief_summary>You are being asked to be in a research study to determine blood levels and vitreous levels of compounds called thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF). These compounds exists naturally in your body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thrombospondin-1 and Pigmented Epithelium Derived Factor Levels in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis tested here is that diabetic patients that express the higher molecular weight pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) isoform have lower thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) level and, as a result, are at a greater risk for the development of more severe diabetic retinopathy.</detailed_description>
