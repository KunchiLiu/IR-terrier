	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to gain real world, live implant experience with the remote implant support system. This system is intended to provide the technical support for device implants from a remote location through telepresence (audio and video) and remote control. Specifically, the goals of this study are to corroborate bench testing, assess the performance of the system, gain understanding of the workflows, customer experience, and logistics. The intent of the remote support model is to provide the same support that would typically be provided by a local support person, only remotely. As such, the remote support person would only perform actions that a local support person would routinely do under the direction of a physician. This may involve observing patient data, providing technical support and advice, and performing testing and device reprogramming via remote control of the programmer.</brief_summary>
