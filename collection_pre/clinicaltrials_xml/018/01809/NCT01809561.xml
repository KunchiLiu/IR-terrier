	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to assess the telomere array of different endometriosis tissue and endometrium from women with endometriosis compared to healthy women. Our hypothesis is that telomere shortening and high telomerase activity will be found in tissues from women with endometriosis, compared to women without endometriosis. A prospective study that compares telomeres and telomerase levels in different lesions of endometriosis and endometrial tissue of women with endometriosis and healthy women without endometriosis. The study group will consist of women with suspected endometriosis facing surgical treatment and the control group will consist of healthy women facing gynecologic surgery for different indication. We will sample endometrial tissue in both groups. In the study group we additionally will sample endometriosis lesion. The samples collected will test for histological diagnosis of endometriosis and verification tests will be done to characterize the telomeres array and telomerase levels and other characteristics for genomic instability such as spontaneous aneuploidy. expect telomere shortening and high telomerase activity in endometrial tissue and in endometriosis tissue sample, that won't characterize samples from women without endometriosis.</detailed_description>
