	<brief_title>Comparison Between Bandage Contact Lens and Pressure Patching for The Erosion Area and Pain Scale in Corneal Erosion Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized open-label clinical trial in patients with mechanical corneal erosion. Subjects were selected to use bandage contact lens (Senofilcon A) or pressure patching. All subjects received combination of Polymyxin B, Neomycin, and Gramicidin eye drops and 0,5% Tropicamide eye drops. Evaluation was done 24 hours after treatment</detailed_description>
