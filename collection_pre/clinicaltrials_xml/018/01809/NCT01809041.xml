	<brief_summary>Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a fairly well-documented clinical phenomenon. Most patients will receive general anesthesia during surgery. Two groups of general anesthetics are used for this purpose. We hypothesize that the incidence of POCD is not different in patients received intravenous anesthetics only or sevoflurane (a volatile anesthetic-based general anesthesia for their major intra-abdominal surgery.</brief_summary>
