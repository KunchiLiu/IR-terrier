	<brief_title>Using an Internet Study to Improve Adherence for Psoriasis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An investigator-blinded, prospective study of subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis will be conducted. Forty subjects ages 18 years and older will be enrolled.The Internet-based survey will be piloted to evaluate its effect on adherence to topical psoriasis medication. Subjects randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Internet-survey group will log their impression of the state of their psoriasis on a weekly basis. Subjects in both the intervention and control groups will receive standard-of-care topical fluocinonide 0.05% ointment to be applied to affected areas on the skin twice daily. Adherence to fluocinonide will be assessed using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMSÂ®) caps, electronic monitors affixed to the medication containers. Investigators and subjects will be blinded to the adherence data until the final (Month 12) treatment visit.</detailed_description>
