	<brief_summary>The main goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 40 or 80 mg atomoxetine as a treatment for cocaine dependence. The Phase I studies summarized above support the safety of atomoxetine in combination with stimulants. As the next step, the investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine in a small clinical trial with cocaine users. If atomoxetine is found to be promising in this study and sufficiently powered, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies will be proposed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be an approximately 13 to 14 week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial testing the safety and feasibility of atomoxetine (40 or 80 mg/day) treatment, compared to placebo, in methadone-stabilized stimulant users. The study will have 3 phases: 1) a one to two week- methadone-induction phase; 2) an 8-week "treatment" phase; and 3) 1 week atomoxetine taper and about a 4-week methadone "taper and detoxification or transfer" phase. Subjects will be randomized to three treatment arms: 40 mg (n=15) atomoxetine, or 80 mg (n=15) atomoxetine, or placebo (n=15). During the methadone induction phase, subjects will be stabilized on methadone. During induction onto methadone, participants will be administered increasing doses of methadone starting at 30 mg daily, and this dose will be increased for stabilization of opiate withdrawal symptoms from 40 mg up to 140 mg depending on individual need. Based on the clinic schedule between 1 to 2 weeks after methadone treatment is initiated , atomoxetine treatment will be started at 40 mg/day. For those assigned to 80 mg of atomoxetine, the dose will be titrated up to 80 mg/day on the second week of treatment phase. At the end of the treatment-phase, subjects will undergo detoxification from methadone over a 4-week period based on an individual's needs, and they will concurrently be tapered off atomoxetine. All participants will receive a weekly one-hour of individual psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) with experienced clinicians specifically trained to deliver the therapy, and who will receive ongoing supervision. This study has been terminated as of march 2014 due to the lack of funding, only 14 were enrolled with 11 subject completers. (June 2016)</detailed_description>
