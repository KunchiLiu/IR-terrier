	<brief_summary>Background Early conversion from calcineurin inhibitor to mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor is one of the immunosuppressive strategies that have been investigated to mitigate long-term CNi associated adverse events. This study aims to evaluate the conversion from tacrolimus to sirolimus in de novo kidney transplant recipients. This multicenter, open-label study, planned to enroll 297 patients initially treated with tacrolimus, enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (1440 mg/day, orally) and prednisone. The primary objective is to show superior glomerular filtration rate in the SRL group at 24 months after transplantation.</brief_summary>
