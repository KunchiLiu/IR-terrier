	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt) inhibitor MK2206 works in treating patients with previously treated colon or rectal cancer that has spread from the primary site to other places in the body or nearby tissue or lymph nodes and cannot be removed by surgery. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Colon or Rectal Cancer That is Metastatic or Locally Advanced and Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the response rate to MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206), defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine response rate to MK-2206 in patients with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation in a pretreatment biopsy from a metastatic site. II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). III. To determine the time to treatment failure (TTF), and duration of tumor response (DR). IV. To determine the safety profile and tolerability of this regimen in this patient population. V. To determine effect of PTEN, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), PIK3CA, and AKT mutations and semi-quantitative grading of PTEN expression on clinical response. OUTLINE: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.</detailed_description>
