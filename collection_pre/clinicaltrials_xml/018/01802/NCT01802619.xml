	<detailed_description>Prolonged periods of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) cause high levels of plasma free haemoglobin(Hb) and are associated with increased morbidity. We hypothesized that repletion of nitric oxide (NO) during and after the surgical procedure on CPB may protect against endothelium dysfunction and organ failure caused by plasma-Hb induced NO scavenging. There are three possible beneficial mechanisms of delivering NO: 1. Nitric oxide reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury (such as in acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute tubular necrosis). 2. Nitric oxide has anti-inflammatory properties. As antioxidants, exogenous NO may reduce injury by counteracting the cytotoxic effects of reactive oxygen species, modulating leukocyte recruitment, edema formation and tissue disruption. 3. Exogenous nitric oxide prevents noxious effects of hemolysis-associated NO dysregulation. During hemolysis, nitric oxide gas oxidized of plasma oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, thereby inhibiting endogenous endothelium NO scavenging by cell-free Hb. NO depletion during hemolysis and its sequelae. The release of plasma free Hb (with Fe2+ iron) by hemolysis avidly scavenges nitric oxide (NO) by the dioxygenation reaction. Elevated plasma ferrous Hb levels can induce a "NO deficiency" state. Reduced vascular nitric oxide levels can contribute to vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thrombosis, potentially contributing to systemic endothelial dysfunction after cardiac surgery with CPB.</detailed_description>
