	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint, parallel-group, active-control, multi-center, proof-of-concept study in subjects with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), designed to assess the safety and potential efficacy of adding edoxaban to aspirin following femoropopliteal endovascular intervention, with or without stent placement, relative to current treatment practice with clopidogrel and aspirin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects older than the minimum legal adult age (country specific); Rutherford stages 25 provided there are no ulcerations on the heel and/or exposed tendon and/or bone; Superficial femoral above kneepopliteal ( 3 cm proximal to the medial femoral condyle) lesion and ≥ 50% stenosis or occlusion; At least one runoff vessel to the foot with or without additional endovascular intervention; Successful intervention, defined as angiographic confirmation of ≤ 30% residual stenosis and absence of flow limiting dissection; Adequate hemostasis at the vascular access site within 24 hours of intervention; A subject is also eligible if they have undergone additional successful endovascular intervention(s) during the index intervention; Able to provide signed informed consent. Calculated Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml/min; Femoral or popliteal aneurysm; Adjunctive use of thrombolytics; Any extravasation or distal embolization not successfully treated; Uncontrolled hypertension as judged by the investigator (e.g., systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg despite antihypertensives); Aspirin intolerance; Clopidogrel intolerance; Contraindication for anticoagulants or antiplatelets and any other contraindication listed in the local labeling of aspirin and/or clopidogrel; Active bleeding or known high risk for bleeding or history of intracranial, or spontaneous intraocular, spinal retroperitoneal or intraarticular bleeding; overt gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or active ulcer within the previous year; Subjects receiving dual antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy at the time of randomization; subjects receiving preinterventional loading dose of clopidogrel or other P2Y12 receptor antagonists; Treatment with cilostazol within 24 hours of randomization; Subjects receiving prohibited concomitant medications [fibrinolytics, chronic use of non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) &gt; 4 days per week, and oral or parenteral nonaspirin NSAIDs and strong Pgp inhibitors]; Prior stroke or MI or acute coronary syndrome within 3 months; Chronic liver disease [alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal; total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal]; however, subjects whose elevated TBL is due to known Gilbert‟s syndrome may be included in the study; Prior history of a positive test for Hepatitis B antigen or Hepatitis C antibody; Subjects who received any investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to randomization, or plan to receive such investigational therapy during the study period; Subjects previously randomized to an edoxaban (DU176b) study; Women of childbearing potential without proper contraceptive measures (i.e. a method of contraception with a failure rate &lt; 1 % during the course of the study including the observational period) and women who are pregnant or breast feeding; Subjects with the following diagnoses or situations: Active malignancy except for adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or other noninvasive or insitu neoplasm (e.g., cervical cancer in situ); Concurrent treatment with cancer therapy (drugs, radiation, and/or surgery); Other significant active concurrent medical illness or infection; Life expectancy &lt; 12 months; Subjects who are unlikely to comply with the protocol (e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for subsequent visits, and/or otherwise considered by the Investigator to be unlikely to complete the study); Subjects with any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study; History of heparininduced thrombocytopenia</criteria>
