	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well a controlled low calorie diet works in reducing side effects and increasing response to chemotherapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Eating a special diet with low calories may reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the response to treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Low Calorie Diet in Reducing Side Effects and Increasing Response to Chemotherapy in Patients With Breast or Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the impact of a restricted diet on toxicity and efficacy of chemotherapy for breast and prostate cancer. II. To evaluate the compliance with a controlled diet intervention. III. To investigate changes in plasma insulin, glucose, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and IGF binding protein (IGFBP) levels in subjects who consume a restricted diet compared to controls. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 or 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients eat a special low-calorie diet during 3 days prior to chemotherapy, during the 12 weeks of chemotherapy, and 24 hours after chemotherapy. Patients are provided with all meals and all food to be consumed and maintain a diary of the food consumed and appropriate amounts. Patients meet with the study dietician within 3 weeks of enrollment and prior to, or on the day of, their first course of chemotherapy on study and at the start of each subsequent course. ARM II: Patients eat a normal diet and receive dietary advice which may include consultation with a nutritionist. Patients maintain a diary of the food consumed and appropriate amounts.</detailed_description>
