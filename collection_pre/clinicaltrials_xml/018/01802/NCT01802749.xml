	<brief_summary>Bevacizumab has been found to prolong progression free survival in first line, and more recently, in second line treatment for platinum sensitive ovarian cancer patients who had not received prior treatment with bevacizumab. Recently reported data suggest that patients with colon cancer who receive bevacizumab in more than one line of therapy (beyond progression) have better results. In ovarian cancer, the role of bevacizumab administered in both first and second-line therapies needs to be defined. This study aims to evaluate whether administering bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in second-line therapy to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have received first-line bevacizumab will be more effective than chemotherapy alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female patients ≥18 years of age. Patients with histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian or fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma, including mixed Mullerian Tumours Recurrence or progression at least 6 months after the last chemotherapy cycle of a first line carboplatin + paclitaxel chemotherapy including bevacizumab (recurrence or progression might occur either during or after bevacizumab as maintenance) Patients can be included if they have a RECIST progression, with either measurable or nonmeasurable disease ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance) Status of 02. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Signed informed consent obtained prior to initiation of any studyspecific procedures and treatment as confirmation of the patient's awareness and willingness to comply with the study requirements including blood samples for molecular analyses. Availability of tumour samples for molecular analyses from primary surgery (mandatory) and secondary surgery (when available) Cancer related Ovarian tumours with low malignant potential (i.e. borderline tumours) History or evidence of synchronous primary endometrial carcinoma, unless all of the following criteria related to the endometrial carcinoma are met: stage ≤Ia no more than superficial myometrial invasion no lymphovascular invasion not poorly differentiated (grade 3 or papillary serous or clear cell carcinoma). Other malignancy within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or squamous carcinoma of the skin, or adequately controlled limited basal cell skin cancer. Prior current or planned treatment: More than one previous chemotherapy line Previous therapy with other antiangiogenetic agents different from bevacizumab. Any prior radiotherapy to the pelvis or abdomen. Surgery (including open biopsy) within 4 weeks prior to the first bevacizumab dose.Current or recent (within 10 days prior to the first study drug dose) use of fulldose oral or parenteral anticoagulants or thrombolytic agents for therapeutic purposes (except for line patency, in which case international normalized ratio [INR] must be maintained below 1.5). Post operative prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin sc is allowed. Current or recent (within 30 days of first study dosing) treatment with any other investigational drug. Laboratory: Inadequate bone marrow function: ANC (absolute neutrophil count): &lt;1500/mm3, or platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3 or Haemoglobin &lt;9 g/dl. Patients may be transfused to maintain haemoglobin values ≥9 g/dl. Inadequate coagulation parameters: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or INR (international normalized ratio) &gt;1.5 Inadequate liver function, defined as: serum (total) bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN for the institution AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT &gt; 2.5 x ULN. Inadequate renal function, defined as: serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl or &gt;177 micromol/l urine dipstick for proteinuria &gt;2+. Patients with ≥ 1+ proteinuria at baseline dipstick analysis should undergo a 24hour urine collection and must demonstrate ≤1g of protein in their 24hour urine collection. Prior or concomitant conditions or procedures: History or evidence of brain metastases or spinal cord compression. Pregnant or lactating females. History or evidence of thrombotic or haemorrhagic disorders; including cerebrovascular accident (CVA) / stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) or subarachnoid haemorrhage within ≤6 months prior to the first study treatment). Uncontrolled hypertension (sustained systolic &gt;150 mm Hg and/or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg despite antihypertensive therapy) or clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease, including: myocardial infarction or unstable angina within ≤6 months prior to the first study treatment New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater congestive heart failure (CHF) serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (with the exception of atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) peripheral vascular disease ≥grade 3 (i.e. symptomatic and interfering with activities of daily living requiring repair or revision). History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess, or with signs of impending bowel obstruction within 6 months prior to the first study treatment. Nonhealing wound, ulcer or bone fracture. Patients with granulating incisions healing by secondary intention with no evidence of facial dehiscence or infection are eligible but require three weekly wound examinations. Evidence of any other medical conditions (such as psychiatric illness, peptic ulcer, etc.), physical examination or laboratory findings that may interfere with the planned treatment, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from treatmentrelated complications.</criteria>
