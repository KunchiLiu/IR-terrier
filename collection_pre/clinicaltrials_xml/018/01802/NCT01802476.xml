	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine approximately what percentage of an orally administered dose of PD-0332991 is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation. This approximation is made by comparing the plasma pharmacokinetics of a 125 mg oral dose of PD-0332991 to the plasma pharmacokinetics of a 50 mg intravenous dose of PD-0332991 administered as a 4-hour infusion.</brief_summary>
