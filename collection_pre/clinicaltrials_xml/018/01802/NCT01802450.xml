	<brief_summary>Trial try to assess the efficacy of dasatinib in terms of major molecular response rate at 6 months in patients with CP-CML who have achieved complete cytogenetic response without major molecular response after at least 18 months on Imatinib 400/600.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II trial for patients in complete cytogenetic response that have not achieved major molecular response or have lost a prior major molecular response, after at least 18 months of treatment with imatinib. All enrolled patients will receive dasatinib 100 mg once daily orally for 1 year until progression, loss of cytogenetic response, transformation to advanced phases, unacceptable toxicity (clinical adverse event, lab abnormality or concurrent disease), pregnancy if a female or withdrawal of consent, whichever happens first. Patients will undergo BCR-ABL assessments at study entry and every 3 months (central lab) and immunophenotyping and studies for clonal lymphocytosis at study entry, at 3 and 6 months. Cytogenetic assessment will be done only if loss of response/progression/clonal evolution are suspected. Subjects will be evaluated for the efficacy and safety of dasatinib (Sprycel). Lymphocytosis data will be collected for all patients and separate description for efficacy and safety parameters will be done in patients with and without lymphocytosis.</detailed_description>

A wash out period of at least 7 days for imatinib is required prior to dasatinib administration Patients meet criteria of late suboptimal response (complete cytogenetic response with no major molecular response) or have lost major molecular response Ability to understand and voluntarily sign the informed consent for Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy and have a negative pregnancy test, a maximum of 72 hours prior to study drug start. Sexually active men must also use effective contraceptive methods during the treatment. Women must not be breastfeeding Patients treated with Imatinib at a dose different of 400/600 mg per day Patients treated with other TKI than imatinib Loss of cytogenetic response at study entry ECOG â‰¥ 3 Inadequate bone marrow reserve: ANC &lt;1.5 x 109/L and/or Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L Inadequate hepatic function (Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)&gt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (IULN).

Patients with active or uncontrolled infections or with serious illnesses or medical conditions that would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol.
