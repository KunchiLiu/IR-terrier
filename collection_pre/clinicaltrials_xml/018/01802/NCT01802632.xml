	<brief_summary>This study will treat patients with advanced NSCLC who have already received at least one course of specific anti-cancer treatment but the tumour has started to re-grow following that treatment. This is the first time this drug has ever been tested in patients, and so it will help to understand what type of side effects may occur with the drug treatment, it will measure the levels of drug in the body, it will also measure the anti-cancer activity. By using these pieces of information together the best dose of this drug to use in further clinical trials will be selected.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Phase I/II, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumour Activity of Ascending Doses of AZD9291 in Patients with Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer who have Progressed Following Prior Therapy with an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Agent (AURA)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures, sampling and analyses Aged at least 18 years. Patients from Japan aged at least 20 years. Histological or cytological confirmation diagnosis of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Radiological documentation of disease progression while on a previous continuous treatment with an EGFR TKI e.g. gefitinib or erlotinib (with the exception of 1st line expansion cohort). In addition other lines of therapy may have been given. All patients must have documented radiological progression on the last treatment administered prior to enrolling in the study. Patients (with the exception of 1st line expansion cohort) must fulfil one of the following: Confirmation that the tumour harbours an EGFR mutation known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (including G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q) OR Must have experienced clinical benefit from EGFR TKI, according to the Jackman criteria (Jackman et al 2010) followed by systemic objective progression (RECIST or WHO) while on continuous treatment with EGFR TKI. Previous treatment with a singleagent EGFR TKI (e.g. gefitinib or erlotinib). Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing or evidence of nonchild bearing potential. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception. For 1st Line expansion cohort ONLY, confirmation that the tumour is EGFRm+ve and have had no prior therapy for their advanced disease (for 1st line patients biopsy will be at time of diagnosis of advanced disease). For dose expansion and extension cohorts, patients must also have confirmation of tumour T790M mutation status (confirmed positive or negative) from a biopsy sample taken after disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen (irrespective of whether this is EGFR TKI or chemotherapy). Prior to entry a result from the central analysis of the patient's T790M mutation status must be obtained. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status 01 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks. Treatment with an EGFR TKI (erlotinib or gefitinib) within 8 days (approximately 5x halflife) of the first dose of study treatment. Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents or other anticancer drugs from the treatment of advanced NSCLC from a previous treatment regimen or clinical study within 14 days of the first dose of study treatment. AZD9291 in the present study (ie, dosing with AZD9291 previously initiated in this study). Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension, active bleeding diatheses, or active infection. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, druginduced interstitial lung disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease.</criteria>
