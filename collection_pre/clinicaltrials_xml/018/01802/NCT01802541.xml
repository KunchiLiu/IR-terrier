	<brief_summary>Diacylglycerol oil has been shown to lower postprandial and fasting serum triacylglycerol levels and reduce body fat. The investigators hypothesize that replacing dietary fat with diacylglycerol oil reduces excess body fat in type 2 diabetic patients and that diacylglycerol oil has a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
