	<brief_title>Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis With Oral Vancomycin by the Study of Its Antimicrobial and Immunomodulating Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in the fecal and salivary microbiota during vancomycin treatment of children and adults with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), identify features of the host microbiota that are associated with disease activity and/or response to treatment and further delineate the immunological effects of oral vancomycin treatment of PSC. This study will correlate changes in microbiota with the immunological effects of oral vancomycin in children and adults with PSC. The results of this proposal will lead to new and validated targets for diagnosis and treatment of PSC that will have high impact in the short and long term for patients and their families.</detailed_description>
