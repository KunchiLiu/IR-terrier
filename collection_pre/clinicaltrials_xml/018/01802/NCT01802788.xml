	<mesh_term>Aortic Valve Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient has signed the Patient Informed Consent prior to participating in the clinical investigation. Patient has been referred for a Portico Valve implant as per Heart Team decision. Patient has senile degenerative aortic stenosis with an initial valve area of less than (&lt;) 1.0 cm2 (or aortic valve area index less than or equal to (â‰¤) 0.6 cm2/m2) AND a mean transvalvular gradient greater than (&gt;) 40mmHg or jet velocity greater than (&gt;) 4.0 m/s derived by resting echocardiogram [or dobutamine stress echocardiogram if subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50%]. (Baseline measurement taken by echo within 45 days of index procedure). Patient has a life expectancy more than (&gt;) 12 months. Any case in which the Portico Valve would not be indicated for the patient as per current instructions for use (i.e any "offlabel" use). Patient has any other than tricuspid valve. Patient has a prosthetic valve or ring in the aortic position. Patient needs a concomitant structural heart procedure. Patient needs the usage of an embolic protection device. Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with all clinical investigationrequired followup evaluations. Patient is pregnant</criteria>
