	<brief_summary>This is a multi-centre study to take place in approximately 3 centers in Seoul, South Korea. The study will be carried out as a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical trial in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine if an enhanced recovery strategy paying close attention to the type and amount of fluid given during the surgery with proper monitoring combined with a comprehensive perioperative pain management will have a better post-operative outcome compared to institutional standard of care (SOC), in patients undergoing surgery of the colon. One of the fluids used, Volulyte®, is an intravenous solution used to treat low blood volume. The Volulyte® solution being used in the study and the monitor used are approved by the Korean Food and Drug Administration</brief_summary>
