	<brief_summary>An open-label, dose-escalation trial of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), biological, and clinical activity of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered to patients with CD20 (B-lymphocyte antigen CD20) positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that have failed standard rituximab-containing therapy. Following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab (if needed) each patient will receive DI-Leu16-IL2 administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection for three consecutive days every three weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An open-label, dose-escalation trial of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), biological, and clinical activity of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered to patients with CD20 (B-lymphocyte antigen CD20) positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that have failed standard rituximab-containing therapy. Following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab (if needed) each patient will receive DI-Leu16-IL2 administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection for three consecutive days every three weeks (21 day cycle). Three to six (3-6) patients will be enrolled in each cohort. Patients may receive 6 cycles of DI-Leu16-IL2 approximately thrice weekly for 3 weeks for a total of 18 doses. Approximately 66 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 6 investigational centers in the U.S. Forty-two (42) patients will be enrolled during dose escalation (Phase 1) and 2 expansion cohorts of 12 patients each (Phase 2). Following completion of the Phase I portion of the trial and review of the safety, response and correlative immune data it has been elected to have 2 expansion cohorts of 12 patients each at 2 mg/m2. - Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) that is relapsed or refractory to standard therapy - All other CD20-expressing B-cell NHL that is relapsed or refractory to standard therapy. As mentioned above Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) with peripheral blood leukemia/lymphoma cells and high-grade lymphomas (i.e. Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Burkitt's Lymphoma) are excluded At the end of the study, patients may be enrolled into an open-label extension study (Study AO-101-EXT), at the discretion of the investigator. Study Primary Endpoints 1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered SC following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with B-cell NHL. 2. To investigate the optimal biologic dose (OBD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with B-cell NHL, which may differ from the MTD. 3. To describe the toxicities associated with the proposed DI-Leu16-IL2 regimen. Study Secondary Endpoints 1. To evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by the induction of DI-Leu16-IL2-specific antibodies. 2. To evaluate the PK of DI-Leu16-IL2 (achieved in the primary portion of the study). 3. To measure the response rate at the MTD (and/or OBD) associated with the proposed therapy and survival endpoints of the enrolled patients.</detailed_description>

Patients who have received a prior allogeneic stem cell transplant are eligible if: 1. The transplant occurred &gt; 6 months ago 2. There is no evidence of active graft vs host disease 3. Systemic immunosuppressive agents (including corticosteroids) have not been received for at least 8 weeks 6. Age ≥18 years 7. Karnofsky performance scale ≥70% 8. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks 9. Adequate baseline functions: 1. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl 2. Total white blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 3000/µl, or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/µl 3.

Chest xray (CXR) or computed tomography CT within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 with no evidence of pulmonary congestion, pleural effusions, pulmonary fibrosis, or significant emphysema. If results are questionable, patients should have additional lung function testing to exclude clinically relevant restriction or obstruction. Patients must have a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) of at least 65% and 50% of expected, respectively. 11.
