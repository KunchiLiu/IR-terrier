	<brief_summary>Iron overload is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transfusion-dependent patients. Deferasirox is the most promising iron chelator agent in several clinical scenarios. The investigators propose a retrospective study (chart review) to evaluate comprehensive iron overload management in transfusion-dependent patients treated with deferasirox for up to 5-10 years in a real clinical practice setting.</brief_summary>
