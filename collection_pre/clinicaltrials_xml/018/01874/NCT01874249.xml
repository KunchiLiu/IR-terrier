	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the utility of noninvasive markers for the detection of advanced fibrosis in patients newly diagnosed with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) by ultrasound. The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of noninvasive markers for detect of advanced fibrosis in patients with diagnosis of fatty liver disease. The secondary objectives are: - To determine the increase in health care with the specialist (gastroenterologist or endocrinologist). - To determine which noninvasive evaluation strategy favors any treatment of fatty liver disease.</brief_summary>
