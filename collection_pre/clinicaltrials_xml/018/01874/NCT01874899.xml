	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to establish the extent that chronic pain patients implanted with surgical, laminectomy-type, leads experience position-related variation in spinal cord stimulation therapy and to investigate the effects of manual versus automatic position-adaptive spinal cord stimulation on clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Feasibility Study Comparing Manual vs. Automatic Position-Adaptive Spinal Cord Stimulation With Surgical Leads</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-center, prospective, randomized study with a two-arm crossover design. The primary objective of this study is to establish threshold and therapeutic stimulation parameters for the RestoreSensor neurostimulator in response to postural changes. The secondary objective is to compare the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation with manual versus automatic position-adaptive settings for chronic refractory low back and/or extremity pain.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Skeletally mature adults between 18 and 70 years old Patients with chronic refractory back and/or leg pain associated with failed back surgery syndrome, postlaminectomy pain, radicular pain syndrome or radiculopathy refractory to conservative and surgical interventions &gt; 50% pain reduction during the trail period Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol including followup requirements Willing to sign a study specific informed consent Previous SCS treatment Surgically remediable spinal condition Active local or systemic infection</criteria>
