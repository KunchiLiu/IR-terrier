	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is a feasibility study to assess the performance of an Artificial Pancreas (AP) device using the Artificial Pancreas System (APS©) platform for subjects with type 1 diabetes using rapid-acting insulin as well as preprandial inhaled insulin (Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation System by MannKind Corporation). The goal of this proposed study is to explore the feasibility of using multiple insulin delivery routes in order to mimic the physiology of both first- and second-phase insulin secretion. The intent is to exploit the rapid action achieved by inhaled insulin to compensate for part of the meals and utilize the conventional subcutaneous route for management of basal insulin and as second-phase meal-related insulin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year and using an insulin pump for at least 6 months with commercially available rapid actin insulin The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment; C peptide level and antibody determinations are not needed. Age 21 to 65 years For females, not currently known to be pregnant or nursing HbA1c between 5.0% and 10%, as measured with DCA2000 or equivalent device Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 70% Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) predicted Forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥70% NHANES III predicted Forced expiratory volume in 1 second as a percentage of forced vital capacity(FEVl/FVC)≥NHANES III lower limit of normal (LLN) Willing to perform the calibration of the study CGMs using a finger stick only and willing to follow instructions for insulin pump and CGM wear. Willing to use the study CGM and study insulin pump during closedloop. Able to and agrees to avoid the following medication starting 24 hours before sensor wear through completion of CRC visit: acetaminophen, and pseudoephedrine. An understanding of and willingness to follow the protocol and sign the informed consent. Pregnancy (as determined by a positive blood pregnancy test performed in females of childbearing capacity during screening visit and urine test at time of admission for inpatient visit) or nursing mother. Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 6 months prior to enrollment requiring emergency room visit or hospitalization Severe hypoglycemia resulting in seizure or loss of consciousness in the 12 months prior to enrollment Current treatment for a seizure disorder; o Subjects with a history of seizures may be included in the study if they receive written clearance from their neurologist Cystic fibrosis Active infection A known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere with the completion of the protocol such as cognitive deficit. Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate understanding or cooperation, including subjects not able to read or write. Coronary artery disease or heart failure. oSubjects with a history of coronary artery disease may be included in the study if they receive written clearance from their cardiologist Presence of a known adrenal disorder Active coronary artery disease or heart failure Active gastroparesis If on antihypertensive, thyroid, antidepressant or lipid lowering medication, lack of stability on the medication for the past 2 months prior to enrollment in the study Uncontrolled thyroid disease o Adequately treated thyroid disease and celiac disease do not exclude subjects from enrollment Abuse of alcohol A recent injury to body or limb, muscular disorder, use of any medication, any carcinogenic disease, or other significant medical disorder if that injury, medication or disease in the judgment of the investigator will affect the completion of the exercise protocol Current use of a beta blocker medication Laboratory results: Hematocrit &lt; 30% or &gt;55% A1C &gt; 10% Abnormal liver or renal function (Transaminase &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal, Creatinine&gt; 1.5 mg/dL) Labs drawn at screening visit or within one month prior to screening (for other purposes) will suffice for enrollment purposes related to hematocrit Subject has skin conditions that, in the determination of the investigator, would preclude wearing the study devices (infusion set and sensor), in the abdomen. Examples include but are not limited to: psoriasis, burns, scaring, eczema, tattoos, and significant hypertrophy at sites of device wear; any known allergy to medical adhesives. Currently on longterm treatment using prednisone. If subject had been on short term treatment of prednisone, defer enrollment until underlying condition and prednisone treatment have resolved. Allergy to study drug, food or other study material History of asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or any other clinically relevant chronic lung disease Respiratory track infection within 4 weeks before screening Clinically significant screening ECG, physical examination, laboratory test, or vital sign abnormality Exposure to any investigational drug within 30 days. History of malignancy within the 5 years before screening (other than basal cell carcinoma) Inability, in the opinion of the investigator, to adequately inhale Technosphere® Inhalation powder Abnormal spirometry Currently smoking or discontinued smoking (including cigarettes, cigars, pipes) over the past 6 months. Highly sensitive to insulin: insulintocarbohydrate ratio I:C &gt; 1:12. Current participation in another investigational trial (unless participation to original protocol of IDE G110093) or has previously participated to this study.</criteria>
