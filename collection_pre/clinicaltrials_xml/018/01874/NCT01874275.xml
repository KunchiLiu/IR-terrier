	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this investigation is to assess the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation applied using VECTTOR to reduce the symptoms of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and reduce the impact of DMD upon the participants' quality of life. The primary outcome measures will include: 1. increased muscle strength, 2. increased range of joint motions and 3. improved sleep parameters of ASI, N3 and REM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle Strength and Joint Range of Motion Testing - All muscle and joint testing was performed at the MedCenter Therapy clinic in Houston, Texas. JTech computerized testing system was utilized including Goniometry, Grip testing, Inclinometry, Muscle Testing and Joint Range of Motion testing occurred on Day 0, 30, 60, 90, 180, and repeated at 12 months to determine muscular strength and joint Range of Motion. JTech computerized testing system was chosen on the basis of reliability and accuracy. At each of the testing intervals, the testing was administered by the same technician with the same equipment to all of the participants. Inter-and intra-tester reliability of the JTech computerized testing system has been the subject of multiple studies. Each of which found high ICCs (&gt;0.93) for both inter- and intra-tester reliability. All sleep studies were performed at Sleep Diagnostics of Texas in The Woodlands, Texas. Prior to the clinical trial, all of the participants spent two nights in the sleep unit and their sleep study examinations were performed. The second night was used as the Day 0 data. Sleep, breathing, arousals and limb movements were scored manually according to guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The sleep studies were repeated at 6 months and 1 year.</detailed_description>
