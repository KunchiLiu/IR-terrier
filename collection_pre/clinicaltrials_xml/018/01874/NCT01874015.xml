	<detailed_description>In this study all eligible patients were randomly allocated into two study groups by a permuted block randomization method: group A receives only autologous MSCs suspended in fibrin glue, group B receives autologous MSCs+ Fibroblasts. Both groups receive 4 injections inside the wall and lumen of the fistula. Injections will be repeated every month.</detailed_description>
