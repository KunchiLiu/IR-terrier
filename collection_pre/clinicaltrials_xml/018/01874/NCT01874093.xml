	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of SPG stimulation with the ISS in a 24 hour window, in patients with an acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation, who received IV-rtPA and Standard of Care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>THE IMPACT- 24Bt Post rtPA TRIAL (IMPlant Augmenting Cerebral Blood Flow Trial 24 Hours From Stroke Onset, Post IV-rtPA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double blind, sham control, adjunctive to Standard of Care, parallel arm study and will include ongoing DSMB review of accumulated safety data. The study has three phases: Phase I - Implantation Safety Assessment Number of patients: 20 (at least 10 implantations) - Implanters: only certified implanters who already performed implantation of ISS in previous studies - Continue to the next phase if there are no serious procedure complications related to rtPA (as determined by the implanter). Otherwise, implement retirements and continue only after DSMB approval. DSMB meetings: after 10 implantations Phase II - Symptomatic Hemorrhage Assessment (sICH): - Number of patients: 50 (additional 30) - Implanters: all certified implanters - Continue to the next phase if there is no clinically meaningful difference between treated and control. A clinically meaningful difference is a difference of more than 3 sICH cases within the first 5 days of treatment, in the treated arm compared to the control arm. Otherwise, implement retirements and continue only after DSMB approval. - DSMB meetings: after 30 and 50 patients Phase III - Entire study population, DSMB meetings once per quarter</detailed_description>
