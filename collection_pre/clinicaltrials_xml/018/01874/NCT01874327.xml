	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the efficacy of a novel intervention implemented in a classroom setting aimed at improving joint attention and joint engagement skills with infants who are at risk of developing an Autism Spectrum Disorder.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed intervention adapts a parent-mediated intervention that successfully improved outcomes in toddlers with autism. The intervention model (a) targets the foundations of social-communication (joint attention, imitation, play), (b) uses naturalistic strategies to increase the rate and complexity of social-communication and (c) includes parents as implementers of the intervention to promote generalization across settings and activities and to ensure maintenance over time. In addition to testing the primary effects of this early intervention on the developmental outcomes of children with signs of autism, we will examine whether this method is superior to an early intervention focused on global infant development. Because brain development occurs rapidly in infants and toddlers, we will use high density EEG to investigate (1) biomarkers of change in these infants as a result of intervention and (2) biomarkers predicting response to treatment, with focus on the neural correlates of social attention and learning from joint engagement. Study Aims: AIM 1: To examine the effects of the experimental intervention (Baby JASPER) on primary (joint attention) and secondary outcomes (receptive language, play, symbol-infused joint engagement and parent use of social communication support strategies). AIM 2: To examine maintenance and generalization of the effects of the experimental intervention on children and their parents. AIM 3: To examine electrophysiological biomarkers of change with treatment as well as predictors of social communication outcomes in children after intervention. AIM 4 (exploratory): To examine the effect of potential child level and parent level moderators on the primary and secondary outcomes of the study across the two conditions.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Autism Spectrum Disorder</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Have elevated scores on the ADOSToddler version and clinical concern from professional (Pediatrician, Psychologist, etc). Because of the young age of children, we expect to intervene with children who do not yet have a diagnosis of ASD but may only show some risk by virtue of elevated scores on the ADOST. Have a parent available for parentmediated sessions 2 times per week in the classroom Do not have seizures Do not have associated sensory or physical disorders Are not comorbid with other syndromes or diseases Other comorbid syndromes or diseases Seizure activity Other sensory or physical disorders</criteria>
