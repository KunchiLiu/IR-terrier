	<detailed_description>Head and neck cancer patients who receive radiation are at risk for permanent swallowing disorders. Because of these potential problems, swallowing exercises are an important part of recovery. Researchers want to learn what factors affect how well patients follow the swallowing schedule they are given, and what can be done to make it consistent. If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the following procedures performed. Videotaped Swallowing Exercise: Researchers will ask you to perform 3 swallowing exercises while being recorded by a video camera. The length of the taping session will be 3 minutes. Afterward, you will fill out 3 questionnaires. The questionnaires will take about 10 minutes to complete. Length of Study: You will be asked to come in 1 time for this study. For the next 2 years, information may be collected from your medical record. This information will include the cancer stage, if the disease has gotten worse, any treatment you receive, and any side effects you experience. This information will help researchers learn how certain treatments affect patients and their risk for future disease. This is an investigational study. Up to 225 patient will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
