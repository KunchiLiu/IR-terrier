	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa among adults above age 30. The prevalence of hypertension, a major risk factor for CVD, is increasing over time in sub-Saharan Africa, exerting a significant epidemiologic and economic burden on the region. Without adequate control of hypertension, its health and economic burden will increase drastically in the decades ahead. Well established and evidence-based interventions to manage hypertension exist; however, treatment and control rates are low. A critical component of hypertension management is to facilitate sustained access of affected individuals to effective clinical services. In partnership with the Government of Kenya, the United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare Partnership (AMPATH) is expanding its clinical scope of work in rural western Kenya to include hypertension and other chronic diseases. However, linking and retaining individuals with elevated blood pressure to the clinical care program has been difficult. Thus, the overall objective of this application is to utilize a multi-disciplinary implementation research approach to address the challenge of linking and retaining hypertensive individuals to a hypertension management program. We aim to add to existing knowledge on scalable and sustainable strategies for optimizing control of hypertension and other chronic diseases in low- and middle-income countries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Linkage and Retention to Hypertension Care in Rural Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control rates are low in most regions of the world. A critical component of hypertension management is to facilitate sustained access of affected individuals to effective clinical services. In partnership with the Government of Kenya, the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) Partnership is expanding its clinical scope of work in rural western Kenya to include hypertension and other chronic diseases. However, linking and retaining individuals with elevated blood pressure to the clinical care program has been difficult. To address this challenge, we propose to develop and evaluate innovative community-based strategies and initiatives supported by mobile technology. The objective of this application is to utilize a multi-disciplinary implementation research approach to address the challenge of linking and retaining hypertensive individuals to a hypertension management program. The central hypothesis is: community health workers (CHWs), equipped with a tailored behavioral communication strategy and a smartphone-based tool linked to an electronic health record, can increase linkage and retention of hypertensive individuals to a hypertension care program and thereby significantly reduce blood pressure among these patients. We further hypothesize that these interventions will be cost-effective. This research will generate innovative and productive solutions to the expanding global problem of hypertension, and will add to existing knowledge on scalable and sustainable strategies for effectively managing hypertension and other chronic diseases in low- and middle-income countries.</detailed_description>
