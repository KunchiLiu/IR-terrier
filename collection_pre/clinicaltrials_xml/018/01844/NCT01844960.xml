	<brief_summary>A double blinded randomised control trial comparing the differences between laparoscopic single incision versus multiple port bariatric surgery in morbidly obese patients (BMI&gt;35). Single incision surgery is a new minimally invasive surgical technique requiring the surgeon to operate through one small single incision and is virtually scarless. The traditional laparoscopic approach to abdominal surgery is through multiple small incisions (4-7 ports) across the whole abdomen. This study seeks to identify the risks, benefits and costs of the adjustable gastric band insertion via single incision and multiple incision within the morbidly obese patient group.</brief_summary>
