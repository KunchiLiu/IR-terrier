	<brief_title>Comparison of Intranasal Kovacaine Mist, and Placebo for Anesthetizing Maxillary Teeth in Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will employ a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups design to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Kovacaine Mist delivered intranasally for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary permanent teeth numbers 4 to 13 (maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar) or maxillary primary teeth numbers A to J (maxillary right second primary molar to maxillary left second primary molar) sufficient to allow completion of the Study Dental Procedure. The maxillary teeth will be categorized in two subsets, anterior teeth (permanent teeth numbers 6 to 11 and primary teeth numbers C to H) and posterior teeth (permanent teeth numbers 4, 5, 12, 13 and primary teeth numbers A, B, I, J). The intent is to treat 90 male and female subjects aged 3 to 17 years, inclusive, at 3 study sites, 2:1 randomization within each study site, and an overall goal of 60 subjects treated with Kovacaine Mist and 30 treated with placebo. Subjects will receive Kovacaine Mist or placebo (2:1) according to the kit randomization plan within three dosing strata (100 µL, 200 µL or 400 µL) based on subject weight at entry: subjects weighing 10 to &lt;20 kg, 20 to &lt;40 kg and ≥ 40 kg will be assigned to the 100 µL, 200 µL or 400 µL dose group, respectively. Recruitment will be from diverse pediatric dental patient populations. To ensure adequate representation in the 3 dose/weight groups, each stratum will contain at least 25% of subjects.</detailed_description>
