	<brief_summary>HBV-related liver failure (HBV-LF), a dramatic clinical syndrome, is characterized with massive necrosis of liver cells. Liver transplantation might be the most effective therapy for HBV-LF. However, there are a lot of problems such as lack of donors, surgical complications, transplant rejection, and high cost, which could limit the application of liver transplantation. It is demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells could directionally differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in injured liver, as well as reduce inflammation of the liver by immune regulation. In this study, we assess the safety and efficacy of human bone marrow and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation for patients with HBV-LF.</brief_summary>
