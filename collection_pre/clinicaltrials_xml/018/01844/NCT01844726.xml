	<brief_summary>The present study proposes to evaluate the potential cognitive enhancing effects of GLYX-13, an NMDAR partial agonist, among a group of healthy adults and those with psychiatric illness on a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) learning and memory tasks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of GLYX-13 on Learning and Memory in Healthy Individuals and Those With Psychiatric Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a single blind randomized parallel group design, we will evaluate the whether a single dose of GLYX-13 vs. placebo increases cognitive performance on tasks of learning, declarative memory, and working memory, and associated task-related increases in BOLD activation in hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. Positive findings will provide biomarker evidence for GLYX-13 effects on neural systems underlying these cognitive processes.</detailed_description>
