	<brief_summary>This is a 12-week clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of memantine hydrochloride (Memantine HC1, brand name Namenda) in the treatment of executive function deficits (EFDs) in adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). After screening procedures, memantine is prescribed in randomized, double-blind fashion (equal chance of medication or placebo) for 12 weeks. The investigators hypothesize that memantine hydrochloride will prove to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated agent for the treatment of EFDs in individuals with ADHD interested in non-stimulant medications.</brief_summary>
