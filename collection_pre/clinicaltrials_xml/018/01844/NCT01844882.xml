	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a debilitating condition in which there is a gradual decline of renal function associated with increased overall mortality. Most dietary guidelines for CKD focus on limiting protein intake (nitrogen) and high phosphorus-containing foods. However, increasing dietary fiber has been proposed to increase fecal nitrogen excretion which may ameliorate the progress of CKD. We therefore plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical trials to assess the effect of fiber on urea and creatinine as classical markers of a state of uremia in individuals with CKD. We hypothesize that increasing fiber intakes will improve urea and creatinine levels in individuals with CKD.</brief_summary>
