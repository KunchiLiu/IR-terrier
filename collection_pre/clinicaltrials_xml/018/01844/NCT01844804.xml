	<brief_summary>In this study, healthy volunteers will receive a single intravenous dose of either PF-06438179 or infliximab (United States) or infliximab (European Union). During the course of the study, the pharmacokinetics will be assessed by sampling the levels of drug in the blood, and by comparing these levels among the different administration arms of PF-06438179 and the licensed infliximab products. Safety, tolerability, and immunologic response will also be evaluated throughout.</brief_summary>
