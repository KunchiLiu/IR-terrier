	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) using rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) (Thymoglobuline, Genzyme) for patients with very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) and severe aplastic anemia (SAA) as a primary therapy. The primary endpoint is the response rate (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) at day 180 after the start of IST. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of the presence and frequency of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-reactivation and EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV-LPD), Cytomegalovirus(CMV)-reactivation and CMV associated diseases, the response rate (CR+PR) on Day 360 after the start of IST, relapse rate and overall survival.</brief_summary>
