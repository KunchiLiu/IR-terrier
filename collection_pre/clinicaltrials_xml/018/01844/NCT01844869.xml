	<brief_title>An Open-Label Study to Investigate the Pharmacokinetics of Omacetaxine Mepesuccinate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, nonrandomized study to determine the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of omacetaxine and its metabolites following a sc dosage of 1.25 mg/m2 in adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies or advanced solid tumors. The study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days, followed by a 7-day pharmacokinetic assessment period (period A) that includes administration of a single radiolabeled dose of omacetaxine, an open-label treatment period of up to six 28-day cycles (period B), and a final assessment to occur approximately 28±7 days after the end of the last treatment cycle. Period B will begin after collection of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic sample during period A.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent is obtained. The patient is at least 18 years of age at the time of informed consent. The patient has a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of any of the following: Relapsed or refractory leukemia, including Philadelphia chromosomepositive (Ph+), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Advanced solid tumors (ie, breast, lung, head/neck, colorectal, melanoma, and sarcoma). The malignancy must be considered unresponsive to accepted available therapies. The patient has an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2. Other criteria apply. The patient has had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radioimmunotherapy, or immunotherapy within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug or has not recovered from adverse events due to any agents administered previously. For patients who received therapy with mitomycin C, the interval is 42 days. The patient is receiving any other treatment for hematologic/nonhematologic malignancy. The patient has had previous treatment with omacetaxine. The patient has been treated with any hematopoietic growth factors within 14 days of study entry (patients on chronic erythropoiesis stimulating agents are allowed). The patient has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 3 or 4 heart disease, active ischemia, or any uncontrolled, unstable cardiac condition for which treatment for the condition is indicated but is not controlled despite adequate therapy, including angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, or congestive heart failure. The patient has experienced a myocardial infarction within the previous 12 weeks. The patient has a solid tumor with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases. The patient has an active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered opportunistic, life threatening, or clinically significant at the time of treatment. Other criteria apply.</criteria>
