	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Tenofovir Plus Lamivudine Plus Efavirenz Regimen as First-line Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, open-label, multi-centered clinical trial to assess the virologic suppression and immune recovery rates as well as tolerability of the regimen 3TC+TDF+EFV in ARV-naive Chinese population. 500 eligible participants will be recruited to take the regimen If the patient fails to tolerate EFV, it can be substituted by NVP when CD4 &lt; 250/μL, and by LPV/r when CD4 &gt; 250/uL. If the patient fails to tolerate TDF, AZT will be an alternative, except when Hb &lt; 90/L or neutrophil count &lt; 0.75×109/L. The participants will be followed up by months 0.5, 1, 2 ,3 and every 3 months subsequently for 2 years. The efficacy of the regimen will be evaluated by comparison between different points along the time line and previous regimens. The safety of the regimen will be assessed by monitoring kidney function, bone density, cardiovascular profile, lipid profile, liver function etc as well as other adverse events.</detailed_description>
