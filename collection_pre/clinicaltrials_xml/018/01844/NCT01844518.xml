	<criteria>JIA subjects (male or female), ages 217 years with active disease who had an insufficient therapeutic response or intolerance to at least one non biologic DMARD or Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNFα) antagonists for at least 3 months prior to screening Subjects with TNFα inadequate response (or prior biologic) will be restricted to 30% of the population Subjects must have a history of at least 5 joints with active disease and must have currently active articular disease with ≥2 active joints and ≥2 joints with limitation of motion. Subjects with other rheumatic diseases or major chronic inflammatory/immunologic diseases, active uveitis, systemic JIA with active systemic features (within a period of 6 months prior to enrollment), persistent Oligoarthritis JIA, or failed 3 or more TNFα antagonists or other biological DMARDs will be excluded. Active systemic disease: (ie, extraarticular features of systemic JIA including fever, rash, organomegaly) within a period of 6 months prior to randomization. Subjects who have failed more than two TNFα antagonists or other biologic DMARDs</criteria>
