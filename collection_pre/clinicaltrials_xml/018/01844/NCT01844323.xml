	<brief_summary>The particle size of the active ingredient may impact dissolution rate in the gastro intestinal tract and hence the amount of drug available for absorption. Similarly, differences in the percentage of the excipients used in the formulated capsules may affect dissolution rate. The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect that particle size and percentage of excipients could have in drug absorption, which will improve the manufacturing process of the formulated capsules.</brief_summary>
