	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, 3-period, fixed-sequence study will evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of vemurafenib on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of tizanidine in participants with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic malignancies. Participants will receive a single oral dose of tizanidine on Day 1, vemurafenib orally twice daily on Days 2 to 21, and tizanidine and vemurafenib on Day 22. Eligible participants will have the option to continue treatment with vemurafenib as part of an extension study (NCT01739764).</brief_summary>
