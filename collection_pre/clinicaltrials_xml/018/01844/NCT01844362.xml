	<brief_summary>Uterus transplantation, as a possible future treatment for uterine factor infertility, has been developed in animal species during the last decade. The study protocol includes transplantation of the uterus from a live donor (mother, relative, friend) into women with absolute uterine factor infertility (lack of uterus from birth or due to life saving hysterectomy).The recipient will be treated by standard immunosuppression and transfer of embryos (acquired by IVF before surgery) will be attempted when at least 12 months have passed from transplantation. Approval for a case series including up to 10 patients has been acquired.</brief_summary>
