	<brief_summary>Since docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) level in sperm membrane has been shown to be decreased in asthenozoospermic men, the investigators hypothesized that DHA supplementation may improve it. Furthermore, the investigators added vitamin E to it to protect its unsaturated bonds which are susceptible to oxidation and production of free oxygen radicals.</brief_summary>
