	<brief_summary>Recently, it has been shown that salt (ClNa, sodium chloride) can modulate the differentiation of human and mouse TH17 cells. Indeed, mice feed with high sodium diet were described to develop more aggressive course of EAE (Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis). However, the role of sodium intake in MS has not been investigated. In this study we investigate the effect of sodium intake in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) clinical and radiological activity.</brief_summary>
