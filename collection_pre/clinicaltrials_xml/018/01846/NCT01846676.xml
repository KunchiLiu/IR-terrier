	<brief_summary>- Introduction: Hearing loss is a prevalent condition in elderly population. However, the low adherence to hearing aids is a fact, with an estimation of use of 50 per cent.

The study hypothesis is that a counseling program will improve adherence to hearing aids in elderly population. - Objective: To evaluate the utility of a standardized counselling program in patients with hearing loss. - Material and Methods: A before/after trial will be carried out, approved by the Hospital ethics - committee.

	<detailed_description>- Introduction: Hearing loss is a prevalent condition in elderly population. However, the low adherence to hearing aids is a fact, with an estimation of use of 50 per cent. In Chile, hearing aids are provided by the State for elderly population. In 2007 there was designed a rehabilitation program called Active Communication Education (ACE), that is a semistructured rehabilitation program for people with hearing loss, which aims to improve rehabilitation of hearing aids users by a strategy based on problem solution. - The study hypothesis is that a counseling program will improve adherence to hearing aids in elderly population. - Objective: To evaluate the utility of a standardized counseling program in patients with hearing loss. - Material and Methods: A before/after clinical trial will be carried out, approved by the Hospital ethics - committee. Patients with 65 years and older diagnosed by pure tone audiometry who are beneficiaries of the Public GES hearing loss programme and receive a hearing aid will be included. The subjects will be randomized in two branches: Active branch, subject to the rehabilitation program; and passive branch, which was control, with usual management (no intervention). To assess adherence we will use the IOI-HA scale.</detailed_description>
