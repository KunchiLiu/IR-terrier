	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of trabectedin+DOXIL as a third-line chemotherapy regimen (treatment) in patients with platinum-sensitive advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing the Combination of Trabectedin (YONDELIS) and DOXIL/CAELYX With DOXIL/CAELYX for the Treatment of Advanced-Relapsed Epithelial Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (individuals assigned to study treatment by chance), open - label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), active - controlled study in adult female patients with platinum-sensitive advanced - relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum - based chemotherapy. Approximately 670 participants will be enrolled. Patients will be stratified by 4 criteria defined in the protocol and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy group (Arm A) or to the DOXIL (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) monotherapy group (Arm B). During the treatment phase, patients will receive study drug infusions according to 21 - day cycles in Arm A and 28 - day cycles in Arm B. Treatment will continue until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment toxicity, or until 2 cycles after assessment of a complete response (CR). Efficacy assessments will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Disease assessments, including assessments for patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, will be performed until disease progression, the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or the clinical cutoff date. Collection of survival status will continue until at least 514 deaths have been observed. Serial pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected in a subset of patients who voluntarily consent to the PK portion of the study. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. An interim analysis of overall survival (OS) will be performed after approximately 308 participants have died. The final analysis of OS will occur when approximately 514 deaths have been observed.</detailed_description>
