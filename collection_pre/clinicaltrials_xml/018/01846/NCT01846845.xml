	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Novel Transfemoral Prosthetic Socket System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional transfemoral socket designs impose an array of limitations on transfemoral amputee patients. Flexion, extension, and abduction are considerably impaired and end basic functions like sitting are usually uncomfortable or even painful. An alternative socket design that lowers the socket trim-lines and still provides structural support would greatly improve the socket comfort for transfemoral amputees.</detailed_description>
