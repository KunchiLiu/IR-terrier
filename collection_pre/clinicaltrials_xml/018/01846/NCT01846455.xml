	<detailed_description>This will be a multi-center, open-label study. After providing informed consent, subjects will undergo an outpatient screening period of up to 21 days. Screening procedures will include an assessment of mental status which will be repeated before dosing. Eligible subjects will then undergo hospital intake procedures and reside at the investigational site until Day 5. Subjects will be enrolled in 5-treatment groups as follows: (1) Group 1: Subjects with hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh A; (2) Group 2: Subjects with hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh B; (3) Group 3: Subjects with hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh C; (4) Group 4: Subjects with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection but without hepatic impairment; and (5) Group 5: Subjects without hepatic disease or impairment. Group 5 is used as a control group</detailed_description>
