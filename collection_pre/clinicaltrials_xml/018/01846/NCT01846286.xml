	<brief_title>Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete the following tests and procedures at the beginning and at the end of the study (about 3 months later): - You will complete 5 questionnaires about any pain and other symptoms you may have had, your general well-being, drugs you may be taking, and personal information, such as your age. The questionnaires will take about 25-50 minutes to complete. - You will have sensory testing. These tests will measure your sensitivity to touch, coolness, warmth, hot/cold feeling, and pin pricks. The sensory tests will take about 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to learn if you are more likely to have chronic pain. During already scheduled clinic visits, about every 6-8 weeks, you will complete a questionnaire about pain you may be having. This questionnaire will take about 5-10 minutes to complete. Length of Study: You will be on study for about 6-12 months. Additional Information: All of the tests and procedures described above will be scheduled for you to complete during your regularly scheduled clinic visits. Any information that is collected about your symptoms will be used for the purposes of this research study only. If you are having any severe and/or intolerable symptoms, you should contact the study doctor or study nurse right away. This is an investigational study. Up to 1200 will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aim 1: Discovery Phase: The samples are from a large NIHfunded Genomewide association study of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Shete; PI). A total of 2900 "case" patients and 1200 control patients were recruited for the study. In this study, researchers will only use cases who were: Newly diagnosed, untreated, histopathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx No previous cancers Age 18 years or older white Caucasian. Aim 2: Newly diagnosed patients (have not had any prior cancer treatment) with locoregional squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck Will receive cancer treatment at MDACC Are 18 years or older English or Spanish speaking Able to understand the description of the study and give written informed consent Will state that they will receive followup at MD Anderson posttreatment Selfreported Caucasian White This sample will also be included in the Validation Phase of Aim 1. We note that population stratification, i.e., the presence of a systematic difference in allele frequencies between subpopulations in a population possibly due to different ancestry, is an issue for genetic association studies. Thus, researchers focus on white caucasians in this particular study. Aim 3: Patients included in aims 1 and 2. Aim 2: Patients with distant metastasis (Stage IVC) Patients participating in clinical trials/ investigational drugs for pain control. Aim 1 (discovery phase) and Aim 3 will use existing data.</criteria>
