	<brief_title>Intravitreal Anti-VEGF in Exudative AMD With Epiretinal Membranes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gass in 1987 described three cases of epiretinal membrane (ERM) associated with wet macular degeneration. Since then we have seen that is not rare to find the coexistence of these entities. An ERM may produce intrinsic disorganization of the outer retina leading to persistent increased macular thickness and/or edema. This persistent edema may affect the effectiveness in the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration (eAMD). Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of significant ERM on the visual and anatomic outcomes of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for eAMD.</detailed_description>
