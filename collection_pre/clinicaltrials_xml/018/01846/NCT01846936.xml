	<brief_summary>One lung ventilation (OLV) is accomplished with a double lumen tube (DLT) or a bronchial blocker (BB). In this study, the investigators compared the effectiveness of lung collapse using DLT, BB with spontaneous collapse, and BB with disconnection technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disconnection Technique With a Bronchial Blocker for Improving Lung Deflation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In selecting this maneuver of OLV, lung collapse is a major concern because it permits adequate surgical exposure. Although once lung deflation was achieved, the overall clinical performance appears to be similar, BB takes longer to deflate the operative lung and there is some conflict reports as to BB provides a similar degree of lung deflation compared to that of DLT. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of BB and DLT for achieving lung collapse, and to evaluate the efficacy of disconnection technique with monitoring the carbon dioxide trace on a capnograph in BB. The investigators further evaluated the disconnection time, which is the time to loss of carbon dioxide trace on the capnograph, needed to facilitate lung collapse.</detailed_description>
