	<brief_title>Decitabine and Midostaurin in Treating Older Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with decitabine, a cytidine analog, then midostaurin, a multi-target protein kinase inhibitor (PKI), may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newlydiagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) per the World Health Organization [WHO] 2008 classification [except t(15;17)], including: De novo AML Secondary AML Secondary AML arising from previouslydiagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) treated with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) (ie, decitabine or azacitidine) FLT3ITD mutation confirmed in bone marrow aspirate Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.5 ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min Ejection fraction ≥ 50% by echocardiogram Unwillingness or inability to receive conventional chemotherapy Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements Life expectancy &gt; 2 months Receiving concomitant treatment with other antineoplastic agents (EXCEPTION: hydroxyurea). Prior treatment with DNMTi therapy (ie, decitabine or azacitidine) for MDS is allowed Received antineoplastic treatment within 4 weeks prior to enrollment (EXCEPTION: hydroxyurea) Received any surgical procedure, excluding central venous catheter placement or other minor procedures (eg, skin biopsy) within 14 days of study day 1 Received any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to enrollment Previous or current history of a myeloproliferative disease Known active central nervous system (CNS) malignancy Any other known disease (except carcinoma insitu), concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition which could compromise participation in the study (eg, uncontrolled diabetes; cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure; myocardial infarction within 6 months with poorly controlled hypertension; chronic renal disease; active uncontrolled infection) Active opportunistic infection or treatment for opportunistic infection within 4 weeks of first day of study drug dosing Known confirmed diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active viral hepatitis Known impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of midostaurin History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to midostaurin and/or decitabine Impaired cardiac function including any of the following: Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) with a corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 450 msec Bradycardia defined as heart rate (HR) &lt; 50 beats per minute (bpm) Right bundle branch block + left anterior hemiblock (bifascicular block) Patients with myocardial infarction or unstable angina &lt; 3 months prior to starting study drug Congestive heart failure (CHF) New York (NY) Heart Association class III or IV Inability to swallow or absorb drug Other medical or psychiatric illness or organ dysfunction or laboratory abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's safety or interfere with data interpretation Unwillingness or inability to comply with the protocol Pregnant nursing (lactating) Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, UNLESS they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 3 months after midostaurin medication; highly effective contraception methods as follows: Total abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject [periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception] Female sterilization (surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy; or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment). In case of oophorectomy alone, reproductive status must be confirmed by followup hormone level assessment Male sterilization, at least 6 months prior to screening (for female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject) Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c): Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%), eg, hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. For oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository</criteria>
