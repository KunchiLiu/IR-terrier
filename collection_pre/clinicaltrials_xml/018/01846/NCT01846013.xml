Hypotheses: 1. Compared to the control group, total physical activity will be higher in the standing and walking intervention groups. 2. The combined standing and walking group will have higher total physical activity than the other three groups. 3. Compared to the control group, the fitness and health outcomes will be improved for the standing and walking groups.</brief_summary>
