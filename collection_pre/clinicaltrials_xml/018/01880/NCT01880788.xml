	<brief_summary>The study will be designed as a case control evaluation to compare the genetic profiles of three groups of patients categorized according to diagnosis. Group 1 - CNV secondary to CSC Group 2 - CSC without CNV Group 3 - CNV secondary to advanced AMD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis of Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Masquerading as Neovascular AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine if patients presenting with type 1 neovascularization believed to be secondary to CSC are genetically distinct from typical CSC patients without neovascularization or patients presenting with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to advanced AMD. Disease associated markers detecting variants in ARMS 2, Complement Factor H (CFH) Complement component 3 (C3), Complement component 2 (C2) , Factor B (FB), VEGFA or other genetic polymorphisms associated with CNV will be evaluated to determine if the CSC neovascular group is genetically distinct from the CSC group without neovascularization or the advanced AMD group.</detailed_description>
