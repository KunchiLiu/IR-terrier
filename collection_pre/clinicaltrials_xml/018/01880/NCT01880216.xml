	<brief_summary>Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common but under-diagnosed medical condition that occurs when a thrombus forms in one of the large veins, usually in the lower limbs, leading to either partial or complete blocked circulation. The condition may progress to severe health complications, such as pulmonary embolism (PE), if not diagnosed and treated in a timely and effective manner. The goal of the therapy for lower-extremity DVT is to prevent the extension of thrombus and pulmonary embolism in the short term and to prevent recurrent events in the long-term. Although anticoagulant therapy decreases the risk of recurrent thrombosis, the treatment also increases the risk for major hemorrhage. This trial aims to optimize the current medical knowledge on the effectiveness and safety of two low molecular weight heparins, bemiparin and enoxaparin in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Bemiparin Versus Enoxaparin in the Treatment of DVT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to demonstrate the therapeutic non-inferiority of bemiparin sodium (LMWH) versus enoxaparin sodium (LMWH) during a 7±2 days treatment period and a follow up of 11 weeks observation period. Primary endpoint: The percentage of patients with an improvement in thrombotic burden at Visit 3 (Day 83) defined as a ≥4-point reduction in thrombus score (or at least halving the thrombus score, when the total score is ≤ 6), without confirmed symptomatic extension of recurrence of DVT, confirmed symptomatic PE, or VTE-related death at Visit 3 (Day 83 / Month 3), as measured by complete compression ultrasound (cCUS) by Duplex sonography according to a standardized protocol. Secondary endpoint: The secondary efficacy endpoints are defined as the: • Incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolic events (VTE) at Visit 3 (Day 83: - Recurrent DVT - Pulmonary embolism Incusion criteria: Patients with acute deep-vein thrombosis of the leg (DVT) with symptoms of less than 14 days, confirmed by complete compression ultrasound (cCUS) within 48 hours prior study start. Patients who have given their signed declaration of consent and data protection declaration Males and females aged 18 years</detailed_description>
