	<brief_summary>The proposed study is a post marketing, observational, retrospective data collection intended to gather and record data on patients treated with the ColonRing device in routine clinical practice at 4-6 centers. The data will assist in future evaluating the performance of the ColonRing device in regards to the creation of a colorectal anastomosis in Low Anterior Resection procedures. Hypothesis: The performance of the ColonRing, determined by the rate of complications, will be within the acceptable range reported in the literature for alternative treatment modalities.</brief_summary>
