	<brief_summary>Non-contrast MRI with T2 fat suppression has been a useful imaging modality in evaluation spinal trauma. However, the role of contrast enhancement has not investigated in patients with spinal trauma. Therefore, this prospective study aims to evaluate the usefulness of contrast enhanced MRI for spinal trauma W/U clinically. The study hypothesis is that there is no additional gain in addition of contrast enhanced study to routine non-contrast MRI.</brief_summary>
