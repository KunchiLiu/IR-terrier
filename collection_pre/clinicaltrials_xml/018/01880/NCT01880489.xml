	<brief_summary>The objective is to expand and refine an intervention for transgender women (TW) into a 7-session individual- and group-based intervention that is scalable for community settings to reduce sexual risk and substance use and to increase stigma-coping and risk-buffering behaviors among TW in NYC. The investigators will pilot test the intervention with 20 TW and subsequently, conduct a randomized controlled trial with 240 TW to compare the intervention to a wait list control condition.</brief_summary>
