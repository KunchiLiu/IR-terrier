	<brief_summary>Oncologic patients often report increased fatigue during and after chemotherapy. Evidence suggests Tai-chi/Qi-gong may improve quality of life (QOL) in oncologic patients treated with chemotherapy. Previous studies, mostly performed in a population of breast cancer patients, have demonstrated the benefits of Tai-chi/Qi-gong practice in improving quality of life (1), reducing bone resorption (2), preventing the decrease of blood counts (WBC and Hb) (3), and reducing inflammation (4). The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of Tai-chi/Qi-gong on QOL, sleep, and fatigue in patients with gynecological malignancies, particularly in patients with ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tai-chi / Qi-gong in Patients With Patients With Gynecological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tai-chi/Qi-gong is a complementary medicine technique that synergizes the mind-body connection. The technique employs a series of positions and movements that are performed in a slow, flowing manner to help a person concentrate on breathing and motion. The effect of Tai-chi/Qi-gong on fatigue, quality of life, and quality of sleep will be assessed in gynecological cancer patients. This trial will recruit 60 patients with gynecological malignancies, who receive first or second line chemotherapy. The patients will be allocated according to their preference to either the study or the control group. The Tai-chi/Qi-gong classes will take place once a week, for 10 consecutive weeks, at the facilities of the gyneco-oncology department. All patients will fill out the questionnaires at the beginning of the study, after 5 weeks, and upon the completion of the study (10 weeks).</detailed_description>
