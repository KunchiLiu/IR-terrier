	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and efficacy of vismodegib in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and relapsed/refractory high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients in Cohort 1 will receive single-agent vismodegib 150 mg orally daily. In Cohort 2, patients will receive vismodegib 150 mg orally daily in combination with cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously for 10 days. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient withdrawal of consent.</brief_summary>
