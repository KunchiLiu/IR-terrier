	<brief_summary>The modified Atkins diet is a non-pharmacologic therapy for intractable childhood epilepsy that was designed to be a less restrictive alternative to the traditional ketogenic diet. This diet is started on an outpatient basis without a fast, allows unlimited protein and fat, and does not restrict calories or fluids. Modified Atkins diet is of special importance in resource constraint settings with paucity of trained dieticians. However, there is paucity published data on the use of the modified Atkins diet in refractory epilepsy in young children. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the modified Atkins diet in refractory epilepsy in young children.</brief_summary>
