	<brief_summary>This study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-month interprofessional community-based health promotion program, and explore its effects on older adults' self-management of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). Recently enrolled clients of Diabetes Care Guelph (DCG), who are age 65+ and have at least two other chronic conditions, will be eligible to participate. Participants must be English speaking, community-dwelling, independent in activities of daily living, and mentally competent to give informed consent. The 6-month intervention will consist of: in-home visits by a Registered Nurse and Registered Dietitian from DCG; participation in a monthly Diabetes Wellness Day group program offered through the Guelph Wellington Seniors Association (GWSA) together with DCG; peer support from trained volunteers at the Diabetes Wellness Day group program; care coordination by the DCG Registered Nurse to help participants access necessary supports and services; and monthly team conferences between care providers at DCG and the GWSA to develop a client-centred plan of care. To evaluate the program, participants will complete interviewer-administered questionnaires before and after the intervention, and care providers and peer volunteers will take part in group interviews.</brief_summary>
