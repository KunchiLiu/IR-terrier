	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to estimate the proportions of vestibular schwannomas (VS) and meningiomas after 10 days of exposure to the study drug RAD001 at a dose of 10 mg daily, as determined by immunohistochemistry. This is a "phase 0" PK (pharmacokinetic) and PD (pharmacodynamic) study of RAD001 in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 2-related and sporadic VS and meningiomas. Enrolled patients will take RAD001 prior to a scheduled VS or meningioma surgery, and blood and tissue samples will be obtained for further analysis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must satisfy all of the following eligibility criteria: Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 60% Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm³ (unsupported) Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ (unsupported) Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl (transfusion support allowed) Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN*) OR corrected glomerular filtration rate ≥ 70 ml/min Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN* ALT ≤ 2.5 times ULN* Serum albumin ≥ 2 g/dl INR &lt; 1.3 (or &lt; 3 on anticoagulants) Patients taking a cholesterollowering agent must be on a single medication and on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks Fasting serum cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dl OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/l AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 times ULN*. Fully recovered from acute toxic effects of any prior chemotherapy, biological modifiers or radiotherapy Any neurologic deficits must be stable for ≥ 1 week Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. The antiproliferative activity of this experimental drug may be harmful to the developing fetus. Able to provide written informed consent Patients with any of the following are ineligible for this research study: Patients with VS or meningiomas deemed very high surgical risk for stroke and/or other complications by the attending surgeon, such as meningiomas with major vascular or dural sinus infiltration. Patients with serious concurrent infection or medical illness, which would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the treatment outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety. Symptomatic congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris. Uncontrolled diabetes, as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5 times ULN*. Current active hepatic or biliary disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, or chronic persistent hepatitis (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome and asymptomatic gallstones). History of hepatitis B or C. Note: A detailed assessment of hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done at screening for all patients. HBV serology, DNA and/or HCV RNA PCR testing are required at screening for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors and/or confirmation of prior HBV/HCV infection. If no positive medical history for risk factors, serology is not required. Seropositivity or DNA/RNA positivity for hepatitis B or C, with the exception of patients who have received prior Hepatitis B vaccination and are AntiHBs positive only. Known HIV seropositivity Neurologic deficits that are rapidly progressing: all neurologic signs and symptoms must have been stable for a week prior to first dose Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. The antiproliferative activity of this experimental drug may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant. Antitumor therapy (i.e. chemotherapeutics or investigational agents or immunotherapy) within 4 weeks prior to enrollment Radiation therapy to a study target lesion within 6 months Prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors, including sirolimus, temsirolimus, deforolimus within 6 months prior to enrollment Known hypersensitivity to RAD001 or other rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus, deforolimus) Patients with a concurrent malignancy Patients treatment with systemic steroids or another immunosuppressive agent. Patients with endocrine deficiencies are allowed to receive physiologic or stress doses of steroids if necessary. Patients cannot receive CYP3A4 inhibiting drugs including antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin), antiHIV agents (delaviridine, nelfinavir, amprenavir, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir), antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole at doses &gt; 200 mg/day, voriconazole), antidepressants (nefazodone, fluovoxamine), calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) oramiodarone Patients should avoid CYP3A4 inhibiting foods including grapefruit and Seville orange juice. Patients cannot receive CYP3A4 inducing anticonvulsants including carbamazepine, felbamate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and oxcarbazepine, or other CYP3A4 inducers such as St. John's Wort Patients who previously received CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors must have discontinued these medications within at least 1 week prior to study entry and can restart them 1 week postoperatively (or earlier if determined to be of clinical benefit, as determined by the treating physician). of institutional norms</criteria>
