	<brief_summary>1. Target population:locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (LAGC, cT2~3/N+M0,or cT4aN+M0);no previous chemo or radio therapy. 2. Primary objective:Response rate of XELOX in the neoadjuvant setting of LAGC. Secondary objectives: - The progression free survival (PFS) in the perioperative treatment of locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (cT3/N+M0,or cT4aN+M0); - percentage of pathological response ; percentage of grade 3 or 4 adverse events as safety profile of perioperative treatments; - D2 resection -rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy of XELOX; - Overall survival; - QOL during the whole period of treatment. 3. Trial design:This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Oxaliplatin plus capecitabine(XELOX) in the perioperative treatment of locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in combination with D2 resection. 4. Treatment plan:Patients will be given the perioperative chemotherapy as below once recruited:Schedule of Oxaliplatin plus capecitabine (XELOX) will be as follow: Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 ，bid,d 1~14 every 3 weeks(treatment for 2 weeks and rest 1 week)Oxaliplatin：130mg/m2， iv infusion over 2h，d1,every 3 weeks. 5. Number of subjects:50 patients.Number of centers 5 sites, which have the high volume of gastric operations in China, more than 500 per year.</brief_summary>
