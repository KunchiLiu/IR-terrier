	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether mothers with Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has antibodies against platelets in breastfeeding milk aside control group of healthy mothers. In order to prevent severe thrombocytopenia in infants born to mothers with ITP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunoglobulins Anti Platelets In Breast Milk Of Maternal ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Samples of breastfeeding milk and sera will be collected from 10 lactating women diagnosed with ITP and from 10 healthy women in the same stage after giving birth. Antibodies against platelets in the samples will be examined by using anti human IgM/G/A antibody following incubation of the serum/milk samples with platelets. The platelets will be from leftovers of samples send to platelets functionality test and found to be normal (the platelets samples will be taken without any identification and be marked only with lab number). The measurement will be done by flow cytometer. Sample will be consider as positive when the signal will be greater than 2 fold of control samples standard deviation. In addition, the presence of antibodies in different times from the birth will be checked in breastfeeding milk and sera of ITP patients. If the milk proteins and lipids will disturb the exam, the immunoglobulins from the milk will be isolated using Ig isolation kit from plasma.</detailed_description>
