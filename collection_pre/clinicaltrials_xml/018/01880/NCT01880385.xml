	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Bevacizumab in the Neodjuvant Treatment of Inflammatory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pilot study evaluating the safety and efficacy of adding Bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients presenting non metastatic inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Patients will receive 4 cycles of chemotherapy FEC100 associating Fluorouracil (500 mg/m2), Epirubicin (100 mg/m2), Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) and Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every at day 1 of ecah 21 days cycle for 4 cycles. Six weeks after the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients will undergo mastectomy and 4 cycles of Docetaxel (100 mg/m2)as adjuvant chemotherapy +/-Trastuzumab 8 mg/kg for the first cycle then 6mg/kg every 3 weeks for 17 cycles if tumor overexpress Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy, i.e. pathologic complete response (pCR) after 4 cycles of FEC100+Bevacizumab in IBC</detailed_description>
