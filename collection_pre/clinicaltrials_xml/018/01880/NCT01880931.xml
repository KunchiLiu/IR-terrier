	<brief_title>The Effect Site Concentration of Remifentanil for Preventing QTc Interval Prolongation During Intubation in Normotensive and Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is known that anesthetic agents can influence the QTc. In addition, tracheal intubation during induction can stimulates sympathetic activity, which, as a results, prolong the QTc interval. Therefore, the aim of study is to find out the effect site concentration of remifentanil for preventing QTc interval prolongation during intubation under propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in normotensive and hypertensive patients.</detailed_description>
