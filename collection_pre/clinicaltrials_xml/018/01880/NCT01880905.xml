	<brief_summary>Ovarian torsion is one of the gynecological emergency. This complication requires high clinical suspicion and early detection, to prevent permanent loss of ovarian function. The long uterine ovarian ligament could be a risk factor for ovarian torsion. We want to measure the uterine ovarian ligament length during routine laparoscopy/laparotomy and to compare the length between the torsion group and other non torsion patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Length of Uteroovarian Ligament and the Risk of Ovarian Torsion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Female patient who are going to undergo laparoscopy/laparotomy for any gynecological reason will ask to participate. During the operation the uteroovarian ligament length will be measure by sterile ruler (calibrated plastic device 1 mm in diameter). The length of uteroovarian ligament will compared between the patient who will diagnose with ovarian torsion (study group) and the other women (control group)</detailed_description>
