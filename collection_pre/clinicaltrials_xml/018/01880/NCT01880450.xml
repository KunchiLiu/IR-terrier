	<brief_summary>Project Prepared is a theoretically based, comprehensive, intensive group intervention that is designed to prepare early adolescents for middle adolescence and its challenges. It emphasizes skills in avoiding risky sexual situations, and provides medically accurate information about sexual development, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. Effectiveness is measured by using a randomized control trial design and tracking differences in cognitive factors (HIV/STI (Sexually Transmitted Infections) knowledge, sexual self-efficacy; intention to use a condom); relationship factors (immature romantic beliefs, relationship self-efficacy), gender norms (macho man, powerless female), and resilience.</brief_summary>
