	<brief_summary>1. Objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of an SR 75 mg tramadol/650 mg acetaminophen formulation compared with an immediate release (IR) 37.5 mg tramadol/325 mg acetaminophen formulation after a single dose and at steady state 2. Subjects: Healthy subject 3. Methods: A phase I study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic sustained release and immediate release treatment profiles at steady state.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study was open, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment multiple-dose crossover study of immediate release treatment and sustained release treatment was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics after a 2-day repeated administration in which the steady state was achieved.</detailed_description>
