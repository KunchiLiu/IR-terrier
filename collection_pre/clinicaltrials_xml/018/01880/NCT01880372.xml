	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of alpha lipoic acid in patients who have moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The primary aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the addition of alpha lipoic acid in a diabetic patient's therapeutic regimen can decrease the progression of diabetic retinopathy and preserve visual acuity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Alpha Lipoic Acid for the Treatment and Prevention of Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased production of free radicals and depletion of antioxidants are commonly observed in diabetic patients. Based on animal studies, increased production of free radicals tends to persist even after blood glucose is tightly controlled. The rationale of using a potent antioxidant is based on the observation that increased oxidative stress associated with hyperglycemia can contribute to cellular injury leading to apoptosis; consequently, leading to diabetic retinopathy. Evidence from animal model showed that alpha lipoic acid (a potent antioxidant) was effective for decreasing the progression of diabetic retinopathy and in reducing free radicals. Therefore, we hypothesize that therapy that can exert a powerful antioxidant activity can provide a therapeutic modality needed to target the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. This study will be a 12-month pilot study demonstrating the role of alpha lipoic acid in patients who have moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Eligible patients will be randomized to two groups, treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group will receive 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid daily with routine care while patient in control group will only follow routine care. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)and electronic visual acuity testing algorithm (ETDRS) will be used to measure changes in retinal thickness and visual acuity respectively. Blood changes in macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), vascular endothelia growth factor (VEGF), Interferon 2 alpha, interleukin 6 and 8 will also be evaluated and compared between the two groups. Descriptive statistics and intention to treat analysis will be used to compare treatment and control groups.</detailed_description>
