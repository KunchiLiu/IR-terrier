	<brief_summary>The primary aims of this study are to: 1. Quantify serotonin transporter (5-HTT) binding potential (BP) in vivo in bipolar disorder patients (BPD) during a major depressive episode (MDE). 2. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HTT. 3. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HT1A BP. 4. Assess the effect of lamotrigine treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HTT and 5-HT1A BP. 5. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of unipolar depression on 5-HTT BP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET and MRI Brain Imaging of Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PET and MRI imaging will be used to investigate the aims described above in patients who have bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and are currently experiencing a depressive episode. Both healthy controls and depressed participants with bipolar disorder or unipolar depression will be recruited. Patients who are on medication before enrolling in the study will have a three week washout. At baseline, healthy controls and patients will have an MRI consisting of both structural and functional sequences. Psychological measures will also be obtained at baseline. Within one week of the MRI, both patients and healthy controls will have one CUMI and one DASB PET scan. Following the baseline PET scans, patient participants will begin medication treatment with either lithium or lamotrigine, based on the clinical judgement of the treating psychiatrist. Psychological measures will be obtained every 2 weeks. After 6 weeks of medication treatment at a therapeutic dose, patients will be assessed for remission (defined as a 50% decrease in the HDRS score from baseline). If this criteria is met, patient participants will then have follow-up PET scans (one CUMI and one DASB). If this criteria is not met, the patient will be switched to the other medication under study and will be reevaluated after an additional 4 weeks of medication treatment. Patients who still do not demonstrate a 50% decrease in their HDRS will be considered non-responders and will have repeat CUMI and DASB scans.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PATIENTS BIPOLAR Bipolar patients suffering from a major depressive episode currently or recently (in the month prior to scanning). Patients on psychiatric medication will have failed their current regimen for the treatment of their depression: they will meet criteria for depression, be seeking treatment for it, and have been on an adequate dose of antidepressant or mood stabilizer (as defined by the Antidepressant Treatment Form—see Oquendo et al., 2003) for 4 weeks or more. Of sufficient severity to score at least 15 on the first 17 items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or a score of 10 to 14 on the first 17 items of the Hamilton Depression Scale in conjunction with a score of at least 29 on the Beck Depression Inventory. Age range 1865 years. Off all psychotropic and other types of drugs likely to interact with serotonin transporters and 5HT1A receptors for at least 21 days. Allowed shortacting benzodiazepines for distressing anxiety or insomnia (up to 24 hours prior to each PET scan). Patients will be off neuroleptics for 3 weeks and off fluoxetine for 6 weeks prior to study. Off serotonin depleting drugs such as reserpine for 3 months. Patient will also be off anticoagulant/antiplatelet treatment such as coumadin, with the exception of aspirin for 10 days. Willing to travel for PET scanning Other major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective illness; current drug or alcohol abuse (within past 2 months), or drug or alcohol dependence &lt;6mos ago; anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa in the past year; IV drug use or ecstasy use more than two times. A firstdegree family history of schizophrenia if the subject is less than 33 years old (mean age of onset for schizophrenia plus two standard deviations). Significant active physical illness particularly those that may affect the brain or serotonergic system including blood dyscrasias lymphomas, hypersplenism, endocrinopathies, renal failure or chronic obstructive lung disease, autonomic neuropathies, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, low hemoglobin and malignancy, significant anemic disease or blood loss and the lab parameters platelet count &lt; 80,000.
