	<criteria>1. Patient with histological proven colorectal cancer. 2. Operable liver metastases according to preoperative imagery. Operability is the possibility of treatment by resection and/or local destruction (radiofrequency, cryotherapy…). 3. Patient treated or not with preoperative chemotherapy. 4. With or without extrahepatic metastases 5. Age ≥ 18 years. 6. Radiological assessment by CT and MRI liver and TEPscan within six weeks before surgery. 7. Patient affiliated to the Social Security system. 8. Signed informed consent. 1. Known hypersensitivity to sulfur hexafluoride or another component of SonoVue®. 2. Patients with recent acute coronary syndrome or suffering from unstable ischemic heart disease, especially: evolving myocardial infarction, unstable angina during the last 7 days, recent coronary intervention or another factor suggesting clinical instability, acute heart failure, class III or IV heart failure, severe arrhythmias. 3. Patients with righttoleft shunt, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, uncontrolled systemic hypertension, as patients suffering from respiratory distress syndrome. 4. Pregnant and lactating women. 5. Patients with contraindication for a CT scan, a MRI or a TEP with contrast. 6. Patients with indication of two step liver surgery. 7. Patients already included in the study. 8. Patient who couldn't be treated or followed up according to study criteria for psychological, social, family or geographical reasons. Patient deprived of liberty or under guardianship.</criteria>
