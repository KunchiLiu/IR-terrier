	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of VX-509 in subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on DMARD therapy. This study will enroll subjects who completed a previous designated study with VX-509 (e.g., Study VX12-509-103).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2/3 Open-label Extension Study to Evaluate Long-Term Safety and Efficacy With VX-509 in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VX-509 is an oral, selective Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibitor being developed by Vertex. In autoimmune diseases, JAK3 is an essential component of the immune signaling cascade. This cascade ultimately contributes to abnormal immune response that results in chronic inflammation and, in the case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), irreversible damage to cartilage and bones. Selective inhibition of JAK3 offers a new disease modifying approach to the treatment of RA. This study will follow a "treat to target" (T2T) paradigm. T2T strategies have been followed in non-rheumatologic fields for decades. T2T trials have been conducted for RA from the late 1990's, and have substantiated the concept that treating to a target is associated with a better outcome than standard of care treatment. This has led to recommendations by experts to use T2T strategies in clinical practice.</detailed_description>
