	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help understand the benefits of eating food supplemented with fiber in the form of sugarcane bagasse (the leftover fiber after cane juice is extracted) on glucose metabolism and body weight.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Effects of Short Term Sugarcane Bagasse Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will employ a double-blind randomized controlled study design with 3 arms such that obese, insulin resistant adults will be randomly selected to receive food made with 1) sugarcane bagasse, 2) non-caloric, non-fermentable fiber, or 3) a similar product with minimal fiber for 4 weeks. The intervention will be in the form of brownies and cookies and will look and taste nearly identical to each other. Caloric value will be constant with all three delivery systems. Subjects will have blood testing and body composition analysis before and after the intervention.</detailed_description>
