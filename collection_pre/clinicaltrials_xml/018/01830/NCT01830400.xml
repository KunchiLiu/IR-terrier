	<brief_summary>This was a Non-interventional Prospective Study. Centres enrolled adult patients with partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation for whom the clinician had decided to initiate Eslicarbazepine Acetate (ESL) as an adjunctive therapy prior to the decision to take part in this study. Patients enrolled into the study were not sufficiently controlled with one drug licensed for the use as monotherapy in partial-onset seizures. Patients were seen at baseline and then during normal clinical visits at intervals. Patients in this study were assessed for efficacy and tolerability at baseline and then at least 3 and 6 months after the baseline.</brief_summary>
