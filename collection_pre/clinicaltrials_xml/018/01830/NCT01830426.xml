	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the circulating tumor cell (CTC) assay as a surrogate for tissue diagnosis of suspected primary lung cancer. This is done through evaluating clinical and molecular markers to stratify the outcome/survival in patients with thoracic malignancies treated at Yale University/Yale-New Haven Hospital, University of California San Diego/Moores Cancer Center, Billings Clinic Cancer Center.</brief_summary>
