	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes and the operative costs of appendectomy performed with the Hem-O-Lok polymetric clips compared to endoscopic staplers. Prospective data will be collected before, during, and after surgery on patients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy that have the Hem-o-Lok ® stapler used to close the stump after the appendix is removed. Use of the Hem-o-Lok ® stapler is standard for appendectomy patients at Duke Regional Hospital. Retrospective data will be collected from patients who had an appendectomy prior to 1/2012 using a different clip as part of their surgery, or an open appendectomy to compare outcomes.</brief_summary>
