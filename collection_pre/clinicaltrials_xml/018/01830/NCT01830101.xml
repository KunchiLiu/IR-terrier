	<brief_title>A Phase III Study of Re-Irradiation in Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a stratified study for patients with recurrent intracranial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma previously treated with concurrent chemoradiation presenting radiographic progression or recurrence of tumour. Patients are stratified by extent of resection, time to re-irradiation and re-irradiation volume.</detailed_description>
