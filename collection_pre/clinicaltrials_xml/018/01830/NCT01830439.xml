	<brief_summary>This will be a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, balanced, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence, crossover, open-label study to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of PA-824. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that the rate and extent of absorption of two doses of PA-824 (50mg or 400 mg and 200mg) are the same after a high-calorie, high-fat meal as compared with after a minimum 10-hour fast. For each of the two dose levels 16 subjects with approximately 8 men and 8 women, will be enrolled for a total of 32 subjects.</brief_summary>

Be healthy nontobacco/nicotine using (6month minimum) adult subjects, 19 to 50 years of age, inclusive. 3. Be medically healthy subjects with clinically insignificant Screening results (among laboratory profiles, medical histories, ECGs, or physical exam), as deemed by the Principal Investigator. 4. Have a body mass index of 18 to 29. 5. Have negative urine test results for alcohol and drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, cannabinoids, and cocaine metabolites at both Screening and Checkin. 6.

History of prolonged QT interval. 6. Family history of LongQT Syndrome or sudden death without a preceding diagnosis of a condition that could be causative of sudden death (such as known coronary artery disease or CHF or terminal cancer) 7. Resting pulse rate &lt; 40 or &gt; 100 bpm at Screening. 8. At Screening blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg or below 95/65 mm Hg (supine, after a minimum 5minute supine rest) 9. At either Screening or the predose read before the first dose, a QTcB (Bazett's correction) &gt;450ms for men and women, calculated from the average of triplicate reads collected at one sitting. 10. At either Screening or the predose read before the first dose, a QTcF (Fridericia's correction) &gt;450ms for men and women, calculated from the average of triplicate reads collected at one sitting. 11. History of hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. 12. History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years (as deemed by the Principal Investigator). 13. Use of alcohol within 72 hours prior to dosing. 14. Significant history of drug and/or food allergies (as deemed by the Principal Investigator). 15. For women, subject is pregnant (positive test for serum HCG at Screening or Checkin), breastfeeding or planning to conceive a child within 1 week of cessation of treatment. 16. For males, planning to father a child within 12 weeks of cessation of treatment. 17. History of lens opacity or evidence of lens opacity on slit lamp ophthalmologic examination. 18. Any contraindication to the use of nitroimidazoles or prior treatment with PA824 or OPC67683. 19. Use of any systemic or topical prescription medication within 14 days prior to dosing or during the study, except hormonal contraceptives in women 20. Use of any systemic or overthecounter medication including vitamins, herbal preparations, antacids, cough and cold remedies, etc., within 7 days prior to dosing or during the study. 21. Use of any drugs or substances within 30 days prior to dosing known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes (including quinidine, tyramine, ketoconazole, testosterone, quinine, gestodene, metyrapone, phenelzine, doxorubicin, troleandomycin, cyclobenzaprine, erythromycin, cocaine, furafylline, cimetidine, dextromethorphan, etc.) or known to prolong the QT interval (including amiodarone, bepridil chloroquine, chlorpromazine, cisapride, clarithromycin, disopyramide dofetilide, domperidone, droperidol, erythromycin, halofantrine, haloperidol, ibutilide, levomethadyl, mesoridazine, methadone, pentamidine, pimozide, procainamide, quinidine, quinolones, sotalol, sparfloxacin, thioridazine,) or barbiturates, opiates, or phenothiazines. 22. Use of any therapeutic agents known to alter any major organ function (e.g., barbiturates, opiates, phenothiazines, cimetidine, etc.) within 30 days prior to dosing. 23. Consumption of products containing grapefruit within 10 days prior to dosing. 24. Any special dietary changes during the 30 days prior to dosing, as deemed by the Principal Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. 25. Any strenuous exercise within 7 days of Checkin, as deemed by the Principal Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. 26. Donation of whole blood or significant loss of blood within 56 days prior to dosing. 27. Plasma donation within 7 days prior to dosing 28. Participation in another interventional clinical trial within 30 days prior to dosing. 29. Any serum creatinine or BUN measure beyond the upper limit of the normal range at Screening or Checkin.
