	<brief_title>Open-label Safety and Tolerability Study of LTS-PDT in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, safety study in healthy volunteers. Two cohorts, of 6 subjects each, will be enrolled (total subjects = 12). Each subject will have test areas identified on the back and receive a single LTS, vehicle solution and red light (PDT) applied to the test areas on the back. Subjects will be followed for safety at study visits occurring on Day 1 (baseline and treatment), Day 2, and Day 7.</detailed_description>
