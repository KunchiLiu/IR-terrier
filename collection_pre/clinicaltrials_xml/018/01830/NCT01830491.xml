	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the combination therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel napadisilate is not inferior to that of aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate with respect to its effectiveness in inhibiting platelet aggregation, if it is given for four weeks to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients who had been treated with a drug-eluting stent before &gt; 12 months and had remained in a stable condition with a single antiplatelet agent, aspirin.</brief_summary>
