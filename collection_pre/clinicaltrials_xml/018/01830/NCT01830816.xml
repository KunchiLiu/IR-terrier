	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1/1b, open-label, multicenter study of oral ixazomib (MLN9708)designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single dose ixazomib in patients with normal renal function and in patients with severe renal impairment (RI) (according to Cockcroft-Gault estimates). Twenty-eight PK-evaluable patients will be enrolled in either 1 of the 2 arms of the study. Arm 1: (N = 12): Normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 90 mL/min) Arm 2: (N = 16): Severe RI (CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min) including at least 6 patients with ESRD, defined as renal failure requiring hemodialysis</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female patients 18 years or older Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed according to standard criteria or patients with a diagnosis of an advanced malignant solid tumor for which standard, curative, or life prolonging treatment does not exist or is no longer effective. Patients with multiple myeloma must have had at least 1 prior therapy Patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma after at least 1 prior therapy A calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) that meets entry criteria for enrollment (ie, calculated CrCl either ≥ 90 or &lt; 30 mL/min Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Female patients who are post menopausal, surgically sterile, or agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception through 90 days after the last dose of study drug or agree to practice true abstinence Male patients who agree to practice effective barrier contraception through 90 after the last dose of study drug or agree to practice true abstinence Voluntary written informed consent Suitable venous access Female patients who are pregnant or lactating and breastfeeding Failure to have recovered from clinically significant effects of prior chemotherapy (defined as toxicity greater than Grade 1 with the exception of alopecia) Major surgery or radiotherapy within 14 days before study drug administration Dexamethasone (or equivalent systemic steroid) higher than the physiologic dosing with 7 days before study drug administration Central nervous system involvement Infection requiring IV antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug Diagnosis of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome, plasma cell leukemia, myeloproliferative syndrome, or primary amyloidosis (with the exception of patients in whom amyloidosis has been documented as a complication of MM, who will be evaluated on a casebycase basis for trial participation) Systemic treatment with strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP1A2, strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP3A, or clinically significant CYP3A inducers or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort within 14 days before the first dose of study drug Evidence of uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions Ongoing or active infection, or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive Comorbid systemic illness or psychiatric illness that could interfere with study completion Known allergy to study medications Inability to swallow oral medication or condition that could interfere with oral absorption or tolerance of treatment</criteria>
