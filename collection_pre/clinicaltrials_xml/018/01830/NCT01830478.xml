	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether lenalidomide in association with rituximab is effective in the treatment of patients with indolent non follicular NHL relapsed after &gt;=2, but less than 4 prior lines of (immuno)chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Plus Rituximab (R) in Non Follicular NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single arm, multicenter, open-label study divided in two phases: 1. Induction phase; 2. Follow-up phase. Enrolled patients will start the induction phase and receive the courses of R-Lenalidomide. At the end of the third cycle of R-Lenalidomide (week 12 of the study), the patients will be evaluated for tumor response (complete assessment); the patients with Progressive Disease (PD) will be withdrawn of the study. Two weeks after the end last courses of R-Lenalidomide (week 26 of the study) patients will be evaluated for tumor response (complete assessment). Patients with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR), and with a stable disease will undergo the follow up phase, while patients with PD will be withdrawn of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological confirmed diagnosis of BCell non follicular NHL according to REAL/WHO Classification: small lymphocytic lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, nodal marginal zone lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, extranodal nongastric marginal zone lymphoma Availability of tissue biopsy mandatory when suspected pathological sites (nodal or extranodal) are easily accessible and in presence of extranodal nongastric marginal or nodal marginal zone lymphoma diagnosis. In the other cases bone marrow biopsy, when representative, may be considered sufficient for defining lymphoma histotype Disease relapsing after &gt;=2, but less than 4 prior lines of (immuno)chemotherapy. At least one of previous treatment had to include rituximab Presence of at least one of the following criteria for the definition of active disease: systemic symptoms, bulky disease, progressive marrow failure and/or splenomegaly and/or lymph adenopathy Age 1875 Life expectancy &gt; 6 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) &lt;=2 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;=45% Creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min calculated by CockcroftGault estimation; patients with creatinine clearance &gt;= 30 and &lt; 50 mL/min, at physician discretion could enter the study starting at lenalidomide dose level 2 (10 mg) Total bilirubin up to 2 x upper limit of normal(ULN). Total bilirubin values higher than 2 x ULN are admitted if related to localization of the disease Alkaline phosphatase up to 2 x ULN and transaminases up to 3 x ULN Female and male patients must agree to participate in pregnancy prevention program signing informed Consent (paragraph 5.4.)
