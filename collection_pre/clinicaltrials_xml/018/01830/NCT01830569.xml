	<criteria>Patients are 18 years or older. Patients have their electronic medical records registered by one of the included family physicians. Medical records are not centralized in Belgium. Patients are free to choose any physician, and can even see several physicians at the same time. To encourage a patient to have their medical records held by a single physician, 'Global Medical Records' werr introduced a decade ago. In return for a registration fee, patients can choose a main general practitioner who keeps their central medical records. This registration is a requirement for patient inclusion in the trial. Patients with 'Global Medical Records' are reimbursed a larger proportion of the consultation fees by the health insurance fund. Patients have an established diagnosis of diabetes at the baseline time point of the study (identified as having (1) an ICPC (International Classification of Primary Care) code of diabetes or (2) a prescription for a diabetesspecific or (3) the necessary labo results to confirm diabetes) Pregnancy Cognitive impairment</criteria>
