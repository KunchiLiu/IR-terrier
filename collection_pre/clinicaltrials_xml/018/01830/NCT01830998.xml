	<brief_title>Early Detection of Cognitive Dysfunction in Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinically relevant cognitive decrements in relation to diabetes mainly occur during two crucial periods in life: the period of brain development in childhood, and the period when the brain undergoes neurodegenerative changes associated with ageing.Potential leads for treatment are to optimise glycaemic control and avoid and treat vascular risk factors.we want to detecte early clinical dementia in diabete by MMSE and Olfactory function.</detailed_description>
