	<brief_summary>Primary To investigate in patients with relapsed or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck whether progression free survival (PFS) in the arm with cetuximab, paclitaxel and carboplatin based chemotherapy is not markedly worse than PFS in the arm with cetuximab and 5-FU, cisplatin or carboplatin based chemotherapy. Secondary To compare in patients with relapsed or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck the following study variables between both treatment arms: - Best overall response - Duration of response - Time to treatment failure - Overall survival - Safety</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Phase II, Cetuximab in Combination With 5FU and Cisplatin or Carboplatin Versus Cetuximab in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN patients are, by definition patients with recurrent disease and/or with newly diagnosed distant metastases, although this group of patients has a very heterogeneous disease characteristic, they share a dismal prognosis that has changed little in the past 30 years. The median survival time remains around 6-8 months with a poor quality of life. Patients with resectable locoregionally recurrent SCCHN may benefit from surgery. Patients with recurrent SCCHN who are not suitable for curative salvage surgery or re-irradiation, and patients who have distant metastases, usually receive CT (Cohen EE et al.) A number of compounds demonstrate single-agent activity in recurrent and/or metastatic disease including cisplatin, carboplatin, methotrexate, 5-FU, bleomycin and the taxanes ( Scantz SP et al). Cisplatin is one of the most active agents identified for head and neck cancer, with carboplatin providing an alternative for patients unable to tolerate cisplatin. While carboplatin is associated with lower response rates than cisplatin, there appears to be no difference between the agents in terms of survival Cetuximab is a targeted therapeutic agent, a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the EGFR with high affinity, internalising the receptor and preventing the ligands EGF and TGF-alfa from interacting with the receptors and thus effectively blocking ligand-induced EGFR phosphorylation. In addition, cetuximab has been found to potentiate the effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in experimental systems. The dose of cetuximab has been found to be generally safe and effective in several studies in major tumor types expressing the EGFR. These included colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and non-small cell lung cancer, with cetuximab given either in combination studies with chemotherapy and radiotherapy or as monotherapy. The main side effects of cetuximab monotherapy are hypersensitivity- and acne-like skin reactions.</detailed_description>
