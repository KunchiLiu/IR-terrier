	<brief_summary>This is a Non-interventional Prospective Study. Centres will enroll adult patients with partial onset seizures for whom the clinician has decided to initiate ZNS as an adjunctive therapy prior to the decision to take part in this study. Patients to be enrolled into the study are not sufficiently controlled with one dug licensed for the use of monotherapy in partial onset seizures. Patients will be seen at baseline and then during normal clinical visits at intervals which are appropriate to the typical practice of the treating clinician. Patients will be assessed at baseline and then at least 3 and 6 months after the baseline.</brief_summary>
