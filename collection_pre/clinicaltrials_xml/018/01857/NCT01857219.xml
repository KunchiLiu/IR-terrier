	<brief_summary>To accomplish our Specific Aims, we propose to conduct a two-session fMRI experiment in up to 30 patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and up to 30 healthy controls. All subjects will be invited to complete the second, identical fMRI session about 3 months following completion of the first session. Fibromyalgia subjects will complete their scans before and after a 12-week Tai Chi intervention in collaboration with Tufts Medical Center.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Criteria for fibromyalgia patients. Volunteers 1850 years of age. Fibromyalgia for at least the past 3 months, as determined by the referring physician. At least a 10th grade Englishreading level; English can be a second language provided that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the assessment measures. Specific causes of pain (e.g., cancer, fractures, spinal stenosis, infections) History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened potential for adverse outcome. Presence of any contraindications to fMRI scanning. For example: cardiac pacemaker, metal implants, fear of closed spaces, pregnancy. Criteria for healthy adults. Volunteers 1850 years of age. At least a 10th grade Englishreading level; English can be a second language provided that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the assessment measures. Chronic and acute pain (ex. Fibromyalgia). History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened potential for adverse outcome. Presence of any contraindications to fMRI scanning. For example: cardiac pacemaker, metal implants, fear of closed spaces, pregnancy.</criteria>
