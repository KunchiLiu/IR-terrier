	<brief_summary>Inclusion criteria: - Patients with biochemical recurrence (Phoenix criteria: PSA nadir + 2 ng/ml) after radiation therapy for prostate cancer addressed for prostate biopsy OR - Patients referred to our institution for biopsy-proven local recurrence after radiation therapy for prostate cancer but needing a re-assessment with biopsy (insufficient number of biopsy and/or imprecise location of positive biopsy and/or questionable diagnostic of recurrence) Study Design: - Included patients will undergo an endorectal US examination with a Histoscanning™ acquisition and a multiparametric (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced) MRI. - Two independent operators will separately define suspicious focal lesion on Histoscanning™ images and on MR images. - Random biopsies (at least 2 cores) will be performed in sextants negative at Histoscanning™ and at MRI ; In sextants positive at Histoscanning™ and/or at MRI, targeted biopsies will be performed in the suspicious part of the sextant (at least two cores per suspicious lesion). - Histoscanning™ and MRI results will be compared to biopsy results. A total of 30 patients will be included</brief_summary>
