	<brief_summary>Many drug interactions with Warfarin are well documented in the literature, including interactions with a variety of antibiotics. However,in mamy cases it is difficult to predict when the interaction remains theoretical and when it becomes clinically significant and will be reflected in the individual patient. This study's aim is to identify and characterize related conditions (including comorbidities, laboratory test results and other parameters related to the patient)that might be predictors for drug interactions turning from theoretical to clinically significant.</brief_summary>
