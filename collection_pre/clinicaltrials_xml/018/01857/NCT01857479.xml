Received glucocorticoids for management of ABPA according to the Chest clinic protocol (0.5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, 0.25 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, 0.125 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, subsequently taper and stop steroids over the next 4 weeks). 4. Clinicoradiologic improvement with decline in IgE levels. The chest radiograph and IgE levels after four months of steroid therapy would serve as the baseline 1.
