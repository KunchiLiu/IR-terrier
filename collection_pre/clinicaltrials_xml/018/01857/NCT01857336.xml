	<brief_summary>Poor graft function (PGF) is a common complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which was associated with high mortality. The pathogenesis fo PGF was poorly understood. Infusion of donor peripheral cell harvest was effective for some patients with PGF in our preliminary study. This present study aimed to explore the efficacy of peripheral cell harvest for poor graft function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poor graft function (PGF) is a common complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which was associated with high mortality. The pathogenesis fo PGF was poorly understood. Infusion of donor peripheral cell harvest was effective for some patients with PGF in our preliminary study.The peripheral cell harvest was aphaeresis on the fourth or fifth day after mobilization with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Hematogical response was assessed at 30 days after infusion. Good response was defined as neutrophil &gt; 1.0×109/l without G-CSF support for at least 3 consecutive days, and persistent platelet &gt;20×109/l without transfusion for at least 7 days. Otherwise, poor response was defined.</detailed_description>
