	<brief_title>Proof-Of-Concept Investigation With a Neurosteroid Analog (Ganaxolone) as a Smoking Cessation Candidate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate whether expired air carbon monoxide (CO) will be reduced and smoking cessation success rates enhanced for smokers who receive the neurosteroid analog ganaxolone. The trial will be seeking preliminary indications of efficacy and tolerability in the smoking population and allow us to estimate effect sizes for future controlled trials.</detailed_description>
