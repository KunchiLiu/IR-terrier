	<brief_title>Bioequivalence of Orfadin 20 mg Compared to Orfadin 10 mg Capsules.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open, randomized 2-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects will receive single oral 20 mg doses of nitisinone administrated as one 20 mg capsule or as two 10 mg capsules of Orfadin. There will be a 3-week washout period between the doses. There will be a screening visit within 3 weeks prior to the first dose. During each treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the clinic from the afternoon on the day before drug administration (i.e., on Day -1) and remain at the clinic until the 48-hour post-dose blood sample has been collected in the morning of Day 3. They will then return for ambulatory visit in the morning of Day 4 (72-hour sample). A follow-up visit will take place 7-14 days after the last dose.</detailed_description>
