Have a Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) equal to or greater than 70 6. Have the following laboratory parameters (may be assessed locally): 1. Platelet count ≥50 x 10E3/µL 2. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL 3. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min calculated using CockcroftGault 4.

Able to provide written informed consent prior to any study specific screening procedures with the understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason without prejudice 1. The patient has a history of another primary cancer, with the exception of: 1. Curatively resected nonmelanomatous skin cancer; 2. Other primary solid tumor with no known active disease presents that in the opinion of the investigator that will not affect patient outcome in the setting of current prostate cancer diagnosis. 2. Contraindication to propranolol, etodolac 3. Patients on beta blockers 4. Patients receiving chemotherapy (e.g., docetaxel, cabazitaxel, taxane, or platinum as single agents or in combination) as their cancer treatment 5. History or evidence of cardiac disease: congestive heart failure; New York Heart Association class 2 or greater; active coronary artery disease; unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy, atrioventricular block of second or third degree, or uncontrolled hypertension, patients with recent (less than 6 months) myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary revascularization 6. Hypotension at the time of screening (i.e., systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg) 7. Resting heart rate less than 60 bpm at time of screening 8. Any uncontrolled, intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the Investigator may interfere with study evaluation. Participants with uncontrolled diabetes will be excluded from the study. 9. On chronotropic drugs (acetylcholine, digoxin, diltiazem, verapamil, atropine, dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, isoproterenol) 10. Active clinically serious infections [&gt; Grade 2 National Cancer Institute (NCI)Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0] 11. Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results 12. Known or suspected allergy to the investigational agents or any agent given in association with this trial (hypersensitivity reaction, hives, rash, difficulty breathing swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat) 13. Any condition that is unstable or which in the opinion of the Investigator could jeopardize the safety of the patient and his/her compliance in the study 14. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes or insulin resistance 15. Participation in any other investigational trial in which receipt of investigational drug or device occurred within 30 days prior to screening for this study</criteria>
