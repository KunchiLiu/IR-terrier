	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate the early effects of intensive lipid lowering treatments with ezetimibe/simvastatin (Vytorin®) for each component of coronary plaques. Study Design - Prospective, randomized, single-center study of each 80 subjects enrolled - Subjects with acute coronary syndrome who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. - Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to A) Ezetimibe/Simvastatin (n=80) vs. B) Pravastatin (n=80), and each group of patients will be randomized further in a ratio of 1:1 to a) ZES (n=40) vs. b) EES (n=40), according to the type of stent used. - All subjects will undergo VH-IVUS at initial procedure. - Follow-up VH-IVUS will be performed at 3 months after index procedure. OCT at initial procedure and 3-months will be performed in available cases.</brief_summary>
