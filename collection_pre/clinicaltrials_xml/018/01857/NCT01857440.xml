	<brief_title>The Flashing Light-Induced Pupil Response (FLIPR) Glaucoma Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pupils inside the eyes constrict in response to light stimulation. Different classes of cells within the human retina initiate this response. Recent research suggests that one of the ganglion cell types involved in this pupil response is affected by glaucoma. By measuring pupil responses to different colored lights, the function of this class of cells can be evaluated quickly, and without touching the eye. An advantage of pupil testing strategies is that they do not require subjective feedback from the subject about what they can see, as is required for standard visual field tests that are used in the clinic. The main aim of this study is to measure and compare the pupil constriction that occurs in response to flickering red and blue lights in patients with glaucoma versus matched control patients without glaucoma. In addition, the subjects will be asked questions about their quality of life and it will be determined whether issues related to quality of life correlate to alterations in the pupil responses.</detailed_description>
