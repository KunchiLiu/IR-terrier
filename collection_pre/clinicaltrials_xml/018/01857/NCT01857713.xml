	<brief_title>Treatment of Extraesophageal Reflux With the Reza Band UES Assist Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of non-invasive Reza Band UES Assist Device for the treatment of esophagopharyngeal reflux with extra-esophageal symptoms (chronic cough, choking, aspiration, chronic post nasal drip, globus, sore throat, throat clearing). Reza Band is to be worn when sleeping. The patient will put the Reza Band on at bedtime and take it off upon waking. This is a prospective, non-randomized, open label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Reza Band. At up to 5 investigational sites, up to 100 subjects will be enrolled. The primary effectiveness endpoint is to be evaluated by the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI). Success is defined as &gt;25% reduction in the RSI at the last follow-up, as compared to the baseline RSI. The RSI is a validated nine-item patient-administered outcome questionnaire designed to document symptoms and severity. Patients are asked to rate how nine problems have affected them on a scale of 0 (no problem) to 5 (severe problem), with a maximum total score of 45. All adverse reactions being reported will be evaluated with the frequency and percent of subjects of each reaction being summarized by severity and by relationship to the Reza Band. Since some subjects may report the same event several times (e.g., redness), the first occurrence of the worst reported case of the event will be used for the purpose of analysis. The incidence of site reactions, including laryngospasm, choking, pain, cough and hoarseness will be summarized. Exact 95% confidence intervals for the incidence rate of site reactions will be presented.</detailed_description>
