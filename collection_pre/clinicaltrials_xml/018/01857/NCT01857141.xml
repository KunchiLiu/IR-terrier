	<brief_summary>The use of epidural dexmedetomidine decreases the anaesthetic requirements and improved postoperative pain. Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly selective a2-adrenoceptor agonist and has sympatholytic effect. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability(HRV) is a useful tool to assess cardiac autonomic activity. We investigated whether preemptive epidural dexmedetomidine can develop hemodynamic change and it could be identify patients by HRV.</brief_summary>
