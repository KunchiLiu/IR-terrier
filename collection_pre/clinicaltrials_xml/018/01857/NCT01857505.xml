	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to evaluate and compare the percentage of patients who are able to be discharged in less than 3 days after undergoing total hip arthroscopy through either a direct anterior or posterior approach, utilizing the identical post operative protocol. The investigators also propose to evaluate the costs associated with the two different approaches to hip replacement in the same group of patients. Post operative resource utilization, discharge disposition, and pain medicine requirement will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hip Replacement in a High Volume Community Hospital: Effect on Length of Stay and Hospital Cost</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that a higher proportion of patients treated with the direct anterior approach for hip replacement will be able to leave the hospital in less than 3 days when compared with a less invasive posterior approach. Secondly, decreased length of stay associated with the procedure may reduce hospital costs.</detailed_description>
