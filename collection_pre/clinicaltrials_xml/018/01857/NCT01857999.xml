	<brief_summary>The dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin-receptor blocker used together in heart failure patients has been demonstrated to be beneficial. However, the dual inhibition has not been studied during heart failure decompensation or even when low cardiac output is present. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of add-on therapy with angiotensin receptor blocker on plasma B-type natriuretic peptide levels and hemodynamic measurements in heart failure patients with low cardiac output during hospitalization for decompensation. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The inclusion criteria were hospitalization for decompensated heart failure defined by worsening of symptoms until fatigue or dyspnea at rest, low cardiac output defined by the clinical-hemodynamic profile, dobutamine dependence, and ejection fraction &lt; 0.45, spontaneous breathing and receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The patients could have jugular ingurgitation, lower limbs edema, ascites and rales. Dobutamine dependence was defined by infusion for more than 15 days or an unsuccessful attempt of withdrawal. The exclusion criteria were serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL, serum potassium &gt; 6.0 mEq/L, systolic blood pressure &lt; 70 mm Hg, aortic stenosis, and acute coronary syndrome in the previous 2 months. The patients were randomly assigned by permuted block of 4, stratified by sex, to losartan or placebo. The endpoints were change in B-type natriuretic peptide levels, cardiac index, pulmonary wedge capillary pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and successful withdrawal of dobutamine.</detailed_description>
