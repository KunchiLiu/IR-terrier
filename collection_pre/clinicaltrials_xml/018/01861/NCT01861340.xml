	<brief_summary>This research study is being done to see if combining the investigational chemotherapy drug, MEDI-551 with the known anti-myeloma drugs, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone will reduce your myeloma cancer stem cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone and MEDI-551 in Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To explore the effect of Lenalidomide, dexamethasone and Medi-551 on multiple myeloma cancer stem cells (CSCs). Myeloma CSCs will be assessed by a clonogenic assay from the bone marrow and flow cytometry from peripheral blood.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 to 100 years at the time screening Symptomatic, previously untreated (with exception of corticosteroids) secretory myeloma Written informed consent obtained from the patient/legal representative prior to performing any protocolrelated procedures, including screening evaluations Patient must agree to take Lenalidomide with low dose dexamethasone as their initial therapy. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Life expectancy of &gt;6 months Serum creatinine ≤ 2 ANC≥1000 Platelets ≥ 50,000 Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN Able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin) Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of patient safety or study results. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, except for noninterventional, observational studies. Any chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, investigational, for treatment of multiple myeloma other than Lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Previous monoclonal antibody (mAb) or other treatment specifically directed against CD19. History of serious allergy or reaction to any component of the MEDI551 formulation that would prevent administration. Previous systemic cancer therapy for myeloma. Any active secondary malignancy. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive serology or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Active hepatitis B as defined by seropositivity for hepatitis B surface antigen. Or patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody titers. Patients with hepatitis C antibody will be eligible provided that they do not have elevated liver transaminases or other evidence of active hepatitis. Documented current central nervous system involvement by multiple myeloma. Previous medical history or evidence of an intercurrent illness that may, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the safety of the patient in the study.
