	<brief_title>Phase 1/II, Safety and Immunogenicity Study of AERAS-404 in BCG-Primed Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, immunogenicity and dose-range finding study in HIV-uninfected, HIV-unexposed, BCG-primed infants. The study vaccine AERAS-404 or placebo will be administered without concomitant EPI vaccines (Cohorts 1 to 5, N = 159 subjects) and with concomitant EPI vaccines (Cohort 6, N = 70 subjects). Study vaccine or placebo will be administered as a single dose (injection) at Study Day 0 ( ≥168 to ≤ 196 days of age, Cohorts 1 and 2), a 2-dose schedule at Study Day 0 (≥ 168 to ≤ 189 days of age) and Study Day 28 (Cohorts 3A and 3B) or a 3-dose schedule at Study Day 0 (≥ 84 to ≤ 98 days of age), Study Day 42 and Study Day 98 (Cohorts 4 and 5). Subjects in Cohort 6 will receive the study vaccine or placebo at Study Day 0 (≥ 64 to ≤ 83 days of age), Study Day 28 (≥ 91 to ≤ 105 days of age), and Study Day 210 (≥ 273 to ≤ 287 days of age). A cohort will enroll once safety in the previous cohort has been established. AERAS-404 is an investigational vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (SP) and Statens Serum Institute (SSI).</detailed_description>
