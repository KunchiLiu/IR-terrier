	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing TURP were randomly allocated into two groups. - Group I: Received fentanyl 20 µgr (0.4ml),heavy bupivacaine 0.5% (1.5 ml)and normal saline % 0.9 NaCl ( 1.1ml) - Group II: Received fentanyl 20 µgr (0.4 ml), plain bupivacaine 0.5%(1.5 ml) normal saline 0.9% NaCl (1.1 mL) in total bupivacaine 0.25% (3ml) intrathecally.
