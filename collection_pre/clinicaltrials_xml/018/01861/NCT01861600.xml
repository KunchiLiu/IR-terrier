	<brief_title>Stool Composition and Stool Characteristics in Healthy Term Infants Fed Human Milk or Infant Formulas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of term infant formula containing high 2-palmitic vegetable oil on stool composition and characteristics and to investigate the effect of both high 2-palmitic vegetable oil and oligofructose in infant formula on stool softness and bacteria. Because some studies demonstrate the benefit of high concentrations of a non-digestible carbohydrate in the formula, we will study 2 concentrations of added oligofructose.</detailed_description>
