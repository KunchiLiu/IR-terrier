	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine two implementation strategies (external facilitation and educational outreach visit) when introducing nutritional guidelines in the elderly care setting and to evaluate the results of the implementation by clinical outcome measures of the nursing home residents. The hypothesis is that the residents affected by the external facilitation strategy will stay stable in the measured clinical outcomes, while the residents influenced by the educational outreach visit will deteriorate during the implementation process.</brief_summary>
