	<brief_title>Analgesic Efficacy of a Multiport Versus Uniport Flexible Catheter for Labor Epidural Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiport catheters, when compared to uniport catheters, have been associated with better analgesic quality during labor epidural analgesia because the presence of more than one port may enhance the distribution of epidural medication Flexible catheters, when compared to rigid catheters, have been associated with better analgesic quality during labor epidural analgesia because greater flexibility may minimize catheter deviation in the epidural space, facilitate more optimal catheter placement in the epidural space, and result in better distribution of epidural medication It is unknown whether multiple ports, which promote better distribution of epidural medication, provide added analgesic benefit to flexible catheters, which also facilitate better distribution of epidural medication, when used for the provision of epidural analgesia during labor and delivery</detailed_description>
