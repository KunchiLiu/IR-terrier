	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the protocol is to evaluate the StO2 performance measured at the admission to the emergency department to identify hemodynamic failure at the admission or within the first three hours of monitoring patients with drug poisoning. The study hypotheses are: - The early detection of hypoperfusion by StO2, essential to prevent the development of collapse. - To limit hemodynamic failure effects, reduce morbidity and mortality of drug poisoning, hospital stay and cost.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>StO2 Performance Measured on Admission to the Emergency Department in the Assessment of Drug Poisoning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The procedure is a measurement and non-invasive monitoring system of percentage of oxygen saturation of haemoglobin in tissues using infrared technology. The system used in the study is the tissue oxygenation monitor InSpectraTM StO2 Spot Check, Model 300 consisting of a clamp applied to the base of the thumb of the patient.</detailed_description>
