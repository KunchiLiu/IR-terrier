	<brief_summary>The proposed study aims to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a combined 4-session HIV sexual risk reduction (HIVSRR) and microfinance intervention (including 34 training session and matched savings) to reduce unprotected sex and to increase proportion of income from sex work among women engaged in high risk sexual activity in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Feasibility and preliminary efficacy will be tested using a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 134 women sex workers meeting eligibility criteria. Following eligibility screening, eligible women will complete informed consent, a baseline assessment, and be randomized to one of 2 study conditions: 1) the combination HIV sexual risk reduction plus microfinance (HIVSRR+MF); or 2) a 4-session HIVSRR alone control condition. The study design will permit us to: 1. Examine and enhance the feasibility (i.e. recruitment, engagement, attendance, retention data collection) of a combination HIV sexual risk reduction and MF intervention with high risk women in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; 2. Examine the preliminary outcomes of the interventions on decreasing unprotected acts of vaginal and anal intercourse; increasing the proportion of protected vaginal and/or anal acts using barrier protection and decreasing number of sexual partners with repeated measures at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3 and 6 month follow-up assessments. 3. Use the results of the pilot study to inform the design of a future R01 application.</brief_summary>
