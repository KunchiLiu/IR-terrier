	<brief_summary>Background: The individual's ability to sustain itself in the upright position, effectively adjusting the body's movements and reacting to external stimuli, postural control strategies represent essential activities of daily living. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM-2) is considered a more problem of Public Health as having complications deficit in functional performance of the lower limbs and falls, which can interfere with the maintenance of balance, and is a strong predictor of functional limitations self referred. Aim: To assess quality of life and the answers neuromuscular balance and baropodometric after sensory-motor training in patients with type 2 diabetes. Method: To be recruited 50 volunteers aged between 45 to 64 years with DM-2, of both sexes, divided into two groups: 1) Guidelines and 2) Guidelines + sensory-motor training. Biomechanical data will be collected (balance, baropodometry, electromyography strength and joint position sense), as well as questionnaires ADDQoL and BESTest. The intervention will be twice a week for 45 minutes for 12 weeks, divided into three phases: heating, sensory-motor training and cool-down, with monitoring of blood pressure and blood glucose. There will be a follow up after 3 months of intervention. Statistical analysis will be used normality test to verify the data distribution and consistent statistical test for the appropriate comparisons within and between groups, and adopted a significance level of 5%. Expected Results: Considering previous studies that demonstrate improvement in postural balance static and dynamic responses under the forward training protocol sensorimotor disease Diabetes mellitus type 2, is expected to improve neuromuscular, balance, distribution plant, the joint position sense and the quality of life of voluntary DM-2. Keywords: physical therapy modalities, exercise therapy, postural balance, Diabetes Mellitus, quality of life.</brief_summary>
