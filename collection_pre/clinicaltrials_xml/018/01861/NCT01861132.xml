	<brief_title>Validation of a Non-invasive Hemodynamic Monitor (NexFin) in Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Validation will be a direct beat-to-beat comparison of data from NexFin and the invasive measurements of blood pressure and calibrated cardiac output as an integrated part of LiDCO Plus. Both comparison of absolute values and the two different devices trending abilities will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
