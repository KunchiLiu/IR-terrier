	<brief_summary>Patients with a locally advanced or metastatic (i.e., there are already metastases of the diagnosed tumor in the body outside the primary lesion) soft tissue sarcoma will be recruited for this study. The minimum age to enter the study is 60 years. Therapy with doxorubicin is the mainstay of palliative chemotherapy for these patients, which is associated with hematological toxicity and an increase of the infection rate. Pazopanib is known to rarely induce hematological toxicity or to trigger infection. We therefore assume that pazopanib exerts similar activity while decreasing neutropenia and neutropenic fever. Pazopanib is already approved in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Doxorubicin and pazopanib will be randomly allocated to either receive doxorubicin or pazopanib in a phase II clinical trial. The aim of this study is to measure the treatment effect (reduction in tumor size or tumor stabilization) for both drugs, as well as the survival rate, and the duration of tumor control by the different therapies. A further objective is to measure the quality of life by standardized questionnaires throughout the course of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Signed written informed consent and willingness to comply with treatment and followup. Procedures conducted within 3 weeks as part of routine clinical management (e.g. blood count, imaging) and obtained prior to signing consent may be used for screening or baseline purposes if they are conducted as specified in the protocol 2. Male and female patients age ≥ 60 years at day of inclusion 3. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or advanced soft tissue sarcoma of intermediate or high grade with disease progression within 6 months prior to study inclusion: Fibrosarcoma Pleomorphic high grade sarcoma ("malignant fibrous histiocytoma") Leiomyosarcoma Liposarcoma Malignant glomus tumor Rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar or pleomorphic (excluding embryonal) Vascular sarcoma (epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, angiosarcoma) Synovial sarcoma Not otherwise specified (NOS) Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors Other types of sarcoma (not listed as ineligible), if approved by the study coordinator. Excluding: Uncertain differentiation (epithelioid, alveolar soft part, clear cell, desmoplastic small round cell, malignant mesenchymoma, PEComa), chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcomas/PNET, chordoma, malignant solitary fibrous tumors, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (lowgrade), neuroblastoma, malignant mesothelioma, and mixed mesodermal tumors of the uterus (Study inclusion is based on local histopathological diagnosis). 4. ECOG performance status of 02 5. Evidence of progressive disease prior to start of treatment with measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 6. Preferably archived tumor tissue of the most recent histology or, if not available, tumor block or 8 representative unstained sections on slides must be provided for all subjects for biomarker analysis within first month of treatment for central review 7. Adequate organ system function 8. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must meet one of the following criteria: At least 6 weeks after surgical sterilization by vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia Correct use of two reliable contraception methods for 14 days before exposure to IMP, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days after the last dose of IMP. This includes every combination of a hormonal contraceptive (such as oral, injection, transdermal patch, implant, cervical ring) or an IUD/IUS with a barrier method (diaphragm, cervical cap, Lea contraceptive, femidom, or condom). Complete sexual abstinence for 14 days before exposure to IMP, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days after the last dose of IMP. 9. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective contraception, as defined in Section "3.1 Inclusion criteria" during the study and for 14 days following the last dose of investigational product. 1. Prior malignancy Excluding: Subjects who have had another malignancy and have been diseasefree for 2 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma, or successfully treated in situ carcinoma or incidental prostate cancer (TNM stage T1a or T1b) are eligible. 2. History or clinical evidence of CNS metastases Excluding: Subjects who have previouslytreated CNS metastases (radiotherapy, surgery ± radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or gamma knife) and who meet both of the following criteria: a) are asymptomatic and b) have no requirement for steroids or enzymeinducing anticonvulsants 12 weeks prior to study inclusion. Screening with CNS imaging (CT or MRI) is required only if clinically indicated or if the subject has a history of CNS metastases. 3. Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding including but not limited to: Active peptide ulcer disease Known intraluminal metastatic lesion(s) with risk of bleeding Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) or other gastrointestinal conditions with increased risk of perforation History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 28 days prior to beginning of study treatment 4. Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may affect absorption of IMP including but not limited to: Malabsorption syndrome Major resection of the stomach or small bowels 5. Presence of uncontrolled infection 6. QTc &gt; 480 msecs using Bazett's formula 7. History of any one or more of the following cardiovascular conditions within the past 6 months: Cardiac angioplasty or stenting Myocardial infarction Unstable angina Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease 8. Class III or IV congestive heart failure as defined by NYHA 9. Poorly controlled hypertension (SBP of ≤ 150 mmHg or DBP of ≤95 mmHg is acceptable provided that BP will be treated and monitored at least weekly. The goal is to attain controlled hypertension within 4 weeks of start of IMP which is defined as grade ≤1 hypertension CTCAE Version 4.0) Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to study entry. BP must be reassessed twice with an interval of at least 1h before start of treatment and should be ≤140/90 mmHg for a subject to be eligible for the study. However, BP of ≤150/95 mmHg is acceptable provided the above measures are employed. 10.
