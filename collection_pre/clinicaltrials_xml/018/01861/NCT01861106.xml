	<brief_summary>Background: - GATA2 deficiency is a disease caused by mutations in the GATA2 gene. It can cause different types of leukemia and other diseases. Researchers want to see if a stem cell transplant can be used to treat this condition. A stem cell transplant will give stem cells from a matching donor (related or unrelated) to a recipient. It will allow the donor stem cells to produce healthy bone marrow and blood cells that will attack the recipient s cancer cells. Objectives: - To see if stem cell transplants are successful at treating GATA2 mutations and related conditions. Eligibility: - Recipients who are between 10 and 70 years of age and have GATA2 deficiency. - Donors who are between 6 and 70 years of age and are matched with the recipients. Design: - All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will be collected. Recipients will have imaging studies and other tests. - Donor participants will provide stem cells for the treatment. Filgrastim injections will allow these cells to be collected from the blood. In some cases, bone marrow donations will be needed to provide more stem cells. - Recipients will have chemotherapy or radiation to prepare for the transplant. On the day of the transplant, they will receive the donated stem cells. - Recipients will stay in the hospital until their condition is stable after transplant. - Frequent blood tests and scans will be required for the first 6 months after the transplant, followed by less frequent visits over time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for GATA2 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Genetic and sporadic mutations on one allele of the GATA2 gene lead to a syndrome termed MonoMAC. MonoMAC is characterized by: 1) infections with Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) and other opportunistic infections, 2) deficiency of monocytes, Blymphocytes, and Natural Killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood, and 3) progression to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and 4) mutations on one allele of GATA2 in most patients. We propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using different conditioning regimens for different donor sources and post-transplant immunosuppressive regimens in reconstituting normal hematopoiesis and reversing the disease phenotype in patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC. Objectives: Primary: (NotEqual) (Cross)To determine whether allogeneic HSCT approach reconstitutes normal hematopoiesis and reverses the disease phenotype by one year in patients with mutations in GATA2 or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC. Eligibility: (NotEqual) (Cross)Recipients ages 8-70 years old with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC. Clinical history of at least one life-threatening infection. (NotEqual) (Cross)Have a 10/10 or a 9/10 matched related or unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B, -C, DRB1, DQB1 by high resolution typing identified through the National Marrow Donor Program), or a haploidentical related donor. Design: (NotEqual) (Cross)Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a 10/10 matched related or unrelated donor will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV once daily for 4 days on day s -6, -5, -4, and -3, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -6, -5, -4, and -3, and HSCT on day 0. The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan. If the patient has normal, favorable, or intermediate cytogenetics, post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180. If there is no evidence of GVHD, tacrolimus will be begin tapering at approximately day +180. If the patient has unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities prior to transplant, then the posttransplant GVHD prophylaxis will consist of methotrexate 5 mg/m2 IV on day s +1, +3, +6, and +11 and tacrolimus daily from day -3 until day +180. If there is no evidence of graftversus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day +180. (NotEqual) (Cross)Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a 9/10 matched related or unrelated donor will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s -6 and -5, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, (if clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are present, then three days of busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, and -2 will be given), fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV once daily for 5 days on day s -6 to -2, 200 cGy TBI on day -1, and HSCT on day 0. The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan. Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis for recipients of 9/10 donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to approximately day 180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day +180. (NotEqual) (Cross)Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a haploidentical related donor will receive pre-transplant conditioning with cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s -6 and -5, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, (if clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are present, then three days of busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, and -2) will be given, fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV once daily for 5 days on day s -6 to -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1, and HSCT on day 0. The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan. Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis for recipients of haploidentical donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day +180.</detailed_description>

Written informed consent/assent obtained from patient/parent or legal guardian. 11. Disease status: Patients are to be referred in remission for evaluation. Should a patient have progressive disease, or a donor becomes not available after enrollment, the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologistoncologist for treatment. If this course of action is not in the best interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI/LAI, then the patient may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease under the current study. If under either of these settings, it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to transplant, then he/she must come off study. RecipientSubjects receiving a standard therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks, benefits alternatives of the proposed therapy, and availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Recipient 1. Patient age less than 8 years old or greater than 70 years old 2. HIV infection. 3. Chronic active hepatitis B. Patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive. For patients with a concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patients will require a hepatology consultation. The riskbenefit profile of transplant and hepatitis B will be discussed with the patient, and eligibility determined by the PI or Lead Associate Investigator. 4. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent. 5. Active infection refractory to antimicrobial therapy. 6. Active CNS involvement by malignancy (patients with known positive CSF cytology or parenchymal lesions visible by CT or MRI). 7. Pregnant or lactating. 8. Sexually active individuals capable of becoming pregnant who are unable or unwilling to use effective form(s) of contraception during time enrolled on study and for 1 year posttransplant. Effective forms of contraception include one or more of the following: intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy, partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or abstinence. The effects on breastmilk are also unknown and may be harmful to the infant; therefore, women should not breast feed during the interval from study entry to one year posttransplant. Males on the protocol must use an effective form of contraception at study entry, and for one year posttransplant. The effects of transplant, the radiation, and the medications used after transplant may be harmful to a fetus. 9.

A donor who is lactating must be willing and able to interrupt breastfeeding or substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period of filgrastim administration and for two days following the final dose. Filgrastim may be secreted in human milk, although its bioavailability from this source is not known. 8. No mutation in GATA2, or in the case where the mutation in GATA2 has not been identified, but the recipient has the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, the donor is required to have no clinical evidence of MonoMAC . INCLUSIN CRITERIA Matched Unrelated Donor 1. Unrelated donor matched at 10/10 or 9/10 HLAA, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 loci by high resolution typing. 2. The evaluation of donors shall be in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies and Procedures. General donor inclusion criteria specified in the NMDP Standards. INCLUSION CRITERIA Haploidentical Related Donor 1. A haploidentical donor is a related donor that shares one haplotype in common with the recipient such that HLA compatibility will be a minimum of 5 out of 10 HLA loci matched. The HLA loci to be tested will be HLA A, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQB1. A minimum number of mismatches is desirable; however if several options are available the selection of a donor will be based on the loci where the mismatch occurs and the relative importance of its potential immunological function. Donorrecipient pairs will initially be typed molecularly to provide a low resolution typing (antigenlevel) to aid in the selection of the potential donor. Upon review of the familial inheritance pattern, a qualified HLA staff member will review haplotype inheritance. High resolution (allelelevel) typing will be performed. Final selection of a donor will be in consultation with NCI physicians and qualified HLA personnel. Haploidentical related donors for pediatric recipients must be 6 years of age or older. If more than one haploidentical related donor is available, we will evaluate each donor individually according to overall health, ABO matching, CMV, etc. to select the donor 2. Age 670 years 3. No history of lifethreatening opportunistic infection 4. Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections to the recipient. 5. Haploidentical donors will undergo marrow harvest with general anesthesia. Subjects will undergo anesthesia consultation prior to enrollment. CD34 plus fraction will be determined. 6. No mutation in GATA2, or in the case where the mutation in GATA2 has not been identified, but the recipient has the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, the donor is required to have no clinical evidence of MonoMAC EXCLUSION CRITERIA Matched Related Donor 1. Age less than6 years or greater than 70 years. 2. History of psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise compliance with transplant protocol, or does not allow for appropriate informed consent. 3. History of other medical conditions that in the opinion of PI constitute a contraindication to donation. 4. History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a casebycase basis. Risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient. 5. Donors must not be pregnant. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication under this protocol. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown. Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception. Effective forms of contraception include one or more of the following: intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy, partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or abstinence. 6. Mutation in GATA2, or evidence of loss of expression of one allele of GATA2 by cDNA analysis performed by a CLIA certified laboratory, or in the case where the mutation in GATA2 has not been identified, but the recipient has the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, the donor is excluded if he or she has the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC.
