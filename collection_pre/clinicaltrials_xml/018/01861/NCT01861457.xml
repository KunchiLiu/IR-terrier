	<brief_title>Reduction of Staph Aureus Carriage by Non-Antibiotic NOZIN® Nasal Sanitizer® Antiseptic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to employ a repeated sampling protocol to test the effectiveness of a currently marketed, over-the-counter topical preparation to reduce carriage of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in the nasal vestibules of health professionals working in an outpatient clinical setting. The product to be tested is the NOZIN® Nasal Sanitizer® antiseptic produced by Global Life Technologies Corp. It is an alcohol-based, non-antibiotic antiseptic preparationl The study has one primary Specific Aim: To determine the extent to which colonization of the vestibular region of the nares by S. aureus can be reduced by a regimen of nasal topical applications of the alcohol-based antiseptic during the course of typical 10-hour work day in subjects known to exhibit S. aureus nasal carriage. A secondary aim of the study will be to evaluate the concurrent effectiveness of the antiseptic applications on a measure of general bacterial colonization within the vestibules of each subject.</detailed_description>
