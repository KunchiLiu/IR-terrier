	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine whether testing for HIV together as a couple, as opposed to testing separately, in acceptable to men in male couples, and is a safe prevention service. Testing of couples together has been provided for decades in Africa, but has never been tested in the United States. In this study, male couples will be enrolled and randomly assigned to be tested together in the same room, or separately. At the time of testing, investigators will ask questions about how they felt about the service they received. Three months later, investigators will survey the men again, and determine whether they had any problems after the testing, like violence in the relationship or the relationship breaking up. The main outcomes are being satisfied with the testing service, and safety (lack of intimate partner violence or relationship termination). Although the study is not designed to determine if the service reduces risk behaviors for HIV transmission, investigators will examine data on risks just to explore that topic. The main hypotheses are: (1) men will be at least as satisfied with couples testing as they are with individual testing; and (2) men tested as couples will not experience higher rates of intimate partner violence or relationship dissolution, relative to men tested separately.</brief_summary>
