	<brief_summary>Liposomal formulations are frequently used today in the treatment of cancer. LiPlaCis is the first targeted liposomal formulation with a tumour triggered release mechanism to undergo clinical development in oncology and it is expected that LiPlaCis will improve the therapeutic index of cisplatin compared to conventional cisplatin. Cisplatin is one of the most widely used drugs in the treatment of cancer due to its documented efficacy in a number of tumour types. Furthermore, it seems highly likely that cisplatin will remain an important drug in the future treatment of cancer. However, the drug is associated with a number of serious toxicities that complicates or necessitates discontinuation of therapy - e.g. need for pre-hydration, neurotoxicity, nausea and vomiting. Thus, there is a well-established need for improving cisplatin therapy in cancer patients. One option here is improving the formulation of the drug, so that a more selective up-take of cisplatin administered takes place at the tumour sites. Based on the results of the pre-clinical studies of LiPlaCis, it seems clear that LiPlaCis offers the potential to improve cisplatin therapy to the benefits of cancer patients. In a prematurely stopped Phase I Dutch study a Recommended Dose (RD) for a Phase II study was never reached which is now the aim of this Phase I dose escalating study. At the RD level in this study, patients will preferably have advanced breast cancer with a biopsy examination showing a pattern compatible with sensitivity to LiPlaCis</brief_summary>

From step5 and extension phase, population limited to Skin Cancer patients (non screened) or metastatic Breast Cancer patients screened sensitive to LiPlaCis. Age &gt;= 18 years. Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months. ECOG performance status of 0 1. Recovered to Grade 1 or less from acute toxicities of prior treatment. &gt;= 6 months must have elapsed since patient received cisplatin. &gt;= 4 weeks must have elapsed since patient received any investigational medicinal product. &gt;= 4 weeks must have elapsed since patient received any radiotherapy, or treatment with cytotoxic or biologic agents (&gt;=6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas). No hormonal treatment is allowed except treatment with corticosteroids at physiological dose and hormonal treatment with LHRH agonists for prostate cancer. &gt;=2 weeks must have elapsed since any prior surgery or therapy with GCSF and GMCSF. Adequate condition as evidenced by the following clinical laboratory values: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,5 x 10E9/L Haemoglobin is at least 5,6 mmol/L Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10E9/L Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;= 2,5 x ULN, in case of known liver metastases ALT and AST &lt;= 5 x ULN Serum bilirubin &lt;= 1,5 ULN Alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2,5 x ULN, in case of known liver metastases &lt;= 5 x ULN Blood urea within normal limits, creatinine below upper normal limits and creatinine clearance within normal limits (&gt;= 60 mL/min CrEDTA clearance). Sexually active males and females of childproducing potential, must use adequate contraception (oral contraceptives, intrauterine device or barrier method of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly or surgical sterile) for the study duration and at least six months afterwards. Patient must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an independent ethical committee (IEC) approved written informed consent form prior to any study related activities. Active uncontrolled bleeding or bleeding diathesis (e.g., active peptic ulcer disease). Any active infection requiring parenteral or oral antibiotic treatment. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis virus. Preexisting renal insufficiency. Active heart disease including myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure within the previous 6 months, symptomatic coronary artery disease, or symptomatic arrhythmias currently requiring medication. Known or suspected active central nervous system (CNS metastasis). (Patients stable 8 weeks after completion of treatment for CNS metastasis are eligible). Autoimmune disease. Impending or symptomatic spinal cord compression or carcinomatous meningitis. Preexisting neuropathy, i.e., Grade &gt;1 neuromotor or neurosensory toxicity (as defined by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4,0), except for abnormalities due to cancer. Known hypersensitivity to cisplatin or liposomes. Requiring immediate palliative treatment of any kind including surgery and/or radiotherapy. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding (pregnancy test with a positive result before study entry). Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements.</criteria>
