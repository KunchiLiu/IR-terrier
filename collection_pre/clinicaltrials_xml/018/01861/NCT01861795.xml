	<brief_title>Observational Study in Preterm Neonates Who Are Sufficiently Stable on Non-Invasive Ventilatory Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to collect data on vital signs, oxygen requirements and other data in preterm infants who are breathing stably on non-invasive ventilatory support. The data obtained during this study will be used to compare data obtained in a future study that will add a new medicinal product in combination with non-invasive ventilatory support to accelerate lung development in preterm infants. The study will enroll approximately 40 patients. Participants will not be receiving any investigational medicinal product or device in this study. All participants will have vital signs, oxygen requirements and other data collected continuously throughout the study. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Germany. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 10 weeks. Participants will be observed until they reach 36 weeks of gestational age or until they are discharged from the hospital.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Written, informed consent of both parents or legal guardian(s) obtained (on admission, prior to or after delivery). 2. Preterm neonates born at or above 27+0 gestational weeks (GW) who are sufficiently stable on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Upper limit 36+0 GW. 3. Participants' minimum weight at birth must be 800 g. Upper weight limit is 2500 g. 4. CPAPpositive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) must be ≥5 cm and ≤ 8 cm H2O. 5. Fraction of oxygen (O2) in ventilator outlet gas flow (FiO2) ≥ 30% to reach saturation goal (SpO2 between 88% and 96%) during the time period from B0 to T0. 1. FiO2 &gt; 50% to reach saturation goal (saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) between 88% and 96%) during the time period from 30 minutes after birth (B0) to 45 minutes after birth (T0). 2. Presence of severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) necessitating immediate intubation and surfactant rescue at entry into the study, or having necessitated surfactant rescue prior to entry into the study. 3. Known lifethreatening congenital anomaly or genetic syndrome. 4. Participation in an interventional study in parallel to this observational study.</criteria>
