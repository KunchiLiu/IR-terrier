	<brief_summary>To provide children dependent on total parenteral nutrition with Omegaven®, a fish oil-based intravenous lipid emulsion that may be less hepatotoxic than conventional, vegetable oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions, and that may therefore reduce the need for liver transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The targeted population for enrollment is the cohort of patients with TPNdependent short bowel syndrome, defined as any pediatric patient who, following abdominal surgery, has a residual small bowel length less than 25% of that predicted for gestational age or requires postoperative TPN for more than 42 days because of gastrointestinal intolerance and who has developed TPNassociated liver disease sufficient to pose a significant risk for progression to liver failure based on the following criteria: Total serum bilirubin concentration greater than 3 mg/dL after a total duration of TPN greater than 2 months in the absence of a proven episode of bacteremia within the preceding 3 weeks. PLUS EITHER: • Platelet count less than 200,000/μL after a total duration of TPN greater than 2 months in the absence of a proven episode of bacteremia within the preceding 3 weeks. OR • Serum albumin concentration less than 3.2 mg/dL after a total duration of TPN greater than 2 months in the absence of a proven episode of bacteremia within the preceding 3 weeks. Patients with coagulopathy due to parenteral nutritionassociated liver disease (INR &gt; 1.2) will be potential candidates for enrollment, because patients with an elevated INR exceeding 2 have demonstrated resolution of coagulopathy after treatment with Omegaven®. Similarly, patients with hyperlipidemia will be potential candidates for enrollment. Alternatively, patients currently receiving Omegaven that was initiated at another center because of intestinal failure with liver disease that do not need to meet the lab criteria listed above. The subject may continue Omegaven under this protocol at the discretion of the Principle Investigator. Patients with a history of the following will be excluded from enrollment in this protocol: Allergy to fish or egg protein. Liver disease proven or suspected to be caused by a process other than TPNdependent short bowel syndrome, including but not limited to hepatitis C, hepatitis B, cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, familial intrahepatic cholestasis, and alpha1antitrypsin deficiency. Refusal of third party providers to reimburse hospital for the cost of Omegaven®.</criteria>
