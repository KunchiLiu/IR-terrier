	<brief_summary>To evaluate if the Ghost Ileostomy is really advantageous in laparoscopy we conducted a prospective randomized controlled study comparing 2 groups of patients undergoing anterior resection of the rectum laparoscopically. In the first group of patients at the end of the procedure was always performed a Ghost Ileostomy while in the second group no protective stoma was built at the end of the intervention.</brief_summary>
