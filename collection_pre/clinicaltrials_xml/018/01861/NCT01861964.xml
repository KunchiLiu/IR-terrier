	<brief_summary>Human and animal studies demonstrate that xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are a highly efficacious prebiotic ingredient that delivers benefits at a minimum level of 1.4 g/day (d), which is much lower than levels required by fructooligosaccharides (FOS, 5 g/d) or galactooligosaccharides (GOS, 8 g/d). XOS promotes gastrointestinal regularity and relieves diarrhea and constipation at 0.7 g/d and 1.4 g/d, respectively. Xylooligosaccharides may also reduce blood cholesterol and may improve glycemic control, although more data from clinical trials are needed to confirm preliminary findings.</brief_summary>
