	<brief_summary>Uterine myomas (fibroids or leiomyomas) are the most common benign tumor of the female genital tract and the leading indication for hysterectomy. Although hysterectomy is the definitive treatment of myomas, myomectomy remains the gold standard treatment for women desiring future fertility and uterine conservation3. However, bleeding is often a problem in myomectomy and can results in intraoperative hypovolemic shock, postoperative anemia, pelvic infection, and adhesions with infertility. A number of interventions have been introduced to reduce hemorrhage during myomectomy. Two categories of interventions can be identified: (a) Vascular interventions on uterine and/or ovarian arteries such as artery clamping, tying, or embolization; (b) pharmacologic interventions such as vasopressin, epinephrine, oxytocin, ergometrine, misoprostol, sulprostone, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist4-11. Of these, intraoperative local injection of vasopressin causing vasospasm is most commonly used. However, there is not a wide consensus on the use of this agent because of serious side effects reported in literature. In addition, in several countries, including France and Italy, vasopressin has not been commercialized because of its potential adverse effects on cardiovascular system. Epinephrine also induces a vasoconstrictive effect on tissue that lasts longer than that of vasopressin (5-6 hours versus 7-35 minutes) and is used during various gynecological surgeries, endoscopic resection, and dermatologic procedures to reduce blood loss. However, there are a few studies for the use of epinephrine to reduce hemorrhage during myomectomy. Furthermore, a randomized comparison of epinephrine and vasopressin as hemostatic agents during myomectomy has never been conducted. To test the hypothesis that the injections of epinephrine and vasopressin during myomectomy are equivalent in reducing blood loss, the investigators performed this randomized controlled study.</brief_summary>
