	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) who were previously randomized and have completed the 8week treatment in ACT12688 study with an acceptable safety profile. Patients who for administrative reasons could not be enrolled in the LTS12593 study right after completion of the 8week treatment in the ACT12688 study must be enrolled within 3 months from the end of the ACT12688 study Signed written informed consent for Study LTS12593 Exclusion criteria: Patient with any adverse event leading to study drug (active or placebo) treatment discontinuation from ACT12688 study. Patient with any abnormalities or adverse events that per investigator judgment would adversely affect patient's participation in the longterm extension study. Use of any immunosuppressant (if patient is on immunosuppressant he or she must discontinue immunosuppressant before starting the LTS12593). If the patient started biological treatment for UC while waiting to be enrolled in the LTS12593, then he or she must stop the biological treatment and must have 8 weeks of wash out period before starting treatment with SAR339658 (only antitumor necrosis factors (TNFs) are allowed) Patients exposed to an antiintegrin or any investigational drug administered after the end of treatment in ACT12688 Positive pregnancy test Breast feeding woman Women of childbearing potential not protected by highly effective contraceptive method of birth control and/or who are unwilling and unable to be tested for pregnancy.
