	<brief_summary>In this research, the investigators want to see if early detection of HIV infection can be improved by testing young adults who seek urgent health care from pharmacies and healthcare facilities with symptoms similar to those people get with recent HIV infection. Specific objectives: 1. What proportion of people presenting with these symptoms are HIV positive at the point of seeking urgent health care? 2. What proportion of those who test negative or where the result is unclear (one rapid test positive and one negative) at first rapid HIV testing, will test positive two weeks later? 3. What is the best way (SMS, phone call or home visit) to remind people to come for the second test after two weeks? 4. Will young adults who seek urgent health care for fever, body pains, diarrhoea or an STD from pharmacies or health facilities find it acceptable to be invited for an HIV-1 test at the time of health care seeking? Hypotheses 1. Targeted screening for AHI among patients seeking health care for symptoms compatible with AHI or sexually transmitted disease (STD) will identify AHI cases in more than 1% of those screened. 2. Intense follow-up of patients evaluated for AHI will improve rates of repeat HIV-1 testing 2-4 weeks after initial health-care seeking, relative to standard practice (i.e., recommendation to return for testing on a given date).</brief_summary>
