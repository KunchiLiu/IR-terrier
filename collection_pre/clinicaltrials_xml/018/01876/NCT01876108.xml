	<brief_title>The Effect of Helicobacter Pylori Eradication on Liver Fat Content in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized double blind clinical trial was performed in dyspeptic patients with positive antibody to HP and the evidence of fatty liver in ultrasonography. After excluding other causes, participants with persistent elevated serum aminotransferase levels were presumed to have NAFLD. Those with NAFLD liver fat score greater than (-0.64) and positive urea breath test (UBT) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to lifestyle modification alone or lifestyle modification plus HP eradication groups. Quadruple therapy (omeprazole, amoxicillin, bismuth subcitrate, and clarithromycin) for HP eradication was performed in two weeks. HP eradication was documented by UBT. Liver fat content, fasting serum glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglyceride, cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein,homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR), and anthropometric measurements (body mass index and waist circumference) were checked at baseline and six months later.</detailed_description>
