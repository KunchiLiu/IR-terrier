	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to see whether the addition of Clindamycin, a protein inhibiting antibiotic, to the standard antibiotic treatment of limb cellulitis, with Flucloxacillin, results in less tissue damage and a more rapid resolution of both systemic and local features, in a cost-effective manner. This study is a randomised controlled trial comparing Clindamycin with placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Clindamycin for Cellulitis: C4C Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Criteria to be used to assess tissue damage and clinical response: 1. Fever, tachycardia, neutrophil count, urea and other laboratory parameters at five and ten days post first dose of clindamycin 2. Limb swelling (by the measurement of limb circumference), skin surface temperature and tissue damage (by the proportion of the limb affected) 3. Document the duration between initial systemic features and the development of local signs 4. Examine the effect of the duration between systemic and local features and first dose of flucloxacillin on the subsequent duration and severity of cellulitis 5. Examine the effect of duration between the first dose of flucloxacillin and the first dose of clindamycin on the subsequent duration and severity of cellulitis 6. Identify and quantify possible side effects of clindamycin</detailed_description>
