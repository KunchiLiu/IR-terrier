	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of consuming 50g of fat from 5 different sources (coconut, canola, grapeseed, chia, and butter) on arterial stiffness, blood pressure and blood glucose levels. It is hypothesized that butter will have the most detrimental effect on acute vascular function. Canola, grapeseed and chia oil with their decreased content of SFA are hypothesized to impair vascular function to a lesser extent.</brief_summary>
