	<brief_title>Treatment of a Resistant Disease Using Decitabine Combined With Vemurafenib Plus Cobimetinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the proposed schedule of decitabine and Vemurafenib plus Cobimetinib in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Assess tumor response rates by RECIST criteria Secondary Objectives To measure the time to progression of patients treated with this combination in comparison to patients treated historically with Vemurafenib alone (the current standard of care in BRAF-mutated patients)</detailed_description>

Patients with CNS disease are eligible for treatment only after their CNS disease has been directly addressed with radiation therapy.

No measurable disease Pregnant, breastfeeding women or WOCBP not willing to use a double barrier method of contraception during the study and 3 months after the end of treatment. One method of contraception must be a barrier method. WOCBP are defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). Male patients whose sexual partners are WOCBP not using a double method of contraception during the study and 3 months after the end of treatment.
