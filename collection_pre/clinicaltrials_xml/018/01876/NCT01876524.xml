	<brief_title>tRNS in Anterior Cingulate Cortex Reduces Craving Over Dual Pathology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: There is an intimate relationship between addictive behaviors and other mental disorders, proven by clinical practice and many epidemiological studies, genetic and neuroscience. This gives risk to the diagnosis of Dual Pathology: an addiction and another mental disorder. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that anterior cingulate cortex is associated with substance´s dependence and craving. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) stimulates parts of the brain and can change it´s activity. Researchers are interested in reduce cravings for substance dependence on patients with Dual Pathology using tRNS in anterior cingulate cortex. Aims: To determine whether tRNS in anterior cingulate cortex can reduce craving over Dual Pathology patients.</detailed_description>
