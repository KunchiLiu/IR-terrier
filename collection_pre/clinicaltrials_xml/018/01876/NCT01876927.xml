	<brief_summary>Study design: Multicenter, randomized, open label phase II study Arm A: DOX 4 cycles - Surgery - Follow-up Arm B: DOX 2 cycles - Surgery - DOX 2 cycles - Follow-up Population: Male or female, 18-75 years of age, with a diagnosis of histologically confirmed, potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Sample Size: Planned sample size is 90 patients, 45 patients for each arm (p0=50%, p1=80%, alpha=0.05 (two sides), beta=0.2) Treatment Plan: Treatment will be administered for 4 and 2 cycles before surgery in arm A and B, respectively, and in arm B for a further 2 cycles after surgery unless progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, or a patient refuses treatment. In such cases patients will go off treatment. 3-6 weeks after the end of the fourth (arm A) or second (arm B) preoperative cycle, patients will undergo surgery. After surgery 3-6 weeks from surgery patients in arm B will receive 2 more cycles. DOX: Docetaxel 35 mg/m2 day 1 and 8 Oxaliplatin 80 mg/m2 day 1 Capecitabine 750 mg/m2 x 2 daily for 2 weeks Cycles repeated every 3 weeks Evaluation criteria: Tumor assessment will be performed according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1). Duration of Study: Overall study duration: 07/2010- 03/2017 Planned study duration per patient: 5 years</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-Operative Or Peri-Operative Dox Regimen In Patients With Locally Advanced Resectable Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title: A randomised phase II study of pre-operative or peri-operative docetaxel, oxaliplatin, capecitabine (DOX) regimen in patients with locally advanced resectable gastric cancer. Clinical Phase: II Study Objectives: Primary: The percentage of patients receiving all the planned chemotherapeutic cycles. Secondary: - Downstaging according to Recist criteria - pT1-3 vs pT0. - Safety: number of patients with grade 3-4 toxicity - The role of PET Scan as predictor of response - Curative vs palliative surgery - TTP - OS - Diagnostic correlation between the various staging methods - Possible correlations between CT scan, CT/PET, laparoscopy; - Molecular markers related to toxicity: DPYD, MTHFR, TS, XPD, ERCC1, XRCC1; - Molecular markers related to prognosis: TYMS, GSTP1, COX-2, RUNX3, methylation profile (Cox2, hMLH1, MGMT); - Molecular markers related to therapy response: TYMS, DPYD, MTHFR, OPRT, ERCC1, XRCC1/2/3, GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1, ABCB1, methylation profile (Cox2, hMLH1, MGMT), whole genome arrayCGH. Study design: Multicenter, randomized, open label phase II study Arm A: DOX 4 cycles - Surgery - Follow-up Arm B: DOX 2 cycles - Surgery - DOX 2 cycles - Follow-up Population: Male or female, 18-75 years of age, with a diagnosis of histologically confirmed, potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach.
