	<brief_summary>The sensory and motor perception thresholds can influence the therapeutic effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation. This study aimed to determine the threshold of sensory perception and the threshold of motor response in young and elderly subjects of both sexes. Eighty healthy volunteers were evaluated; 40 women and 40 men divided into two equal groups of young and elderly subjects. Half of the individuals in each group were stimulated with 5 and 50Hz frequency, with pulse duration of 20, 100, 400, 1000 and 3000Âµs applied on the flexor muscle bellies of the wrist and fingers. The threshold of sensory perception was identified as the first sensation of increased current intensity and the threshold of motor response as the minimum muscle contraction detected. The results were submitted to ANOVA test, followed by the Tukey test, with a significance level of 5%.</brief_summary>
