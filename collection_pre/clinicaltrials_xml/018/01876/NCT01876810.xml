	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of gemfibrozil on nicotine reinforcement and cue-elicited craving. Other objectives of this study include screening for the ability of gemfibrozil to aid smoking abstinence during a brief quit attempt and examining the validity of using laboratory measures of tobacco dependence to predict smoking abstinence. It is hypothesized that gemfibrozil will result in diminished nicotine reinforcement, an attenuated response to smoking cues, and an increase in smoking abstinence compared with placebo. It is also hypothesized that the laboratory measures will prove valid in predicting abstinence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initial Screening of Gemfibrozil as a Novel Treatment for Tobacco Addiction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Animal studies have shown that drugs acting as agonists at alpha-type peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα) suppress nicotine self-administration, attenuate relapse to nicotine-seeking behavior in the reinstatement model, and block nicotine-induced neuronal firing and dopamine release in reward pathways of the brain. These results have been demonstrated with synthetic PPARα agonists and with fibrate drugs (clofibrate, fenofibrate), which are used clinically to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides levels. Thus, PPARα is a potential target for the treatment of tobacco addiction. This is the first human study to investigate whether a fibrate drug (gemfibrozil, Lopid®) can reduce nicotine reward and aid smokers in becoming tobacco abstinent. The objectives of this study are: 1. to investigate the effect of gemfibrozil on laboratory measures of nicotine reinforcement and cue-elicited craving 2. to screen for the ability of gemfibrozil to aid smoking abstinence during a brief quit attempt 3. to examine the validity of using laboratory measures of tobacco dependence to predict smoking abstinence and possible gemfibrozil-related increases in smoking abstinence This outpatient study will be conducted at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, Canada. This site will enroll 40 adult smokers who intend to quit smoking in the next 3 months. The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design comparing the effects of gemfibrozil and placebo. The study will comprise two 2-week medication phases with a washout period of at least one week. At the end of the first medication week laboratory measures will be taken and during the second medication week participants will make a quit attempt and abstinence will be assessed. Outcome measures include laboratory assessments of nicotine reinforcement and smoking cue reactivity. The measure of nicotine reinforcement is the percentage of nicotine cigarette puffs chosen during a forced-choice task. Measures of cue reactivity include tobacco craving, mood, and autonomic responsivity. Other measures are days of smoking abstinence during the quit-attempt weeks. Abstinence is assessed by self-reports of no smoking and by breath carbon monoxide &lt; 5 ppm on clinic visits. Other assessments of abstinence include self-reported tobacco craving and withdrawal.</detailed_description>
