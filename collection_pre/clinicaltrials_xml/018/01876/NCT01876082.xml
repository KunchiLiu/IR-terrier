	<brief_summary>Desmoids tumors are benign soft tissues tumors characterized by aggressiveness and potential local recurrence. There is a female predominance with a sex ratio of 2/1 and median age at diagnosis is about 30 years. Only a complete surgical excision is recommended in desmoids tumors. Some forms of desmoid tumors are recurrent and/or symptomatic and are not accessible to a conservative surgical treatment. In these clinical situations, only a medical treatment may achieve tumor control and quality of life maintenance. Place of systemic treatments in the management of desmoids tumors is poorly evaluated. Regarding chemotherapy, methotrexate and vinblastine protocol is actually the best evaluated combination, which allowed observing objective response rate between 40 and 75%. Toxicity was mainly marked by the risk of haematological toxicity. Pazopanib is an inhibitor of multi-target tyrosine kinase, in oral form, with selective type receptors -1, -2 and -3 of VEGF receptors on the PDGFA and B, and c-Kit. It is currently under clinical development in humans in the treatment of several tumor types.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PAZOPANIB Efficacy and Tolerance in Desmoids Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, randomized, multicenter, open label trial, evaluating efficacy and safety of pazopanib versus a chemotherapy protocol combining methotrexate and vinblastine in progressive and symptomatic desmoid tumors. This study will include 72 patients in 15 centers of the French Sarcoma Group. Patients will be treated according to therapeutic strategy allocated by randomization until documented RECIST progression and for a maximum of 12 months : - Arm A = experimental strategy: daily oral administration of pazopanib. - Arm B = reference strategy: methotrexate-vinblastine. In case of documented radiological progression (RECIST criteria): - Patients initially included in arm A will have the opportunity, as determined by the investigator, to receive arm B treatment, or leave the study, - Patients initially included in arm B will have the opportunity, as determined by the investigator, to receive arm A treatment, or leave the study.</detailed_description>
