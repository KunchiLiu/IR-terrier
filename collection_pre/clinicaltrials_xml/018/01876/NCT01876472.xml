	<brief_summary>Adult recipients of cochlear implants (CI) generally loose interest in listening to music. This may be due to the rather limited spectral resolution of CI. However, child CI-recipients, if offered the opportunity, like to listen to music. They participate actively in musical acitivities, such as singing, dancing or playing an instrument. Thus, there seems to be a fundamental difference in the music perception of people who receive CI as child or as adult. This study assesses music perception skills of child, teen and adult cochlear implant recipients in settings with simple tone sequences and in a more complex, melodious context.</brief_summary>
