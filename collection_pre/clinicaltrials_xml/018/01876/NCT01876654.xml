	<brief_summary>Patient specific instrumentation is an alternative to conventional intra- and extra-medullary guides to perform the femoral and tibial cuts in total knee replacement (TKR). This instrumentation could provide a better alignment of a TKR, reduce blood losses and operative time, and improve clinical outcomes. The primary goal of this study is to compare the femorotibial mismatch angle of two groups of patients: patients undergoing posterior stabilized, mobile bearing TKR with conventional P.F.C. Sigma® HP instrumentation (DePuy Johnson &amp; Johnson, Warsaw, Indiana), versus patient undergoing TKR with the TruMatch® (DePuy Johnson &amp; Johnson, Warsaw, Indiana) cutting guide.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Good alignment after a TKR leads to faster rehabilitation, better clinical outcomes and lower revision rate. A correct rotational (axial) alignment reduces patellofemoral complications, polyethylene wear and unexplained knee pain. A randomized controlled study is conducted to test if to use the TruMatch® (DePuy Johnson &amp; Johnson, Warsaw, Indiana) patient specific instrumentation reduces the number of patients presenting femorotibial mismatch. Secondary goals are to compare: - alignment in the coronal, sagittal and axial plane of the femoral component; - alignment in the coronal and sagittal plane of the tibial component; - number of recuts during surgery and surgeon's adherence to planning; - blood loss; - clinical outcome after two months using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS). After having signed informed consent, patients will be randomized in 2 groups preoperatively. A long-leg CT scan, according to manufacturer's instructions, will be performed on patients randomized to the TruMatch® group. Haemoglobin and haematocrit will be recorded pre- and postoperatively. Two months after surgery a knee CT-scan, anteroposterior and laterolateral scanograms will be performed on all patients, and OKS will be recorded.</detailed_description>
