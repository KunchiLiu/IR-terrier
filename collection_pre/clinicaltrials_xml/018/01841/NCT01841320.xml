	<brief_summary>This research examines the effectiveness of an intervention that employs seek, test, and treat strategies for Vietnamese injection drug users (IDU) and their network members, by ensuring that high risk individuals are sought for HIV testing and promptly referred to and maintained on antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV prevention interventions are provided to IDUs who test HIV-negative, as well as those who test HIV-positive. HIV-positive IDUs will be referred to HIV care through a two-arm randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of different levels of engagement in care on ART uptake, ART adherence, and treatment outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seek, Test, Treat Strategies for Vietnamese Drug Users: A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid injection and HIV infection are major public health problems in Vietnam. Injection drug users (IDUs) have a high burden of HIV infection (20% HIV prevalence, nationally; 6% mortality per year) and the high rate of HIV transmission continues (HIV incidence, 5% per year). The investigators propose an intervention that employs the seek, test, and treat strategies for the IDU population and their network members, by ensuring that high risk individuals are sought for HIV testing, promptly referred to and maintained on ART, while HIV prevention interventions provided to the many who test HIV-negative, as well as those who test HIV-positive. The intervention will seek and test IDUs and their network members in the community, particularly those who are recently released from drug treatment centers. HIV-positive IDUs will be referred to HIV care through a two arm randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of different levels of engagement in care on ART uptake, antiretroviral adherence, and treatment outcome.</detailed_description>
