	<brief_summary>The major impact of this study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy. The investigators hypothesize that a subset of adult severe asthma patients will respond to supplemental L-arginine and derive clinical benefit from the addition of this therapy to standard-of-care asthma medications. The investigators hypothesize that the patients that benefit most will have low exhaled nitric oxide concentrations (&lt; 20 ppb) at baseline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>L-arginine in Severe Asthma Patients Grouped by Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that a subset of adult severe asthma patients will respond to supplemental L-arginine and derive clinical benefit from the addition of this therapy to standard-of-care medications. We hypothesize that these patients will have lower exhaled NO concentrations (&lt;20 ppb) and lower nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2)/ arginase I (Arg1) mRNA ratios in their airway epithelial cells than "non-responders." The aim is to test the hypothesis that adult severe asthma subjects with exhaled breath NO concentrations &lt; 20 ppb will have fewer American Thoracic Society (ATS)-defined asthma exacerbations over 3 months when treated with L-arginine compared to subjects with exhaled nitric oxide concentration (FeNO) &gt; 25 ppb. The major impact of this study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy to define the underlying mechanisms of arginine benefit in asthma. This follows our initial 20 subject trial of L-arginine in asthma subjects (Kenyon et al., Pharmaceuticals 2011) that was designed to determine how L-arginine was metabolized (by testing serum markers) and whether certain participants had clinical benefit. To do this, we will recruit a total of 50 ATS-defined severe asthmatic subjects with ongoing asthma exacerbations in past two months and enroll them in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over designed trial of L-arginine and placebo. We will compare 25 subjects with "low" FeNO &lt; 20 with 25 subjects that have "high" FeNO &gt; 25 ppb.</detailed_description>
