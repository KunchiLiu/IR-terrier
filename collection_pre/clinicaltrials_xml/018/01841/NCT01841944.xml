	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to investigate the possible effects of supplementation with 1.8 g/day of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality during a follow-up period of 2 years in an elderly population after having experienced an acute myocardial infarction. The hypothesis is that this supplementation on top of modern therapy will reduce the combined cardiovascular end-point of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and revascularizations with at least 30%.</brief_summary>
