	<brief_summary>The rate of axillary dissection avoided in patients with Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) and a mastectomy indication will be obtained by calculating the proportion of women with GAS in-patient population that will prove to be DCIS or DCIS-MI + CCI. A confidence interval of 95% will be deferred.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The rate of axillary dissection avoided in patients with DCIS and a mastectomy indication will be obtained by calculating the proportion of women with GAS in-patient population that will prove to be DCIS or DCIS-MI + CCI (after the final histology). A confidence interval of 95% will be deferred (binomial). The rate of axillary dissection avoided in patients with DCIS-MI and an indication of mastectomy is obtained by calculating the proportion of women with a GAS-all women with DCIS-MI and an indication of mastectomy. A confidence interval of 95% will be deferred (binomial).</detailed_description>
