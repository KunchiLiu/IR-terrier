	<brief_summary>This is a non-inferiority study comparing omarigliptin with sitagliptin in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy. The primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in participants treated with omarigliptin is non-inferior to that in participants treated with sitagliptin. There will be a 2-week run-in period with placebo + metformin prior to the double-blind treatment period.</brief_summary>
