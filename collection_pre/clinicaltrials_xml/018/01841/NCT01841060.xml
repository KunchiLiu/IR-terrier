	<brief_summary>Lung tumors of non-small cell stage 1A are usually treated surgically but many patients are not operable because of their condition or respiratory problems associated with it. The treatment is then suggested that local radiotherapy is conventionally carried out in split mode for 6 weeks at a dose of 60-65 Gy irradiation mode This exposes the patient to complications, including post-radiation pneumonitis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung tumors of non-small cell stage 1A are usually treated surgically but many patients are not operable because of their condition or respiratory problems associated with it. The treatment is then suggested that local radiotherapy is conventionally carried out in split mode for 6 weeks at a dose of 60-65 Gy irradiation mode This exposes the patient to complications, including post-radiation pneumonitis. This can be problematic in patients with respiratory failure for which surgical treatment has been challenged. Radiofrequency pulmonary developed as a therapeutic alternative, it has the advantage of being performed in a session with less toxicity in the lung parenchyma</detailed_description>
