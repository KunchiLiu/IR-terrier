	<brief_summary>Ginseng (American ginseng, Asian ginseng, Korean ginseng etc) is expected to show positive hypoglycemic effects, including improvements in glycated blood proteins[HbA1c], fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ginseng on Glycemic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ginseng has demonstrated to have significant hypoglycemic effect. Its major pharmacological component is considered to be ginsenosides. Several trials have been undertaken in diabetes some of which have demonstrated advantages in glycemic control in both diabetic as well as non diabetic individuals although clinical consistency of results is lacking.The lack of high quality data in this area to support diabetes recommendations represents an urgent call for stronger evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials remains the "Gold Standard" of evidence for recommendations and clinical guidelines development. Therefore, investigators will conduct a systematic review and meta-analyses of controlled trials to assess the effect of ginseng on glycemic control.</detailed_description>
