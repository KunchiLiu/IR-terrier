	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and effect of anacetrapib on low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) when added to ongoing lipid-lowering therapy. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with anacetrapib 100 mg for 12 weeks will lower LDL-C to a greater extent than treatment with placebo.</brief_summary>
