	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of an HIV medication (raltegravir) in the blood, and how it is affected if raltegravir is taken at the same time as another medicine for high blood pressure (amlodipine). Many patients with HIV will also have high blood pressure, so it is important to know which drugs for each of these conditions can be taken together without affecting how well they work individually. Over a 3 week period, participants took amlodipine for 2 weeks, and raltegravir for 2 weeks, with the middle week being on both drugs. The investigators will look at and compare the levels of these two drugs in the blood after subjects have taken them separately and both together. This study is randomised into two groups with both study medications received by all participants in a three-period crossover pattern; randomisation determined which medication was taken first. Once randomised allocation was performed, medications were administered in an open-label fashion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Two Way Cross Over Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study Between Raltegravir and Amlodipine in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-negative male and female volunteers will be enrolled, after written confirmation of informed consent, in a phase I, open-label, cross-over, PK study (approved by Westminster Research Ethics Committee and UK Regulatory Authorities; Eudra number 2012-005400-18). Subjects are randomized to receive either raltegravir 400mg twice-daily (seven days), followed by raltegravir 400mg twice-daily plus amlodipine 5mg once-daily (seven days), followed by amlodipine 5mg once-daily alone (seven days), or the same treatments in the opposite order, in the fasted state (at least eight hours) with 240mL of water. Intensive PK sampling and safety laboratory analysis are performed at the end of each phase (Days 7, 14 and 21). Raltegravir and amlodipine plasma concentrations will be analysed by a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. PK parameters are determined by non-compartmental methods [WinNonlin Phoenix (version 6.1; Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, CA, USA]. These are the concentrations measured 12 and 24 hours post-dose (C12h, C24h) for raltegravir and amlodipine, respectively; the maximum concentration (Cmax); and the area under the curve over 12 and 24 hours (AUC12h, AUC24h) for raltegravir and amlodipine, respectively.</detailed_description>
