	<brief_summary>Prolonged Collagen/Epinephrine - closure time (CEPI-CT) indicates platelet dysfunction in CKD patients taking antiplatelet agent. The synthetic vasopressin derivative, Desmopressin (DDAVP) shortens the prolonged bleeding time and improves platelet dysfunction measured by in vitro closure time: CEPI-CT in uremic patients. Desmopressin also antagonizes the in vitro platelet dysfunction induced by GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, clopidogrel and aspirin. The investigators designed a prospective study to evaluate the effect of desmopressin on platelet function, as measured by in vitro collagen/epinephrine - closure time, in uremic patients who were taking antiplatelet drugs.</brief_summary>
