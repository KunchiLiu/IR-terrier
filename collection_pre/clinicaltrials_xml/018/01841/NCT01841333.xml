	<brief_title>PF-04449913 For Patients With Acute Leukemia at High Risk of Relapse After Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disease relapse is the most common cause of death after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for acute leukemia. Patients at high risk for relapse may benefit from a novel, biologically rational therapeutic intervention to prevent this outcome. PF-04449913 is a small molecule inhibitor of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway that inhibits the protein Smoothened (SMO). Aberrant Hh signaling may contribute to the survival and expansion of the leukemia stem cell, and inhibiting the Hh pathway can eliminate these cells. Therefore, targeting Hh may be a logical intervention in the post-transplantation setting for those with high risk of relapse. The investigators propose a phase 2 study of PF-04449913 in post-allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients at high risk of relapse. This is an open label, phase 2 study employing PF-04449913 in acute leukemia patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation and are at high risk of relapse. Patients will receive consecutive 28-day cycles of PF-04449913 at 100 mg/day, beginning on post-transplantation day 80 +/- 10 days, after their routine post-transplant bone marrow biopsy. Treatment will continue for up to one year or until they experience toxicity or disease relapse. Seventeen patients will be required for an 80% power to detect a 30% difference in one-year relapse free survival.</detailed_description>
