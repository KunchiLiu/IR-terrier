	<brief_summary>Hemorrhoids are vascular cushions in the anal canal. People are normally born with hemorrhoids, and the presence of hemorrhoids does not imply disease. However, hemorrhoids typically cause symptoms when they enlarge over time. There are two types of hemorrhoids- External Hemorrhoids and Internal Hemorrhoids. Current minimally invasive technologies for the treatment of internal hemorrhoids are associated with several drawbacks that include high rate of recurrence and a need for repetitive procedures, frequent post-procedural pain or significant discomfort, intra-operative pain and technically demanding. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the HET Bipolar System is safe and effective in the treatment of Stage I and Stage II hemorrhoids (internal hemorrhoids). The HET Bipolar System is a new alternative device for the minimally invasive treatment of Stage I and Stage II hemorrhoids that incorporate design features with the intent of resolving each of the major limitations of currently available technology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of HET Bipolar System for Treatment of Stage I and Stage II Hemorrhoids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators will use the HET Bipolar System for the treatment of Stage I and Stage II hemorrhoids, where significant tissue prolapse is not present. The hemorrhoids are treated by bipolar ligation of the superior hemorrhoidal blood supply. Each prospective subject will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria at least one week prior to treatment. All patients undergoing treatment will review and sign the study Informed Consent prior to their procedure. One to three internal hemorrhoids will be treated in one therapeutic session. The number will be based on the investigator's judgment of which quadrants are symptomatic. Evaluations will be recorded for all treated subjects immediately following treatment. Subjects will be followed at 1, 3, and 6 months post procedure unless complications are reported between scheduled follow-up dates. At each post treatment follow-up, a report will be made of pain/discomfort, bleeding, medication use, itching, presence of adverse events or complications and need for supplemental treatment. Face-to-face follow-up evaluations will include anoscopic evaluation and assessment of hemorrhoid and other relevant symptoms.</detailed_description>
