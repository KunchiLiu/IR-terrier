	<brief_summary>ALS is a severe progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration motor neurons leading to death in 3 to 5 years. Gradually in time, the patient deprived of all motor skills as well as the possibility of communication written and oral developing a state close Locked In Syndrome (LIS). The main objective is to establish the feasibility of brain-computer interface using the pathological condition, with dependent disabled subjects as a means of communication.</brief_summary>
