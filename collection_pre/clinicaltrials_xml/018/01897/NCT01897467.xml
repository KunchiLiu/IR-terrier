	<brief_summary>Losses of muscular fitness/balance are common occurrences with aging that can lead to an increased fall-risk. The accelerated bone loss that may accompany menopause makes some women even more "at-risk" for serious consequences related to falling. Interventions to reduce fall-risk have been conducted in an attempt to improve balance or muscular fitness, but often these interventions require monotonous exercises that don't arouse enough long-term interest to elicit the improvements. In other words, while the intervention may be beneficial, participants quit before they can realize any gains. Currently, there is little research that uses novel technology-based programs to promote balance exercises among middle-aged women. The Wii Fit system includes various strength and balance exercises integrated into games intended to have the participant have fun and retain interest, while also improving fitness. By using such a program, women could potentially improve their balance and decrease their fall risk in a way that is fun and exciting. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a Wii Fit based exercise program on balance/muscular fitness/markers of bone health in women between the ages of 45-60 with low bone mass. Volunteers who have moderately low bone levels (n = 28) will be randomly assigned to either the Wii Fit exercise intervention or a normally active control. Balance ability, muscular fitness, body composition, physical activity levels and markers of bone health will be assessed before and after the intervention. Each participant in the intervention will be provided a pre-programmed Wii Fit console and balance board to use at home. The intervention will consist of a 12-week program that they perform 30 minutes a day 3 days a week. The exercises include 10 minutes of Yoga poses and strength exercises and then 20 minutes of balance games such as soccer heading, ski slalom and table tilt. At the 6 week point and the conclusion of the intervention, participants will come to the lab for testing on the same tests done initially. The overall goal of this study is to gauge the efficacy of this intervention to improve balance, fitness, and bone health in at-risk women. This project is important because it offers an exciting, fun, and motivating way to impact fall-risk before clinical symptoms develop. Overall, this intervention could significantly reduce healthcare dollars spent on fall-related outcomes, as well as reduce fall-related mortality.</brief_summary>
