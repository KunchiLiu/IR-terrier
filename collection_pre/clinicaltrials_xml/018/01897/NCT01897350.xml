	<brief_summary>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a non invasive technique used to obtain functional and anatomical information on the heart. Several CMR parameters measured after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) have been shown to have prognostic value and are increasingly being used as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. Myocardial oedema is a prognostic indicator following myocardial infarction1. Myocardial salvage is calculated as the myocardial oedema minus infarct size; this again is a prognostic indicator following STEMI. However, myocardial oedema imaging is controversial. There are multiple sequences available, with no standardisation of sequences used to assess this surrogate endpoint. The investigators propose to conduct a study to measure the myocardial oedema by all available techniques to determine the agreement between these methods.</brief_summary>
