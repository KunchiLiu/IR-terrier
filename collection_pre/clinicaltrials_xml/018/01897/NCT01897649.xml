	<brief_summary>NUTRIOSE is a food ingredient defined as a carbohydrate polymer of vegetable origin (wheat starch or corn) with a degree of polymerization â‰¥ 3 and chemically transformed. It is soluble in aqueous solution, very poorly digested in the small intestine, it mostly reaches the colon where it stimulates fermentation. AFSSA, in its opinion of July 30, 2007, considers that this ingredient is a "soluble dietary fiber." The objective of this research is to determine, among healthy subjects, the effect of this dietary fiber on changes in gut microbiota and digestive tolerance during a 28 days consumption. Microbiological analyzes will be performed by RT-PCR. Digestive tolerance will be measured by the intelligence of a questionnaire by volunteers.</brief_summary>
