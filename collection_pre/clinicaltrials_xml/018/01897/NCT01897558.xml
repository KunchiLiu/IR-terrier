	<brief_summary>Pacemaker electrodes are either equipped with tines (passive fixation) or with a screw (active fixation) for initial fixation in the patient´s heart. Both types of electrodes provide similar results in a long-term follow-up and the use of one or the other electrode type in many instances is mainly based on the implanter´s preference. The PACMAN-trial investigates whether the two lead types are associated with different amounts of myocardial micro-damage during implantation.</brief_summary>
