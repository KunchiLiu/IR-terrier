	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is the comparative evaluation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering, atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence and clinical data in patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF and resistant/non-resistant hypertension, undergoing AF ablation alone or combined with percutaneous renal denervation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On the basis of the eligibility criteria, patients is assigned by the enrolling physician to one of two strata. The first stratum includes patients with moderate drug-resistant hypertension, defined by the Joint National Committee VII and ESH/ESC guidelines as office BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and &lt;160/100 mm Hg. The second stratum includes patients with drug-resistant hypertension, defined by office BP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Symptomatic drugrefractory AF (with history of failure of ≥2 class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs) in patients referred for catheter ablation of AF PAF with ≥1 monthly episodes or PersAF in patients who had already undergone ≥3 electrical cardioversions. PAF was defined as episodes lasting less than 7 days with spontaneous termination. PersAF was defined as lasting more than 7 days before being terminated pharmacologically or by electrical cardioversion. Officebased systolic blood pressure of ≥140/90 mm Hg, despite treatment with 3 antihypertensive drugs (including 1 diuretic) A glomerular filtration rate ≥45 mL/min/1⋅73 m2, with modification of diet using a renal disease formula Secondary causes of hypertension Severe renal artery stenosis or dual renal arteries Congestive heart failure with NYHA IIIV symptoms Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35% Transverse left atrial diameter &gt; 60 mm on transthoracic echocardiography 1. Previous AF ablation procedure 2. Treatment with amiodarone Previous renal artery stenting or angioplasty Type 1 diabetes mellitus</criteria>
