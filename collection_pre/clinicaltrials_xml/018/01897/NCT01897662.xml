	<brief_summary>NUTRIOSE is a food ingredient defined as a carbohydrate polymer of vegetable origin (wheat starch or corn) with a degree of polymerization â‰¥ 3 and chemically transformed. It is soluble in aqueous solution, very poorly digested in the small intestine, it mostly reaches the colon where it stimulates fermentation. AFSSA, in its opinion of July 30, 2007, considers that this ingredient is a "soluble dietary fiber." Recent work in China in overweight volunteers have shown an effect of NUTRIOSE on satiation and satiety, and demonstrate an effect on reducing weight and fat mass. By its action on satiety and reduced food intake, the NUTRIOSE be of interest in the management of overweight or obese. Among the possible mechanisms of action, are the metabolites produced by colonic fermentation of NUTRIOSE. The goal of this biomedical research is to study the effect of a dose of 14g/day of NUTRIOSE FB06 for 12 weeks on the evolution of weight, percentage of body fat and digestive tolerance in Caucasians overweight subjects. To gather evidence to support mechanisms of action, it is proposed to measure before consumption, then every 4 weeks, the effects of NUTRIOSE FB06 on satiety and satiation and changes in colonic flora and its metabolites.</brief_summary>
