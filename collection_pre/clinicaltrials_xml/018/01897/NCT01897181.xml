	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the central auditory processing in patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and to observe the change of the central auditory processing ability after using hearing aids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Central Auditory Processing and the Use of Hearing Aids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening for recruiting - Among patients who are visiting for hearing disturbance, patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss will be included after audiologic tests, history taking and physical examination. - audiologic tests: pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, impedence audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emission, auditory brainstem response. Dividing into "Hearing aids" group and "No hearing aids" group - The use of hearing aids will be recommended to all included patients. - Hearing aids group: patients who want to be prescribed hearing aids (28 subjects) - No hearing aids group: patients who do not want to be prescribed hearing aids (28 subjects) Audiologic test - Hearing in noise test (HINT), central auditory processing disorder test - at screening, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after starting hearing aids use</detailed_description>
