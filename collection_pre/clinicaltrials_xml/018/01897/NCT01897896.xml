	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SD-809 ER in subjects switching from tetrabenazine to SD-809 ER. In addition, the safety and tolerability of long term treatment with SD-809 ER will be assessed in "Switch" subjects as well as "Rollover" subjects completing a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of SD-809 ER,</brief_summary>
