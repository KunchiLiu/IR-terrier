	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study that is being conducted in two parts. The Phase 1 part (closed to accrual as of January 25, 2016) is comprised of dose escalation and expansion parts to establish the MTD and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) when tazemetostat is given BID (twice daily) orally on a continuous basis. Additionally, in separate cohorts in Phase 1, the effect of food on the bioavailability of tazemetostat as well as the drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of tazemetostat are being evaluated. The Phase 2 part was initiated once the MTD and /or RP2D was established. Phase 2 enrolls subjects with DLBCL (Cohorts 1-3 and 6) and FL (Cohorts 4 and 5) for the determination of efficacy and safety of tazemetostat monotherapy (Cohorts 1-5) and of tazemetostat in combination with prednisolone (Cohort 6) with placement determined by centrally confirmed histology, cell of origin (COO), and EZH2 mutation status.</brief_summary>

Time between prior anticancer therapy and first dose of tazemetostat as below: 1. Cytotoxic chemotherapy At least 21 days 2. Noncytotoxic chemotherapy (eg. Small molecule inhibitor) At least 14 days 3. Nitrosoureas At least 6 weeks 4. Monoclonal antibody (ies) At least 28 days 5. Radiotherapy At least 14 days from local site radiation therapy/At least 6 weeks from prior radioisotope therapy/At least 12 weeks from 50% pelvic or total body irradiation 6. High dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic cell infusion At least 60 days 7. High dose therapy with allogeneic transplant At least 90 days (if graft versus host disease [GVHD] is present, must be &lt; Grade 2) and no prohibited medications per Exclusion Criteria #3) Note: Starting at Cycle 1 Day 1, subjects may receive no more than 10 mg of prednisone daily (or equivalent corticosteroid, excluding protocoldefined prednisolone dosing for subjects enrolled in Cohort 6) when used for treatment of lymphoma related symptoms, with the intent to taper by the end of Cycle 1. 8. Males or females aged ≥ 18 years at the time of informed consent (Phase 2). Males and females aged ≥ 16 years at time of informed consent (Phase 1). 9. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at screening or baseline (as documented by a negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [betahCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of betahCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrheic, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dose). Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days prior to study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception, from the last menstrual period prior to randomization, during Treatment Cycles, and for 30 days after the last final dose of study treatment, and have a male partner who uses a condom. Highly effective contraception includes: 1. Double barrier methods of contraception such as condom plus diaphragm or cervical/vault cap with spermicide. 2. Placement of an intrauterine device. 3. Established hormonal contraceptive methods: oral, injectable, or implant. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. Female subjects exempt from this requirement are subjects who practice total abstinence or have a male partner who is vasectomized. If currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception as described above if they become sexually active during the Treatment Cycles, and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. 10. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy or they and their female partner must meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing potential or practicing highly effective contraception and use a condom throughout the study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation). 11. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol. Phase 1 only: 12. Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor or Bcell lymphomas that have progressed after treatment with approved therapies or for which there are no standard therapies available. Phase 2 only: 13. Subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria: 1.

Subjects may have relapsed/refractory disease following at least 2 standard prior treatment regimens, including at least 1 antiCD20based regimen, as well as alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide or bendamustine), and have no curative option with other available therapies OR have a contraindication to their use. Subjects with prior ASCT may be included. 2. Have provided sufficient archival tumor tissue that has been successfully tested for EZH2 mutation status and cell of origin (DLBCL only) at study specific laboratories allowing for allocation into an open cohort. 3. Have measurable disease as defined by International Working GroupNonHodgkin's Lymphoma (IWGNHL [Cheson, 2007]). Exclusion Criteria All Subjects: 1. Prior exposure to tazemetostat or other inhibitor(s) of EZH2. 2. Subjects with leptomeningeal metastases or brain metastases or history of previously treated brain metastases. 3.

Note: Minor surgery (eg. minor biopsy of extracranial site, central venous catheter placement, shunt revision) is permitted within 3 weeks prior to enrollment. 7. Inability to take oral medication, or malabsorption syndrome or any other uncontrolled gastrointestinal condition (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting) that might impair the bioavailability of tazemetostat. 8.
