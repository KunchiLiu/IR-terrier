	<brief_summary>The proposed PIVOTAL study will examine a panel of platelet/coagulation activity markers during the perioperative period. The goal is to develop a clinically useful assessment of platelet/coagulation activity for risk stratification that may ultimately serve as a target for therapeutic intervention. This study will enroll 200 patients with peripheral artery disease undergoing vascular surgery. PIVOTAL is funded by American Heart Association and is scheduled to begin enrollment in July 2013 for approximately two years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Activity in Vascular Surgery for Thrombosis and Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To describe platelet activity among PAD subjects undergoing vascular surgery. To determine whether preoperative platelet activity measurements are independently associated with perioperative cardiovascular events. To identify demographic, clinical, and surgical factors associated with postoperative platelet activity measurements in patients with established PAD.</detailed_description>
