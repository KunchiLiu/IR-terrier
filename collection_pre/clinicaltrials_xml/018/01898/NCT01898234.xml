	<brief_summary>Background: High- and low-flux dialysis membranes made of different materials may correlate with various hemodynamic tolerance profiles. This study aims to investigate hemodynamic response and incidence of hypotensive episodes by comparing some of the most commonly used high- and low-flux dialyzers. Methodology: The study was designed as an open label, randomized, cross-over investigation, including 25 patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Four polysulfone dialyzers of 1.8 m2, A (Revaclear, Gambro), B (Helixone high flux, Fresenius), C (Xevonta, BBraun) and D (Helixone low flux, Fresenius), were compared with each other. The hemodynamic profile was assessed with a non-invasive technique and patients were asked to provide tolerance feedback through a questionnaire.</brief_summary>
