	<criteria>Adults patients &gt;= 18 years of age Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma (surgically incurable and unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV; AJCC) with documented BRAF V600 mutation determined by the cobasÂ® BRAF V600 Mutation Test prior to administration of vemurafenib. Unresectable stage IIIC disease must have confirmation from a surgical oncologist Patients with either measurable or nonmeasurable disease (RECIST Version 1.1) Patients may or may not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 Patients must have recovered from all side effects of their most recent systemic or local treatment for metastatic melanoma Adequate hematological, renal, and liver function Negative serum pregnancy test at screening Fertile men and women must use an effective form of contraception during the study and for at least 6 months after completion of the study Evidence of symptomatic CNS lesions as determined by the investigator, use of steroid or antiseizure medication for treatment of brain metastases prior to the first administration of vemurafenib Patients with previous malignancies (other than melanoma) within the past 2 years except patients with treated and controlled basal or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin or carcinoma insitu of the cervix. Concurrent administration of any anticancer therapies (e.g. chemotherapy, other targeted therapy, experimental drug, etc.) other than those administered in this study Known hypersensitivity to vemurafenib or another BRAF inhibitor Pregnant or lactating women Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, external biliary shunt, or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption. Any of the following within the 6 months prior to the first vemurafenib administration: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack, pulmonary embolism, hypertension not adequately controlled by current medications.</criteria>
