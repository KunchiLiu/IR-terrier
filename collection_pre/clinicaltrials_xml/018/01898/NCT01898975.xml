	<brief_summary>Optimal fluid management has been considered as crucial part to determine postoperative outcome and organ function. Recently developed, non invasive cardiac output measurement(NICOM, Cheetah Medical, Portland, OR)has enabled continuous cardiac output(CO) monitoring just by attaching electrode on chest wall. Moreover, CO and SSV derived from NICOM have been demonstrated as predictors of fluid responsiveness. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate stroke volume variation derived from NICOM as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in neurosurgical patients. In addition, we plan to reveal inconclusive patients using gray zone approach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Gray Zone Approach to Stroke Volume Variation Derived From NICOM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimal fluid management has been considered as crucial part to determine postoperative outcome and organ function. Many reports have focussed on evaluation of fluid responsiveness using various parameters such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) or stroke volume variation (SSV) derived from invasive or semi-invasive monitoring. Recently developed, non invasive cardiac output measurement(NICOM, Cheetah Medical, Portland, OR)has enabled continuous cardiac output(CO) monitoring just by attaching electrode on thorax. Moreover, CO and SSV derived from NICOM have been demonstrated as predictors of fluid responsiveness. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate stroke volume variation derived from NICOM as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in neurosurgical patients. In addition, we plan to reveal inconclusive patients using gray zone approach.</detailed_description>
