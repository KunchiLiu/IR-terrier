	<brief_summary>The aim of this Phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cells (DCs) vaccine combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcoma. Experimental recombinant adenovirus-transfected DCs, which engineered to express MUC1 and Survivin are used for DCs-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our previously performed preclinical study with DCs vaccine combined with CIK cells, the investigators plan to perform the clinical trial.</brief_summary>
