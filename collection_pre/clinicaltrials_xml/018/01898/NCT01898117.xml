	<brief_summary>Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a difficult to treat molecular subtype with a poor survival. TNBC can be divided into at least two molecular entities; BRCA-like and non-BRCA-like. In this trial we would like to investigate whether a molecular subgroup exists within TNBCs that derives a benefit from bevacizumab added to first line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triple-B Study;Carboplatin-cyclophosphamide Versus Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab as First-line Treatment in Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In preclinical studies the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves drug access in the tumor. In humans, bevacizumab monotherapy normalizes the tumor vascularization. It is presently unknown what molecular subtype would derive a progression free survival (PFS) benefit of the addition of bevacizumab to first line chemotherapy. There are indications that patients with high VEFGA and/or VEFGR-2 plasma levels derive most benefit. There are indications that TNBC that are BRCA-like are more sensitive to bifunctional alkylating and platinum agents than non-BRCA-like TNBCs, and relatively resistant to taxanes. Consequently, because TNBCs in general derive substantial benefit from taxanes, we anticipate that non-BRCA-like TNBCs are exquisitely sensitive to taxanes. Bevacizumab and paclitaxel are synergistic in preclinical models. Therefore we anticipate that bevacizumab added to paclitaxel confers a substantial progression-free survival benefit in non-BRCA-like patients. We would like to test these hypotheses in a prospective clinical trial.</detailed_description>
