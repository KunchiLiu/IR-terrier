	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of activated natural killer cells in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and myeloid dysplastic syndromes. Giving chemotherapy before a donor natural killer cell infusion helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's natural killer cells. Modified natural killer cells may help the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells. Aldesleukin (interleukin-2) may stimulate the white blood cells (including natural killer cells) to kill leukemia cells.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Refractory AML without complete remission (CR) after induction therapy (primary induction failure) or relapsed AML after obtaining a CR. OR Highrisk AML (by ELN criteria; See Appendix C) in complete remission (CR) and has either refused hematopoietic stem cell transplantation OR is currently not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation OR for whom hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is being reserved for later relapse. This is inclusive of patients with minimal residual disease evidenced by cytogenetics, molecular testing, and/or flow cytometry. OR Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with excess blasts (&gt;5%) and progressive disease (see section 12.4) at any time after initiation of DNA hypomethylator treatment during the past 2 years, OR failure to achieve complete or partial response or hematological improvement (see section 12.4) after at least six cycles of azacytidine or four cycles of decitabine administered during the past 2 years, OR intolerance to azacytidine or decitabine. MDS patients with isolated 5q abnormalities that meet these criteria after lenalidomide therapy and DNA hypomethylator therapy are also eligible. At least 18 years of age. Available HLAhaploidentical donor that meets the following criteria: Related donor (sibling, offspring, or offspring of sibling) At least 18 years of age HLAhaploidentical donor/recipient match by at least Class I serologic typing at the A&amp;B locus. In general good health, and medically able to tolerate leukapheresis required for harvesting the NK cells for this study. Negative for hepatitis, HTLV, and HIV on donor viral screen Not pregnant Voluntary written consent to participate in this study Patients with known CNS involvement with AML are eligible provided that they have been treated and CSF is clear for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment into the study. CNS therapy (chemotherapy or radiation) should continue as medically indicated during the study treatment. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50 % Adequate organ function as defined below: Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dl AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 by CockcroftGault Formula Oxygen saturation ≥90% on room air Ejection fraction ≥35% Able to be off of corticosteroids and any other immune suppressive medications beginning on Day 3 and continuing until 30 days after the infusion of the CIML NK cells. However, use of lowlevel corticosteroids is permitted if deemed medically necessary. Lowlevel corticosteroid use is defined as 10mg or less of prednisone per day. . Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 28 days prior to study registration. Female and male patients (along with their female partners) must agree to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study and throughout the DLT evaluation period. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). Relapsed after allogeneic transplantation. Circulating blast count ≥30,000/uL by morphology or flow cytometry (cytoreductive therapies including leukapheresis or hydroxyurea are allowed). Uncontrolled bacterial or viral infections, or known HIV, Hepatitis B or C infection. Uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or EKG suggestive of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. New progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest xray or chest CT scan that have not been evaluated with bronchoscopy. Infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/ improving after 1 week of appropriate therapy (4 weeks for presumed or proven fungal infections). Known hypersensitivity to one or more of the study agents. Received any investigational drugs within the 14 days prior to the first dose of fludarabine. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.</criteria>
