	<brief_summary>Intraocular pressure is significantly increase during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy which is performed in a steep trendelenburg position at prolonged timeds of pneumoperitoneum. Threrefore we decided to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine in intraocular pressure during roboti-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
