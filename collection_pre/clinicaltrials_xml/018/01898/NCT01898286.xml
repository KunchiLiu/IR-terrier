	<brief_summary>This is an extension study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with DiaPep277® and to determine the long-term treatment effect of DiaPep277® on parameters of metabolic control and on preservation of beta-cell function in subjects who have long exposure to DiaPep277®.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Extension Study to Evaluate Long Term Safety and Treatment Effect of DiaPep277®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with DiaPep277® is expected to be long-term; stopping treatment may result in the eventual loss of the preserved beta-cell function. Indeed, extension of phase 2 studies has shown that patients who were initially treated with DiaPep277® and maintained their initial beta-cell function, required continuation of treatment, losing beta-cell function if switched to Placebo. These extension studies were too small for the outcome to be statistically significant, but they suggested that continuation of treatment is needed for long-term maintenance of efficacy. Therefore, in this extension study, patients who complete the 1001 phase 3 study (NCT01103284) and maintain clinically significant beta-cell function are offered a 2-year continuation of active treatment, since they are likely to benefit from use of the medication. The participation in the extension study will be offered to all eligible subjects who complete the 1001 study, regardless of the treatment arm allocation in the initial study. By achieving long-term preservation of beta-cell function, patients are expected to maintain good management of the disease, manifesting as better glycemic control and fewer hypoglycemic events.</detailed_description>
