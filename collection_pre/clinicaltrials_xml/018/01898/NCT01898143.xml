	<brief_summary>Whole body vibration training seems to be a useful adjunct in exercise training in patients with severe COPD. The basic principle relies on reflectory muscle contractions caused by a vibration stimulus. Until now the impact of whole body vibration training on cardiopulmonary parameters remained unknown. Therefore aim of this study is to investigate cardiopulmonary parameters during whole body vibration training in patients with chronic lung disease.</brief_summary>
