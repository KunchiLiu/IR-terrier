	<brief_summary>This first-in-human study is designed to establish the safety and tolerability of ATR-101 in patients with advanced adrenocortical carcinoma whose tumor has progressed on standard therapy. Information will also be collected to determine how long ATR-101 stays in the blood, and if any effect on tumor progression is seen. Biomarkers (blood and urine tests) will determine if any effects on production of steroid hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen and testosterone) are seen.</brief_summary>
