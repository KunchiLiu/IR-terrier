	<brief_summary>With functional imaging development, it becomes possible to increase radiation dose to radioresistant areas (located inside tumor volume) using radiotherapy dose-painting. This strategy is particularly suitable for prostate cancer where tumor hypoxia plays a major role in the resistance of these tumors to radiation. In order to develop intratumoral hypoxia targeting by radiotherapy dose-painting areas, we should characterize changes in hypoxia before treatment and during radiotherapy. - If hypoxia does not change during radiotherapy, radiotherapy dose-painting strategy by an "integrated" boost is performed. - If hypoxia varied (increasing or incomplete regression), a "final" boost strategy of radiotherapy dose-painting(IMRT, stereotactic brachytherapy or high dose rate) after a first fractionated IMRT could be considered. This study should show that PET imaging with fluoromisonidazole (18F-MISO) is an available tool to physicians in assessing tumor hypoxia.</brief_summary>
