	<brief_summary>Post-thoracotomy Pain Syndrome (PTPS) is defined as "pain that recurs or persists along a thoracotomy scar at least 2 months following surgery." PTPS presents a frustrating challenge to patients and healthcare providers alike. PTPS can affect up to 80% of patients undergoing thoracotomies, and results in significant impairment. A proposed mechanism for PTPS is the compression of the intercostal nerves during routine closure. Closure of thoracotomies using intracostal sutures is a novel technique where sutures are passed through holes drilled into the rib; thus, avoiding compression of the nerves. We propose a double-blind, randomized control study involving 90 patients undergoing elective posterolateral thoracotomies. Participants will be randomly assigned to undergo thoracotomy closure with pericostal sutures or intracostal sutures. Our primary outcome will assess the incidence and severity of PTPS at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery between groups.</brief_summary>
