	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies lymph node mapping using indocyanine green solution in diagnosing patients with malignant melanoma. Diagnostic procedures, such as lymph node mapping using indocyanine green solution, may help find out how far the melanoma has spread and may help in planning cancer treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lymph Node Mapping Using Indocyanine Green Solution in Diagnosing Patients With Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To show that indocyanine green (ICG) (indocyanine green solution) is equal to both isosulfan blue (ISB) and technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid (TSC) and will allow all lymph node mapping to occur in the operating room (OR). OUTLINE: Patients receive peri-tumoral, intradermal injections of isosulfan blue and indocyanine green solution. During surgery, patients undergo identification of the sentinel lymph node and imaging using a laser with videocamera (SPY Elite camera).</detailed_description>
