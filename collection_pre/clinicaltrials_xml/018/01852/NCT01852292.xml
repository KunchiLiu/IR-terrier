	<criteria>Patient has histologically/cytologicallyconfirmed HNSCC. Patient has archival or fresh tumor tissue for the analysis of PI3Krelated biomarkers. One tumor block (preferred) or a minimum of 12 unstained slides to be provided. Enrollment in the study is contingent on confirmation of an adequate amount of tumor tissue. Patients with recurrent or metastatic disease resistant to platinumbased chemotherapy (defined as progression while on platinumbased chemotherapy given in the recurrent/metastatic setting). Pretreatment with cetuximab is allowed Measurable disease as determined by per RECIST criteria v1.1. If the only site of measurable disease is a previously irradiated lesion, documented progression of disease and a 4 week period since radiotherapy completion is required Adequate bone marrow function and organ function ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1 Patient has received previous treatment with any AKT, mTOR inhibitors or PI3K pathway inhibitors; Patient treated with more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for recurrent/metastatic disease Patient has symptomatic CNS metastases. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases may participate in this trial. The patient must have completed any prior local treatment for CNS metastases ≥ 28 days prior to the start of study treatment (including radiotherapy and/or surgery) and must have stable low dose of corticosteroid therapy; Patient has not recovered to ≤ grade 1 (except alopecia) from related side effects of any prior antineoplastic therapy Patient has any of the following cardiac abnormalities:symptomatic congestive heart failure, history of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV), documented cardiomyopathy, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO); myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to enrolment, unstable angina pectoris, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, symptomatic pericarditis, QTcF &gt; 480 msec on the screening ECG (using the QTcF formula);</criteria>
