	<brief_summary>There is no study hypothesis. The purpose of this study is to see if the Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), when administered before and early after an autologous peripheral stem cell transplant will induce an immune response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploration of Immune Response to Early PCV13 Vaccination in Conjunction With Autologous Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study to determine the safety of PCV13 administered to patients with myeloma before and at +7-10 days and +21-24 days after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant; and,to quantify the immune response induced by PCV13 vaccination in patients with myeloma when administered before and early after autologous PSCT.</detailed_description>
