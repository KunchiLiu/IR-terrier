	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect on various biomarkers of treatment with MK-8237 in participants with allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis. In Part 1 of the study healthy participants undergo nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with house dust mite (HDM) extract in order to verify the operational performance of NAC and associated sample collection methods. Part 2, the main study, is a placebo controlled, double blind study of participants with HDM-induced allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis. The primary hypotheses are that the changes from baseline in post-allergen challenge HDM-specific Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and Immunoglobulin E blocking factor (IgE-BF) are greater after treatment with MK-8237 than after treatment with placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part 1: healthy participants has a Body Mass Index (BMI) =&lt; 30 kg/m^2 female of reproductive potential remains abstinent or uses two acceptable methods of birth control from 2 weeks before first allergen challenge to 2 weeks after last allergen challenge; alternatively hormonal contraception may be used. Part 2: has a Body Mass Index (BMI) =&lt; 38 kg/m^2 has a clinical history of allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis to HDM for at least one year, and used medication to relieve symptoms within the last year does not have asthma, or has mild controlled asthma not requiring regular use over the 12 months prior to screening of any corticosteroids female of reproductive potential remains abstinent or use two acceptable methods of birth control from 2 weeks before first allergen challenge to at least 2 weeks after last allergen challenge or last dose of study drug, whichever is longer has not smoked or used tobacco for the prior 6 months, and agrees not to during study Parts 1 and 2: is experiencing at the first NAC visit, symptoms from an upper or lower respiratory tract infection (viral or bacterial) has participated within the prior 3 months in another investigational study (that included an investigational drug or agent) is directly associated with the administration of the study or is related to the investigational study staff is mentally or legally incapacitated, has significant emotional problems or has a history of clinically significant psychiatric disorder within the past 5 years has a history of clinically significant endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematological, hepatic, immunological, renal, respiratory, genitourinary or major neurological (including stroke and chronic seizures) abnormalities or diseases has a history of cancer has a history of significant intolerability to drugs or food is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies or HIV had major surgery or lost 1 unit (500 mL) of blood within the prior 4 weeks has a clinical history of chronic sinusitis during the prior 2 years has any nasal condition (e.g. nasal polyposis) that could confound efficacy or safety assessments is pregnant or expects to conceive during the study period is a nursing mother consumes more than 3 glasses of alcoholic beverages per day regularly uses any illicit drug, or has a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the prior 6 months Part 2 only: is experiencing allergic rhinoconjunctivitis exacerbation at Screening NAC consumes excessive daily amounts of caffeinated beverages has a known history of allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to investigational medicines is sensitized and regularly exposed to animal dander and molds in the home or workplace in a manner that might interfere with the study in the opinion of the investigator is sensitized and regularly exposed to seasonal allergens such as Birch or grass pollen (sensitized but out of season is acceptable however) has a history of chronic urticaria and/or angioedema within the prior 2 years has had previous immunotherapeutic treatment with any HDM allergen for more than 1 month during the prior 3 years is receiving any specific immunotherapy within prior 60 days has a history of anaphylaxis with cardiorespiratory symptoms with prior immunotherapy due to an unknown cause or an inhalant allergen</criteria>
