	<brief_summary>Androgenic alopecia is the most common cause of hair loss in men. Finasteride and minoxidil are available in treatment of androgenetic alopecia, although the former causes decreased libido or ejaculate volume, erectile dysfunction, the latter causes scaling, itching of the scalp. Recently, Pulpkin Seed Oil shows some improved clinical efficacy on scalp hair growth in men with androgenetic alopecia, but there is no evidence to support this. The investigators conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and tolerability trial of Pumpkin seed oil (400mg/day)therapy in male patients with androgenetic alopecia.</brief_summary>
