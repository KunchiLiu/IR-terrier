	<brief_title>Perfusion Index Variability in Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral tissues of preterm infants are very sensitive for hypoperfusion, but there are rare data in the literature for peripheral perfusion after surfactant treatment. In this study the investigators aimed to compare the perfusion index (PI) variability in premature infants with respiratory distress (RDS) following instillation of one of two different natural surfactant preparations.</detailed_description>
