	<brief_summary>In collaboration with the Neurointerventional programs at state university of new york Buffalo, state university of new york Stonybrook, Swedish Medical Center, Erlanger Health System, Vanderbilt University, and West Virginia University School of Medicine, the investigators aim to prospectively collect experiences where direct aspiration as a first pass technique is used for thrombectomy procedures. The investigators also want to compare specific characteristics from these cases to other stroke cases where traditional thrombectomy devices were used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADAPT A Direct Aspiration, First Pass Technique for the Endovascular Treatment of Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally, at a physician's discretion, first pass attempts at thrombectomy procedures are performed with any number of FDA cleared catheters, guide wires, and devices designed for efficient removal of clot within an intracranial vessel. Among institutions involved in this case study, the latest devices are readily available and fully support standard treatment paradigms. However, several cases, recently completed, using only large bore catheter and aspiration have anecdotally demonstrated a superior ability to remove clot from vessels, restoring blood flow to the affected vessel and brain tissue. In these limited number of cases, full restoration of blood flow has been achieved. While this combination of approved devices is minimalistic, the efficiency of the procedure, rapid technical success, and relative simplicity of the approach is unique and should be thoroughly reviewed and possibly prepared for publication.</detailed_description>
