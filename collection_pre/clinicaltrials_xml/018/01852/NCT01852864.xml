	<brief_summary>The biological effects of castration on prostate cancers will be studies by administration of degarelix prior to radical prostatectomy. The effects will be studied by analysis of gene expression and immunohistochemistry focusing on markers of proliferation and apoptosis of samples taken at the time of radical prostatectomy (7 days after administration of degarelix). Tumours from patients treated with neo-adjuvant degarelix will be compared with tumours from patients who have not been medically castrated.</brief_summary>
