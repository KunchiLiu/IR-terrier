	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective non-randomised study is to examine whether two different microspheres (Bead-Block and Embosphere) are equally effective in the treatment of the uterine fibroid controlled with contrast-enhanced MR examination. Quantitative MR imaging, including dominant fibroid T1, T2 and contrast enhancement characteristics before intervention and 3 months after interventions will be analysed as a potential predictor of volumetric response after embolization. Another purpose is to determine long-term follow-up in all patient treated in a period from 2001-2011 in OUH analysed retrospectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uterine Fibroid Embolization- Long Term Follow up and Technical Perspectives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group 1: 26 patient will be treated with Bead-block microspheres - 700-900 µm microspheres or combinations of one vial 2 ml of 500-700 µm microspheres, follow by 700-900 µm microspheres until blood flow stop ( " cut the tree" appearance). Group 2: 26 patient will be treated with Embosphere; 500-900 µm until "near-stasis" flow stop in the uterine artery. Clinical and Technical success will be examined, and radiological follow-up 3 and 12 months after embolization using MR contrast-enhanced examination in a Bead Block group and only 3 months control in Embosphere group to assess total fibroid burden infraction degree and eventually residual contracts fibroid enhancement. Quantitative MRI dominant fibroid characteristic for and 3 months after an intervention to examine eventually potential of as a possible predictor of the volumetric response of the uterine fibroid. Retrospective study compromised all patient treated between January 2001 until January 2011 with follow up to January 2014, and re-intervention as well as complications rate analysis.</detailed_description>
