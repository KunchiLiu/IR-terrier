	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation (BOLT) followed by cadaveric partially-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is safe and effective for patients aged 5-40 years with primary immunodeficiency (PID) and end-stage lung disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Cadaveric Lung and Bone Marrow Transplant for Immune Deficiency Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an original IND for an investigator initiated phase I/II study. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of performing bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation (BOLT) followed by cadaveric, partially HLA-matched CD3+/CD19+-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from the same donor for patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) and end-stage lung disease. For many patients with primary immunodeficiencies, HSCT is a curative, life-saving therapy, resulting in restoration of function in the immune system. Patients with primary immunodeficiencies often develop pulmonary complications as a result of chronic or recurrent infections, making them ineligible for HSCT due to the high risk of mortality and pulmonary complications. Lung transplant prior to HSCT would allow for restoration of pulmonary function prior to HSCT, allowing PID patients to proceed to HSCT, which would be curative for the patient's underlying immunodeficiency. As a secondary aim after successful engraftment with donor bone marrow, there is realistic hope for tolerating planned withdrawal of immunosuppression achieving eventual freedom from all immunosuppressive drugs and attaining a tolerant state.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients should be between the ages of 5 and 40 years Patients should have evidence of an underlying primary immunodeficiency for which HSCT is clinically indicated. o Examples of such diseases include, but are not limited to: Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Combined immunodeficiency with defects in Tcellmediated immunity, including Omenn syndrome and DiGeorge Syndrome Severe Chronic Neutropenia Chronic Granulomatous Disease Hyper IgE Syndrome or Job Syndrome CD40 or CD40L deficiency WiskottAldrich Syndrome Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease NOTE: A genetic diagnosis is recommended, but not required. Patients should have evidence of endstage lung disease and be candidates for bilateral orthotopic lung transplant as determined by the lung transplant team. Patients &lt;5 or &gt;40 years of age Patients who have underlying malignant conditions Patients who have nonmalignant conditions not requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients who do not meet criteria for bilateral orthotopic lung transplant GFR less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 AST, ALT &gt;4x upper limit of normal, Bilirubin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 40% or shortening fraction &lt; 26% HIV positive by serology or PCR, HTLV positive by serology, HepBsAg positive, or HCV RNA positive by PCR Pregnancy or nursing mother Allergy to DMSO or any other ingredient used in the manufacturing of the stem cell product Uncontrolled infection NOTE: Pulmonary colonization with multiple organisms is common, and will not be considered an exclusion criterion. Any comorbid illnesses that would otherwise preclude participation</criteria>
