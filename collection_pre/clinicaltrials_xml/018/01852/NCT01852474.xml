	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators aim to assess the clinical and neurophysiological effects of a non-invasive brain stimulation technique - transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)- on cortical plasticity and motor learning in children with cerebral palsy. Investigators will use different assessment techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and kinematics (sensors) to measure changes through the trial.</brief_summary>
