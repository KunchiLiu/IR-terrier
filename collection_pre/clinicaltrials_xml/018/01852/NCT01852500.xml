	<brief_summary>Results from previous studies suggest the association between Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) and length of stay (LOS) reduction in a population of preterm infants. The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of sham OMT in reducing LOS in a sample of preterm newborns, in order to investigate whether previous clinical results could be related to a hypothetical placebo effect.</brief_summary>
