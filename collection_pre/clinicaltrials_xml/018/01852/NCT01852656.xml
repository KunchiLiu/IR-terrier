	<brief_summary>Influenza disease causes significant morbidity and mortality in the Unites States each year. Although influenza can cause morbidity in otherwise healthy individuals, adults with chronic lung disease have significantly increased rates of hospitalization from influenza-related illnesses compared to healthy adults. Influenza vaccination is the primary means of preventing influenza disease. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals 6 months of age and older in the United States. Influenza vaccination rates are sub-optimal, however. Patient reminder/recall has been shown, in multiple studies across a variety of age groups and health conditions, to increase immunization rates. However, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different types of reminder/recall has not been well-studied, particularly in adults. In the fall of 2012, the Population and Prevention Services (PPS) Department at Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) is using 3 different reminder strategies for influenza vaccination among adults with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study is to provide a rigorous evaluation of which strategy is more effective and more cost-effective, to promote influenza vaccination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccine Reminder Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At KPCO, postcards are typically sent to members each fall, to remind members to receive their annual influenza vaccine. At KPCO, interactive voice response (IVR) systems have been utilized for a number of prevention reminders, but have not in the past been used for influenza vaccination reminders. For the 2012-2013 influenza season, the PPS department is going to send three different types of reminders to their adult patients with certain chronic lung diseases (specifically, adults with asthma and COPD): postcards only; IVR reminders only; postcards plus IVR reminders. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, of an already-finalized operational plan for influenza reminders.</detailed_description>
