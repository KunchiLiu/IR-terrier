	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the imaging performance of an investigational breast computed tomography (CT) scanner, built at UC Davis, with that of an FDA-Approved breast tomosynthesis scanner (capable of producing standard 2-D mammography and 3-D tomosynthesis images), built by Hologic, Incorporated, in a group of patients with suspected breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computed Tomography Versus Standard 2D Mammography Versus 3D Tomosynthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is the comparison of tumor conspicuity on images taken by both systems (computed tomography versus standard 2-D mammography versus 3-D tomosynthesis) using a ten point conspicuity scale as the end-point. Secondary aims will be to compare the number of lesions detected by the two systems, and to compare the estimated radiation dose of the two systems.</detailed_description>
