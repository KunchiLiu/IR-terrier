	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to estimate the effect size of a 5-week consumption period of different dietary non-digestible polysaccharides (NPS) on antibody response to influenza vaccination and cellular immunity of healthy volunteers (aged ≥ 50) for clarifying whether these NPS may enable enhancement of immune defence and to estimate the sample size for a confirmative trial. Furthermore the effects on faecal microbiota and its metabolites will be investigated.</brief_summary>
