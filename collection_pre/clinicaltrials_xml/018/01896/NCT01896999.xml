	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab when given together with brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or has not responded to previous treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Brentuximab vedotin is a combining monoclonal antibody with an anticancer drug that binds to a protein on the surface of lymphoma cells called cluster of differentiation (CD)30 and may kill the cells. Giving ipilimumab or nivolumab or both with brentuximab vedotin may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Brentuximab Vedotin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of the combinations of brentuximab vedotin and ipilimumab, brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab, and brentuximab vedotin, ipilimumab, and nivolumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate complete response (CR) rate, partial response (PR) rate and overall response rate (ORR), for the combinations of brentuximab vedotin and ipilimumab, brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab, and brentuximab vedotin, ipilimumab, and nivolumab. II. To evaluate the duration of remission (DOR) to these combinations and compare with the DOR achieved with the most recent prior systemic therapy. III. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS) in patients receiving the combination of brentuximab vedotin and ipilimumab, brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab, and brentuximab vedotin, ipilimumab, and nivolumab. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the ability of these combinations to alter tumor specific T cell immunity. II. To evaluate the effects of these combinations on systemic immunity. III. To evaluate a panel of cytokine and T cell specific biomarkers from the peripheral blood as a potential immune signature of treatment response to therapy with these combinations for patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). IV. To evaluate using gene expression profiling (GEP) a signature of response to these novel combinations of an antibody drug conjugate with immunomodulatory therapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab and nivolumab. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 of courses 1-4, 8, 12, and 16 and brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 90 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 30 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM III: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of course 1 and then every 12 weeks for up to 9 doses. Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment with brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab repeats every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 30 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 3 years.</detailed_description>
