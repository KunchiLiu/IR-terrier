	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies body warming in improving blood flow and oxygen delivery to tumors in patients with cancer. Heating tumor cells to several degrees above normal body temperature may kill tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body Warming in Improving Blood Flow and Oxygen Delivery to Tumors in Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility and efficacy of 2 different Body Warming to Alter (Thermo) Regulation and the Microenvironment (B-WARM) regimens on altering tumor blood flow in patients with a variety of malignancies. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if duration and thermal dose of B-WARM changes duration and extent of tumor blood flow changes in patients with a variety of malignancies. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees Celsius (C) for 30 minutes. ARM II: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees C for 2 hours. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with a variety of malignancies (i.e., melanoma, sarcoma, colon, head and neck, renal, breast, lung, ovary, liver) Patients must have measurable disease (1.0 cm or greater) by computed tomography (CT) scan Have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (using the CockcroftGault equation) of more than 60 mL/min Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods (e.g., double barrier) during treatment Patient or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure History of prior myocardial infarction or arrhythmia History of any condition deemed by the principal investigator to be a contraindication to BWARM therapy (e.g., skin reaction, dysregulation of thermoregulation, etc) All patients with transdermal patches (e.g.; fentanyl, Lidoderm, scopolamine, etc) Pregnant or nursing female patients Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements Any condition which in the investigator's opinion deems the patient an unsuitable candidate to receive BWARM Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment Received any systemic therapy within 21 days prior to planned BWARM therapy Patients may be enrolled on study but at least 21 days should elapse prior to date of BWARM therapy Patients should not have either CT scanning or BWARM if they have a fever at the time Fever should be worked up and treated as appropriate Patients should be afebrile for 24 hours prior to scanning or BWARM therapy</criteria>
