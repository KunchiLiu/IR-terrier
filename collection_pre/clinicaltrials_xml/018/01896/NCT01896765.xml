	<brief_summary>It is unknown, if a modern prevention program, including intense nurse-coordinated education sessions, regular telephone contacts and a telephone hotline for 12 months, significantly reduces cardiovascular risk factors, clinical events and quality of life in myocardial infarction patients compared to usual care. Furthermore, actually no data on the additional effects and the feasibility of longterm telemetric care of cardiovascular risk factors exist. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that an intensive longterm prevention program compared to the standard of medical care, will achieve better risk factor control and consecutively less clinical adverse events in patients after myocardial infarctions. A nurse-coordinated program and telemetric prevention will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
