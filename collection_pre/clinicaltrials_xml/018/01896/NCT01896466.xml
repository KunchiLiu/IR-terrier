	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is twofold: 1. Establish baseline measures of gait performance in healthy young and older adults, and older adults with a history of falls. 2. Investigate the effects of gait and balance training with and without cranial nerve noninvasive neuromodulation (CN-NINM) on postural balance and gait performance in older adults. For the second purpose, the study will incorporate a placebo-controlled design to evaluate the effects of CN-NINM augmented exercise compared to physical exercises alone. Both groups will perform gait and postural balance training (outlined in more detail below) but will differ in the stimulation level of the PoNS device. The investigators will use the results of this study as a first step toward evaluating the benefits of CN-NINM in a falls prevention program.</brief_summary>
