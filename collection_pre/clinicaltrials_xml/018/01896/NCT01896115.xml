	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. This study will compare various program settings for the bilateral stimulation of the STN using the BSC implantable Vercise™ DBS System for the treatment of levodopa-responsive, moderate to severe idiopathic PD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Implanted bilaterally in STN with a Vercise DBS system for Parkinson's disease for at least three months with programming optimized according to standard of care. UPDRS subset III score of ≥30 in the in the preoperative meds off state. DBS must improve PD symptoms by ≥30% in the meds off state, as measured by UPDRS subset III score. Medical and mental fitness to comply with programming visit and study related procedures. Able to understand the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides written informed consent before any studyspecific tests or procedures are performed. Off symptom rigidity score of ≥2 in the evaluated arm as determined by the UPDRSIII. Have any significant medical condition that is likely to interfere with study procedures or likely to confound evaluation of study endpoints, including any terminal illness with survival &lt;12 months. Resting and/or action tremor score of ≥3 on the evaluated side as determined by the UPDRSIII in preoperative meds off condition.</criteria>
