	<brief_summary>Anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation can be performed with and without neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Tracheal intubation can be performed with sevoflurane instead of NMBAs; intubating conditions are similar and the incidence of vocal cord injuries are similar, too.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laryngeal Injuries After Anesthesia Induction With Three Different Sevoflurane Concentrations (Without Muscle Relaxant)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We perform tracheal intubation with propofol, remifentanil and sevoflurane; sevoflurane is administered with three dosages. During tracheal intubation intubating conditions are noted. After surgery, all patients are examined by video laryngoscopy; moreover all patients are asked for hoarseness and sore throat.</detailed_description>
