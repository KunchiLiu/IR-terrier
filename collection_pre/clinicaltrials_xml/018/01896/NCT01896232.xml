	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that treatment with etelcalcetide (AMG 416) is not inferior to treatment with cinacalcet for lowering serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels by &gt; 30% from baseline among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) who require management with hemodialysis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible subjects must be receiving adequate thrice weekly maintenance hemodialysis with a dialysate calcium concentration ≥ 2.5 mEq/L for at least 3 months prior to screening laboratory assessments Subjects must have SHPT as defined by one central laboratory screening predialysis serum PTH value &gt; 500 pg/mL, measured on separate days within 2 weeks prior to randomization Subjects must have one serum cCa value ≥ 8.3 mg/dL obtained before dialysis within 2 weeks of the date of randomization Subjects receiving calcium supplements must have no more than a maximum dose change of 50% within 2 weeks before screening laboratory assessments are obtained, and the dose must remain unchanged through randomization Eligible subjects cannot have received cinacalcet during the 3 months preceding the first screening laboratory assessment Other criteria may apply</criteria>
