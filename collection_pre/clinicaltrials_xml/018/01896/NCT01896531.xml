	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy of GDC-0068 in combination with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (modified FOLFOX6 [mFOLFOX6]) chemotherapy in participants with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive either GDC-0068 or placebo orally daily on Days 1 to 7 of each 14-day cycle in combination with mFOLFOX6 on Day 1 of each cycle. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs (up to approximately 2 years).</brief_summary>
