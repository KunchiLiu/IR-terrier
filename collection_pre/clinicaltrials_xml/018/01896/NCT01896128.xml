	<brief_summary>Armodafinil is an FDA approved medication with wakefulness-promoting properties. It is a relatively safe agent with interesting neurochemical effects on the catecholamine system, producing an improvement in cognitive function, particularly working memory in humans. When combined with intensive task-related training, armodafinil may accelerate motor recovery in chronic stroke patients. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether administration of armodafinil during subacute post-stroke rehabilitation will augment cortical plasticity and enhance motor recovery. The primary hypothesis suggests that cortical plasticity will be enhanced by armodafinil and, therefore, will induce an improvement in motor function and better performances on measures of motor control.</brief_summary>
