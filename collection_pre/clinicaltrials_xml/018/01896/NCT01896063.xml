	<brief_summary>Insomnia is a common clinical disease.The serious patients could not sleep all night, often accompanied by headache, dizziness, forgetfulness and so on. All of these increase the mental burden of insomnia patients and seriously affected the normal work and quality of life of patients. Modern medical treatment to treat insomnia is using sedative and hypnotic drugs, mainly benzodiazepine, zopiclone. But long-term use of these drugs can induce the adverse reactions, including resistance, dependence and addiction. Many articles indicate that electroacupuncture can effectively improve insomnia, play the role of sedative and hypnotic effect and avoid many adverse reactions and side effects. Then there are no more objective indicators to affirm that which part of brain takes place the appropriate changes when electroacupuncture induces the sedative effect. So we designed this experiment.</brief_summary>
