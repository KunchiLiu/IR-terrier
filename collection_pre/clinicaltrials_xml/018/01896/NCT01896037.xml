	<brief_summary>People with a spinal cord injury (SCI) characteristically have low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c; "good cholesterol") and high levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c; "bad cholesterol"), and are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular health problems, such as heart disease, heart attack and stroke, than the able-bodied population. A common way for able-bodied people to improve their lipid profile is through exercise; however, SCI people, especially tetraplegics, are often unable to achieve and maintain a level of exercise needed to obtain these benefits. It is therefore clinically important to find an effective, safe and inexpensive method of increasing HDL-c levels in people with chronic tetraplegia. This study will investigate the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the lipid profile of people with tetraplegia. The investigators hypothesize that 5 months of daily consumption of high doses of omega-3 fatty acids will increase plasma levels of HDL-c in those with tetraplegia, leading to decreased risk of cardiovascular health issues.</brief_summary>
