	<brief_title>Trial of Scrambler Therapy or Sham Treatment for Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of the experimental protocol and provide sufficient pilot data to estimate statistical power and sample size requirements. The study will include 30 individuals (15 per group) diagnosed with persistent low back pain who will receive a standard protocol of Scrambler therapy or sham treatment. Participant data will include subjective measures of low back pain, pain sensitivity using quantitative sensory testing, and mRNA expression levels of pain sensitivity candidate genes at baseline (prior to treatment) and 1 and 3 weeks post-treatment.</detailed_description>
