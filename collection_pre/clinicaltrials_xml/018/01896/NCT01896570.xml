	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators aim to examine the prognostic role of subsequent Atrial Tachycardias (ATs) in the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF). Therefore, the investigators compare patients who were randomly assigned to either undergo cardioversion after AF has been terminated to AT or further ablation until the achievement of sinus rhythm.</brief_summary>
