	<brief_summary>This phase 3 study will serve to collect efficacy and safety data of two different doses of NT 201 in subjects suffering from Bilateral Blephorasm (BEB) who are BTX treatment-naïve. In this study, BTX treatment-naïve subjects are defined as those who have not received BTX treatment within the last 12 months for the treatment of BEB. This definition aims to avoid bias by comparison of treatment effects in the subject's assessments. Furthermore, this study will substantiate the existing efficacy and safety database for the indication BEB.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female outpatients age ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years. A clinical diagnosis of bilateral BEB characterized by spontaneous, spasmodic, intermittent or persistent involuntary contractions of orbicular oculi muscles. A need for injection of BTX defined as a Jankovic Rating Scale [JRS] severity subscore ≥ 2. Treatmentnaïve subject defined as at least 12 months without BTX of any serotype for the treatment of BEB before administration of IP. Subject with any previous unsuccessful treatment with BTX of any serotype for the treatment of BEB. Atypical variant of BEB (e.g., apraxia of the eyelid opening) caused by inhibition of levator palpebrae muscle. Neurolepticinduced blepharospasm. Myotomy or denervation surgery in the affected muscles (e.g., peripheral denervation, spinal cord stimulation) and surgery in the upper face. Generalized disorders of muscles activity (e.g., myasthenia gravis in particular ocularis, LambertEatonSyndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or any other significant neuromuscular dysfunction which might interfere with the study.</criteria>
