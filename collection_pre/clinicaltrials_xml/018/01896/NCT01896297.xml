	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to assess dabigatran pharmacokinetics in NVAF subjects with severe renal impairment defined as creatinine clearance between 15 and 30 mL/min calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula. The dabigatran etexilate dose of 75 mg BID was approved by the FDA for NVAF patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min) , based on pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation.</brief_summary>
