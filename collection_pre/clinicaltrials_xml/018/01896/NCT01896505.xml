	<criteria>1. Patients must have histologically confirmed soft tissue or bone/cartilage sarcoma. Patients with sarcoma of small round blue cell tumor types are allowed. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are excluded. 2. Patients must have received at least one prior anticancer regimen for metastatic disease unless there is no other therapy available and evidence of progressive disease on study entry. Patients with stable disease will be included if there has been failure to respond to another drug(s) within the previous 3 months 1. Patients with known liver metastases 2. Radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, any other systemic anticancer therapy or participation in an investigational anticancer study â‰¤ 3 weeks prior to initiation of therapy 3. Patients with known brain metastasis 4. Patients with any gastrointestinal dysfunctions that could interfere with the interpretation of the food effect data 5. Patients with known intolerance to low or high fat meals 6. In the opinion of the investigator, patients who are significantly below their ideal body weight</criteria>
