	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is becoming an increasingly problem for public health and it is related with various complications such as sexual problems. The prevalence of erectile dysfunction has been widely studied in men as a complication of diabetes; the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women, instead, has not been well investigated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in type 2 diabetic women using international validated questionnaires.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sexual Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetic Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In an estimated temporal space of about 3 years, 306 women will be recruited consecutively. After collection of written informed consent, the following data will be collected: - History: type of diabetes, comorbidities, current medication, duration of diabetes and complications, voluptuary habits such as tobacco smoke (both number of packets/year and nÂ° packets/day), alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, physical activity. - Physical exam, general anthropometric parameters such as weight, height, circumference, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and blood pressure. - Assessment of glycemic variability (fasting plasma glucose and post-prandial glucose) - Each patient will be self-administered Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) questionnaires to assess the prevalence of sexual dysfunction and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) of Zung for an accurate assessment of the state of anxiety and depression. - We will collect blood and urine samples to assess: ematology, glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, creatinine, urea, transaminases, electrolytes, complete urinalysis, 24-hour microalbuminuria, homocysteine, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), soluble adhesion molecules (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1), sE-selectin, lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)], Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). - We will also conduct a clinical and instrumental exam of the foot using Neuropad, recently validated as a screening tool for diabetic neuropathy. Patients will also undergo autonomic tests (deep breathing, lying to standing, Valsalva maneuver, and orthostatic hypotension). We will also evaluate the presence of neuropathy through the administration of the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) and the Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS).</detailed_description>
