	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will investigate the following hypothesis - that hypoxia induce migraine headache and migraine aura - the aura phase is associated with a spreading reduction in cerebral blood flow - the migraine headache is associated with dilatation of intra- and extracerebral arteries - the migraine headache is associated with changes in brain metabolism - the pre-ictal stage of a migraine attack with aura is associated with specific patterns in neural activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Migraine With Aura Inducing Characteristics and Effects on the Cerebral Arteries and Blood Flow by Hypoxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate migraine with aura symptoms during and after hypoxia. With magnetic resonance imaging the investigators will investigate changes in - regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) - resting state functional connectivity - circumference of the middle cerebral artery(MCA), internal carotic artery, superficial temporal artery, medial meningeal artery, external carotic artery - brain metabolism And compare these changes with a aged match healthy control group.</detailed_description>
