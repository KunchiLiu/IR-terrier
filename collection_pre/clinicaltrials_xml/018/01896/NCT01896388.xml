	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence suggests a key role of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent studies suggest that the NMDA receptor antagonist ifenprodil tartrate may be a potential therapeutic drug for PTSD. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether ifenprodil tartrate is effective in the treatment of adolescents PTSD patients. If ifenprodil tartrate is effective in these patients, this study contributes to the development of novel therapeutic drugs for PTSD.</brief_summary>
