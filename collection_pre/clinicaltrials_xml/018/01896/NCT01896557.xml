	<brief_summary>Previous reports have shown a possible drug interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (PPI´s), which could result in increased number of adverse cardiovascular events among patients on dual antiplatelet therapy(DAPT). Because of this, ranitidin has been proposed as an alternative drug to PPI´s for prophylaxis of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who need DAPT. The study´s aim is to test the hypothesis that ranitidin doesn´t have any influence on clopidogrel pharmacodynamic.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population: 100 patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease from Heart Institute Inclusion Criteria: - Age &gt; 18 years old - Coronary artery disease, defined as previous myocardial infarction and/or coronary angioplasty and/or Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery and/or coronariography showing obstruction of at least 50 % in one of major epicardial vessels - Treatment with Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) 100 mg/day Exclusion Criteria: - Use in the last 7 days of oral anticoagulant or any other antiplatelet drug beside ASA - Previous utilization of PPI or ranitidine in the last 7 days before randomization - Active bleeding - Pregnancy or woman of childbearing age without contraceptive method - Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL or hematocrit &lt; 30 %, hematocrit &gt; 50 %, platelets &lt; 100.000/mm3 or &gt; 500.000/mm3; creatinin clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute - Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the last 30 days before randomization (or PCI on the last year when drug-eluted stents are used); CABG surgery on the last 90 days; acute coronary syndrome on the last 60 days - Active malignant neoplasm - Active peptic ulcer disease on the last 60 days or upper gastrointestinal bleeding any time in life - Known allergy to the drugs clopidogrel, ranitidine or omeprazole - Refuse to participate in the study] Methodology: The study has a double-blind, double-dummy prospective design. Clopidogrel action is evaluated by platelet function tests: VerifyNow, bioimpedance aggregometry and Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100). The patients have measurements of platelet function on three moments: before starting clopidogrel; 1 week after DAPT with clopidogrel (without loading dose) plus ASA; and after 1 week of randomization to ranitidin 150 mg bid or omeprazole 20 mg bid.</detailed_description>
