	<brief_summary>Using two clinical models - pregnancy (Sample 1) and oral contraceptives (OC; Sample 2) - we aim to (1) examine the association between levels of progesterone (Prog), allopregnanolone (Allo) and the estradiol/progesterone (E2/P) ratios with smoking-related symptomatology during ad libitum smoking, and (2) determine the association between Prog, Allo, and E2/P with the changes in smoking-related symptomatology and response to nicotine following overnight abstinence</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sample 1 will consist of pregnant women and Sample 2 will be oral contraceptive users. Sample 2 will be testing "low" and "high" dose levels of exogenous progesterone with a consistent dose of exogenous estrogen. All participants will complete identical data collection procedures including providing saliva (cortisol to measure stress), urine (cotinine and 3-Hydroxycotinine to measure nicotine exposure), and blood (progesterone, allopregnanolone, and estradiol) samples, as well as ecological momentary assessments (EMA) daily for seven-days. Participants will also complete a three-hour smoking topography lab session after overnight abstinence and a 4.5 hour nicotine nasal spray lab session after a 14 hour abstinence. These sessions will contain a nicotine challenge via smoking a cigarette or nasal spray with timed -series physiological, subjective and behavioral responses.</detailed_description>
