	<brief_title>Comprehensive-Care for Multimorbid Adults Effectiveness Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with multi-morbidities pose a significant challenge for healthcare organizations because they require continuity of care among a wide range of long-term therapeutic paradigms for many different types of diseases. The current study is based on a treatment model entailing a nurse-primary care physician team to provide care for patients with multiple morbidities. Patients in the intervention group who agreed and signed the consent form to participate in the study will receive treatment by the physician - nurse team in accordance with the components of the Clalit's Comprehensive Care for Mutlimorbid Adults Project model. Components of the intervention include: 1. Comprehensive assessment of the patient's and family's needs 2. Coordinated care plan based on integrated care guides 3. "Multimorbid Action Plan" for patients 4. All-inclussive patient centered care and caregiver support 5. Proactive monitoring according to the plan. Patients in the control groups will receive usual care in their primary care clinics. The Usual Care Survey control group will complete study questionnaires at 6, 12 and 24 months after enrollement. The Usual Care Blinded group will be assessed only retrospectively based on deidentified information from Clalit's admistrative databases.</detailed_description>
