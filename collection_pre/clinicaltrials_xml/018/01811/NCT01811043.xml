	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to examine whether a guided meditation intervention will reduce anxiety and distress as compared to a music intervention or radiologist supportive dialogue in women undergoing imaging-guided core needle breast biopsies. Both the guided meditation and music interventions are administered through use of headphones during routine outpatient imaging-guided core needle breast biopsies. Women in the guided meditation and music conditions will be given a CD with instructions for home practice. Women complete follow-up questionnaires in the 12 months after biopsy. Receipt of recommended follow-up care is examined for 60 months.</brief_summary>
