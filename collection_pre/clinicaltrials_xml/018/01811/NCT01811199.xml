	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Reduces Postoperative Emesis by Decreasing PGF2α and LTC4 Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has been done to further study the effectiveness of dexamethasone in the prevention of postoperative emesis after breast and thyroid surgery and at the same time, the mechanism of action was investigated. In this prospective, randomized controlled trial it was hypothesized that corticosteroids exert their antiemetic effects in postoperative period via plasma prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 α) and plasma leukotriene C4 (LTC4) inhibition.</detailed_description>
