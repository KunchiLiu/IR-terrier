	<detailed_description>Twenty children with at least two carious molar teeth without pulpal involvement participated in this randomized clinical trial. A total of 40 teeth were randomly divided into two treatment groups: group A, papain-based gel; and group B, conventional technique. Data collection included the time required for caries removal, need for local anesthesia, degree of discomfort, changes in the number of viable bacteria, and clinical evaluation of glass ionomer-cement restorations 6-month post-treatment.</detailed_description>
