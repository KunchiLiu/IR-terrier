	<brief_summary>Mitral prolapse is a common cardiac disease whose patients are at higher risk for serious complications. Mitral valve (MV) repair offers several important advantages compared with valve replacement and it achieves excellent midterm and long-term results. Two major problems of using pre-measured expanded polytetrafluoroethylene(ePTFE) neochordae (the loop technique) are deciding the length of the neochordae and tying the knot at the intended length. Therefore, a great need still exists to find new method to simplify and precise the length of neochordae. 20 patients with mitral valve prolapse who undergo mitral valve repair using neochorda will be recruited in this study. Trans thoracic echocardiography (TTE) will be done preoperatively for all patients. Two, three, and four chamber view of each patient will be pre-operatively recorded. The device will be set with extracted measurements. Artificial corda loops are made using CV-4 ePTFE sutures. After artificial chordae replacement, the ring annuloplasty will be done. Follow up: A leakage test after attaching the 1st loop; Post operative trans esophageal echocardiography (TEE) and determining the severity of mitral regurgitation [Wall motion Score Index (WMSI), Mitral Annulus Area (MAA), LVEF, End Systolic Volume (ESV), End Diastolic Volume (EDV), Iso-Volemic Relaxation Time (IVRT), (IVRT/(QE-QE^') ,Chamber Relaxation velocity)/(Myocard relaxation velocity(E/E^' ), HR]; TEE 3 months after discharge; Cross clamp time; Intubation period in ICU.</brief_summary>
