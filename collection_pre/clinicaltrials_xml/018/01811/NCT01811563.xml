	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the differences in functional and patient reported outcomes between total knee replacement (TKA) implants. In addition, this work will examine the correlation between functional assessments and patient reported outcomes following surgery. All subjects will complete assessments preoperatively, 4-6 weeks following TKA and then one year following TKA. Subjects will complete a series of patient reported outcomes as well as a series of functional outcomes at each of the time points of interest. The analysis will include a repeated measures design to determine differences between groups across time as well as correlations between the functional and patient reported outcomes. This work will hopefully determine the importance of using objective functional outcomes following TKA as well as determining the need for patient assessments out to one year following surgery.</brief_summary>
