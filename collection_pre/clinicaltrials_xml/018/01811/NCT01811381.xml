	<brief_summary>Physical exercise has proven to improve memory including in the elderly. Drugs developed to stop the underlying disease processes that cause Alzheimer's disease may succeed only with multimodal efforts to stimulate brain function. One purpose of the study is to test the clinical benefits of curcumin, a safe and effective compound isolated from the turmeric root (a component of Indian curry spices), which has been found to inhibit several potential disease pathways in Alzheimer's disease. Another purpose of this study is to determine how the addition of a physical exercise program in individuals with early memory problems may affect memory function or brain imaging and blood-based markers associated with Alzheimer's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Curcumin and Yoga Therapy for Those at Risk for Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often represents the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as individuals meeting criteria for MCI are subsequently diagnosed with AD at much higher rates than their cognitively normal elderly peers. The goal of the current study is to determine whether dietary supplementation with a novel formulation of curcumin (a component of the curry spice turmeric), which is better absorbed and more efficiently transported into the brain, can alter biological and clinical markers associated with AD risk, and to determine whether the potential beneficial effects of curcumin supplementation are synergistic with aerobic exercise. The investigators will recruit 80 elderly participants meeting criteria for MCI. Over the second 6 months of the study, the curcumin and placebo groups will be further divided into groups receiving training in either aerobic or non-aerobic yoga to determine the synergism between curcumin supplementation and aerobic exercise. The effectiveness of these interventions will be measured using plasma samples (for expression of Alzheimer-related biomarkers), and neuropsychological, functional, and behavioral assessments (i.e. clinical measures) collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after initiation of treatments, with a subset of participants receiving brain imaging at baseline and 6 months. Dosage is titered up two weeks prior to study start (1 capsule BID, first five days, then 2 capsules BID for five days, then 6 capsules BID for five days, then 8 capsules BID- study dosage). Over the first 6 months of the study, participants will be randomized into equal groups receiving dietary supplementation with either curcumin or placebo. Patients are stratified according to whether they have only subjective memory complaints without MCI versus those that have MCI. Over the second 6 months of the study, participants will be further randomized into equal groups receiving dietary supplementation with either curcumin or placebo.</detailed_description>
