	<brief_summary>Unruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms larger than 7 mm can be treated with endovascular occlusion using detachable coils, with or without expendable stent assistance. A new endovascular technique has recently been developed, using flow diverter stents without associated coils. Clinical results already published are encouraging but have to be confirmed. Furthermore, these medical devices are expensive in comparison to the coiling strategy. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of endovascular coiling and endovascular flow diversion for unrupted saccular intracranial aneurysms.</brief_summary>
