	<brief_summary>Prospective, open-labelled study which will enrol 360 participants in four groups of 80 participants including: HIV-uninfected adults without evidence of TB; HIV-infected adults without any evidence of TB; HIV-uninfected adults with concurrent microbiologic confirmed TB, HIV-infected adults with concurrent microbiologic confirmed TB. Participants will receive the recommended seasonal 2013 un-adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV). At 3 visits, blood will be collected for determination of immune responses. Objective: • To determine the effect of HIV-infection, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV-TB co-infection on immune responses</brief_summary>
