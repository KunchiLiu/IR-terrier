	<brief_title>Ion Irradiation of Sacrococcygeal Chordoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this trial is safety and feasibility of hypofractionated irradiation in patients with sacrococcygeal chordoma using protons or carbon ions in raster scan technique for primary or additive treatment after R2 resection. The evaluation is therefore based on the proportion of treatments without Grade 3-5 toxicity (CTCAE, version 4.0) up to 12 months after treatment and/or discontinuation of the treatment for any reason as primary endpoint. Local-progression free survival, overall survival and quality of life will be analyzed as secondary end points.</detailed_description>
