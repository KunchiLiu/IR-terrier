	<brief_title>An Interventional Study to Compare the Efficacy and Tolerability With Targin® in Non-malignant Chronic Pain (GLORY)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design (Methodology): This will be a single center, open-label, randomised, phase IV, exploratory interventional study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of current titration patterns and slow titration pattern with Targin® (Oxycodone/Naloxone) in the treatment of moderate to severe non-malignant chronic pain patients who are dissatisfied with their current analgesic medication World Health Organisation (WHO) step II analgesics). Upon providing written informed consent, subject will be screened in the study and assessment will be performed at that time such as safety laboratory assessments, physical examination, vital sign, medical history taking, 24 hours pain intensity score. If the patient is eligible in inclusion/exclusion criteria at the time of visit 1, the patient will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to allocate in Group A or Group B. Re-screening, study drug dose interruption is not allowed.</detailed_description>
