	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the possible mechanisms underlying music-based multitask training (i.e., Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics) in older people, compared to multicomponent exercise training. This study is designed as a 12-month, prospective, single-centre, single-blind, 2-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial in which 140 community-dwelling older adults at high risk of falls are randomly assigned to receive either a music-based multitask training intervention (i.e., Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics) or a multicomponent exercise training intervention, for 12 months. A 12-month follow-up is planned with outcome measures assessed at three time points: baseline (before intervention initiation), 6-month (intervention mid-point), and 12-month (intervention termination). Outcomes of interest include physical and cognitive performances, and falls. In addition, the investigators specifically address brain circuits in an exploratory sub-study. Volunteer trial participants from both study arms are invited to undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and 12-month.</brief_summary>
