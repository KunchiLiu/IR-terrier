	<brief_summary>The knowledge of the real-time contact force leads to a greater reduction in atrial fibrillation burden after pulmonary vein antrum isolation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of a Contact Force Catheter for Pulmonary Vein Antrum Isolation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled study comparing pulmonary vein antrum isolation with and without the knowledge of the real-time contact force. In both groups, a catheter, which is able to measure contact force (SmartTouch, ThermoCool catheter, Biosense Webster) will be used. In the control group, the operator will be blinded to the measured contact-force. In all patients, the ablation will be guided by a circumferential mapping catheter (Lasso, Biosense Webster), CARTO 3 mapping system and ablation of adenosine-induced reconnection will be performed in all patients. Follow-up will be performed by continuous monitoring using an implantable loop recorder (Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn)</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients &lt;75 years of age with atrial fibrillation who have had at least two episodes of symptomatic paroxysmal or shortlasting persistent atrial fibrillation in the foregoing 12 months undergoing the first pulmonary vein antrum isolation can be included. Patients having also persistent episodes of atrial fibrillation of shorter duration (the longest atrial fibrillation episode 3 months) on top of paroxysmal episodes will be included Contraindication to anticoagulation treatment with vitamin K antagonists Amiodarone therapy Expected surgery for structural heart disease within the followup period Significant mitral valve disease NYHA IIIIV Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35% Left atrial diameter &gt; 5 cm Secondary atrial fibrillation (e.g. postsurgery, infections, hyperthyroidism) Age &lt; 18 years</criteria>
