	<brief_summary>The interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP)-findings is primarily performed by radiologists who only in some cases have experience with the interpretation of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-images. It is unclear if MRCP-interpretation by the radiologist is sufficient to decide which additional endoscopic procedures might be necessary in an individual case or if an additional MRCP-interpretation by the endoscopist renders any clinical impact.</brief_summary>
