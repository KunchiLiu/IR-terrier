	<brief_summary>This is a phase III B, prospective, interventional, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to provide regorafenib to subjects diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed after standard therapy and for whom no therapy alternatives exist, in the time between positive results and approval / availability on the market, and to collect safety data for regorafenib until market access. Regorafenib is an oral (i.e. taken by mouth) multi-targeted kinase inhibitor. A kinase inhibitor targets certain key proteins that are essential for the survival of the cancer cell. By specifically targeting these proteins, regorafenib may stop cancer growth. The growth of the tumor may be decreased by preventing these specific proteins from functioning. The primary endpoint of this study will be safety.</brief_summary>
