	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to compare wound healing after the use of fibrin sealant and sutures for gum surgeries. 15 patients requiring gum surgery for their periodontal (gum)problems are selected and invited. Two regions will be operated in a selected patient. One region will receive fibrin sealant (test site) and the other region will get sutures (control site). Wound healing will be assessed by evaluating inflammatory markers, Interleukin 1beta and interleukin 8, from a non invasively collected gum fluid. Hypothesis. Fibrin sealant use will result in less inflammation seen through reduced levels of interleukin (1beta and 8) compared to use of sutures.</brief_summary>
