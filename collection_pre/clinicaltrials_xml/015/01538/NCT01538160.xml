	<brief_summary>Lately the investigators found that patients with severe factor XI deficiency and inhibitors could undergo major surgery with a single low dose of recombinant factor VIIa and tranexamic agent. These results encourage us to apply this treatment in clinical trial setting to patients with severe factor XI deficiency undergoing surgery instead of blood product.</brief_summary>
