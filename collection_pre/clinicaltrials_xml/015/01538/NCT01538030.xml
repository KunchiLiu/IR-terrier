	<brief_summary>Premature rupture of membranes is an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, mainly because of the complications associated with this pathology (oligohydramnios, cord compression or prolapse, infection). When rupture of the membranes occur the risk of cord compression increases but there is little evidence regarding this complication and amniotic fluid volume. The investigator's focus are the perinatal outcomes according to amniotic fluid volume (&lt; 5 or &gt;5).</brief_summary>
