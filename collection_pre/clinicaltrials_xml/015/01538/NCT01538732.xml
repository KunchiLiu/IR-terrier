Patients who meet enrolment criteria will receive 30mg alitretinoin, given orally as gelatin capsules, once daily for 24 weeks. Dose interruptions are permitted in response to adverse effects, consistent with use of retinoids and the product label. Most clinical evaluations will be performed every 4 weeks. A safety follow-up visit is planned 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Further follow-up visits will be conducted 16 and 24 weeks after end of treatment in those patients meeting the primary endpoint - Trial with medicinal product</brief_summary>
