	<brief_summary>Restless Leg Syndrome is a common but not well recognized central nervous system disorder. It is more prevalent during pregnancy and, if present before pregnancy, can develop an exacerbation of symptoms. In some of the hypothesis trying to explain this syndrome, the physiopathology can also explain hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. So far, no study has been done trying to link both disorders.</brief_summary>
