	<brief_summary>The Antiphospholipid Syndrome is an immune disease where the presence of antibodies directed against cell membrane phospholipids (antiphospholipid antibodies) can cause an hypercoagulable state that causes thrombosis and obstetric complications (miscarriages, stillbirths). Since 1999 the Sapporo Criteria for Antiphospholipid Syndrome diagnosis includes the development of severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation, but this was done without solid evidence of a relation between the two. Our study will try to add information to this particular point.</brief_summary>
