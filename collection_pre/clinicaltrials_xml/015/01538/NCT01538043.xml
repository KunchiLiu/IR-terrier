	<brief_title>Spa Therapy in Knee Osteoarthritis: Study on Cost/Effectiveness - Cost/Utility and Possible Mechanisms of Action</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OA is the most common rheumatic disease and the most important from the social-economic point of view because of its frequency, causing functional impairment and disability in older people, important health resource utilization and costs (drugs, physical therapies, spa therapy, surgical prothesis, early retirement). Thermal therapy is one of the most commonly used non-pharmacological approaches for OA, but it is still being discussed and its role in modern medicine is still not clear. The action mechanisms of mud packs and thermal baths are not completely known, and it is difficult to distinguish the effects of thermal applications from the benefits that could be derived from a stay in a spa environment. Furthermore, there are no data about cost analysis of spa therapy in OA. The aim of this study is to analyze for the first time the cost/effectiveness- cost/utility for spa therapy in comparison to conventional treatments in knee OA (one-year-follow-up)and to assess changes of some biomarkers or mediators of cartilage damage in order to identify new possible mechanisms of action of spa therapy in rheumatic diseases.</detailed_description>
