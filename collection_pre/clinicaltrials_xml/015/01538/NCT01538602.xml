	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)is closely associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia as well as with increased incidence in diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Indeed, subjects with PCOS were reported to carry an increased long-term cardiovascular risk, among others. Aiming to correlate the mean platelet volume, the thromboxane A2 level and the PCOS, an observational study was planned. Clinical evaluation of metabolic outcomes in PCOS patients is compared to a placebo group.</brief_summary>
