	<brief_summary>This retrospective observational study included patients (pts) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of a de novo coronary bifurcation lesion in one German center between January 2008 - August 2011. The investigators included all consecutive patients where the side branch was covered with a stent. Patients with ACS/cardiogenic shock were not excluded. Two different methods were compared: group A represents patients with a simple strategy without any treatment of the side branch (SB). Group B consisted of patients where the SB was treated (PCI and/or stenting). For the treatment of bifurcation lesions we used the concept of "provisional stenting", indications for the treatment of the SB were residual stenosis &gt; 50 %, TIMI flow reduction &lt; 2. Final-kissing PCI was intended in all patients of group B. MACE during follow-up was evaluated in all patients.</brief_summary>
