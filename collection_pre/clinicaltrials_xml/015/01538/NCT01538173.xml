	<brief_title>Increased Microcirculation for Preventing Postoperative Wound Infections in Patients Undergoing Reduction Mammoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many studies identifying risk factors for surgical side infections (SSI) after breast surgery included a large percentage of breast conserving therapies and risk factors for patients undergoing more extensive procedures like breast reduction (BR) are underrepresented and risk factors for more extensive breast surgeries might not be identified. Our approach to decrease SSI after BR was the application of an i.v. isotonic crystalloid solution, 6% hydroxyethylstaerke (HES) as a diminished peripheral blood flow and impaired vasculogenesis are characteristics of poorly healing wounds. HES causes a medium- to long-term increase in blood volume, blood flow and improved blood oxygen transport. Blood flow and tissue oxygenation are parts of regulating the healing process by utilizing molecular oxygen as a terminal oxidant. This antioxidant capacity can influence the wound healing process positively, as a characteristic feature of the inflammatory phase is the oxidative burst. HES additionally decreases haematocrite, blood viscosity and aggregation of erythrocytes positively influencing the complex components regulating wound healing. These characteristics and the increase in blood circulation might influence the postoperative healing and regeneration process.</detailed_description>
