	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is superior to interventricular right ventricle (RV) septal pacing in respect of reverse remodeling (LV ESD) and morbidity in patients with less preserved (less than 45%) ejection fraction (EF), persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) who successfully received atrioventricular (AV) junction ablation ablation (100% pacemaker dependency)</brief_summary>
