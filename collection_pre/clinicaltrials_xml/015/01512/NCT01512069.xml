	<brief_summary>Life style interventions that promote exercise and a healthy diet, which have the potential to improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL), may be particularly appropriate for cancer survivors. The previous studies suggested that a key strategy to implement sustainable healthy behavior and improve health was providing appropriate feedback and promoting self-efficacy. Web-based program enables to provide the feedback in a timely manner on a daily basis, to continue the healthy behaviors. Therefore, the investigators developed a web-based, stage-matched Exercise and Diet Planning program, and whether the program can promote significantly greater changes in behavioral outcomes [goal of exercise (energy expenditure of aerobic exercise ≥ 12.5 kcal/kg/week) and diet (intake of vegetables ≥ 5 serv/day and intake of fruit ≥ 1 serv/day)], stage of changes for exercise and diet, psychosocial outcomes (HRQOL, fatigue, anxiety and depression) and self-efficacy in implementing goal of exercise and diet among breast cancer survivors in Korea was examined. Hypotheses were following: 1. Survivors of a group participating in a web-based, stage-matched Exercise and Diet Planning program (hereinafter called the 'intervention group') will show a more advanced stage of change for exercise and diet compared to survivors in the control group. 2. The intervention group will show a higher proportion of attaining goal of exercise (or higher level of energy expenditure of aerobic exercise) compared to the control group. 3. The intervention group will show a higher proportion of attaining goal of diet (or higher level of diet quality) compared to the control group. 4. The intervention group will show a better HRQOL level compared to the control group. 5. The intervention group will show a better self-efficacy level compared to the control group. 6. The intervention group will show a lower fatigue level compared to the control group. 7. The intervention group will show less anxiety compared to the control group. 8. The intervention group will show less depression compared to the control group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study was to develop a web-based, stage-matched Exercise and Diet Planning program and to examine effects of the program on implementation of exercise and diet, self-efficacy, HRQOL, fatigue, anxiety and depression among breast cancer survivors. All participants were recruited from two tertiary university hospitals and the National Cancer Center in Korea.</detailed_description>
