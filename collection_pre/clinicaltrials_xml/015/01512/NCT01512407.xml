	<brief_summary>We hypothesise that the use of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) after liver resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can eradicate residual cancer cells in the liver and thus improve survival. The aim of this study is to compare the survival of patients undergoing liver resection plus post-operative TACE versus liver resection alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT on Adjuvant TACE After Hepatectomy for HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, recurrence is common after surgery and most occurs in the liver. Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is an effective palliative treatment for HCC. It involves the infusion of chemotherapeutic agent admixed with iodised oil followed by embolisation of the hepatic arterial flow using small particles. This procedures allows application of smaller dose of chemotherapy concentrated to the liver and thus is well tolerated with minimal side effects. We conduct a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of using TACE after hepatectomy in HCC patients.</detailed_description>
