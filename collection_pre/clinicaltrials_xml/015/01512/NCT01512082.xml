	<brief_title>The Effect of Reducing Soreness in Marathon Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a growing body of clinical evidence which shows that noninvasive, nonpharmacologic pulsed electromagnetic fields have many clinical effects. Pulsed electromagnetic fields have shown to reduce pain in different groups of patients. This concerns patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, distal radius fractures, pelvic pain and postoperative patients. A marathon is a muscular strain. Physiologic effects of a marathon involves muscular and connective tissue damage which initiates an inflammatory response as well as release of metabolic factors like lactate and free radicals, intracellular metabolites and by-products of proteolysis. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of pulsed electromagnetic fields compared to placebo in reducing delayed onset muscle soreness in marathon runners.</detailed_description>
