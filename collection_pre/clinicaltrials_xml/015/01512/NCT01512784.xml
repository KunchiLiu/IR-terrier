	<brief_summary>Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important risk factor for HPV infection and the development of HPV-associated lesions in female and male anogenital tract. Data on safety and immunogenicity of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in HIV-infected population are few. The present study is a non-randomized controlled clinical trial with the primary objective to determine safety ad immunogenicity of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil®) in HIV-infected female and male adolescents and young adults.</brief_summary>

History of severe allergic reaction after previous vaccination or hypersensitivity to any vaccine component. Any serious chronic or progressive disease (other than HIV) according to the judgment of the investigator: Acute infection requiring therapy or fever at time of enrollment Chronic autoimmune or oncologic disease receiving chemotherapy Concomitant therapies (other than HAART): Chronic therapy (for more than 14 days consecutively) with immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents or chemotherapy during the 6 months prior to study entry. Receipt of blood, blood products and/or plasma derivatives or any parenteral immunoglobulin preparation prior to study entry. Use of investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment.
