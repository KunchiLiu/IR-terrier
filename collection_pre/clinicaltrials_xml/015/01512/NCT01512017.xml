	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-center, randomized, open and paralleled positive control study for evaluating the safety and efficacy of Veloderm in treatment of split-thickness skin graft donor sites. The result implies that Veloerm can do it better than Vaseline gauze in accelerating and promoting wound healing of skin graft donor sites. The present study have indicated that high permeability of Veloderm dressing to oxygen and water vapor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study on Veloderm for the Treatment of Split-thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rational oxygen permeability of Veloderm dressing also provides a good environment for wound healing. Therefore, it can be as a temporary skin substitute in the case of missing epidermis to play a role, in order to provide an ideal environment for wound epithelialization. As regards safety, 1 adverse reaction occured in test group. It shows effusion under the dressing mild inflammatory infiltration on the wound edge. After the dressing was changed and the effusion was drained, the patient was relieved. As Veloderm dressing itself has no direct anti-inflammatory effects, clinical application as appropriate can plus other anti-infective drugs in accordance with patient conditions. In conclusion, Veloderm is a safe and effective dressing to accelerate the healing of donor sites in burn and plastic surgery. Veloderm can be used as a temporary skin substitute in case of damage of skin or loss of superficial epidermal (such as burns, wounds, abrasions, ulcers, sores and auto-graft donor areas).</detailed_description>
