	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if 14 weeks of pazopanib therapy prior to surgery (nephrectomy) is of benefit to patients with metastatic renal cancer. Ninety-five patients will be recruited into his study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Investigating Upfront Pazopanib In Metastatic Renal Cancer Renal Cancer (Panther)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, open label study evaluating pre-operative pazopanib treatment in previously untreated patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancer. This study follows a Simon 2 stage design Patients will take pazopanib for 14 weeks followed by a nephrectomy. The drug will continue after nephrectomy until disease progression is documented. Patients will come off study once disease progression occurs, where they will then be followed for survival. Subsequent treatment at the discretion of the treating physician will be documented. After surgery, all patients will be radiologically evaluated 8 weekly until progression. Standard radical nephrectomy with lymph node dissection will be performed on those patients who are deemed operable. The surgery can be laparoscopic or open. Those not deemed suitable for nephrectomy after 14 weeks of treatment will be offered a repeat biopsy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histopathologically confirmed clear cell carcinoma with measurable metastases on CT/MRI imaging (by RECIST v1.1). Only a component of clear cell is required. No prior systemic treatment or nephrectomy for RCC. Palliative radiotherapy is acceptable to non target lesions. Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria: i. Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x uln (patients with gilbert's disease exempt) ii. Serum transaminases (ALT) &lt;3 x uln iii. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;30ml/min iv. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/mm3 without growth factor support v. Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3 Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrolment. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and laboratory tests and other study procedures ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2. 18 years or above (no upper age limit) Male or female Congestive heart failure (class III or IV NYHA), myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft/ stenting or stroke in the previous six months, ongoing severe or unstable arrhythmia requiring medication. Previous treatment for renal cancer Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile, be postmenopausal, or must agree to use adequate contraception during the period of therapy. Male patients must be surgically sterile or agree to use adequate contraception during the period of therapy. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that would in the judgement of the investigator, impart excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or which, in the judgement of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study Prolonged QT interval &gt;480msecs or a history of prolonged QT interval &gt;480msecs Ongoing major gastrointestinal disease including ulcerative colitis, bleeding peptic ulcer disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Bleeding diathesis Current uncontrolled hypertension Another malignancy requiring treatment within the last 5 years. Local prostate cancer not requiring hormone therapy or an asymptomatic raised PSA is acceptable.</criteria>
