	<brief_title>Hormonal Deficiency in the Quality of Life of Patients With Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, when not leading to mortality, is a major cause of morbidity in early adulthood. Recent studies have demonstrated a previously unappreciated association between Severe Traumatic Brain Injury and endocrine dysfunction. The current trial aims at evaluating the quality of life 18 months post-trauma and associating this outcome to growth hormone levels.</detailed_description>
