	<brief_summary>Apatinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and it's anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and the maximum tolerable daily dose is 850 mg. The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib can improve progression free survival or overall survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma who failed two lines of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
