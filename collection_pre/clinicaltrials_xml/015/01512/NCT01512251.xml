	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1/2 clinical trial with the goal of determining whether the addition of the investigational agent BKM120 to vemurafenib will lead to improved 6-month progression-free survival in patients with BRAFV600E/K mutant melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BKM120 Combined With Vemurafenib (PLX4032) in BRAFV600E/K Mutant Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase 1 portion of this trial is a dose escalation study; the phase 2 portion is a single-stage, single arm prospective clinical trial. All patients will receive continuous doses of vemurafenib twice a day and BKM120 once a day. In the phase 1 portion of the study, there will be a 7 day lead-in period to allow for single dose pharmacokinetic analysis of BKM120 alone. Cycle 1 (28 days) is the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period. During phase 1, vemurafenib and BKM120 doses will be escalated using a standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme with the goal of identifying the recommended phase 2 dose. In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients will receive continuous doses of vemurafenib and BKM120 starting on day 1 of the first cycle. In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients will receive vemurafenib and BKM120 at the recommended phase 2 dose.</detailed_description>
