	<brief_title>Treatment of Diabetes After Gastric Bypass With Sitagliptin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Januvia (sitagliptin phosphate 100mg) is an FDA approved medication for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes. Sitagliptin works by inhibiting the Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme, resulting in increased active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. GLP-1 is an incretin which increases post-prandial insulin secretion. Because Gastric Bypass has also been shown to increase GLP-1 levels, this study seeks to determine the additional effect of DDP-4 inhibition on glucose control in patients who have elevated incretin levels post Gastric Bypass. The study will also assess if Januvia (Sitagliptin phosphate) is safe and well tolerated in patients after Gastric Bypass. Recruitment and data collection for this study was started at St. Luke's Hospital in New York, NY and later moved to Columbia University Medical Center in New York, NY.</detailed_description>
