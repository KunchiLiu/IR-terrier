	<detailed_description>Comparative and longitudinal study. Anthropometric and biochemical evaluation were done before, 1hr and 4hr after a bout of exercise and repeated after two weeks of daily supervised exercise. We studied sedentary young healthy women. A treadmill exercise test (following the Bruce's protocol) was done five times per week (from Monday to Friday) for two weeks. The Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the INCMNSZ performed all biochemical laboratory measurements using standardized procedures.</detailed_description>
