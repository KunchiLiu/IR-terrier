	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of second-line Tarceva (erlotinib) in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer with confirmed wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. The aim of the study is to identify from baseline clinical and demographic patient characteristics prognostic factors related to overall survival with second-line Tarceva treatment. Data will be collected from eligible patients for up to 2 years.</brief_summary>
