	<brief_title>Resolution of Comorbidities, Safety and Efficacy of Greater Curvature Plication in Obese Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since the acceptance of surgical procedures to achieve a sustainable weight loss, many different procedures has been tried with variable success. Among them , various gastric restrictive procedures have evolved over the years but abandoned due to poor long term weight loss, food intolerance or severe gastroesophageal reflux. Currently, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band ( LAGB) and sleeve gastrectomy are being used with variable acceptance and success. Laparoscopic gastric plication or laparoscopic greater curvature plication ( LGCP) has recently been done as an alternative to the other restrictive procedures. But the short and long term safety and efficacy outcomes of LGCP is not well documented in current literature. American society of metabolic and bariatric surgery ( ASMBS) guidelines state that LGCP procedures should be considered investigational at this time and should be performed under a study protocol with third party oversight (e.g. IRB) to ensure continuous evaluation of patient safety and to review adverse events and outcomes. A prospective nonrandomized study at Cleveland clinic suggested that a reduction in gastric capacity can be achieved by way of plication of stomach and thereby achieving encouraging weight loss. We intend to study this procedure as an alternative to LAGB or sleeve gastrectomy for carefully selected patients. The objective of this study will be to demonstrate feasibility , short term and long term safety and efficacy of LGCP . This will be done by achieving gastric restriction by infolding of stomach and thereby achieving good weight loss . The subjects will be followed up post operatively to observe the effect on the comorbidities along with sustained weight loss. The inclusion and exclusion criteria , target population, duration of subject participation and primary endpoints will be defined and all the data will be recorded per protocol.</detailed_description>

These conditions may include but are not be limited to Hyperlipidemia Type 2 diabetes Mild obstructive sleep apnea Hypertension Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee 4. Agree to refrain from any type of weightloss drug (prescription or OTC) or elective procedure that would affect body weight for the duration of the trial; 5. HbA1C &lt; 11% 6. For subjects who have Type 2 diabetes, the antidiabetic medication regimen is no more complex than oral metformin plus one oral sulfonylurea plus once daily insulin injection. 7. Ability to self pay for the procedure and follow up. 1. Previous malabsorptive or restrictive procedures performed for the treatment of obesity; 2. Scheduled concurrent surgical procedure, with the exception of SOC liver biopsy; 3. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant or lactating at the time of screening or at the time of surgery; 4. Any condition which precludes compliance with the study; 5. History or presence of preexisting autoimmune connective tissue disease 6. Use of prescription or over the counter weight reduction medications or supplements within thirty days of the Screening Visit or the duration of study participation. 7. Psychiatric disorders that may affect compliance with the clinical trial, including dementia, active psychosis, severe depression requiring &gt; 2 medications, or history of suicide attempts. Any condition which places the subject at undue risk for the procedure (surgeon's discretion).</criteria>
