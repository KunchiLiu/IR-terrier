	<brief_summary>There is a demand for explorative and comparative studies on various non-pharmaceutical efforts in treating and helping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. This study has been developed in light of this need. The main purpose of the project is to test whether a device guided breathing control system can decreasing the feeling of breathlessness in patients with moderate stage and severe stage of COPD. In addition the study could shed light on whether a reduced feeling of breathlessness can lead to improved physical function, and less experience of other symptoms (I.e., depression, anxiety, sleeping difficulties, fatigue, pain) and provide a better quality of life for patients with COPD.</brief_summary>
