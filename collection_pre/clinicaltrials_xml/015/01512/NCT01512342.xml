	<brief_summary>Given the lack of evidence in support of pacing self-management for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), it is examined whether physical behavior and health status of patients with CFS improve in response to a pacing self-management program.

	<brief_title>Pacing Activity Self-management for Patients With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given the lack of evidence in support of pacing self-management for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), it is examined whether physical behavior and health status of patients with CFS improve in response to a pacing self-management program. The effects of pacing will be compared with those observed when applying relaxation therapy to patients with CFS. According to the power calculation, 36 patients fulfilling the 1994 Centre for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) will be randomized to either 3 weeks of pacing activity self-management or relaxation therapy. Both treatment groups will receive 3 weekly sessions spread over 3 consecutive weeks. All treatments will be delivered by occupational therapists or physiotherapists. One treatment session lasts for about 45 minutes each. Outcome measures include the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), Medical Outcomes Short Form 37 Health Status Survey (SF-36), Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), CFS Symptom List and autonomic activity at rest and following 3 activities of daily living (writing a standardized test on a laptop computer, ironing, and climbing 26 flights of stairs). For measuring autonomic activity, the Nexus 10 device (Mind Media, the Netherlands) will be used. Skin conductance, body temperature, heart rate, blood volume pressure and heart rate variability will be measured continuously in real time during a 2 minutes period, with the patient sitting on a chair (back supported and hands resting on legs). Electrodes will be placed on the left hand in all patients.</detailed_description>
