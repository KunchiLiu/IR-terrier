	<brief_summary>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) versus CAMS (Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality) -informed supportive psychotherapy on the risk of self-harm acts and suicide attempts in patients with self behavior and personality traits within the spectrum of borderline personality disorder. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is 16 weeks of treatment with Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) after a defined manual has a higher efficacy than CAMS-informed supportive psychotherapy on self-harm acts, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, impulsiveness and consumption of hospital services in patients with symptoms within the spectrum of borderline personality disorder (BDP). Method: The investigators will include 160 patients in the randomized trial to investigate whether 16 weeks of DBT-treatment as a higher efficacy than CAMS-informed supportive psychotherapy on the risk of self-harm acts and suicide attempts in patients with self-harm behavior and personality traits within the spectrum of borderline personality disorder. The trial will meet strict criteria for high quality randomized trials, and will hopefully help to establish evidence for the treatment of this patient group at higher risk of later suicide. There will be performed follow up interviews after 16 weeks, 28 weeks and 52 weeks.</brief_summary>
