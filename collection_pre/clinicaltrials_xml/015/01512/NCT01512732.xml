	<brief_summary>Today, no non-verbal auditory stimuli that assess mental processing are available in Israel. The goal of this study is to make available a validated set of auditory stimuli in Israel. We created a computerized Hebrew version of the Montreal Affective Voices (MAV). The MAV is a novel tool for assessing mental processing. The MAV consists of 90 nonverbal affect bursts corresponding to nine different emotions (such as anger, fear, happiness etc.) recorded by ten different actors. The uniqueness of these affective bursts is that they do not contain verbal context, but rather express affective moods using the vowel /a/ (as in "apple"). In this study, the investigators will verify the new Hebrew version of MAV in healthy control groups. Next, the investigators will compare the mental processing ability in young vs. old population, using the MAV test. In addition, the investigators will assess mental processing in two pathologic study groups (Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder) using the MAV test. The investigators intend to use the MAV tool in future research in Parkinson's disease and depression.</brief_summary>
