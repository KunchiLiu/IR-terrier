	<brief_summary>There is an unsatisfied medical need for a first-line treatment of localized uncomplicated proliferating Infantile Hemangioma with a good benefit/risk profile. Pierre Fabre Dermatologie has developed a new formulation of propranolol (V0400 GL 01A) which is a topical gel adapted to paediatric use. The objective of this study is to evaluate topical propranolol efficacy and safety in the management of localized hemangioma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main only one proliferating Infantile Hemangioma present anywhere on the body except on the head, the neck, the hands and on the diaper area, with largest diameter diameter ≥ 1cm and ≤ 5 cm. Main more than one Infantile Hemangioma with largest diameter ≥ 1cm medically unstable health status that may interfere with his/her ability to complete the study Infantile Hemangioma requires, according to Investigator's judgment, a systemic treatment the patient has previously been administered treatment for IH or surgical and/or medical procedures (e.g. laser therapy) have been performed to treat the IH</criteria>
