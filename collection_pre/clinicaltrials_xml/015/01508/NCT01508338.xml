	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to - determine the effects of 12 weeks of HMB free acid gel, ATP, and HMB free acid gel plus ATP supplementation in trained individuals during a periodized training program on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, body composition, strength, force, velocity, and peak power during loaded and unloaded vertical jumps. Additionally, the study will determine if either supplementation protocol prevents the typical decay seen in performance following an overreaching cycle performed in the 9th and 10th weeks of the study. Finally, the study will elucidate the mechanisms of action of supplementation on protein breakdown by analyzing serum indices of muscle damage (CK, LDH) and anabolic status (Testosterone:Cortisol ratio) as well as a urinary indicator of protein breakdown (3-methylhistidine). We hypothesize that under these conditions that the supplementation protocols will augment skeletal muscle hypertrophy, strength, and power and that HMB will blunt increases in serum indices of muscle damage, and urinary indices of protein breakdown.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of HMB, ATP, and HMB Plus ATP on Muscle Mass, Strength, and Power in Resistance Trained Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a randomized and double blind study the subjects will consume either placebo supplements, HMB supplement, ATP supplement, or HMB plus ATP supplements for 12 weeks. While consuming the supplements the subjects will undergo an extensive resistance training program designed to train all major muscle groups. An additional overreaching training cycle during weeks 9 and 10 which will involve a high-volume, hypertrophy style training program. Subject testing will consist of the following: - Strength and power at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12 - Range of motion and muscle soreness at weeks 0, 1, 8, 9, and 10 - Body composition and muscle assessments at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12 - Body fat assessments at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 - Blood biochemical measurements at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12 - Urinary analysis for protein breakdown (3-methylhistidine) at 0, 1, 8, 9, and 10 weeks</detailed_description>
