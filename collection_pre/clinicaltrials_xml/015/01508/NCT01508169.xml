	<detailed_description>Aging has been associated with balance impairment. The use of foot orthoses has been shown to be a feasible strategy for improving postural control.The objective of this study was to determine if foot orthoses (with metatarsal pad and medial arch support) are effective as an adjuvant treatment to improve balance, foot pain and disability in elderly women with osteoporosis. Another purpose was to verify if social demographic and clinical factors such as age, race, education, marital status, age of menopause, use of drugs related to balance dysfunction, visual or hearing complaints, body mass index, previous fractures and number of falls may influence the results.</detailed_description>
