	<brief_summary>The presence of proteinuria (&gt;300 mg/d) represents an important factor in the diagnosis and evaluation of the pregnant patient with an hypertensive disorder. The 24 hour collection of urine for proteinuria is the gold standard for the diagnosis of the condition and allows the physician to determine if an hypertensive disorder is related directly or not to the gestation. The problem is the time it takes and the technical difficulties related to the sample collection. An alternative is the quantification of protein and creatinine in a random sample of urine. We seek to evaluate if this method is as affective as the gold standard in the diagnosis of proteinuria (&gt;300 mg/d).</brief_summary>
