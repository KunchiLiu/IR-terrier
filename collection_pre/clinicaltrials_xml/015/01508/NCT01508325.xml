	<brief_summary>This is a multicentre, randomized, open-label parallel trial to demonstrate the superiority and/or non-inferiority of bisoprolol on metoprolol succinate sustained-release (SR) tablet in subjects with mild to moderate primary hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Bisoprolol With Metoprolol Succinate Sustained-release on Heart Rate and Blood Pressure in Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objectives: To demonstrate that bisoprolol is superior in mean ambulatory heart rate and/or non-inferior in mean ambulatory DBP as compared with metoprolol SR in the last 4 hours after 12-week active treatment in subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH). Secondary objectives: 1. To compare the efficacy of the 2 study drugs by 24h ambulatory monitoring by several parameters at different times (Example: blood pressure, heart rate, their variability, etc...) after 12-week treatment from baseline among subjects with mild to moderate EH 2. To evaluate safety of the two drugs 3. To evaluate the treatment compliance of the two drugs</detailed_description>
