	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets of canagliflozin and metformin immediate release (IR) in comparison with the individual components of the FDC tablets (canagliflozin and metformin IR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Canagliflozin and Metformin Immediate Release (150 mg/500 mg) FDC Tablets in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff), single-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence (to see if blood levels of one drug are equivalent to blood levels of another drug) of canagliflozin and metformin IR when administered orally (by mouth) as individual components (ie, separate tablets of canagliflozin and metformin IR) (Treatment A) and when administered as FDC tablets (ie, canagliflozin and metformin IR contained in the same tablet) (Treatment B). Healthy volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive a single dose of Treatment A followed by a single dose of Treatment B or Treatment B followed by Treatment A with a period of approximately 15 days between treatments. The total duration of the study will be approximately 51 days.</detailed_description>
