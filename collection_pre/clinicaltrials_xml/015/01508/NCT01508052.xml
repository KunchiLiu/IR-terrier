	<brief_summary>We hypothesized that sequential compression device (SCD) compression system might induce more decreases on core temperature by increasing lower extremity blood flow. And, this study investigated the effects of SCD compression system on body temperature in patients during total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and remifentanil. During the surgery, temperature was measured and recorded using oesophageal temperature and the calf-minus-toe skin-surface temperature gradient, respectively.</detailed_description>
