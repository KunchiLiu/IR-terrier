	<brief_summary>Adequate glycemic control in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a desired therapeutic goal that is difficult to achieve with current blood glucose monitoring technology. Home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) technology, which requires finger pricking, is a source of severe inconvenience and hence, a lack of compliance.Thus, the need for non-invasive and easy to operate glucose monitoring in DM patients for strict glycemic control cannot be overemphasized. The Glucometer GM-205 blood glucose readings are accurate and measure blood glucose with an acceptable mean relative error when compared to acceptable invasive blood glucose measurements. The primary objectives of the trial are to determine: 1. The safety of the Glucometer GM-205 in evaluating blood glucose levels 2. The accuracy of the Glucometer GM-205 in evaluating blood glucose levels</brief_summary>
