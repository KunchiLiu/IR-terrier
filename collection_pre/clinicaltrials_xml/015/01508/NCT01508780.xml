	<brief_summary>It has been hypothesized that one of the benefits of bosentan relates to pulmonary vascular remodeling. The investigators believe that this study will help document the nature of beneficial changes that occur in patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in response to bosentan therapy. In turn, demonstrating that changes in pulmonary vascular structure and function accompany clinical improvement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Use of Angiography, Optical Coherence Tomography and Intravascular Ultrasound in Evaluation of Pulmonary Vascular Structure and Function in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Treated With Oral Bosentan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will have Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) imaging during the right heart catheterization that diagnoses them as having PAH. Subjects will start their bosentan and will be followed by monthly clinic visits for 4 months. At 4 months they will have repeat OCT and IVUS imaging.</detailed_description>
