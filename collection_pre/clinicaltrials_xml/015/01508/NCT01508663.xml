	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether PCI added to OMT could be superior over OMT alone in the prevention of late adverse cardiac and cerebro-vascular events in elderly patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) during the additional 12 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design - Prospective, randomized, multi-center study of each 1600 subjects enrolled. - Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a) PCI added to OMT (n=800) vs. b) OMT alone(n=800). Subsequently, subjects in PCI added to OMT group will be randomly assigned to everolimus eluting stent(n=400) vs. zotarolimus eluting sten(n=400). All subjects will be followed for 1 year after randomization. Additional long-term follow-up (2- or 3-year) will be preceded in the next plan after 1-year study period. - Subjects with CAD who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included - Clinical and laboratory follow-up should be performed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with CAD and those in whom initial CCS class I to III angina or Braunwald classification less than IIB 2. Patients with age 75 years or older 3. Patients receiving OMT (one or two antiplatelet agents, betablockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and statin) 4. Patients with stenosis of at least 70% in at least one proximal epicardial coronary artery or objective evidence of myocardial ischemia (substantial changes in STsegment depression or Twave inversion on the resting electrocardiogram or inducible ischemia with either exercise or pharmacologic vasodilator stress) 5. Patients with signed informed consent 1. Patients with persistence of CCS IV angina 2. Resting chest pain (≥ Braunwald classification IIB) 3. Patients who experienced a markedly positive stress test (substantial ST segment depression or hypotensive response during stage 1 of the Bruce protocol) 4. Patients with age 85 years or older 5. Patients with refractory CHF or cardiogenic shock 6. Patients with an EF of less than 30% 7. Patients who have received revascularization within the previous 6 months 8.
