	<brief_summary>Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) can emphasize surface pattern and microvascular architecture of the gastric mucosa.However,the usefulness and criteria of NBI for differential diagnosis among early gastric cancers (EGC) have not been fully established.The study is based on the hypothesis: 1. ME-NBI is useful in distinguishing EGC from other gastric lesions 2. ME-NBI is useful in further differential diagnosis among EGCs.</brief_summary>
