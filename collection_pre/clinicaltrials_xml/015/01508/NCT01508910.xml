	<criteria>Main Male or female participants who are 21 to 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent. Participants with Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class III or IV chronic refractory angina. Participants without control of their angina symptoms in spite of maximal tolerated doses of antiangina drugs. Participants must be on optimal therapy for their angina and must have been on a stable antianginal medication regimen for at least 4 weeks before signing the informed consent form. Participants with obstructive coronary disease unsuitable for conventional revascularization due to unsuitable anatomy or comorbidity as determined at the site and confirmed by an independent adjudication committee. Participants must have evidence of inducible myocardial ischemia. Participants must experience angina episodes. Participants must be able to complete 2 exercise tolerance tests on the treadmill within 3 weeks of randomization. If female of childbearing potential, subject must not be pregnant and agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study. Main Cardiovascular hospitalization within 60 days prior to potential study enrollment. Participant has had a successful or partially successful coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within 6 months or PCTA within 60 days of potential study enrollment. Participant has had a placement of a biventricular pacemaker for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for heart failure within 180 days of potential study enrollment. Participant has documented stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) within 60 days of potential study enrollment. Participant has a history of moderate to severe aortic stenosis; or severe aortic insufficiency; or severe mitral stenosis; or severe mitral insufficiency. Participant has a prosthetic aortic valve or a mechanical mitral valve replacement. Participant has severe comorbidity associated with a reduction in life expectancy to less than 3 years as a result of chronic medical illnesses. Participants with cancer are excluded with the following exceptions: Subjects with insitu nonmelanoma skin cancer or insitu cervical cancer are not excluded. Participants that have been cancer free for &gt;= 5 years as determined by their oncologist are not excluded. Subjects with a prior history of stem cell transplant for cancer are excluded no matter how long they have been cancerfree. Participants with a history of leukemia or other bone marrow disease. Participant has sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait. Participants with proliferative retinopathy. Participants with Hb A1c &gt; 9%. Participant has platelet counts &gt;10% above the upper limit of normal (ULN) or platelet counts &lt; 70,000. Participant has a hematocrit &lt; 30% prior to potential study enrollment. Participant has a serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL prior to potential study enrollment. Participant tests positive for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, or is on chronic immunosuppressive medications, or has had a previous stem cell transplant. Participant has a known contraindication to Neupogen (filgrastim) or GCSF. Participant was previously enrolled in an active treatment group of cell therapy trials for cardiovascular disease including any phase of CD34+ stem cell trials. Left ventricular (LV) thickness of &lt; 7 mm in the target areas of injection as measured by during a 2D echocardiogram (ECHO). Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or other uncontrolled arrhythmias that would prohibit accurate electromechanical mapping and NOGAguided intramyocardial injection. Bleeding diathesis with an INR &gt; 1.8 when not receiving antithrombotic therapy. Hepatic dysfunction as evidenced by elevated AST or ALT levels &gt; 2.5 x ULN. Any previous transplant requiring immunosuppression. Disease state requiring chronic immunosuppression.</criteria>
