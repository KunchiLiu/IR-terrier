	<brief_summary>In this study, participants will have standard ADT and undergo standard XRT to the prostate and at-risk lymph nodes by IMRT. The subsequent *boost* RT to the prostate alone will be given using the CyberKnife, rather than using the standard IMRT. This study will also see how CyberKnife affects the quality of the participant's life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study, participants will have standard androgen deprivation therapy and undergo standard radiation therapy to the prostate and at-risk lymph nodes by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The subsequent *boost* radiation therapy to the prostate alone will be given using the CyberKnife, rather than using the standard IMRT. This study will also see how CyberKnife affects the quality of the participant's life.</detailed_description>
