	<brief_summary>Hypotension is a recognized frequent complication of induction of anesthesia. The intent of this research is to determine the incidence of hypotension in patients receiving anesthetic induction with propofol. This investigation seeks to examine how normal clinical practice or a "real world" understanding of the usual response to propofol affects hemodynamics without isolating or standardizing other variables. The current research concerns hypotension in normal clinical practice where variability exists. This project aims to gather information and data in an attempt to form a foundation upon which each of the other variables affecting blood pressure may be subsequently assessed.</brief_summary>
