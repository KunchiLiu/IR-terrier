	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples from pregnant women who achieved pregnancy following in-vitro fertilization (IVF) with Natera's preimplantation aneuploidy screening (with or without single gene gene testing). These samples will be used for test development of non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection of Maternal Blood Samples for Development of Non-invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subjects will sign a consent form and have blood drawn at approximately 8-17 weeks gestation. Subjects will received $200 reimbursement for providing this blood sample. The collected samples will be used to help develop non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing using Natera's Parental Support technology which is already commercialized for genetic diagnosis of in-vitro embryos. In this study, the technology will be tested for it's ability to analyze fetal-specific pieces of DNA isolated from the mother's blood. No results of the maternal blood testing will be reported to the subject or to their physicians.</detailed_description>
