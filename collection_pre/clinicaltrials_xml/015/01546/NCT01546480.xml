	<brief_summary>Chronic Pain after Cholecystectomy is a well known problem. One theory is that it is due to persisting inflammation. The purpose of the study is to measure inflammatory factors in cerebrospinal fluid and blod at patients 12 months after the operation. DNA-samples are collected to examine genetical factors, important for perception of pain, and the development of chronic pain.</brief_summary>
