	<brief_title>Single Cohort, 2-Period Study to Assess Pharmacokinetics of Metformin Alone and in Combination With Ranolazine 500 mg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is as follows: • To evaluate the effect of steady-state ranolazine 500 mg twice daily (bid) on the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of metformin in subjects with T2DM. The secondary objectives of this study are as follows: - To examine the safety and tolerability of metformin when co administered with ranolazine 500 mg bid at steady-state in subjects with T2DM. - To determine the steady-state PK of ranolazine 500 mg bid in subjects with T2DM receiving metformin.</detailed_description>
