	<brief_summary>The goal of this trial is to test the impact of a step-wise approach for catheter ablation of recurrent ventricular tachycardia, (irregular heart rhythms that originate in the bottom chambers of the heart), in patients with a previous heart attack for whom catheter ablation is clinically indicated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sudden cardiac death due to VT (ventricular tachycardia) or VF (ventricular fibrillation) occurs at an estimated rate of 300,000 events per year in United States, accounting for 5.6% of annual mortality22. A significant proportion of patients treated with ICDs (implantable defibrillators) will receive shocks due to recurrent VT, resulting in increased mortality8. As a result, catheter-based ablation has emerged as an effective treatment for recurrent VT. However, no study has assessed the impact of a step-wise approach on the outcome of catheter ablation of VT. The investigators propose a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single-arm trial to evaluate the impact of a step-wise approach to catheter ablation on ventricular tachycardia recurrence. Given the increasing use of catheter ablation in patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia, this study will answer a critical question regarding the impact of a step-wise approach on the inducibility of VT at the end of the procedure and clinical recurrences of ventricular arrhythmias at 6 months.</detailed_description>
