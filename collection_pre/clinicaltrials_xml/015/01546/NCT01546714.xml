	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among African American women who have sex with women (AAWSW). In addition, the study is interested in better understanding the types of risk behaviors that place AAWSW at risk for STIs. The investigators hypothesis is that AAWSW experience high rates of STIs, similar to heterosexual African American women. Knowledge gained from this study will guide development of interventions to reduce women's risk for these types of infections and will improve how AAWSW are screened for STIs.</brief_summary>
