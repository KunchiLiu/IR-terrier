	<brief_summary>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients perform airway clearance incorporating various breathing strategies, to clear secretions from their lungs. Hand held devices may aid mucus expectoration, and also motivate the patient to manage by themselves. Our aims was to study if resistive expiration through "volumetric incentive spirometer" (VISex) can improve lung function in the short term in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients.</brief_summary>
