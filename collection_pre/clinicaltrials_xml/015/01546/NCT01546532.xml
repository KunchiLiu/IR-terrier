	<criteria>Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Male and female heart failure patients with body weight &lt;160 kg, on standard therapy including a stable dose of furosemide 40240 mg/day orally (p.o). or equivalent dose of loop diuretics, reduced systolic function (LVEF ≤ 45% measured within the past 6 months), BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL or NTproBNP of ≥ 400 pg/mLNYHA Class II or III, and worsening symptoms, e.g. fatigue, dyspnea, breathlessness within 3 months Mild to moderate renal impairment Exclusion criteria: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 110 mm Hg at the time of randomization Administration of intravenous radiographic contrast agent within 72 hours prior to randomization or acute contrastinduced nephropathy at the time of randomization Current use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Current or planned (through the completion of study drug infusion) treatment with any i.v. therapies, including vasodilators (including nesiritide), positive inotropic agents, vasopressors, levosimendan, or mechanical support (intraaortic balloon pump, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, or any ventricular assist device).
