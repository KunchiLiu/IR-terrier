	<brief_summary>Perineal massage at the end of labor stage 2 has been investigated in 2 randomized controlled trials using a water soluble lubricant. In one trial a significant reduction of labor stage 2 has been found, both trials did not show a significant increase of perineum integrity. In the HCB Swiss Study both a significant reduction of labor stage 2 by 30 % as well as a significant increase of perineal integrity have been shown. No adverse events have been reported. (see also Obstetric gel shortens second stage of labor and prevents perineal trauma in nulliparous women: a randomized controlled trial on labor facilitation. Schaub AF, Litschgi M, Hoesli I, Holzgreve W, Bleul U, Geissbuhler V. J Perinat Med 2008; 36 (2): 129-135). Today's practice- Lubricants are widely used to enable manual vaginal examination during labor. In Israel midwifes are using Almond Oil for perineal massage at the end of labor stage 2 to protect the perineum. It has been shown for the first time that the use of the Dianatal Obstetric Gel facilitates vaginal childbirth in humans. Dianatal has been introduced to the EU markets in 2008.</brief_summary>
