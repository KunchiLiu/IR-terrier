	<criteria>Patients with AML or RAEB 2 High Risk MDS who are newly diagnosed according to the WHO 2008 Classification and previously untreated. Patients with AML (arising from an antecedent hematologic disease [AHD]) or MDS who may have had one prior regimen with commercially available agents for the treatment of their prior hematologic disease. The patients may not have had a prior therapy for their AML. AML patients include de novo AML, AML evolving from MDS or other AHD and AML after previous cytotoxic therapy or radiation (secondary AML) For a diagnosis of AML, a bone marrow blast count of 20% or more is required. For a diagnosis of highrisk Myelodysplastic Syndrome RAEB 2 the patient must have 1019% bone marrow blasts Adequate Organ Function ECOG Performance Status 0, 1, or 2 AML M3 Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) or patients with a t(9:22) cytogenetic translocation. Patients with known active uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.</criteria>
