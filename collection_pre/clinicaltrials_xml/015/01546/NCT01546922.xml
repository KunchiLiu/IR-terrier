	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate whether a physiologically low hydrocortisone (HC) dose is better for cognition as compared to a physiologically high HC dose. In addition, quality of life, metabolic profile and somatosensation will be described in relation to HC dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydrocortisone Replacement in Patients With Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency (SUPREME CORT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Rationale: A wide variety in hydrocortisone (HC) substitution dose-regimens are considered physiological for patients with adrenal insufficiency. However, it is likely that cognition is negatively influenced by higher cortisol exposure to the brain. No studies have been performed to assess the effects of treatment regimens with a low physiological HC substitution dose on cognition in comparison to a high physiological HC substitution dose. These treatment regimens should take body weight and multiple dosing into account. In addition, substitution doses should be monitored by clinical evaluation and biochemical analysis for adverse effects associated with over- or under-replacement. - Intervention: Patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency will be randomized in two groups to receive either a low dose HC (0.2-0.3 mg/kg body weight) for 10 weeks followed by 10 weeks of high dose HC (0.4-0.6 mg/kg body weight) or vice versa. At baseline and after both treatment periods, patients will be tested.</detailed_description>
