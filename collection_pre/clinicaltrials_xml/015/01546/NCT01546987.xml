	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase TAK-700, when used with other hormone therapy, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. This may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer when combined with hormone therapy. Studying quality-of-life in patients having cancer treatment may help identify the intermediate- and long-term effects of treatment on patients with prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the use of hormone therapy, including TAK-700, together with radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Therapy, Radiation Therapy, and Steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase TAK-700 in Treating Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the difference in overall survival of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer with unfavorable prognostic features between a) standard treatment (androgen-deprivation therapy [ADT] + radiotherapy) and b) standard treatment with the addition of 24 months of steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase TAK-700 (TAK-700). Secondary - To characterize differences between the treatment groups with respect to incidence of unexpected grade ≥ 3 adverse events and/or clinically significant decrement in patient-reported quality of life (QOL) among subjects treated with TAK-700. - To compare rates and cumulative incidence of biochemical control (freedom from PSA failure), local/regional progression, and distant metastases. - To compare rate and cumulative incidence of clinical failure, defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &gt; 25 ng/mL, documented local disease progression, regional or distant metastasis, or initiation of ADT. - To compare prostate cancer-specific survival and other-cause mortality. - To compare the change in severity of fatigue as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue short form. - To compare changes in patient-reported QOL as measured by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). - To assess quality-adjusted survival using the EQ-5D. - To compare nadir and average serum testosterone at 12 and 24 months during treatment. - To compare changes in hemoglobin A1C, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin during 24 months of systemic treatment and during the first three years of follow-up. - To compare changes in fasting lipid levels during 24 months of treatment and during the first three years of follow-up. - To compare changes in body mass index (BMI) during 24 months of treatment and during the first three years of follow-up. - To compare the incidence of adverse events ascertained via CTCAE version 4. - To compare the rate of recovery of testosterone to &gt; 230 ng/dL (accepted threshold for supplementation) after 12 and 24 months of follow-up. - To compare the median time to recovery of testosterone to &gt; 230 ng/dL during the first five years of follow-up. - To assess cumulative incidence of relevant clinical survivorship endpoints including new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or osteoporotic fracture. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to risk group (see Disease Characteristics) and type of radiation therapy (RT) boost (intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) vs brachytherapy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive standard androgen suppression (AS) with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (such as leuprolide, goserelin, buserelin, or triptorelin) for 24 months from initiation and oral (PO) antiandrogen (such as flutamide or bicalutamide) beginning 2 months prior and for the duration of radiation therapy (RT). - Arm II: Patients receive the same standard AS with LHRH agonist and oral antiandrogen as in arm 1. Patients also receive steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase TAK-700 (TAK-700) PO twice daily (BID) for 2 years. In both arms, patients undergo IMRT or 3D-conformal RT to the whole pelvis once daily, 5 days a week, for 6-8 weeks. Some patients also receive brachytherapy. Quality of life is assessed via the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Scale, the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26), and the EuroQol (EQ-5D) assessments at baseline and periodically during the study. Serum may be collected from some patients for correlative studies. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
