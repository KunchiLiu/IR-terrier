	<brief_title>Testing the Effect of Zinc Supplementation to Improve the Treatment Effect of Botulinum Toxin for Oculofacial Spasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Botulinum Toxin (Botox) has been used for many years in the treatment of oculofacial dystonias such as blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. It has also gained widespread use for cosmetic purposes. The efficacy and duration of its effect is not constant amongst all patients. Some patient respond very well, while others have no clinical benefit or the clinical benefit does not last as long as expected. Zinc is known to be an important co-factor in the molecular effects of Botox. The investigators hypothesize that one of the many factors that may contribute to the variability in the response to Botox may be the level of Zinc available within the neuromuscular junction of those patients. The investigators plan to to test whether or not giving patients supplemental Zinc with their Botox injections would help improve the magnitude and duration of the intended clinical effect.</detailed_description>
