	<brief_title>A Study of BCI-838 and Several BCI-632 Prodrugs in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first phase of this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of BCI-838 following oral administration of single doses of BCI-838 in healthy male subjects. The pharmacokinetics of BCI-838 and its metabolite BCI-632 following single ascending doses of BCI-838 will be evaluated, as will the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of BCI-838 and its metabolite following single oral doses of BCI-838 in healthy male subjects. The second phase of this study will evaluate and compare the relative bioavailability and PK of the metabolite BCI-632 following single oral administration of several new pro-drug candidates in healthy male subjects.</detailed_description>
