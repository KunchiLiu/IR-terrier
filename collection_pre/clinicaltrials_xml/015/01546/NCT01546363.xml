	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure the levels of serum proteins and other biomarkers in cervical cancer patients. We believe that some of these markers may be useful in selecting patients for specific types of cancer therapies. These markers may also help to predict response to therapy, relapse after therapy, and survival after therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC STUDY AIMS Specific Aim 1: To use gene expression analysis of primary cervical cancers to identify a gene expression signature that predicts for lymph node metastases in this disease. Specific Aim 2: To predict lymph node metastases by performing multiplex measurements of cancer-associated proteins and cytokines using proximity ligation assay (PLA) on plasma samples. Specific Aim 3: To measure circulating human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA in the plasma samples of cervical cancer patients using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and determine its ability to predict for nodal metastases. Specific Aim 4: To use deep sequencing to evaluate gene and sequence differences between cervical cancer patients with and without lymph node metastasis.</detailed_description>
