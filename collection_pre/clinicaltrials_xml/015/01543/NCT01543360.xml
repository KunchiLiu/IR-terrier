	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to compare the rate of successful establishment of a central venous catheter in the first two attempts of ultrasound-guided puncture between two techniques: (1) a subclavian technique versus (2) an axillary technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Axillary Versus Subclavian Vein Strategies for Central Venous Catheterization Under Continuous Ultrasound Guidance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the following between the two techniques: - the success rate of the establishment of a central venous catheter - the success rate of establishment of a central venous catheter at the first attempt at venipuncture - for non-failures (eg, a catheter is placed in the first four trys), time to cannulation - the presence / absence of the following complications: - arterial puncture (yes / no) - pneumothorax (yes / no) - hemothorax (yes / no) - hematoma (yes / no) - nerve injury (yes / no) - aberrant course (yes / no) The reasons catheter placement failures will also be described.</detailed_description>
