	<brief_title>Application of Whole-body Vibration With Stochastic Resonance in Frail Elderly: The Effects on Postural Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is based on the guideline of falls management exercise programs (FaME) designed exercise from Skelton and Dinan. The FAME program is structured so that four biocybernetic pillars are embedded in the three successive stages of training. The biocybernetic pillars: 1. improving the balance 2. improvement in functional capacity 3. improvement in bone density and muscle mass Overthrowing 4) improving the security (reducing anxiety). The training phase should reach the following goals: 1. Skilling up: with the aim of improving improve neuromuscular control, postural control and strengthening of large muscle groups of the lower extremity. 2. Training Gain: with the aim to improve functional abilities. 3. Maintaining the Gains: with the goal of muscle mass and bone density and introduce them to build complex multi-sensory exercises. We started the FaME program with assistance from the pilot study, "Effects of stochastic resonance therapy on postural control in the elderly population" (KEK Bern: No.228/09, Trial Registry: NCT01045746). It was found that a whole-body vibration with stochastic resonance (SR-WBV) enables that strength, coordination, and balance training while standing, in the exercise training gain phase is possible. For this reason, this study will examine the feasibility and the immediately and long term effects of SR-WBV with 6 Hz, Noise 4 on postural control and strength in frail elderly.</detailed_description>
