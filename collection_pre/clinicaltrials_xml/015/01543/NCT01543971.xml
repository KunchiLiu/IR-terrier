	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I Study to be conducted in 18 healthy volunteers. Each will receive daily injections for 5 days of TXA127 alone, or Neupogen alone, or TXA127 plus Neupogen together. The aim of the study is to determine the safety of the TXA127 alone and in combination with Neupogen, and to determine whether the use of TXA127 alone or in combination with Neupogen enhances peripheral blood stem cell (CD34+)mobilization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of TXA127 and Neupogen to Increase Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSCs)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this double-blinded comparison study, healthy volunteers will be randomized to one of 3 treatment groups: (Group A) TXA127 at 300 mcg/kg once a day for 5 days or (Group B) Neupogen 10 mcg/kg once a day for 5 days or (Group C) both together once a day for 5 days, these treatments administered by subcutaneous injection, to increase peripheral blood stem cell (CD34+) concentrations in healthy volunteers. A minimum of 18 healthy male and female volunteer Subjects (6 in each treatment group) who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be recruited from the study center's existing database of healthy volunteers and/or by advertising. A sufficient number of alternate volunteers will be screened and checked-in on Day 0 to ensure 6 eligible healthy volunteers are enrolled on Day 1 in each treatment group. Subjects will remain housed in teh Unit during the conduct of this study. Safety: Predose blood samples will be collected immediately prior to receiving the study medication(s), as well as at 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours and 16 hours post-dose.</detailed_description>

Screening and admission clinical laboratory test results that are within lab's reference range or, if not, are considered not clinically significant by the Investigator. Screening and admission 12lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) that are normal or, if abnormal, are considered not clinically significant by the Investigator. Have negative urine drug and alcohol toxicology screens at screening and on admission, with negative HIV antibody and hepatitis panel results at screening. History of acute or chronic medical condition or test abnormality that would significantly increase Volunteer's risk of study participation or significantly increase risk of not achieving study objectives, in the Investigator's opinion. Has known or suspected liver disease (active hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatic insufficiency or ascites) or has a transaminase value &gt; 2x ULN or total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN, a history of spleen enlargement, except if due to infectious mononucleosis resolved more than 6 months prior to scheduled admission, or a current finding of spleen enlargement. Has a history of mononucleosis within previous six months of scheduled admission. Has an abnormally low Protein C or Protein S at screening, or screening laboratory tests indicate Factor V Leiden is present. Has a history of venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or has systolic blood pressure persistently &gt;145 mm Hg or &lt;90 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure persistently &gt;90 mm Hg or &lt;60 mm Hg at screening or on admission.

Has a history of substance abuse, drug addiction, or alcoholism within 1 year prior to screening. (As defined by DSM IV criteria). Within 2 weeks prior to scheduled administration of study drug, Volunteer has taken any prescription or overthecounter medication, herbal preparation or dietary supplement that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may increase risk to Volunteer's safety or to achievement of study objectives.
