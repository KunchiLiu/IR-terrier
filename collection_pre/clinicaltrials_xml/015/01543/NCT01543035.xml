	<brief_summary>Dyslipidaemia, characterized by raised triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, is common in HIV-infected individuals, and has been associated with HIV infection itself and antiretroviral therapy (ART). These abnormalities are well-established markers of cardiovascular (CVD) risk in the general population. Studies have suggested an increased risk of CVD associated with ART exposure over and above that conveyed by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In HIV population to reduce lipid parameters, the most usual clinical strategy remains to add a statin treatment. Recent studies suggested ART switch can represent an interesting alternative to statins to reduce lipid plasma levels. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the frequency with which the replacement of LPV/r (lopinavir/ritonavir), ATZ/r (atazanavir/ritonavir), DRV/r (darunavir/ritonavir) or EFV (efavirenz) by ETR (Etravirin) in dyslipidemic patients with suppressed viremia would obviate the necessity to administer statins. A prospective, phase III study in which the statin treatment of dyslipidemic HIV patients on antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) will be interrupted during 4 weeks is proposed. At week 4, patients qualifying for a lipid lowering drug (calculated LDL-C≥ 3mmol/L) will replace EFV, LPV/r, DRV/r or ATZ/r by ETR. The proportion of patients not qualifying anymore for a statin treatment at 12 weeks (i.e. after 8 weeks of ETR treatment) will be determined. Additionally, the lipid level changes will be assessed at 12 weeks. Inflammatory markers will be measured at baseline, at drug switch and at the end of the study Study drug will be provided by the drug manufacturer (Janssen-Cilag, AG). Compliance for study drug will be done at week-4 and week-12, Returned study medication will be counted and the amount notified on the Case Report Form (CRF).</brief_summary>
