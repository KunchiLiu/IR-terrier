	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: - To evaluate whether 7-day treatment with oral QLT091001 can improve visual function in RP subjects with an autosomal dominant mutation in RPE65. - To evaluate duration of visual function improvement (if observed) in RP subjects with an autosomal dominant mutation in RPE65 after 7-day treatment with oral QLT091001. - To evaluate the safety of oral QLT091001 administered once daily for 7 days in RP subjects with an autosomal dominant mutation in RPE65.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects will have RP caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in RPE65, as diagnosed by an ocular geneticist or ophthalmologist. Subjects who have a bestcorrected standard ETDRS visual acuity of 3 letters or better (20/800 Snellen equivalent) or visible photoreceptor outer segments on OCT/FAF. Subjects with any clinically important abnormal physical finding at Screening. Subjects who have taken any prescription or investigational oral retinoid medication (e.g., Accutane/Roaccutane® or Soriatane/Neotigason®) within 6 months of Day 0 and subjects who did not tolerate their previous oral retinoid medication will be excluded regardless of the time of last exposure. Subjects with a history of diabetes or chronic hyperlipidemia, hepatitis, pancreatitis, or cirrhosis. Subjects who have taken any supplements containing ≥10,000 IU vitamin A within 60 days of Screening.</criteria>
