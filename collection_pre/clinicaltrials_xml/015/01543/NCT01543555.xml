	<brief_summary>Patients submitted to noncardiac surgeries are at increased risk of serious cardiovascular complications. Statins have shown to lower cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular events in other scenarios. The objective of this study is to explore the effects of atorvastatin, as compared with placebo, on the 30-day risk of a composite of death, nonfatal Myocardial Injury after Noncardiac Surgery (MINS), or stroke among patients who undergo noncardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lowering the Risk of Operative Complications Using Atorvastatin Loading Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke are common in the perioperative period of noncardiac surgeries. To the moment there are no safe and effective interventions to reduce vascular events in this scenario. Data from observational studies and small-sized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown promising results in terms of risk reduction. In addition, experimental data have indicated that statins have acute anti-inflammatory properties, which promote the stabilization of atherosclerotic lesions and, therefore, might reduce the risk of MI, even in the short term. This study was designed to explore the effects of atorvastatin, as compared with placebo, on the 30-day risk of a composite of death, nonfatal Myocardial Injury after Noncardiac Surgery (MINS), or stroke among patients who undergo noncardiac surgery. The study was conducted in accordance with the prespecified protocol and reached successful enrollment rates when, by the end of 2014 the steering committee was invited to join an international initiative and participate in a much larger clinical trial to investigate this relevant question. Due to this outstanding possibility, the steering committee decided to redesign the study which is now formatted as an exploratory trial. As described, the study was completed with the inclusion of 648 participants in June, 2015.</detailed_description>
