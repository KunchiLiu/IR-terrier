	<brief_summary>The biologic drugs targeting TNFa, IL-6, IL-1, T cells, B cells have represented a fundamental discovery to treat rheumatic patients whose disease appears to be refractory to conventional therapy. These biologic drugs have been registered for human therapy from a few years, thereby the investigators miss long-term data for safety and efficacy. Aim of this study is to register all the clinical data of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis beginning a treatment with biologic drugs in order to assess the long-term safety and efficacy in the real life.</brief_summary>
