	<brief_summary>Persistent pain, sensory disturbances, lymphedema and functional impairment are frequently occurring late effects of breast cancer treatment. The investigators have previously published data on 3253 women treated for breast cancer in Denmark in the period 2005-2006. Very few studies have examined how these late effects change in time. The aim of this study is to examine in a well defined patient population any change in the prevalence of persistent pain, sensory disturbances, lymphedema and functional impairment, as well as risk factor profile.</brief_summary>
