	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of Cyclophosphamide in HIV-Infected Subjects on HAART Receiving SB-728-T</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the study are to augment HIV-specific T-cells and to reverse or decrease the progressive destruction of CD4+ T-cells that leads to clinical AIDS. Levels of engraftment vary from negligible to about 10% of the CD4+ T-cells in the vascular compartment. Preliminary analyses of HAART TI suggest that an anti-HIV effect may correlate with the level of SB-728-T engraftment. Concurrently, non-myeloablative lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide has been demonstrated to enhance engraftment of adoptively transferred T-cells through a variety of mechanisms. The study is being undertaken to increase SB-728-T engraftment through the administration of low non-myeloablative doses of cyclophosphamide.</detailed_description>
