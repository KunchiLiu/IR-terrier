	<brief_summary>This study is to see whether the combination regimen of ketorolac and nefopam is superior to that of ketorolac and morphine in controlling ureter stone-related acute flank pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Nefopam and Morphine in Balanced Analgesia for Acute Ureteric Colic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The balanced analgesia regimen using both ketorolac and morphine is the most effective choice in controlling urolithiasis related acute pain. Previous animal and human studies reported that combination regimen of ketoprofen and nefopam showed synergistic effect in pain control. We hypothesized that using nefopam instead of morphine for ketorolac based combination analgesia will produce similar pain reduction without causing opioid-related side effect.</detailed_description>
