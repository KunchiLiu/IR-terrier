	<brief_summary>Resistance training is widely used in training and rehabilitation. During recent years elastic resistance training has become increasingly popular for preventing or relieving neck/shoulder/arm pain among sedentary employees. While most research studies documenting positive effects of such interventions have used training instructors, most training in practice does not use an instructor but rather depends on information from other sources such as the internet. Here the investigators examine - in a outcome assessor blinded randomized controlled trial - the effect of 2 weeks elastic resistance training for the neck/shoulder/arm with personal versus video instruction on technical execution.</brief_summary>
