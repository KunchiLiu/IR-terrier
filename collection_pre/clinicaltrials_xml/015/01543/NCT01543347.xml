	<brief_title>Temocillin Use in Complicated Urinary Tract Infections Due to Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL)/AmpC Enterobacteriaceae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The spectrum of activity together with the route of excretion of temocillin makes it a good candidate for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Several studies have shown very good clinical and microbiological activity in uncomplicated and complicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in adults and in pyelonephritis in children older than 2 months. However there is no specific study performed on Urinary Tract Infections due to broad spectrum ÃŸ-lactamases producing strains. In this context, this study is aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of temocillin in the treatment of complicated Urinary Tract Infection due to confirmed Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL) producing or AmpC hyperproducing Enterobacteriaceae in the United Kingdom. The investigators will also evaluate the tolerance of the drug by monitoring the adverse event and the incidence of eventual Clostridium difficile associated infection.</detailed_description>
