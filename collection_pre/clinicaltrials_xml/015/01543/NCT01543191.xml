Subject has a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis documented by a compatible clinical or radiographic presentation, and definitive accepted lab and clinical criteria (e.g., sweat chloride &gt; 60 mEq/L or 2 disease causing CFTR mutations) OR is regularly attending a Consultant led clinic where the diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis is not in doubt. Subject has an FEV1 â‰¥ 45% of predicted at screening. Subject has an oxygen saturation &gt;92% on room air as determined by pulse oximetry at screening. Subject is a nonsmoker or exsmoker has not smoked for at least six months prior to screening. Subject is otherwise medically stable without clinically significant abnormal screening results that depart from their usual baseline level of health as a subject with CF. Must be willing and able to communicate in English and participate in the whole study. Must provide written informed consent.

Subject has a history of lung transplantation. Females of child bearing potential who are pregnant, or lactating.
