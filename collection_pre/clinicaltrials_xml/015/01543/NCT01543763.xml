	<brief_title>Phase I Tolerability, Efficacy, and Safety Study of Pazopanib in Combination With PCI-24781 in Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study rationale/purpose Pazopanib is a potent, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor44 of VEGFR-1, -2, -3, PDGFR-α and -β and c-kit approved for metastatic renal cell carcinoma based on phase III data showing a significant prolongation of PFS (5 mos in pretreated patients and 8.3 mos in treatment-naïve patients). In addition recent data was presented this year, but is not yet published, with treatment-refractory sarcoma patients that showed a PFS was significantly prolonged from a median of 20 vs. 7 weeks. As can occur with all antiangiogenic agents, resistance to pazopanib may develop. Epigenetic modification with HDAC inhibitors may overcome drug resistance by causing an increase in accessibility of DNA to chemotherapeutic agents and may therefore significantly potentiate their cytotoxicity. Combination trials with chemotherapy agents are ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov.) To our knowledge, a combination trial of HDACi with anti-angiogenesis agents has not yet been performed and represents an unmet medical need. PCI-24781 is a pan HDAC inhibitor. In cell lines tested, up-regulation and down-regulation of genes known to result in changes with signal transduction, oxidation, metabolic changes, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and angiogenesis were seen. In addition, ongoing single agent and combination trials have shown the drug to be effective and well-tolerated. Hypothesis: Combining an antiangiogenic agent, such as pazopanib, with an epigenetic modifier, such as histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) PCI-24781, can increase the efficacy of pazopanib as well as overcome development of resistance to pazopanib.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must provide written informed consent prior to performance of studyspecific procedures or assessments, and must be willing to adhere with treatment and followup. Age ≥ 18 years Phase Ia: Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented metastatic solid tumor malignancies. Phase Ib: Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic sarcoma or renal cell carcinoma, any histologic subtype. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 Phase Ia: Patients may have de novo metastatic disease, or documented progression despite any number of prior therapies. Patients must have no curative or other effective therapeutic options available. Phase Ib: Patients with sarcoma and RCC may have had any number of prior treatments, including 0, or prior pazopanib. Patients with sarcoma must be ineligible for chemotherapy or must have received at least one standard chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 Resolution of all chemotherapy or radiationrelated toxicities to Grade 1 severity or lower except for alopecia Patient must be at least 2 weeks or five halflives (whichever is longer) from last standard or experimental therapy, exceptions listed below radiation therapy, surgery or tumor embolization more than 28 days prior to the first dose of Pazopanib/PCI24781 patients who have received prior pazopanib are eligible but must not have received it in the last two weeks A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant), including any female who has had: A hysterectomy A bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy) A bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal Subjects not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value &gt;40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value &lt; 40pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L). Subjects using HRT must have experienced total cessation of menses for &gt;= 1 year and be greater than 45 years of age OR have had documented evidence of menopause based on FSH and estradiol concentrations prior to initiation of HRT Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate contraception. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follow: Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days after the last dose of investigational product Oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen Estrogenic vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patches Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject Double barrier method: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) Female subjects who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study drug and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 14 days following the last dose of study drug.
