	<brief_summary>The protein composition of HDL is complicated. The investigators have identified 40 distinct proteins associated with HDL by proteomics technology, and these proteins have been confirmed to be related to the function of anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, improvement of endothelial function, inhibition of thrombosis and so on. And the investigators also found that the levels of some proteins in HDL changed in patients with coronary heart disease, compared with the healthy control group. So, this study is to conduct in the two following aspects: enlarge the sample size to verify the preliminary results to find new research ideas of pathogenesis and biomarkers for coronary heart disease; and study the changes of HDL protein composition in patients with coronary heart disease before and after statins treatment using proteomics technology in order to find the mechanism of statins pleiotropic effects and indicators for evaluating the treatment effectiveness.</brief_summary>
