	<brief_summary>CIN2/3 have been increased for many years and mainly concern women aged 25-29 years. They are subsequent to a persistent HPV infection and are classically treated by conization. Recurrences occur in 7 to 18 % of cases, mainly after CIN3 management during the first 2 years of follow-up. Follow-up is crucial to detect and treat recurrence and to select high risk women who might develop cervical cancer. Colposcopy and cytology have been recommended since 1989 by French ANAES, but these methods have poor sensitivity and specificity. However, DNA HPV testing is more sensitive and has demonstrated a very high negative predictive value, while specificity and positive predictive value remain average. Other HPV markers like genotyping, viral load and integration begin to be used in screening but have not been investigated in CIN2/3 follow-up to assess the values of various HPV markers which predict CIN2/3 recurrence after conization. The primary objective is to describe HPV expression (genotyping, viral load, mRNA E6 and E7) at the time of conization and during the follow-up period (6, 12, 24 months) and to assess the prognostic value of HPV 16 expression (viral load, mRNA E6 and E7) to determine the risk of CIN2/3 recurrence after conization, compared to the other clinical and virological risk factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognostic Value of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Detection in Cervical Intra-epithelial Neoplasia (CIN) Recurrence After Conization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women with CIN3 treated by conization will be consecutively included in this study during 12 months. They will be recruited in the 3 main University Hospitals of South West France (Bordeaux, Toulouse, Limoges) and followed-up for 24 months. Colposcopy (+/- biopsies), cytology, and virology tests will be performed at the time of conization and during the follow-up period (6, 12, 24 months). HPV expression will be assessed by centralized validated marketed tests (Hybrid Capture 2, RLA genotyping, PreTectÂ® HPV-Proofer) and by a real time PCR measuring E2, E6 and E7 viral load of HPV 1.</detailed_description>
