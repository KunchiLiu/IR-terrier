	<criteria>1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document (ICD) indicating that the subject (or a legal representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study. 2. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. 3. Subjects who completed a primary study and received all the scheduled injections within the originally planned schedule, either with bivalent rLP2086 (either 2 or 3 doses) or with investigational product in cases where subject vaccine assignment is blinded at the time of consent for study B1971033. 4. Subjects who completed the blood draw following the last vaccination and subjects who completed the 6month followup telephone call in the primary study. 1. Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the trial and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the trial. 2. With the exception of the primary study of bivalent rLP2086, participation in other studies within the 1month (30day) period before study Visit 1 and/or during study participation. Participation in purely observational studies is permitted. 3. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. 4. History of cultureproven disease caused by N meningitidis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. 5. Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would contraindicate blood draw. 6. Receipt of any blood products, including gamma globulin, in the period from 6 months before any study visit. 7. Vaccination with any licensed or experimental meningococcal serogroup B vaccine since being enrolled in the primary Pfizersponsored MnB study (other than study vaccines permitted in the primary study). 8. Subjects who were not compliant with primary study eligibility criteria while enrolled in the primary study.</criteria>
