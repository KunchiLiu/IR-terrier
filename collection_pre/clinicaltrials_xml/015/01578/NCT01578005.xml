	<brief_summary>Coronary angioplasty is rather frequently performed in such situations, presumably because, changes in the atherosclerotic plaque under drug treatment, have remained poorly described so far. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) enables a precise description of coronary atheroma, better than the one provided by coronary angiography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IVUS Assessment of Atheroma Burden After Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to current guidelines, patients with coronary lesions with stenosis &lt;70% should receive optimal secondary prevention drug treatment without angioplasty, even after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Nevertheless, coronary angioplasty is rather frequently performed in such situations, presumably because, changes in the atherosclerotic plaque under drug treatment, have remained poorly described so far. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) enables a precise description of coronary atheroma, better than the one provided by coronary angiography.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>adult patients hospitalized for ACS, for whom the target lesion has less than 70% stenosis and not treated with coronary angioplasty. Patients presenting with a target lesion with â‰¥70% stenosis ; Patients for whom the target lesion is treated with coronary angioplasty ; Interventions: A first IVUS will be performed after the acute coronary event (baseline) and will be done again oneyear after to assess changes in the atherosclerotic plaques.</criteria>
