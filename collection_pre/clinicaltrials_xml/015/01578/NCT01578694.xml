	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the best ways to image articular cartilage. One of the techniques which has shown great promise is the imaging technique called T1ρ (T1-rho). T1ρ is a modified pulse sequence from the standard T1 sequence used in the clinical MRI. Because the initial phases of arthritis occur at the molecular level, the main advantage of the T1ρ pulse sequence is that it is sensitive to proteoglycan. Proteoglycan is a molecule that is important to cartilage structure, and is lost as osteoarthritis develops. If we can show that this non-invasive tool can accurately assess cartilage damage and levels of proteoglycan, the clinical applications are numerous. The results can potentially help determine optimal surgical techniques and timing of surgical intervention to halt or slow the progression of arthritis, and will assist in the study of the effects of FAI and the success of the surgery performed to correct FAI.</brief_summary>
