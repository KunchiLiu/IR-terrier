The following are considered effective means of contraception : surgical sterilization or use of oral contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel, an IUD, or contraceptive hormone implant or patch A recent history of smoking (within 1 year of study enrollment) Prior treatment with intravitreal aflibercept injection Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as IOP greater or equal to 30 mmHg despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication) History of cerebral vascular accident, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks within 3 months of study enrollment Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either eye Presence of significant subfoveal fibrosis or atrophy Intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) in the study eye within 2 months of enrollment Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye History of allergy to fluorescein, ICG or iodine, not amendable to treatment Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (e.g., cataract or diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either Require medical or surgical intervention during the 12 month study period to prevent or treat visual loss that might result from that condition, or If allowed to progress untreated, could likely contribute to loss of at least 2 snellen equivalent lines of BCVA over the 12 month study period Prior/Concomitant Treatment: Panretinal photocoagulation treatment Previous intraocular steroids or PDT within 3 months Previous participation in any studies of investigational drugs within 30 days preceding Day 0 (excluding vitamins and minerals) Previous treatment with intravitreally (in either eye) or intravenously administered Avastin (bevacizumab) within 60 days Previous use of Macugen or Lucentis in study eye within 60 days Prior submacular or vitreous surgery</criteria>
