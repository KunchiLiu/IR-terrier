	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to validate the efficacy of Noxipoint(TM) therapy on chronic pain, and compare it with standard physical therapy using electrical stimulation on patients with chronic pain. Invented by Dr. Charlie Koo at Stanford University, Noxipoint Therapy is a specific procedure with precise location, duration and intensity of TENS stimulation within the general FDA guidelines. The therapy substantially relieves general muscular/tendon pain and persistently restores the muscle and tendon function. The surface locations of nociceptors at the free nerve ending (i.e., "Noxipoints") are focused on in the stimulation therapy. Multiple clinical uses of Noxipoint Therapy confirmed the consistent efficacy of such stimulation at Noxipoints. An observational study of Noxipoint therapy within the FDA-approved use of TENS demonstrated an encouraging 93% success rate in eliminating the chronic pain, such as frozen shoulder pain, within 2-3 sessions. It is an order-of-magnitude improvement over the non-specific application of TENS and any other modalities in pain treatment. A unique neuro-immuno-signaling pathway that implicates the activation of adult stem cells, such as satellite cells in muscles, is implicated based on such a high success rate.</brief_summary>
