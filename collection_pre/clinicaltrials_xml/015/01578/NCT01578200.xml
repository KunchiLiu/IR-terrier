	<brief_title>Outcome Study of Lanthanum Carbonate Compared With Calcium Carbonate in Hemodialysis Patients : Landmark Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated serum phosphate and calcium in dialysis patients are independently associated with increased risk of arterial calcification and mortality. Calcium-based phosphate binders can induce hypercalcaemia and are associated with progression of vascular calcification. A recent randomized study demonstrated that sevelamer, a non-calcium-based phosphate binders, reduced mortality in elderly hemodialysis patients compared with calcium-based phosphate binders. Lanthanum carbonate is another efficacious and well-tolerated non-calcium phosphate binder. A post-hoc survival analysis of lanthanum carbonate versus standard therapy suggested a survival benefit of lanthanum carbonate treatment for elderly patients.</detailed_description>
