	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The use of parent education and medical play will be able to reduce patient discomfort with potential uncomfortable medical procedures. Children that have urinary tract infections and those diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux undergo a procedure called a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to identify and follow vesicoureteral reflux. For many children and parents this can lead to considerable distress. Pre-procedure preparation can potentially reduce anxiety and improve overall experience with the procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parent Education and Medical Play: A Comparison of Psychological Preparation Strategies for Voiding Cystourethrogram</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children that are evaluated medically and found to need a VCUG would be eligible for participation in this study. Children would be randomized to having play therapy or a parental education brochure. The study would have no impact on the child recieving the state of the art medical care. Play therapy involves having the child play through the process of the study with a child life therapist, in an effort to prepare the child for the procedure. Parents/patients will be given a pre and post procedure evaluation form to objectively categorize the parental/patient perception of the experience with the study.</detailed_description>
