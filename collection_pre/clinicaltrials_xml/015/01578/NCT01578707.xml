	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether treatment with ibrutinib as a monotherapy results in a clinically significant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) as compared to treatment with ofatumumab in patients with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) Versus Ofatumumab in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study PCYC-1112-CA is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) versus Ofatumumab in patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. Patients randomized to the ofatumumab arm may be considered to receive next subsequent therapy with ibrutinib.</detailed_description>
