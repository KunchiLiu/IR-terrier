	<brief_title>Erlotinib Plus Pemetrexed to Treat Lung Adenocarcinoma With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of death in the world. Brain metastases are a frequent complication of NSCLC, especially in lung adenocarcinoma. 30-50% or more these patients will develop brain metastases at first time or during the treatment. Limited treatment options, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) combined with or without stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as the primary treatment approach, are available for brain metastases patients with poor survival. So the availability of effective therapies are therefore of great importance. Currently, two agents (erlotinib and pemetrexed) are reported more effective in lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases. The heterogeneity of NSCLC tumors provides a strong rationale for using combination therapy with targeted agents that have different mechanisms of action, moreover different combination offering synergistic effects. So we investigate if erlotinib plus pemetrexed, cisplatin are effective and safe in treating lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastases.</detailed_description>
