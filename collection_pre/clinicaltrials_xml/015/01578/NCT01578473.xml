	<brief_summary>Two recent studies have identified low levels of serum testosterone in association with Peyronie's Disease (PD), with a significant correlation noted between severity of testosterone deficiency and severity of curvature. The study hypothesis is to determine whether treatment with testosterone may help men with PD and penile curvature.</brief_summary>
