	<brief_summary>Trial with medicinal products Recent studies revealed that radiation-based procedures in patients may lead to DNA double-strand breaks in human blood lymphocytes. Additionally, ex vivo studies with human blood lymphocytes have shown a protective effect of antioxidant agents which have been described to decrease the number of DNA double-strand breaks. This study represents a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, single center, and placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial which analyzes the capability of antioxidant agents to decrease the number of DNA double-strand breaks in human blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing radiation-based cardiac examinations (30 patients with high-dose radiation exposure, 30 patients with low-dose radiation exposure, and 30 subjects without radiation exposure). A protective effect of antioxidant drugs in patients undergoing radiation-based examinations could therefore change patient management and would provide an important clinical impact.</brief_summary>
