	<brief_summary>The ELTGOL technique improves mucociliary clearance in adult patients with bronchiectasis. Primary objective: -To evaluate the efficacy of ELTGOL in stable state patients with bronchiectasis compared to placebo. Secondary objectives: - To evaluate the level of knowledge of airway clearance techniques and adherence to them in patients with bronchiectasis. - To assess the side effects during the procedure: oxygen desaturation, increased dyspnea and hemoptysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ELTGOL and Bronchiectasis. Respiratory Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of bronchiectasis has increased in recent years resulting in greater costs, including periods of hospitalisation and the prescription of drugs. The mucociliary clearance mechanism is impaired in these patients, and chest physiotherapy has been recommended for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic productive cough and/or evidence of mucus plugging on HRCT. However, to date, there is insufficient evidence of benefits of chest physiotherapy through randomised controlled trials. Furthermore it rests unclear the most effective technique, the frequency and optimum duration of the RP and the most suitable variables to monitor. A multicenter clinical trial into the efficacy of one chest physiotherapy technique in airway clearance will fill this important "gap" in the scientific evidence.</detailed_description>
