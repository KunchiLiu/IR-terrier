	<brief_title>Feasibility Study for Evaluating the Effect of Electrical Stimulation on Lower Esophageal Sphincter Pressure and Esophageal Acid Exposure in Patients With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EndoStim is developing an investigational medical device specifically designed to deliver electrical stimulation to the LES and has completed two clinical feasibility studies using the EndoStim stimulation system in fifteen subjects. Acute electrical stimulation resulted in significant LES pressure with no adverse effects reported. Results of these studies are promising and warrant additional clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness of EndoStim stimulation system to treat GERD over time. In this study, EndoStim proposes using a fully implantable system. Results of this study are expected to provide confirmation of safety of long-term LES stimulation and may provide long term clinical benefit for GERD patients.</detailed_description>
