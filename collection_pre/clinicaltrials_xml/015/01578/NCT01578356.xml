	<brief_summary>For primary surgical treatment of prostate cancer the investigators compare the classic open surgery (radical retropubic prostatectomy, RRP) versus robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALP). Oncological results are obtained at standard follow-up consultations through Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) measurement to detect biochemical recurrence. Functional results (continence, potency, quality of life) are obtained through standardised questionnaires. Currently the investigators perform all of their prostatectomies in a robot-assisted manner. For results of the open surgery the investigators send questionnaires to patients who had the operation in the past.</brief_summary>
