	<brief_title>Safety of Mesh Used Repairs in Emergency Abdominal Wall Hernias. Prospective Randomized Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repairing of emergency (strangulated) abdominal wall hernias with mesh is controversary. Strangulated abdominal hernias are not clean surgical wounds so applying prostetic materials such as meshes are problematic. Using of prostetic materials in un-clean wounds (clean contaminated, contaminated and dirty) is not proposed. But in surgical practice meshed surgical repair techniques are using largeley. In this multicenter study we try to find the answer for emergency hernia repairs meshed or not.</detailed_description>
