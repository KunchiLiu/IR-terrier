	<brief_summary>In total hip arthroplasty several approaches can be used. The newly introduced minimally invasive anterior approach is supposed to cause less damage to tendons and muscles. At the same time there are reports that there are more complications when this approach is used. The direct lateral approach is the most used in Norway and is well documented. There are however those who postulate that there is to high risk of damage to the gluteus medius causing Trendelenburg gait. In the investigators hospital both the anterior and direct lateral approach is used with good result. The investigators main study hypothesis is that there is no difference between the use of anterior or direct lateral approach i total hip arthroplasty in regards to postoperative function and pain, complications, radiological finds (X-ray and MRI), markers for muscle damage (i.e CK-total) or other clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
