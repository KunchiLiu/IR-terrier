	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension or openangle glaucoma in at least one eye; On latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% monotherapy (including BAKcontaining generics) for at least 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit, but would benefit from a switch to TRAVATAN速 BAKfree because of tolerability issues, in the opinion of the investigator; Intraocular pressure (IOP) &lt;30 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) in both eyes while on latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% monotherapy; IOP considered to be safe (in the opinion of the investigator), in both eyes, in such a way that assured clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study period; Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular hypotensive medications prior to receiving the study medication for the entire course of the study; Able to follow instructions and willing and able to attend all study visits; Best corrected Snellen visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200; 1.0 LogMAR) or better in each eye; Must sign an informed consent form; Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor tolerance to any component of the preparations to be used in this study deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal Investigator; Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in either eye; Corneal dystrophies in either eye; Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either eye; Any clinically significant, serious, or severe medical condition; Use of any systemic medications known to affect IOP which have not been on a stable course for at least 7 days prior to the Screening Visit or an anticipated change in the dosage during the course of the study; Severe dry eye or keratoconjunctivitis sicca which has been or is currently being treated with the use of punctal plugs, punctal cautery, Restasis速, or topical ocular corticosteroids; Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in either eye less than 3 months prior to the Screening Visit; Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in the study, in the investigator's best judgment; Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause; Women who are pregnant, lactating, or not using reliable means of birth control; Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
