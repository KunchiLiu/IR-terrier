	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the trial is to show that optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology can be used to effectively screen for diseases of the eye including glaucoma, macular diseases and keratoconus. Glaucoma is a disease that causes permanent vision loss and is usually accompanied by increased eye pressure. Macular diseases affect sharp, central vision. Keratoconus is a disease that affects the cornea (clear surface covering the colored part of the eye).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The identification of many eye diseases would significantly benefit from earlier detection than is available with typical eye exams. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technology that can perform non-contact cross-sectional imaging of tissue structure in real time. It is similar to ultrasound B-mode imaging, except that OCT measures the intensity of reflected light rather than sound waves.</detailed_description>
