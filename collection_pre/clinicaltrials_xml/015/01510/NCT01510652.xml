	<brief_summary>This investigation is designed with the hypothesis that using a quadripolar left ventricular lead results in less interventions when dealing with high pacing thresholds and Phrenic Nerve Stimulation (PNS), both at implant and during follow-up, compared to standard bipolar left ventricular leads.</brief_summary>
