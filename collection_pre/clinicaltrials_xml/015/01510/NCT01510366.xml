	<brief_summary>Based on pre-clinical trial and phase 1 and phase 2 clinical data and principle of GCP, the objective of phase Ⅲ clinical trial is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine made from Sabin Strains(Sabin IPV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Trial Protocol for the Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine Made From Sabin Strains(Sabin IPV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Sabin IPV was manufactured with poliovirus type 1, 2, 3 Sabin strains and Vero cells by microcarrier culture in 550 liter bioreactors. The virus suspension was harvested, ultra-concentrated, purified and inactivated with formalin. The D Ag contents of Sabin IPV were type 1 30DU, type 2 32DU, type 3 45DU /0.5ml/per dose. Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine (Salk strains) was manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur D Ag contents /0.5ml/per dose were type 1 40DU, type 2 8DU, type 3 32DU. This is a randomized, blind phase 3 clinical trial. Total 1200 infants (ages 60 days to 90 days) were selected, randomized to two groups (Sabin IPV and Salk IPV, each group n=600), infants in each group will be vaccinated with three doses of either Sabin IPV or Salk IPV respectively, one month apart.</detailed_description>
