	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers in Samples From Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To establish telomere length measurement by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) detection method in neuroblastoma (NB). - To determine the frequency of ALT in high-risk NB and the characteristics of ALT+ NB. - To establish C-circle (extra-chromosomal telomeric DNA circles) level as a marker of ALT activity in NB. - To evaluate the prognostic significance of ALT in NB. - To evaluate the utility of the C-circle assay for the detection of circulating tumor DNA in NB patients with an ALT+ tumor. OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue and serum samples are analyzed for telomere length measurement, frequency, and C-circle levels by PCR. Results are then compared with patients' age at diagnosis and outcomes including survival data (event-free and overall survival).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Snapfrozen neuroblastoma (NB) tumors collected at diagnosis (Objectives 1 to 3) Highrisk stage 3 or 4 NB AND MYCN nonamplified, i.e., exclude stage 4 infants who are not highrisk Up to five highrisk (&gt; 18 months, unfavorable histology) stage 3/MYCN nonamplified tumors Patients preferably treated on protocol COGA3973 or similar protocols with myeloablative therapy At least 3 years of followup for those with no event (current evidence suggests that ALT+ NBs often relapse late, i.e., 2 years or longer from diagnosis) NB tumor DNA collected at diagnosis (Objectives 2 &amp; 3) Highrisk stage 3 or 4 NB as for Objective 1, except for MYCN status Stage 4 tumors are preferred; may include up to seven highrisk stage 3 tumors with similar distribution of MYCNamplified and nonamplified tumors Frozen serum from NB patients (Objective 5; 2nd stage of project) Paired serum obtained at diagnosis from patients with ALT+ or ALT tumors identified in Objective 2 PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics</criteria>
