	<brief_summary>In order to meet an existing lack of empirical studies in the field of cognitive behavioral therapy supervision, the present randomized controlled trial is aimed at comparing two different types of supervision. This study compares computer-assisted live supervision and delayed video-based supervision regarding efficacy and acceptance among therapists, patients and supervisors. The efficacy of supervision is defined on different levels such as change of psychotherapeutic competence, nondisclosure, self-efficacy, self-awareness of the supervisee as well as therapeutic alliance, supervisory alliance and therapy outcome.</brief_summary>
