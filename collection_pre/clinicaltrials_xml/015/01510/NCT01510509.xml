	<brief_summary>Even though the safety of drug eluting stents has been long established, in roughly 25% o patients their implantation is not considered, for specifically clinical reasons (chronic anticoagulation, bleeding, etc…), which make prolonged use of clopidogrel unsuitable. A considerable percentage of these patients have diabetes mellitus, a well known risk factor for stent thrombosis. Recently, the special characteristics of the titanium stent with nitric oxide have been described, causing it to be considered as a bioactive stent. The TITANIC-XV trial was a prospective randomized multi-center active-treatment-controlled clinical trial, with the chief aim to evaluate clinical outcome after titanium bare metal stent (Titan2®, Hexacath, Paris, France) implantation as compared with everolimus drug eluting stent (Xience-V®, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California, USA) in diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</brief_summary>
