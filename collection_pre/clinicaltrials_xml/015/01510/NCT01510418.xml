	<brief_summary>The goal of this pilot study is to understand the socialization of adult men with hemophilia living in the United States and their quality of life in order to improve comprehensive care for persons with congenital bleeding disorders. Studies in Europe suggest that despite medical, surgical, and biotechnology advances in care for persons with the congenital bleeding disorders hemophilia A and B, men with hemophilia have earlier work disability and health-related lower quality of life than men of the same age who do not have hemophilia in the general population. Congenital bleeding disorders are known to have medical and psychosocial impact not only in school but also in other activities, e.g. participation in sports beginning at a young age. The psychosocial impact of living with a congenital bleeding disorder has been studied and described in childhood. The support relationships in childhood include parents and primary family of origin and these supports are generally considered in pediatric comprehensive care models. Support relationships in adulthood have not been well described or studied. The role of spouse and significant others (SSO) of PWCBD in health care is of interest for the delivery of adult comprehensive care as well as to understand their contribution to the health-related quality of life of PWCBD. Additionally, this study seeks to learn of the impact of congenital bleeding disorders for the SSO. The study uses self-reported medical and social information questionnaires, health-related quality of life surveys, and confidential interview. Results of this study may guide how comprehensive care and support are provided to adult persons with congenital bleeding disorders by hemophilia treatment programs. This study focuses on PWCBD with hemophilia A or B as a model for the experience of persons with other congenital bleeding disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Socialization of Adult Men With Congenital Hemophilia A or B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two groups (cohorts) in this study. One group is adult men with congenital hemophilia A or B who qualify for the study. The other group is their spouse or significant other (SSO) who are voluntarily identified by the person with congenital bleeding disorder for recruitment into the study. For the adult men with congenital hemophilia A or B, the study involves a minimum of 2 visits and includes screening, medical history and physical exam review, completing confidential questionnaires and interview. Eligible men with congenital hemophilia A or B (person with congenital bleeding disorder, PWCBD) are given the option to permit the investigator to contact their spouse or significant other (SSO) for participation in the study. If PWCBD has an SSO, the SSO is not required to participate in the study. Spouse/significant other(SSO)of men with congenital hemophilia A or B may enter the study only if they have been voluntarily identified by their partner (PWCBD) and their partner has opted to allow investigator to contact them. For the SSO who chooses to participate in the study, the study will involve a minimum of one visit and includes completing confidential questionnaires and interview. All participation including questionnaires and interview information collected is confidential and protected by health privacy information laws and records are de-identified. The study is sponsored by a grant from The National Hemophilia Foundation.</detailed_description>
