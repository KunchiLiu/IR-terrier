	<brief_summary>The long-term goal of the investigators study is to develop a better and safer treatment for, and to potentially cure patients with single or multiple food allergies. The investigators hypothesize that the application of this protocol will allow patients with severe and single or multiple food allergies to be safely and rapidly desensitized.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Moderate to severe peanut and/or egg and/or milk and/or tree nut and/or seed allergic subjects between the ages of 4 to 55 years old. Sensitivity to food allergen will be documented by a positive skin prick test result or allergenspecific ImmunoCAP IgE level, with 7 kU/L as a lower limit of eligibility. No absolute contraindications are known. However, the risk of serious systemic anaphylactic reactions to food allergens suggests a number of preexisting conditions that should be considered relative contraindications. Among those conditions are acute infections, autoimmune disease, severe cardiac disease, and treatment with betaadrenergic antagonistic drugs (betablockers). Subjects with a total IgE at screening of &gt;2,000 kU/L Previous reaction to omalizumab Subjects having a history of severe anaphylaxis to food allergens that will be desensitized in this study requiring intubation or admission to an ICU, frequent allergic or nonallergic urticaria, or history consistent with poorly controlled persistent asthma.</criteria>
