	<brief_summary>This is a single center prospective study of 30 patients undergoing elective heart bypass surgery (CABG) with at least two vein grafts from the leg (SVG). The purpose of this ex vivo study is to evaluate the function of vein grafts from small tissue samples treated with a pressure syringe and a non-pressure syringe. Syringes are routinely used to flush out the veins in preparation of bypass grafting. It is unknown if different levels of pressure in the syringe affect the vein or damage the vein. Small sections of tissue samples which are normally discarded will be obtained immediately after retrieval from the leg and before grafting to the heart. Tissue samples will be taken to the laboratory for study. There are no clinical endpoints in this study, however, clinical information will be obtained from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database and will include demographics, risk factors, and perioperative outcomes.</brief_summary>
