	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory trial with two cross-over arms investigating pharmacokinetic profiles of endogenous and exogenous insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated with continuous subcutaneous Insulin Aspart infusion and combined with or without intravenous glucose infusion. The order of treatment session will be randomised. Hypotheses: 1. Secretion of endogenous insulin depends on exogenous insulin supply 2. Secretion of endogenous insulin is depends on plasma glucose levels</brief_summary>
