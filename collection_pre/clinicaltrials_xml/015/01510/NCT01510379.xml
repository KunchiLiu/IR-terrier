	<brief_summary>The effect a ReletexTM device has on postoperative nausea and vomiting when used with ondansetron after foregut surgery will be studied. A ReletexTM device is a FDA approved wristwatch-like device that painlessly stimulates a nerve in the wrist and has been shown to decrease nausea and vomiting. The investigators will randomize 100 patients who are having a fundoplication for either gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), paraesophageal hernia, or Heller Myotomy for achalasia into two groups. A control group will receive scheduled ondansetron for prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting and phenergan as needed. The treatment group will wear a ReletexTM wrist band after surgery for 7 days. These patients will also get scheduled ondansetron and phenergan as needed, like the control group. The investigators will compare nausea, retching, and the amount of supplemental nausea medication used between the two groups. The patients will be provided a diary to document their nausea, retching, and medication use. The hypothesis of this study is that use of the ReletexTM device will reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting, and will reduce post-operative use of anti-emetic medications in patients who have undergone foregut surgery.</brief_summary>
