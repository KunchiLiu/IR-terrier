	<brief_summary>In a rehabilitation setting, respiratory muscle training with re-expansion techniques in patients following cardio-thoracic surgery represents a consolidated intervention. New devices called RESPILIFT速 and RESPIVOl速 improve deep inspiration and pulmonary volume with an effect on respiratory muscle performance and perceived dispnoea. The aim of the investigators study is to test the clinical efficacy of RESPILIFT速 and RESPIVOl速 in patients with a recent history of cardio-thoracic surgery.</brief_summary>
