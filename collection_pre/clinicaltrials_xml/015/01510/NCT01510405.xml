	<brief_summary>The investigators have characterized in preclinical Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) models the proteomic expression profile associated with exposure to Aurora and Polo-like kinase inhibitors. The identification of proteomic expression patterns in patients with NSCLC would be an important step in defining the possible role of these agents as potential targeted therapies for this clinically important disease. This study proposes to evaluate resected non-small cell lung cancer specimens for these proteomic expression profiles.</brief_summary>
