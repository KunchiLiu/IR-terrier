	<brief_summary>Ipilimumab, an antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, and GVAX have demonstrated anti-tumor activity in prostate cancer. Pre-clinical studies with this combination have demonstrated potent synergy. The purpose of this study is to investigate, using a phase-I 3+3 dose escalation design followed by an expansion cohort, the safety and efficacy of combined treatment with GVAX and ipilimumab in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Trial of Ipilimumab and GVAX in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A promising immunotherapeutic approach in prostate cancer is whole-cell vaccination. Irradiated allogeneic tumor cells expressing GM-CSF generate a long-lasting and specific anti-tumor immunity in preclinical models. Results from several phase I and II trials showed Prostate GVAX (GVAX) to be well tolerated and suggested improved survival. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a crucial immune checkpoint molecule that down-regulates T-cell activation and proliferation. Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that blocks CTLA-4, promotes antitumor immunity, and has been demonstrated in two phase III trials to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients. Pre-clinical studies of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody in combination with GM-CSF secreting tumor cell vaccines demonstrated a potent synergy. In this phase I study the investigators examine in CRPC patients whether ipilimumab can be safely combined with GVAX. In addition, the investigators will treat an additional 16 patients at a dose level of 3â€¢0 mg/kg to determine the safety profile and antitumor effects of GVAX and ipilimumab in patients with CRPC.</detailed_description>
