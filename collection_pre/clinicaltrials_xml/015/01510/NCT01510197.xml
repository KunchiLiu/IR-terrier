	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the risk profile in patients with atrial fibrillation, which represents the degree of changes (remodeling) in the atrial tissue and which can help to predict in which patients rhythm control will be successful. This risk profile will consist of a combination of underlying (heart) disease and risk factors, as measured with use of parameters obtained with echocardiography, circulating biomarkers and other relevant clinical data. Ultimately this risk profile can be used to guide type of (rhythm) control therapy in individual patients with atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Profile for Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality.Identification of patients with AF that is difficult to treat may improve the outcome of rhythm control therapy. Left atrial size or volume could be a useful tool to select patients that will benefit from rhythm control therapy.Beside echocardiographic parameters,atrial fibrillation has been also associated with circulating biomarkers in blood like collagen metabolism, inflammatory mediators,neurohumoral factors and proteins/proteomic profiles. Beside more accepted risk factors (myocardial ischemia, diabetes and pulmonary disease)other less well-known clinical factors (sleep apnea, alcohol or other intoxication abuse, excessive physical activity, esophageal problems and increased body mass index) may also predict the outcome of rhythm control.It seems also plausible that recurrent atrial fibrillation within one month after start of rhythm control is associated with a different risk profile than late atrial fibrillation recurrences.During this study we will try to identify patients with atrial fibrillation who are more or less likely to respond to rhythm control therapy.</detailed_description>
