	<brief_title>The Effect of Three Different Dietary Messages on Dietary Intake and Health in Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this pilot study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial examining three dietary messages: increase fruits and vegetables [INCREASE], decrease energy-dense, non-nutrient dense snack foods [DECREASE], or increase fruits and vegetables plus decrease snack foods [INCREASE+DECREASE], within a 6-month, family-based obesity prevention intervention. Each condition will also focus on increasing family evening meals and physical activity. Primary hypotheses are: 1) INCREASE + DECREASE will consume a greater ratio of F&amp;Vs:SFs than INCREASE and DECREASE at 6 months. 2)INCREASE + DECREASE will consume less energy than INCREASE and DECREASE at 6 months.</detailed_description>
