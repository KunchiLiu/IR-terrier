	<brief_summary>The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE) database, established in 2006, is a multi-site database between the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence and Clinical Severity of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The database has yielded valuable information and clinical insights into the pathophysiology, disease processes, treatments and quality of life associated with CLE. The CLE database incorporates the CLASI (Cutaneous Lupus Activity and Severity Index), a validated outcome measure of disease responsiveness in patients and other assessment tools, surveys and patient information to help validate the clinical course and quality of life of patients with CLE (cutaneous lupus erythematosus). The CLE database has led to publication of significant studies on lupus and its clinical course, the effect of lupus on Quality of Life (QoL), including the effect of photosensitivity on QoL, and the effect of first line medications. The CLE database is an ongoing resource that enables clinicians to evaluate the evolving clinical changes, treatment modalities and patient response to a challenging disease.</detailed_description>
