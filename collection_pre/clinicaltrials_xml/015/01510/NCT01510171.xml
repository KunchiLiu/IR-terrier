	<brief_summary>The aim of the RAPID study is to assess the rapid onset of action of the 2 novel oral antiplatelet agents, Prasugrel and Ticagrelor, in 50 patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI with bivalirudin monotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Activity of Platelet Inhibitor Drugs Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty consecutive patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI with bivalirudin (GP IIb/IIIa not allowed ) will be randomized to receive 60 mg Prasugrel loading dose (n= 25) or 180 Ticagrelor loading dose (n= 25) before PPCI. The loading dose will be performed as soon as possible in the Emergency Room or in the Cath Lab. In the case of vomit in the 2 hours after drug loading dose a new loading dose will be administered. All interventions will be performed by the femoral approach according to current standards. The use of thrombectomy before infarct-related artery stenting, of everolimus eluting stent and of closure devices will be strongly encouraged. Bivalirudin will be administered as a bolus 0.75 mg/kg followed by 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion during PCI. After PCI a reduced bivalirudin infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h for 4 hours will be allowed. Dual antiplatelet therapy (100 mg aspirin associated with 5 or 10 mg Prasugrel or 180 mg Ticagrelor) will be recommended for 12 months. Residual platelet reactivity will be assessed in all patients at baseline (time of loading dose), and after 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours by a point-of-care test VerifyNow bedside available in the Intensive cardiac care Unit. High residual platelet reactivity will be defined as a Platelet Reactivity Units (PRU) &gt; 240 by VerifyNow. At the same time point, Activated Clotting Time (ACT) will be also assessed. Follow-up will be performed by outpatient visits or telephone interviews at 6 months.</detailed_description>
