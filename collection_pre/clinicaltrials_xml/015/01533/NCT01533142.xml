	<detailed_description>Primary endpoints for the study are weight loss and self-reported quality of life (QoL) evaluated by Short Form (SF)-36 and Impact of Weight Wed Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite)) Our hypothesis is that patients operated with RYGBP (Roux A-Y Gastric Bypass) and BPD / DS (biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch) have the same weight and same QoL after 5 years of follow-up as patients treated with gastric sleeve (laparoscopic gastric sleeve (LSG)) We will also compare the groups with respect to a number of secondary endpoints 400 patients (approximately 100 patients / institution) will be included in the main study. Some of the programs that run on secondary endpoints will be conducted separately under study at each hospital. These studies will be reported in separate articles.</detailed_description>
