	<brief_summary>Objective: The objective of this research was to compare the effect of a single session supragingival scaling in a group of pregnant women with periodontal disease with a group that received supra and subgingival scaling. Methods: The investigators included 34 pregnant women between 15 and 43 who had at least 4 teeth with probing depth ≥ 4 mm or clinical attachment loss ≥ 3 mm, with bleeding on probing in the same place. Women were divided into two groups, the group 1 received supra and subgingival scaling associated with oral hygiene orientation (OHO) and the group 2 received only supragingival scaling with OHO too.</brief_summary>
