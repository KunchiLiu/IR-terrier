	<brief_summary>Sutures are an integral part of surgery and available materials are diverse, as are the options for post-procedure care. Both saline and hydrogen peroxide are commonly used cleansing agents. This study aims to compare the effect of saline and hydrogen peroxide on the tensile strength of 4-0 nylon sutures following removal from a cutaneous surgical wound.</brief_summary>
