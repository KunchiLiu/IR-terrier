	<brief_summary>S-1 is a new chemotherapy drug. Some phase II trials showed S-1 is effective in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). S-1 combined with calcium folinate (SL) showed very good efficiency and safety in colorectal cancer (CRC). The short duration (two weekly regimen) is better than common course 4 week regimen in tolerance. So the investigators want to examine the efficiency and safety of SL one week on and one week off regimen in HCC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>S-1 is a new chemotherapy drug. Some phase II trials showed S-1 is effective in HCC. S-1 combined with calcium folinate (SL) showed very good efficiency and safety in CRC. The short duration (two weekly regimen) is better than common course 4 week regimen in tolerance. So the investigators want to examine the efficiency and safety of SL one week on and one week off regimen in HCC. SL one week on and one week off regimen will be give to advanced HCC patients. The primary endpoint is durable complete response (DCR).</detailed_description>
