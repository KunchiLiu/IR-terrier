	<brief_summary>The aim of the current report is to investigate the feasibility of transferring the free dorsal digital flap, including both dorsal branches of the proper digital nerves (PDNs), to reconstruct the volar soft tissue defect of digits. Sensory restoration of the reconstructed digit was evaluated via static two-point discrimination (2PD). The range of motion (ROM) of the donor middle and ring fingers was measured.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sensory restoration of the reconstructed digit was evaluated via static two-point discrimination (2PD). The range of motion (ROM) of the donor middle and ring fingers was measured. The data were compared with those of the contralateral, uninjured hand.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. soft tissue defects in the fingertip, pulp, or volar surface of the digits; 2. a defect &gt; 2 cm in length; 3. unavailability of the homodigital and heterodigital island flaps because of concomitant injuries to donor fingers; and 4. the patient refuses to use tissues from the toe. 1. soft tissue defects in the dorsum of the digits; 2. a defect &lt; 2 cm in length; 3. homodigital and heterodigital island flaps are available.</criteria>
