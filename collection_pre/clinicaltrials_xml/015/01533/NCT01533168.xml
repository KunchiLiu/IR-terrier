	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Testing for minimal residual disease in cell samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia may help doctors plan better treatment. PURPOSE: This research trial studies a genetic test in identifying previously undetectable minimal residual disease in cell samples from younger patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Test To Identify Previously Undetectable Minimal Residual Disease in Cell Samples From Younger Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify and characterize changes in clonal populations of B cells in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis and Day 29 of induction. - To define the ability of this technology to reclassify patients as minimal residual disease (MRD) positive at Day 29 of induction. - To determine whether more sensitive detection of MRD at Day 29 would have clinical prognostic value in children with ALL. OUTLINE: DNA extracted from diagnostic cells are analyzed for immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region by next-generation sequencing.</detailed_description>
