	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Solifenacin With or Without Tamsulosin in Adult Women With Overactive Bladder (OAB)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder (OAB) describes the symptom complex of urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. The lower urinary tract is innervated by both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous system, that act via muscarinic and adrenergic receptors, respectively. Antimuscarinics are mainly used for the treatment of patients with OAB, especially women. Other than antimuscarinics, a1-blockers have been shown in several clinical reports to be useful in treating DO caused by neurological diseases.</detailed_description>
