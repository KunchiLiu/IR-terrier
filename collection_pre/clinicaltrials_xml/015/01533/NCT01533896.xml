	<brief_summary>Parents should receive anticipatory guidance about obesity prevention as part of the routine well child visit. Educational resources are needed to help physicians routinely provide these important anticipatory guidance messages. In this study, consecutive parents will be exposed to routine anticipatory guidance messages before the well child visit with the physician. After the clinic visit, parents will be invited to participate in a research study to determine if they plan any changes at home. The key research question of this study is: Can a brief multimedia intervention help parents develop plans to help their children have a healthy weight?</brief_summary>
