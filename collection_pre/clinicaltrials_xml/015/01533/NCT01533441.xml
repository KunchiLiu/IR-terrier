	<brief_summary>The objective of the SAFE K study is to demonstrate that in patients treated with the antagonists of vitamin K (VKA), a daily intake of vitamin K2 (75 micrograms/day) as naturally produced by the ferments used in fermented dairy products, does not upset the balance of anticoagulant treatment.Fifty-two patients will be chosen to receive either verum or placebo for four months after a 4-month run-in period.In addition, the study evaluates if regular consumption of vitamin K2 reduce the need of changing the dose of anticoagulation treatment and improve the markers of bone mineralisation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomisation of the study subjects will be done by two randomisation lists depending on whether the dose of VKA is high or low. Randomisation will be balanced and stratified depending on the average dose of VKA before the inclusion in order that each arm would have the same number of patients receiving a dose lower than the used anticoagulant treatments. The level of vitamin K intake will be determined during the study visits using dietary questionnaire.</detailed_description>
