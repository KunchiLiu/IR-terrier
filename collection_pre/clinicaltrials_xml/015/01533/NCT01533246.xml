	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well linsitinib works in treating patients with asymptomatic or mild symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer. Linsitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Linsitinib in Treating Patients With Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression based on Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) criteria. II. To evaluate PSA response (proportion of patients achieving a PSA decline &gt; 50% according to PCWG2 criteria in patients receiving linsitinib [OSI-906]). III. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) in patients with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined measurable disease receiving OSI-906. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effect of OSI-906 on time-to opiate use for cancer pain. II. To evaluate the effect of OSI-906 on radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) of patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (non-opioid requiring) castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). III. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (non-opioid requiring) CRPC receiving OSI-906. IV. To further evaluate the safety of OSI-906 in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (non-opioid requiring) CRPC. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the effects of OSI-906 in the levels of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA), DHEA-sulfate, p insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-IR), and p-insulin receptor (IR). (Exploratory) II. To describe the effects of OSI-906 in the levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (a), and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) as markers of metastatic progression. (Exploratory) III. To describe the effects of OSI-906 on the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and endothelial cells (CECs). (Exploratory) IV. To use ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted from CTCs to evaluate effects on downstream targets of IGF-1R signaling after OSI-906 treatment. (Exploratory) V. To measure the effect of OSI-906 on the expression of IGF-1R on CTCs. (Exploratory) OUTLINE: Patients receive linsitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo serum and plasma sample collection at baseline, on day 1 of courses 2 and 4, and after completion of study treatment for correlative studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

a score of 01 on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)Short Form (SF) Question #3 (worst pain in last 24 hours) will be considered asymptomatic, and a score of 23 will be considered mildly symptomatic Patients who received combined androgen blockade or received secondline antiandrogen in the context of CRPC must have shown PSA progression after discontinuing the antiandrogen prior to enrollment (≥ 4 weeks since last flutamide, ≥ 6 weeks since last bicalutamide or nilutamide) and have progressive disease No patients with known brain metastases Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL independent of transfusion Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL Serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL Serum creatinine &lt;

progressive disease (as defined above) must be documented after discontinuation of the hormonal therapy Patients on stable doses of bisphosphonates that show subsequent tumor progression may continue on this medication at the discretion of the treating physician;
