	<criteria>Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures. Male and female (nonchildbearing potential, nonlactating) healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years inclusive, with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture. Female volunteers must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and at admission, must not be lactating, and must be of nonchildbearing potential. Male volunteers should be willing to use barrier contraception ie, condoms, from the first day of dosing until 3 months after dosing with the IP. The female partner should use contraception during this period. Volunteers must have a BMI between 18 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and weigh at least 50 kg. Any clinically significant disease or disorder (eg, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic, malignant, psychiatric, or major physical impairment), as judged by the Investigator. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma, in the opinion of the Investigator, within 4 weeks of the first administration of IP. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis results as judged by the Investigator. Significant orthostatic reaction at enrollment as judged by the Investigator. Abnormal vital signs, after 10 minutes supine rest as defined in protocol.</criteria>
