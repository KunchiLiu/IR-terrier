	<brief_summary>As a measure of secondary prophylaxis, and with the final objective of avoiding the infection, it has been suggested to use antiretroviral therapy. This is known as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Although there are different recommendations, almost every guideline recommend using 3 drugs as PEP both in USA and Europe. Toxicity is one of the main limitations of PEP. Side effects during PEP are very usual, are attributed mainly to PI and are the main reasons for poor adherence or lost of follow-up. A current standard regimen is AZT+3TC (Combivir®) or tenofovir+emtricitabine (Truvada®) plus the PI lopinavir/r. Toxicity associated with this regimens are high (31-85% of cases), with a 10-35% interruption of PEP Maraviroc, a CCR5 receptor antagonist, very well tolerated, coul be an adequate drug for PEP.</brief_summary>
