	<brief_title>Effects of Juice Plus+® Supplementation on Endothelial Function in Overweight Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of obesity in both adults and children in the United States has increased significantly over the past 50 years. More than 66% of adults in the US are now overweight or obese and at least 17% of children in the population at large are now considered overweight. Obesity may be a factor predisposing patients to a myriad of different comorbidities that increase the associated mortality rate. Several large prospective trials have documented that obesity is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Considering the major metabolic and biochemical changes that occur in obesity, such as atherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic inflammatory and prothrombotic states, obesity plays a role in the pathogenesis of systemic atherosclerosis and its clinical complications. Antioxidants are thought to help preserve the endothelium's capacity to generate NO, which acts to promote vasodilation, stabilize platelets, and promote the anti-inflammatory abilities of the endothelium. Juice Plus+® Capsules containing Orchard, Garden and Vineyard blends are rich in the traditional antioxidants β-carotene, Vitamin E and Vitamin C along with other carotenoids and phytonutrients. There is increasing attention to the possibility that micronutrients may exert health effects in concert. Outcomes in studies of isolated micronutrients, such as vitamin E, have often been often disappointing. Plant-derived micronutrients have the potential to contribute to vascular health by offering the endothelium protection from oxidative stress. Evidence of this anticipated effect would have implications for strategies to prevent or retard cardiovascular disease. Endothelial function testing using high-frequency ultrasound imaging of the brachial artery to assess endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) offers a non-invasive, uniquely valuable means of assessing aggregated influences on cardiac risk by gauging a physiologic response of the vascular endothelium. Proposed, therefore, is a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial of Juice Plus+® on endothelial function in overweight men with central adiposity.</detailed_description>
