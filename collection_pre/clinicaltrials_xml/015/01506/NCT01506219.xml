	<brief_summary>Introduction: Elderly with multiple illnesses represent the fastest growing sector of society and make increasing demands on all sectors of the health care system, particularly in community rehabilitation units due to shorter time of stay in acute care units and hospitals. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of geriatrician-performed comprehensive geriatric assessments and intervention with follow up (CGC) in elderly referred to a rehabilitation unit. Methods: The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Settings: two community care rehabilitation units in Aarhus Municipality, Denmark. Inclusion: elderly aged 65 and older from home or hospital. Exclusion: elderly who received palliative care or had been assessed by a geriatrician during the past month. Intervention: medical history, physical examination, blood tests, medication adjustment and follow up by a geriatrician. Control: standard care with the general practitioners (GPs) as back-up. Hospital contacts (primary outcome), GP contacts, activities of daily living (ADL), physical and cognitive functions, quality of life, institutionalization, medication status, and mortality were assessed at day 30 and 90 after arrival at the rehabilitation unit. preliminary Preliminary results: In total, 370 persons were randomized (184 control/186 intervention group). The mean age was 77.9±7.9/78.3±8.3 years. No difference in mortality was demonstrated. Analyses on hospital contacts, GP contacts, activities of daily living (ADL), physical and cognitive functions, quality of life, institutionalization, medication status are ongoing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A new model of care for elderly referred to community rehabilitation was developed and implemented. The potential benefits of this model will be compared with usual care in a community rehabilitation unit in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial. We hypothesized that the geriatrician-performed CGC in elderly referred to a rehabilitation unit will reduce the hospital contacts by 25 % without increase in mortality and contacts to GPs and home care services. We expect that this model of care will prevent deterioration in ADL, physical and cognitive functioning, and reduce the risk of institutionalization. If the results are positive, community rehabilitation services should change their routines for treatment of this population accordingly.</detailed_description>
