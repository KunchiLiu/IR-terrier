	<brief_summary>Patients who receive tailored navigation (consisting of a letter and patient navigation services) and get screened will be significantly greater than the control group who receives treatment as usual. A majority of patients will opt for Fecal Occult Blood Testing (FOBT)as one of their preferred tests, after undergoing the "Patient Navigator" intervention and that proportion will be significantly greater than the group who opt for FOBT in the control group.</brief_summary>
