	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: Phase A: To confirm the feasibility of paclitaxel administered by intravenous (IV) infusion weekly plus concurrent carboplatin administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection once every 3 weeks (dd-TCip therapy). Phase B: To compare the efficacy and safety of the following two treatment regimens as first-line chemotherapy in women with epithelial ovarian, Fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, multicenter international study. Patient are stratified according to Residual tumor diameter([0cm(No residual)] vs. [0cm＜residual＜1cm] vs. [1cm&lt;residual&lt;2cm] vs. [&gt;2 cm]), FIGO stage(StageII vs. III vs. IV) and institution. Patient randomized to one of the treatment arms described below. RegimenI(Standard treatment: dd-TCiv therapy): Paclitaxel administered by IV infusion weekly plus concurrent carboplatin administered by IV infusion once every 3 weeks RegimenII(Study treatment: dd-TCip therapy): Paclitaxel administered by IV infusion weekly plus concurrent carboplatin administered by IP injection once every 3 weeks The 3-week period (21 days) is 1 cycle. Protocol treatment basically comprises 6 cycles. IDS is allowed to be performed after 3, 4 or 5 cycles of the protocol treatment. In such cases, the protocol treatment must be restarted within 8 weeks after IDS. If IDS is performed, patients can receive up to 3 additional cycles of the protocol treatment after IDS. If interval debulking surgery (IDS) is performed after 3, 4 or 5 cycles, the patients can receive up to 3 additional cycles of the protocol treatment. A total of 6 to 8 cycles will be repeated. The analysis of efficacy will be performed on all randomized subjects in accordance with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. In order to assess the robustness of the results, the same analyses will be done using all randomized subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria. The analysis of safety will be performed on all subjects who have received at least one dose of study treatment.</detailed_description>
