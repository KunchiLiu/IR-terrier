	<brief_summary>The study aims to evaluate whether or not an EEG (a type of brain scan) is useful in diagnosing youth with either ADHD, BPD, ASD. Youth with ADHD, BPD, ASD, and healthy controls (without ADHD, BPD, and ASD) will undergo an EEG, and the results will be analyzed using brain activity flow pattern analysis (BAFPA). Twenty subjects with each disorder and twenty without any of the disorders under study (controls) will be evaluated. All subjects will be comprehensively assessed with structured diagnostic interviews and neuropsychological testing. All EEG analyses will be conducted under blind conditions. Conditional probability and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses will examine the diagnostic utility of the EEG scan, using the clinical diagnosis of ASD as the gold standard.</brief_summary>
