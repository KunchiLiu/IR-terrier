	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to scientifically evaluate two different closure strategies for gastroschisis to determine if there is a difference in the two approaches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Silo Versus Primary Closure for Gastroschisis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that there is no difference between bedside silo placement and operative closure in return of bowel function, ventilator dependence, or length of stay. The primary outcome variable between the two techniques will be length of hospitalization. The likely variables will be length of time to meet discharge criteria, length of hospitalization, time to full feedings, time on mechanical ventilation and total hospital charges.</detailed_description>
