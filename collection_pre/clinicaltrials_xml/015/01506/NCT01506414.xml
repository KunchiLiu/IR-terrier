	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin (rh-TPO) in combination with Rituximab are effective and safe in the management of Steroid-Resistant/Relapsed Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin in Combination With Rituximab in Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rituximab was given intravenously at a dose of 100 mg weekly for 4 consecutive weeks (Day 1, 8, 15, 22). Rh-TPO (TPIAOTM, a product of Sunshine Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, China, approved by China State Food and Drug Administration) was given subcutaneously at a dose of 1.0 μg/kg（300u/kg）for 14 days (Day 1-14). Platelet count (PC) was monitored every three or four days until day 22, followed by tests every week. Platelet transfusion was administered to patients with active bleeding symptoms or to those whose PC&lt;10×10^9/L. Patients were followed for 3 months, and any adverse effects were recorded during the period of treatment and during the follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Meet the diagnostic criteria for immune thrombocytopenia. 2. Untreated hospitalized patients, may be male or female, between the ages of 18 ~ 80 years. 3. To show a platelet count &lt;30×10^9/L, and with bleeding manifestations. 4. Willing and able to sign written informed consent. 1. Received chemotherapy or anticoagulants or other drugs affecting the platelet counts within 3 months before the screening visit. 2. Received secondline ITPspecific treatments (eg, cyclophosphamide, 6mercaptopurine, vincristine, vinblastine, etc) within 3 months before the screening visit. 3. Received highdose steroids or IVIG in the 3 weeks prior to the start of the study. 4. Current HIV infection or hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections. 5. Severe medical condition (lung, hepatic or renal disorder) other than chronic ITP. Unstable or uncontrolled disease or condition related to or impacting cardiac function (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension or cardiac arrhythmia) 6. Female patients who are nursing or pregnant, who may be pregnant, or who contemplate pregnancy during the study period. 7. Have a known diagnosis of other autoimmune diseases, established in the medical history and laboratory findings with positive results for the determination of antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant or direct Coombs test. 8. Patients who are deemed unsuitable for the study by the investigator.</criteria>
