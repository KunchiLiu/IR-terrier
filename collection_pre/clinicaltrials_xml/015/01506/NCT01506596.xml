	<brief_title>Study of Pazopanib in the Treatment of Surgically Unresectable or Metastatic Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, multicenter, prospective, open label, single arm study. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free rate as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines version 1.1 at week 12 after start of treatment. The secondary endpoints include overall progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), duration of response, overall survival (OS), and toxicity assessment through the reporting of adverse events.</detailed_description>

Surgically unresectable or metastatic disease. Any number of prior treatment treatment regimens, including treatment naive subjects. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Measurable or evaluable (nonmeasurable) disease per RECIST guidelines version 1.1. Subjects must have documented disease progression within the past 6 months. Adequate organ system function determined within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 50% of the institutional LLN within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Females must be of either nonchild bearing potential or have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Well differentiated liposarcoma. Prior treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Prior malignancy (Note: subjects who have had another malignancy and have been diseasefree for 3 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible). History or clinical evidence of central nervous system metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, unless previously treated, asymptomatic, and off steroids and antiseizure medication for 6 months prior to first dose of study drug Clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities that may increase the risk for GI bleeding. Clinically significant GI abnormalities that may affect absorption of investigational product. Presence of uncontrolled infection. Corrected QT interval &gt; 480 msecs using Bazett's formula. History of certain cardiovascular conditions within the past 6 months. Poorly controlled hypertension [defined as systolic blood pressure of &gt; or = 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; or = 90 mmHg]. History of cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, or untreated deep vein thrombosis within the past 6 months. Prior major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug and/or presence of any nonhealing wound, fracture, or ulcer. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis. Known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels that increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. Hemoptysis in excess of 2.5 mL within 8 weeks of first dose of study drug. Any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric, or other condition that could interfere with subject's safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to study procedures. Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of prohibited medications for at least 14 days or five halflives of a drug, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study drug and for the duration of study treatment. Radiation therapy, minor surgery, tumor embolization, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy, or hormonal therapy within 14 days or five halflives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug. Administration of any nononcologic investigational drug within 30 days or five halflives (whichever is longer) prior to receiving the first dose of study drug. Any ongoing toxicity from prior anticancer therapy that is &gt; Grade 1 and/or that is progressing in severity, except alopecia. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction to idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically realted to pazopanib or excipients that contraindicates participation.</criteria>
