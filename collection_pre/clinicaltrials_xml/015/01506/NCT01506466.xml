	<brief_summary>Weight variation has been reported as a side effect of chemotherapy treatment in early breast cancer patients. To date, there is growing evidence for an increased risk of relapse and death in these patients who gain or lose weight. However, causes of weight variation during chemotherapy and mechanisms involved in the poor prognosis have been little studied. Thus, the investigators are conducting a prospective study to characterize weight variation in terms of body composition and to identify the mechanisms involved.</brief_summary>
