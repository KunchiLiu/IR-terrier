	<brief_summary>Many patients with celiac disease complain of neurocognitive symptoms such as mental confusion, grogginess, difficulty with concentration and forgetfulness after exposure to gluten. However, there is little data on any possible association between impaired cognitive function and gluten intake in celiac disease. The investigators predict that patients with celiac disease, when exposed to gluten, will experience neurocognitive symptoms such as confusion, forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating. The goals of this study are to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive symptoms after exposure to gluten in patients with celiac disease and to characterize the nature of these symptoms both in terms of their duration and severity.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or female 2. 1850 years of age 3. Celiac Disease Group: Positive small intestinal biopsies meeting Marsh II or III histologic criteria for celiac disease at least six months since the time of study entrance as well as positive IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibody or positive IgA/IgG antiDeamidated Gliadin Peptide (DGP) with normal serum IgA 4. NonCeliac Gluten Sensitive Group: Negative small intestinal biopsies and negative IgA antitissue transglutaminase (tTG) or negative IgA/IgG antiDeamidated Gliadin Peptide (DGP) with normal serum IgA, but with symptomatic response to gluten withdrawal 5. Subject should have well controlled celiac disease and have been on a glutenfree diet for at least six months prior to study enrollment 6. Subject must provide informed consent, as approved by the Institutional Review Board, and agree to complete required study visits, blood work neuropsychological testing and a urine pregnancy test (if applicable). 7. Subject agrees to use appropriate birth control for the duration of the study. 1. Subject has other food intolerances or food allergies (other than gluten) that would interfere with the conduct of the study (e.g. corn starch, soy). 2. Subject has a history of severe, acute symptomatic reactions to sporadic gluten ingestion 3. Subject has any chronic active gastrointestinal disease other than celiac disease (e.g. Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, autoimmune enteropathy, eosinophilic enteritis). 4. Subject should not have daily symptoms concerning for brain fog such as mental confusion or difficulty concentrating, at baseline. 5. Subject has symptomatic neurological or psychiatric disease(s) that would interfere with the conduct of the study. 6. Subject should not have been on corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents in the past 3 months. 7. Significant other comorbidity as determined by the Principal Investigator 8. Subject is deemed inappropriate by the Principal Investigator. 9. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding at time of participation. 10. Subject weighs less than 110 pounds.</criteria>
