	<brief_title>Sublingual Immunotherapy in Children With Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with allergic rhinitis with or without asthma were selected for a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and distributed into three groups: DPT (Dpt allergen extract, n=34), DPT+MRB (Dpt allergen plus mixed respiratory bacterial extracts, n=36), and Placebo (n=32). Clinical evaluation and immunological analyses are being carried out before and after 12 and 18 months of treatment, including rhinitis/asthma symptom and medication scores, skin prick test (SPT) to Dpt, and measurements of Dpt-, Der p 1-, Der p 2-specific serum IgE, IgG4, IgG1 and -specific salivary IgA.</detailed_description>
