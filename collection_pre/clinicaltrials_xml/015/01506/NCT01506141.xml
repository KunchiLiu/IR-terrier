	<brief_summary>Elaprase, a large molecular protein, is not expected to cross the blood brain barrier when administered intravenously. A revised formulation of idursulfase, idursulfase-IT, that differs from that of the intravenous (IV) formulation, Elaprase, has been developed to be suitable for delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via intrathecal administration. This extension study of HGT-HIT-045 is designed to collect long-term safety data in pediatric patients with Hunter syndrome and cognitive impairment who are receiving intrathecal idursulfase-IT and intravenous Elaprase enzyme replacement therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must have completed all study requirements and end of study assessments for study HGTHIT045 prior to enrolling in Study HGTHIT046 and must have no safety or medical issues that contraindicate participation. The patient's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s) must have voluntarily signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee(IEC)approved informed consent form after all relevant aspects of the study have been explained and discussed. Consent of the patient's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s) and the patient's assent, as relevant, must be obtained. That patient has received and tolerated a minimum of 12 months of treatment with weekly IV infusions of Elaprase and has received 80% of the total planned infusions within the last 6 months. Patient has received treatment with any investigational drug (other than idursulfaseIT) or device within 30 days prior to study entry. Patient is unable to comply with the protocol (eg, is unable to return for safety evaluations, or is otherwise unlikely to complete the study) as determined by the investigator. Patient has experienced an adverse reaction to study drug in Study HGTHIT045 that contraindicates further treatment with intrathecal idursulfaseIT. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of idursulfaseIT. For patients who were previously untreated with intrathecal idursulfaseIT in Study HGTHIT045, the patient has an opening CSF pressure upon lumbar puncture that exceeds 30.0 cm H2O</criteria>
