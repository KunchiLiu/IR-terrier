	<brief_summary>During restorative procedures, different isolation methods of the operative field can be used to promote moisture control and retraction of the gingival tissues. The aim of the present clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of two isolation techniques on the clinical performance of Class V restorations, as well on the periodontal conditions of restored sites. Patients presenting at least two noncarious cervical lesions (NCLs) will be enrolled in this study. The NCLs will be randomized into the following groups: (1) isolation performed with rubber dam and gingival retraction clamp and (2) isolation provided with cotton rolls and gingival retraction cord. Both techniques will be used with a saliva suction device. All restorative procedures were performed using a self-etching adhesive system and a nanofilled composite resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. The clinical performance of restorations will be recorded in terms of fracture and retention of restoration, marginal adaptation, marginal staining, postoperative hypersensitivity, and preservation of tooth vitality at 1 week, 6 months, 12, 24 and 72 months after placement. The periodontal condition of restored sites will be evaluated based on the presence of supragingival plaque, gingival marginal bleeding, probing depth, and relative gingival recession.</brief_summary>
