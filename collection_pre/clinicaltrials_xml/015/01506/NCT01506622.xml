	<brief_summary>The occurrence of emergence agitation (EA) in pediatric patients who have received sevoflurane anesthesia is a common postoperative problem. The prevalence of EA varies between 10% to 80% depending on the scoring system for evaluation and the anesthetic technique used. Many authors reported various strategies such as use of sedative premedication, change of maintenance technique of anesthesia, or pharmacological agents administered at the end of anesthesia to reduce the incidence and severity of EA, and to allow a smooth emergence from sevoflurane anesthesia. Among these strategies, the use of pharmacological agents at the end of anesthesia is not affected by anesthetic duration, and may not prolong recovery duration of anesthesia excessively when these agents are administered as subhypnotic or small dose. The typical agents that can be administered in this way are propofol and fentanyl. Previous studies demonstrated that the use of either propofol or fentanyl at the end of anesthesia could reduce the incidence of EA. The purpose of this study is to compare the preventive effect on EA and the characteristics of anesthesia recovery between propofol and fentanyl administered at the end of sevoflurane anesthesia.</brief_summary>
