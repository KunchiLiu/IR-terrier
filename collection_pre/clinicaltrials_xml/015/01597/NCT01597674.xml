	<brief_summary>The objective of the study was to assess whether the tolerance to the effect of YF476 on gastric pH observed with repeated doses in a previous study in healthy volunteers can be avoided by using smaller doses of YF476.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of 5, 10 or 25 mg of YF476 Daily for 14 Days on Stomach Acidity in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>YF476 is a novel, potent and selective gastrin antagonist that inhibits basal and meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion, enhances gastric emptying of a liquid meal and increases lower oesophageal sphincter pressure in animals. In a placebo- and ranitidine-controlled, crossover study in healthy volunteers, single doses of 5, 25 and 100mg of YF476 increased gastric pH; the effect was dose-dependent in magnitude and duration and compared favourably with that of ranitidine 150mg. In a placebo- and omeprazole-controlled, parallel-group study in healthy volunteers, 25 and 100mg of YF476 twice daily for 7 days, did not significantly affect gastric pH unlike omeprazole 20mg daily for 7 days. YF476 and omeprazole both increased plasma gastrin concentrations. Single and repeated doses of YF476 were well tolerated.</detailed_description>
