	<brief_title>Effect of Antioxidant Cocktail in Beta-thalassemia/Hb E Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 cases of beta-thalassemia/Hb E patients. All patients will be diagnosed with hemoglobin typing of beta-thalassemia/Hb E disease and not receive blood transfusion or any treatment at least 3 months prior study. The study will be randomized controlled trial that designed before and after treatment with antioxidant cocktail. The antioxidant cocktail consists of vitamin E 400 IU/day, curcuminoids 500 mg/day, N-acetylcysteine 200 mg/day and deferiprone 50 mg/kg/day.
