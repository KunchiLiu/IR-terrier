	<brief_summary>Bioequivalence study comparing test Acotral® ezetimibe 10 mg tablet manufactured by Laboratorios Phoenix, with a reference comparator Zetia® ezetimibe 10 mg tablet of Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals. The CRO Clinigene Bangalore, will conduct the study. Fifty two healthy adult subjects who have satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and given their informed consent will be entered into the study. They will be fasted and receive one tablet by mouth in accordance with a randomisation list and blood samples will be taken at specified intervals over the ensuing 3 days. Between 14 and 21 days later, subjects will receive the opposite tablet and the clinical process repeated. Subjects will be continuously monitored while in the trial clinic and at ambulatory visits with regular measurements of vital signs and questioned for adverse events. Drug concentrations will be analysed and these results compared to ascertain bioequivalence by applying statistical methods to the pharmacokinetic data; this information and all safety data will be formally reported.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acotral® Versus Zetia® Ezetimibe Bioequivalance Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, balanced, open label, crossover, two period, two treatment, two sequence, single dose bioequivalence study comparing test Acotral® ezetimibe 10 mg tablet manufactured by Laboratorios Phoenix, Argentina with a reference comparator Zetia® ezetimibe 10 mg tablet of Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, USA. The CRO Clinigene International Ltd, Bangalore, India will conduct the study. Fifty two healthy male adult subjects who have satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and given their written informed consent will be entered into the study.

Between 14 and 21 days later, subjects will return to the clinic and follow the same procedure to receive the opposite tablet and the clinical process repeated. Subjects will be continuously safety monitored while in the trial clinic and at ambulatory visits with regular measurements of vital signs and questioned for adverse events in accordance with the trial clinic SOPs. Drug concentrations will be analysed and these results compared in accordance with the study protocol to ascertain bioequivalence by applying statistical methods to the pharmacokinetic data; this information and all safety data will be formally reported to GSK.</detailed_description>
