	<brief_title>Full4Health: Understanding Food-gut-brain Axis Across the Lifecourse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Full4Health project aims to further understanding of the mechanisms of hunger and satiety. The proposal integrates investigation of human volunteers and laboratory rodents throughout the life course, applying imaging and other cutting edge technologies to critical research questions. Full4Health will combine study of the mechanisms of hunger and satiety with intervention studies to validate the effects of the relevant food characteristics on the regulation of satiety/hunger. The development of cerebral responses to food through the gut-brain axis across lifespan particularly during childhood, adolescence and elderly will be studied.</detailed_description>
