	<brief_summary>This is a two-arm, open-label, randomised, Phase III study comparing dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and trametinib (GSK1120212) combination therapy to vemurafenib. Subjects with histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma that is either stage IIIc (unresectable) or stage IV, and BRAF V600E/K mutation positive will be screened for eligibility. Subjects who have had prior systemic anti-cancer treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting will not be eligible although prior systemic treatment in the adjuvant setting will be allowed. Approximately 694 subjects will be randomised 1:1 (combination therapy:vemurafenib). The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS) for subjects receiving the combination therapy compared with those receiving vemurafenib.</brief_summary>
