	<brief_summary>Hematopoietic cell transplants (HCT)are one treatment option for people with leukemia or lymphoma. Family members,unrelated donors or banked umbilical cordblood units with similar tissue type can be used for HCT. This study will compare the effectiveness of two new types of bone marrow transplants in people with leukemia or lymphoma: one that uses bone marrow donated from family members with only partially matched bone marrow; and, one that uses two partially matched cord blood units.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Cord Versus Haploidentical (BMT CTN 1101)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) has allowed older and less clinically fit patients to receive potentially curative treatment with allogeneic HCT for high risk or advanced hematological malignancies. Patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling may receive a graft from a suitably HLA-matched unrelated donor. However, up to a third of patients will not have an HLA-matched sibling or a suitably matched adult unrelated donor (i.e., no more than a mismatch at a single locus). Even when a suitably matched unrelated donor is identified, data from the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) indicate that a median of four months is required to complete searches that result in transplantation; thus, some number of patients succumb to their disease while awaiting identification and evaluation of a suitably matched adult unrelated donor. Single or dual center studies have shown that partially HLA-mismatched related bone marrow (haplo-BM) and unrelated double umbilical cord blood (dUCB) are valuable sources of donor cells for RIC HCT, thus extending this treatment modality to patients who lack other donors. In order to study the reproducibility, and thus, the wider applicability of these two alternative donor strategies, The Blood and Marrow Transplantation Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) conducted two parallel multicenter prospective Phase II clinical trials. These two studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of related haplo-BM (BMT CTN 0603) and dUCB (BMT CTN 0604) transplantation after RIC. Both of these alternative donor approaches produced early results similar to that reported with unrelated donor, and even HLA-matched sibling, HCT. These data demonstrate not only the efficacy of both of these approaches, but also that both can be safely exported from the single center setting. Both haplo-BM and dUCB grafts can be obtained rapidly for greater than 90% of patients lacking an HLA-matched donor. This study will test the hypothesis that progression free survival at two years after RIC haplo-BM transplantation is similar to the progression free survival after RIC dUCB transplantation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 to 70 years old Patients must have available both: a)One or more potential related mismatched donors (biologic parent(s) or siblings (full or half) or children). At least low resolution DNA based human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing at HLAA, B, and DRB1 for potential haploidentical sibling donors is required. b)At least two potential umbilical cord blood units identified. Each unit must have a minimum of 1.5 x 10^7/kg precryopreserved total nucleated cell dose. For nonred blood cell depleted units, the minimum precryopreserved total nucleated cell dose of each unit must be at least 2.0 x 10^7/kg. Units must be HLA matched at a minimum of 4/6 to the recipient at HLAA, HLAB (at low resolution using DNA based typing) and HLADRB1 (at high resolution using DNA based typing). Confirmatory typing is not required for randomization. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in first complete remission (CR1) that is NOT considered favorablerisk as defined by the presence of at least one of the following: Adverse cytogenetics such as t(9;22), t(1;19), t(4;11), other Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) rearrangements; White blood cell counts of greater than 30,000/mcL (BALL) or greater than 100,000/mcL (TALL)at diagnosis; Recipient age older than 30 years at diagnosis; Time to CR greater than 4 weeks Acute Myelogeneous Leukemia (AML) in CR1 that is NOT considered as favorablerisk. Favorable risk is defined as having one of the following: t(8.21) without CKIT mutation, inv(16) without CKIT mutation or t(16;16), normal karyotype with mutated NPM1 and not FLTIND, normal karyotype with double mutated CEBPA, Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in first molecular remission at end of consolidation Acute Leukemias in 2nd or subsequent CR Biphenotypic/Undifferentiated/Prolymphocytic Leukemias in first or subsequent CR, adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma in first or subsequent CR Burkitt's lymphoma: second or subsequent CR Lymphoma fulfilling the following criteria: Chemotherapysensitive (at least stable disease lymphomas that have failed at least 1 prior regimen of multiagent chemotherapy and are INELIGIBLE for an autologous transplant. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are not eligible regardless of disease status. Performance status: Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 70%. Additional Patient Inclusion Criteria for Conditioning: Patients with Adequate Physical Function as Measured by: a.

A unidirectional mismatch in either the graft versus host or host versus graft direction is considered a mismatch. The donor and recipient must be HLA identical for at least one antigen (using high resolution DNA based typing) at the following genetic loci: HLAA, HLAB, HLAC, and HLADRB1.
