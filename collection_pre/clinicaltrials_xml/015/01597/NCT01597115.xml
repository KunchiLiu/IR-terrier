	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether Aggressive duplex surveillance after vascular access surgery with native vein for hemodialysis can increase the maturation rate of arteriovenous fistula. This study will be conducted as a single center, prospective, 1:1 randomized study. Enrolled patients will be randomized as a control group (Physical exam at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery) and duplex group (duplex study and physical exam at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery). Maturation of arteriovenous fistula will be evaluated at 8 weeks after surgery by duplex in all patients.</brief_summary>
