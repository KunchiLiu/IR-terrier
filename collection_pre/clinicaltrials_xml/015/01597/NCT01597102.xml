	<brief_summary>The cerebrovascular autoregulation (AR) is impaired in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with the indication to liver transplantation mostly have mild to severe hepatic encephalopathy. Transplantation should recover the encephalopathy. The aim of the study is to investigate the AR during liver transplantation, with the questions if the AR is impaired at the beginning of surgery and if there are changes in AR. For follow up the AR will be measured at the first days after transplantation at the ICU.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebrovascular Autoregulation During and After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cerebrovascular autoregulation (AR) will be measured using transcranial doppler and calculating the index of autoregulation Mx. This measurement is continuous with online calculation. So, the possible changes over the whole time of surgery can be detected. Furthermore, the measurement of AR at the ICU will be performed daily at the same time over a measurement period of 60 Minutes and the time course of AR after liver transplantation will be described.</detailed_description>
