	<brief_summary>In hernia repair a mesh is used to close the defect in the abdominal wall. This mesh is either secured with tissue penetrating devices (ex. staples,tacks or sutures) or fibrin glue (Tisseel/Tissucol) or left unfixated. The investigators believe, and previous studies indicate, that the use of fibrin glue greatly reduces the amount of postoperative complications (ex. chronic pain, impaired ejaculation in men or recurrence of the hernia)when compared with the use of tacks or staples. The aim of this study is to compare the recurrence rates and amount of postoperative complications in patients who have had inguinal hernia repair with fibrin glue and in patients who have had inguinal hernia repair with tacks, staples or sutures.</brief_summary>
