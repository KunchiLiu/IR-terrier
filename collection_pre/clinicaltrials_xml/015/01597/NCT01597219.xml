	<brief_summary>This trial investigates stem cell transplants from partially mismatched donors in patients with blood and bone marrow cancers. The trial will test two kinds of transplants - a full intensity transplant using a high dose of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and a reduced intensity transplant with lower doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients will be entered for the treatment pathway that is most appropriate for their level of health and fitness</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient Inclusion Criteria 1. Eligible for an allogeneic transplant in line with the current BSBMT indications for transplant criteria (http://bsbmt.org/indicationstable/) accepted by Commissioners 2. Age 1670 3. Adequate physical function Cardiac: LVEF at rest ≥45%, or shortening fraction ≥25% Hepatic: Bilirubin ≤35mmol/l; AST/ALT and alkaline phosphatase &lt;5 x ULN Renal: Serum creatinine within normal range for age, or if serum creatinine outside normal range for age, creatinine clearance or GFR &gt;40ml/min/1.73m2 Pulmonary: FEV1, FVC, DLCO (diffusion capacity) &gt;50% predicted (corrected for haemoglobin); if clinically unable to perform pulmonary function tests then O2 saturation &gt;92% on room air Performance status: Karnofsky score ≥60% 4. Donor available aged ≥16 years 5. Needs an urgent transplant where a 10/10 HLA matched sibling or unrelated donor is unavailable in a timely manner. An unrelated donor search is not required for a patient to be eligible if the clinical situation dictates an urgent transplant. Clinical urgency is defined as 68 weeks from referral to transplant centre or low likelihood of finding a matched unrelated donor 6. HLA typing will be performed at high resolution (allelic) for the HLAA, HLAB, HLACw, HLADRB1 and HLADQB1 loci. A minimum match of 5/10 is required 7. The donor and recipient must be identical as determined by high resolution typing at at least one allele of each of the following genetic loci: HLAA, HLAB, HLACw, HLADRB1 and HLADQB1. Fulfilment of this criterion is sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype and typing of additional family members is not required. 8. Patient must have received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 months of the consent date (measured from the start date of the most recent cycle of chemotherapy) except patients with aplastic anaemia, unless otherwise agreed by the TMG (see section 5.3.4). The use of monoclonal antibody therapy may be considered cytotoxic chemotherapy, but must be agreed by the TMG 9. Written informed consent Donor Inclusion Criteria 1. Donor must be an HLAhaploidentical first degree relative of the patient. Eligible donors include biological parents, siblings, children or halfsiblings 2. Age ≥16 years 3. Donors must meet the collection centre's usual selection criteria for related allogeneic HPC donors Patient Exclusion Criteria 1. HLA matched, related donor able to donate 2. Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant &lt;3 months prior to enrolment 3. Pregnancy or breastfeeding 4. Uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection (currently taking medication with evidence of progression of clinical symptoms or radiological findings), the inclusion of patients with an uncontrolled viral or fungal infection can be agreed by the TMG 5. Serious psychiatric or psychological disorders 6. Absence or inability to provide informed consent 7. Severe comorbidity (HCTCI comorbidity score of 3 or more) or disease that prevents treatment with chemotherapy, unless otherwise agreed by the TMG 8. Positive antidonor HLA antibody 9. Unable to receive 2Gy TBI (RIC pathway) or 12Gy TBI (MAC pathway) 10. Patients with graft rejection following a previous allograft from either adult or cord blood donors Donor Exclusion Criteria 1. Positive antidonor HLA antibody in the recipient 2. Pregnancy or recent birth (within 6 months prior to donating cells)</criteria>
