	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Belimumab on Vaccine Responses in Subjects With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients in this study will receive belimumab plus standard therapy for SLE and vaccination against pneumococcus. Patients will be randomized to receive pneumococcal vaccination either 4 weeks prior (early vaccination group) or 24 weeks after (late vaccination group) their first belimumab dose. Vaccine response will be assessed 4 weeks after vaccine administration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Clinical diagnosis of SLE by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Active SLE disease. Autoantibodypositive. Have antibodies with titers &gt;1.0 microgram (mcg)/mL to no more than 9 of the 23 serotypes present in the pneumococcal vaccine. Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent, and comply with the study protocol procedures. Key Pregnant or nursing. Have received any prior treatment with belimumab. Have received a live vaccine within the past 30 days. Have received a pneumococcal vaccination with the past 5 years. Have a history of severe allergic reaction to a vaccine, contrast agents (such as those used for xrays and CT scans), or biological medicines. Have required management of an infection or have had infections that keep coming back within the past 60 days. Hepatitis B: Serologic evidence of Hepatitis B (HB) infection based on the results of testing for HB surface antigen (HBsAg) and antiHB core antibody (antiHBc): Subjects positive for HBsAg are excluded. Subjects negative for HBsAg but positive for antiHBc, regardless of antiHBs antibody status, are excluded. Hepatitis C: Positive test for Hepatitis C antibody. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Have current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence. Have a Grade 3/4 immunoglobulin (Ig)G deficiency (IgG level &lt;400 milligrams [mg]/ deciliter [dL]) or IgA deficiency (IgA level &lt;10 mg/dL). Subjects who have evidence of serious suicide risk including any history of suicidal behavior in the last 6 months and/or suicidal ideation with some intent to act in the last 2 months or who in the investigator's judgment, pose a significant suicide risk.</criteria>
