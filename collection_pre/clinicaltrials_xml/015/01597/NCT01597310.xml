	<brief_title>Dexpramipexole and Warfarin Drug Drug Interaction (DDI) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center open label study to assess the effect of Dexpramipexole on the PK of Warfarin in Healthy Volunteers. The goals of this study are as follows: to assess the effect of dexpramipexole on the pharmacodynamics (PD) of warfarin, to assess the safety and tolerability of dexpramipexole when administered alone, and with warfarin, and to assess the PK of dexpramipexole when administered alone; to explore the influence of genetic variation on the PK and international normalized ratio (INR) of warfarin when administered alone, and with dexpramipexole; and to explore the influence of genetic variation on the PK of dexpramipexole when administered alone.</detailed_description>
