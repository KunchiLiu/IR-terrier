	<brief_summary>The benefits of alternative therapeutic approaches, such as yoga, are poorly understood and this is particularly true of the beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. It is hoped that a better understanding of the value of this therapy will provide a sound scientific basis for including yoga in mainstream clinical practice. The investigators propose to study a group of 80 participants (40 Indian Asians and 40 Europeans) recruited from a cardiac rehabilitation programme in West London post-angioplasty as treatment for an acute coronary syndrome. Those who agree will undergo a series of baseline and follow-up measurements. 20 Indian Asians and 20 Europeans will be randomized to the yoga intervention plus their standard cardiac rehabilitation programme (usual care), and the remaining 20 Indian Asians and 20 Europeans will be randomized to usual care alone. Baseline and follow-up measurements will be performed on all participants. In order to determine the acute effects of yoga the group randomised to the yoga intervention will also undergo a series of acute tests before and after their first yoga session.</brief_summary>

Baseline and follow-up measurements will be performed on all participants; these include: Demographic &amp; health questionnaire, Lifestyle questionnaires focusing on diet and exercise, Fasting bloods sampling (for cardiovascular risk factors and markers), Saliva sampling (x 5 samples for salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase), Anthropometrics - height, weight and waist and hip circumference, Bioimpedence - measurement of total body fat, 3D and Doppler echocardiography, Carotid IMT, Resting brachial blood pressure, Central blood pressure (tonometery at the radial artery), Pulse Wave Velocity, 12 lead ECG, Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Combined 24hr BP &amp; ECG monitor, Accelerometer (3 days). In order to determine the acute effects of yoga the group randomised to the yoga intervention will also undergo a series of acute tests before and after their first yoga session. These include: Exercise capacity, Saliva sampling (x 5 samples for salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase) and combined 24hr BP &amp; ECG monitor.</detailed_description>
