	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of JNJ-40346527 200 mg/day (100 mg twice daily) for 12 weeks, compared with placebo, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of JNJ-40346527 in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Disease-modifying Antirheumatic Drug Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (treatment assigned by chance, like flipping a coin), multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor patient will know the treatment the patient receives), parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the same time) study. JNJ-40346527 will be compared to a placebo, which is an inactive substance used to test whether a drug has a real effect. Patients will receive study medication for 12 weeks and will continue their permitted, stable DMARD therapy (methotrexate [MTX], sulfasalazine [SSZ], and/or hydroxychloroquine [HCQ]) through Week 12. A follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after dosing is complete. The maximum length of patient participation will be 22 weeks, including a 6-week screening period. Other study visits will occur during the study, and patient safety will be monitored.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for at least 6 months prior to screening Have been positive for, or are positive at screening for, either anticyclic citrullinated peptide (antiCCP) antibody or rheumatoid factor (RF) in serum Have active RA with at least 6 swollen and 6 tender joints, using a 66/68 joint count at the time of screening and at baseline, and serum Creactive protein (CRP) &gt;= 0.80 mg/dL at screening Have been treated with and tolerated at least one of the following medications for a minimum of 6 months prior to screening and must be on a stable dose for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to screening: methotrexate (MTX) treatment at dosages of 7.5 to 25 mg/week, inclusive; sulfasalazine not exceeding 3 g/d; hydroxychloroquine not exceeding 400 mg/d If using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or other analgesics regularly for RA, patients must have been on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent. If not using NSAIDs or other analgesics for RA, the patient must have not received NSAIDs or other analgesics for at least 2 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent If using oral corticosteroids, must be on a stable dose of &lt;= 10 mg/day of prednisone or an equipotent dose of another oral corticosteroid for at least 2 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent. If not using corticosteroids, the patient must have not received oral corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent Has inflammatory diseases other than RA, including but not limited to adult onset Still's disease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Lyme disease that might confound the evaluation of the benefit of study agent therapy Has a history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) Has current signs or symptoms of liver or renal insufficiency or cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances that are severe, progressive, or uncontrolled Has been treated in the time frames specified with any nonbiologic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), except for MTX, sulfasazine, and hydroxychloroquine, including, but not limited to: Dpenicillamine, oral or parenteral gold salts, azathioprine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil within 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent; leflunomide within 12 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent unless the subject has undergone a drug elimination procedure at least 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent; any investigational nonbiologic DMARD within 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent or 5 halflives of the DMARD, whichever is longer Has ever received any approved or investigational biologic antirheumatic agent. These agents include, but are not limited to, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, adalimumab, abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, or anakinra. Has received drugs that potently inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 3A4, CYP2C8, or CYP2C19 isoforms within 2 weeks or within 5 halflives of the drug, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study medication Has received intraarticular, epidural, intravertebral, intramuscular, or intravenous corticosteroids, including adrenocorticotropic hormone, within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication</criteria>
