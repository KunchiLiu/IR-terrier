	<criteria>gastroesophageal INCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Subject must state that they have had a "cold" for &lt; 14 days. A "cold" is defined as: Moderate or severe rhinorrhea (i.e., using 2 or more tissues per hour for any 1 hour within 12 hours preceding study screening AND At least one other respiratory symptom (cough, pharyngeal symptoms [sore throat], nasal congestion of moderate or severe intensity, headache, etc.) 2. Subject must exceed a cough severity threshold (VAS) during screening visit (Cough Severity VAS score ≥ 40 mm). 3. Subjects who recall that their average number of days with cough during their usual cold history is 3 or greater (URTI cough history &gt; 3). 4. Subjects who do not smoke or use nicotine or nicotine containing products. Exsmokers/extobacco users must have stopped using tobacco products for at least 6 months prior to study screening. 5. Female subjects should be either postmenopausal (amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months), surgically sterile, or women of childbearing potential (WOCP) with a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test prior to entering the study and who are using or agree to use an acceptable method of contraception as determined by the Investigator. Acceptable contraceptives include abstinence OR intrauterine devices (IUDs), hormonal contraceptives (oral, depot, patch or injectable) for ≥ three months prior to screening OR use of double barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with spermicidal gel or foam. 6. Subject must sign an Institutional Review Board approved informed consent and agree to complete required clinic visits. EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Subject who are using antibiotics at study screening or for whom antibiotics are currently indicated as determined by the Investigator. 2. History of cough of greater than 6 weeks in duration. 3. History of any chronic pulmonary disease including tuberculosis, lung cancer, chronic bronchitis or emphysema 4. History of pneumonia, influenza or whooping cough within the past 30 days. 5. History of asthma that required any treatment within 2 weeks of study 6. T &gt; 38.5oC with no history of antipyretic medication for &gt; 24 hours from screening visit 7. History of inhalational exposure (chemical, smoke, water, etc.) within the past 6 months 8. Chest Xray suggestive of granulomatous disease, malignancy, COPD, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, pleural processes or other underlying pulmonary disease 9. Active, concurrent concomitant disease which might limit the ability of the subject to participate in the study as determined by the Investigator (i.e., diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, etc.) 10. Prior or current renal disease; calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min (calculated ClCr &lt; 30) 11. Known immune deficiency condition 12. Use of opioids or anticonvulsants within 3 days of study screening. 13. Known hypersensitivity to memantine or lozenge excipients. 14. Current oral lesions or abnormal findings on buccal examination done at study screening. 15. History of oropharyngeal or gastroesophageal carcinoma, or gastro/esophageal/duodenal resection. 16. Subject has clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit. (Subject may be enrolled by exception, as determined by the Principal Investigator and consented by Cerecor's Medical Monitor.) 17. Any clinically significant finding on the ECG done at the screening visit, as determined by the investigator. (Subject may be enrolled by exception, as determined by the Principal Investigator and consented by Cerecor's Medical Monitor). 18. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or sexually active without contraception. 19. Subject has donated blood or plasma within the last 45 days. 20.
