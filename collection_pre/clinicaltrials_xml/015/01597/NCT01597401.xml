	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic effects of Aes-103 (active ingredient 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural [5-HMF]) compared with placebo in subjects with stable sickle cell disease (SCD). Safety will be measured by monitoring adverse events (AEs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and laboratory values. Pharmacokinetics of Aes-103 will be measured over time in plasma, red blood cell hemolysate and binding of Aes-103 to hemoglobin. Pharmacodynamic effects will be assessed by measuring partial pressure of oxygen at which 50% of hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen (p50) while breathing normal air, blood oxygen levels (SpO2), ex-vivo antisickling effects in a hypoxic environment, and by imaging related changes in tissue blood flow and oxygen levels.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Be male or female, aged 1865 years old, inclusive Have sickle cell disease (SCD) (hemoglobin SS) without hospitalization for pain crises in the 30 days before screening or for any SCD complications on more than two occasions in the past 12 months; subjects are allowed concomitant usage of hydroxyurea (HU) if the dosage is stable for the 2 months before screening and is at a dosage that does not exceed the product's labeling. Have normal laboratory values as defined below: Direct bilirubin 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) 6 to 41 IU/L Creatinine for females 0.56 to 1.16 mg/dL and for males 0.77 to 1.19 mg/dL If female, be nonpregnant and nonbreastfeeding and be surgically sterile or using an acceptable method of contraception throughout the study and for 30 days after study completion Have successfully completed an outpatient screening visit consisting of medical history, physical examination, 12lead ECG, vital signs, hematology and chemistry tests, urinalysis, urine drug screen, pregnancy test (females), hemoglobin electrophoresis, hepatitis B and C screening, and HIV serology (Note: Subjects with abnormal screening values may be eligible if the results are not clinically significant, as judged by the investigator or medical monitor) Be able to understand and have provided written informed consent including signature on an informed consent form approved by an institutional review board Agree to abide by the study schedule and dietary restrictions and to return for the required assessments Be willing to abstain from foods high in 5HMF (e.g., coffee, malt, barley, balsamic vinegar, dried fruits, and caramel products) for at least 3 days before each dosing Have evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological, psychiatric, or other disease that may interfere with the objectives of the study or the safety of the subject, as judged by the investigator in agreement with the sponsor or medical monitor, or have been hospitalized in the past 6 months as a result of these conditions Have been hospitalized in the 14 days before enrollment, for any reason Be currently on regularly scheduled transfusions Have received a transfusion within 2 weeks of administration of study drug Have taken herbal preparations in the 2 weeks before dosing (Note: subjects are allowed concomitant usage of HU and other scheduled prescription drugs if the dosage is stable for the 2 months before screening and is at a dosage that does not exceed the product's labeling. These scheduled prescription medications will be continued during the study [including during dosing]. All other medications, including overthecounter medications used according to the product labeling, administered on an asneeded basis will be permitted except for the 24 hour period before dosing and the day of dosing. Medications for pain management will be allowed as needed [including during dosing.]) Have taken any other investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives before the screening visit, whichever is longer Consumed more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week or more than 3 drinks per day at any point in the past month Have received disulfiram or 4methylpyrazole within 30 days before dosing Have taken any coughcold product containing dextrorphan or dextromethorphan within 4 days before dosing Have positive result for urine drug test (cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, ethanol) at screening visit. However, use of opiates, amphetamines, or benzodiazepines is allowed if prescribed by a physician. Have engaged in strenuous exercise within 72 hours prior to dosing Be considered not suitable for participation in this study for any reason, as judged by the investigator Have preexisting allergic or other adverse reactions to orange juice</criteria>
