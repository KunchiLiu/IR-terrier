	<brief_summary>The Lower Mississippi Delta (LMD) population is characterized by high levels of overweight and obesity, which are the result of long-term disruptions in energy imbalance where dietary energy intake has exceeded energy expenditure associated with physical activity. To address this issue, the overall goal of this project is to determine ways in which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2005) physical activity recommendations can be effectively adapted for the LMD population. Phase I of this study was completed in early 2011.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steps Ahead, Adapting Physical Activity Guidelines for the Lower Mississippi Delta Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During Phase I, we determined the feasibility of adapting physical activity recommendations by incorporating pedometers (step-counters) as self-monitoring tools within the context of an education program. Lessons learned from the feasibility study have been incorporated into the design of the current proposed Phase II program. This study will be an appropriately powered, randomized controlled effectiveness trial of physical activity and adapted dietary guidelines (DG) eating patterns to reduce unhealthy weight gain. The Steps Ahead study will use the step-based physical activity recommendations identified in Phase I. Participants will be randomized and orientated into one of two groups. One group will be an adapted DG group who will receive education on the adapted DG guidelines. The second group will be an adapted DG plus physical activity group who will also receive the adapted DG guidelines education plus a physical activity intervention. The diet and physical activity recommendations have been developed to be used as low-intensity interventions in order to ensure maximal sustainability in the population. This intervention will be undertaken in East Baton Rouge parish, an area of the Delta region which contains communities and neighborhoods representative of the broader Delta region.</detailed_description>
