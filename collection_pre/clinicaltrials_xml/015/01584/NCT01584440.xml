	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability Study of AVP-923 (Dextromethorphan/Quinidine) for Treatment of Symptoms of Agitation in Alzheimer's Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients for this study must have a diagnosis of probable AD and must have clinically meaningful agitation secondary to AD. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-dummy, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, consisting of 10 weeks of treatment. Up to 200 patients will be enrolled at approximately 30-40 centers in the US. Study medication will be administered orally twice-daily from Day 1 through Day 70. Screening must occur within within approximately 4 weeks prior to randomization. Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients will be randomized into the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). The patient has clinically significant symptoms of agitation secondary to AD, that interfere with daily routine and for which a prescription medication is deemed indicated, in the opinion of the investigator. Either outpatients or residents of an assistedliving facility or a skilled nursing home. CGIS score is â‰¥ 4 (moderately ill) at screening and baseline. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at screening between 8 and 28 (inclusive). Caregiver who is able and willing to comply with all required study procedures, ensuring that the patient attends all study visits and takes the study medication as instructed. In order to qualify as a caregiver for this study, the individual should spend time with the patient for a minimum of 4 hours on 4 separate days per week. Key Patient has other type of dementia (e.g., vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, substanceinduced dementia). Patients with coexistent clinically significant or unstable systemic diseases that could confound the interpretation of the safety results of the study (e.g. malignancy, poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled hypertension, unstable pulmonary, renal or hepatic disease, unstable ischemic cardiac disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, certain cardiac conduction abnormalities including QTc prolongation, or unstable valvular heart disease). Patients with myasthenia gravis.</criteria>
