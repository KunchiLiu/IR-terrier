	<brief_summary>Background Life style related disease is an increasing problem all over the world. The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a condition characterized by abdominal obesity, high blood lipids, high blood pressure and slightly elevated blood sugar. Subjects with MetS have high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Dietary fibers have been shown to have positive effects on the components of MetS. The investigators have special interest in the combination of two types of fiber (Resistant (RS) starch and Arabinoxylans (AX)) . Hypotheses Increase of RS and AX in the dietary composition has a positive effects on components of MetS i.e. decreases blood lipids, improves blood sugar, blood pressure and markers of inflammation. The subjects undergo two dietary interventions of 4 weeks duration each: A "Healthy Carbohydrate Diet" with a high content of RS and AX is compared to a "Western Style Diet" with a low content of RS and AX.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Life style related disease is an increasing problem all over the world. The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a condition characterized by abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance. Subjects with MetS have high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes and CVD. Resistant Starch (RS) and Arabinoxylans (AX) are dietary fibers that have been shown to have positive effects on the components of MetS. The combination of RS and AX has not been tested before . Hypotheses Increase of RS and AX in the dietary composition has a positive effects on components of MetS i.e. decreases postprandial lipaemia, improves glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, blood pressure and markers of inflammation. Design: A nonblinded randomized cross over study Two dietary interventions of 4 weeks duration each. A healthy carbohydrate Diet with a high content of RS and AX is compared to a Western Style diet with a low content of RS and AX. Between the two interventions, there is a wash out period of 4 weeks. The primary outcome is postprandial lipaemia estimated by a high fat meal test of 6 hours duration. The test is performed before and after each intervention. Secondary outcomes are: - Glucose tolerance and insulin resistance estimated by OGTT - 24 hours blood pressure - MRI estimation of liver fat content - Postprandial changes in genes of adipose tissue</detailed_description>
