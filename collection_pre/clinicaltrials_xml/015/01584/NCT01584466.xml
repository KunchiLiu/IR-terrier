	<brief_summary>Comorbid substance abuse leads to many deleterious effects such as medical comorbidities and nonadherence, which is one of the most problematic issues. People with schizophrenia and substance use disorders (SUDs) are at an increased risk nonadherence compared to those who do not use alcohol and illicit drugs. The investigators propose that this new marketed injectable antipsychotic with many benefits over other available long acting injectable agents would be beneficial in the dually diagnosed population and may represent a specific schizophrenia subpopulation where long acting agents may be considered an important therapeutic option.</brief_summary>
