	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of a Therapeutic Vaccine With NY-ESO-1 in Combination With the Adjuvant Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine with the antigen NY-ESO-1 in combination with the MPLA will be evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial conducted in patients with malignancies that express the antigen (lung, ovarian and melanoma). This study will involve 15 patients, who will receive 250 mcg of NY-ESO-1 and 100 mcg of MPLA.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In this study, will be included fifteen patients aged over 18 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of malignant neoplasms, which have proven NYESO1 expression by immunohistochemistry and have undergone the standard treatment. Will be excluded from the study patients with continuous use of systemic steroids, immunosuppressive agents and antibiotics, and with severe chronic systemic disease.</criteria>
