	<brief_title>Resin Infiltration to Arrest Early Tooth Decay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 3-year prospective, randomized control clinical trial (RCT) is designed incorporating a split mouth intra-oral design. Young volunteers (18-24 years old) with at least two early lesions in posterior teeth will be enrolled into this clinical trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of arresting lesion progression by resin infiltration therapy as adjunct to standard-of-care preventative measures. Lesion status (cavitation or not) is clinically confirmed prior to implementing the assigned therapy.</detailed_description>
