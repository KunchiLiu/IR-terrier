	<brief_summary>Stair negotiation is an important activity of daily living. Patients with cruciate ligament injury may have difficulty in stair negotiation because of the proprioception deficit and neuromuscular deficit caused by ligament injury. However, the influence of knee cruciate ligament injury on the control of movement is still unclear. Since inter-joint coordination can provide the information of relationship between angle position and angle velocity, it may be useful to analysis the change of movement pattern.This current study aimed to investigate the change of inter-joint coordination and muscle activation in patients with cruciate ligament injury during stair negotiation.</brief_summary>
