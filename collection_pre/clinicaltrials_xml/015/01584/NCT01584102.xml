	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Targeting Obesity-related Behaviors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 15-week randomized controlled pilot study consisted of two groups. All participants received access to two group fitness classes per week, which were offered free of charge at the Caswell County Parks and Recreation Building. Zumba classes were offered one night a week, and the other evening was a 'potluck night' designed to increase participants exposure to a variety of other fitness classes such as floor aerobics, kickboxing, line dancing, and African dancing. Participants in the intervention group (Group 1) were enrolled in Eat Smart, Move More, Weigh Less (ESMMWL) where they received on hour weekly education classes on healthy eating and physical activity. The ESMMWL curriculum is a 15-week weight-management program that is delivered by local educators. Published research data were used to identify strategies that would lead to weight loss and/or weight maintenance. The program uses the Theory of Planned Behavior, and as such informs, empowers, and motivates participants to live mindfully as they make choices about eating and physical activity. The program provides opportunities for participants to keep a journal of healthy eating and physical activity behaviors.</detailed_description>
