	<brief_title>A Study of Dulaglutide in Japanese Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rescue therapy (defined as alternative antihyperglycemic medication use or dose modification of oral antihyperglycemic medication [OAM]) may have been initiated during the planned treatment period if the participant discontinued study drug or met prespecified thresholds for severe, persistent hyperglycemia. Efficacy data, as well as data for hypoglycemic episodes from participants who permanently discontinued study treatment but switched to another diabetes medication and remained in the study, were censored from the point of initiating new treatment onwards.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants who have had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 6 months before screening Participants who have been taking sulfonylurea (glibenclamide, gliclazide, or glimepiride) and/or biguanide (metformin or buformin). The dose of the drug(s) during the 8 weeks before screening must be stable Participants who have a qualifying glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 7.0% to 10.0% at screening Participants who have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 35.0 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m^2) Participants who have a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes Participants who have previously been treated with any other glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP1) analog Participants who have received therapy with an alphaglucosidase inhibitor (aGI), thiazolidinedione (TZD), glinide, or dipeptidyl peptidaseIV (DPPIV) inhibitor within 3 months before screening Participants who have been currently taking insulin or have had previous insulin treatment within 3 months before screening Participants who have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, a history of chronic pancreatitis, or acute pancreatitis at screening, as determined by the investigator. Participants who have a serum amylase concentration ≥ 3 times the upper limit of the reference range and/or a serum lipase concentration ≥ 2 times the upper limit of the reference range, as determined by the central laboratory at screening Participants who have self or family history of medullary Ccell hyperplasia, focal hyperplasia, or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)</criteria>
