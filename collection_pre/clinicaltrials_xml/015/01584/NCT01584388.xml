	<brief_title>Rituximab in IgG4-related Disease: A Phase 1-2 Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-center trial will enroll at total of 30 patients with IgG4-RD. The two participating sites are the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) and the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). All patients will receive rituximab 1 gram intravenously times two doses, separated by approximately 15 days. The primary efficacy outcome - disease remission and successful completion of the glucocorticoid taper - will be assessed at six months. Patients will be followed on the protocol for an additional six months after measurement of the primary outcome.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients will be included in the trial based on the following diseasespecific criteria: Age 18 or older Diagnosis of IgG4RD, based upon either pathological criteria* (for those who have undergone biopsies) or clinical criteria.** The criteria for pathological and clinical diagnoses are specified below. The subject can be either steroidnaive, in relapse, steroid dependent, or refractory to steroids. Subjects who are steroid dependent or refractory are eligible for enrollment if steroid dose has not been increased in the past 2 weeks, and their treating physician plans to withdraw steroids completely (by dose taper) within 8 weeks of starting rituximab. Pathological diagnosis: Histopathologic features consisting of a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and storiform fibrosis within involved organs. Other histopathologic features consistent with IgG4RD (e.g., obliterative phlebitis) may be present but are not required. Either an IgG4/IgG plasma cell ratio of &gt; 50% within the affected organs or more than 10 IgG4bearing plasma cells per highpower field. All patients with pathologic diagnoses will have their specimens reviewed by pathology investigators. **Clinical diagnosis: â€¢ Organ involvement in a pattern consistent with IgG4RD. This must include dysfunction of one of the following organs: pancreas (autoimmune pancreatitis); salivary glands (chronic sclerosing sialadenitis); lacrimal glands; orbital pseudotumor; kidneys; lungs; lymph nodes; meninges; aorta (including aortitis/periaortitis and/or retroperitoneal fibrosis); thyroid gland (Riedel's thyroiditis). If a patient is enrolled with a clinical diagnosis alone, the diagnosis must be accompanied by both an imaging finding compatible with IgG4RD and a 1.5fold elevation in the serum IgG4 concentration. Patients will be excluded from the study based on the following criteria: DiseaseSpecific Concerns: Excessive fibrosis within organs, such that a disease response to rituximab would not be expected. General Medical Concerns: Pregnancy (a negative serum pregnancy test should be performed for all women of childbearing potential within 7 days of treatment), or lactating. Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures. RituximabSpecific Concerns: History of HIV. Presence of active infection. New York Heart Association Classification III or IV heart disease (See Appendix D). Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies within the last five years, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. At the Investigator's discretion, receipt of a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Positive hepatitis B or C serology is considered a potential exclusion criterion. Hepatitis B screening should include hepatitis B antibody and surface antigen for a patient with no risk factors. For patients with risk factors or previous history of hepatitis B, add core antibodies and eantigen. Allergies: History of severe allergic reactions to human or chimeric monoclonal antibodies or murine protein. Uncontrolled disease: They show evidence of other uncontrolled disease, including drug and alcohol abuse, which that could interfere with participation in the trial according to the protocol. History of antihuman antichimeric antibody formation.</criteria>
