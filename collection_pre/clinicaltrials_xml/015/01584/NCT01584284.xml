	<brief_title>Safety Study of Attenuated Vaccinia Virus (GL-ONC1)With Combination Therapy in Head &amp; Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GL-ONC1, an oncolytic vaccinia virus, has shown the ability to preferentially locate, colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 40 different human tumors. A First-in-Man, Phase I clinical study focusing on the safety and tolerability of GL-ONC1 intravenously administered to patients with a variety of advanced solid tumor entities has shown that GL-ONC1 is well-tolerated at therapeutic dose levels, with documented evidence of antitumor activity. Preclinical studies have further shown synergistic effects with the use of chemotherapy (Cisplatin) and viral therapy with GL-ONC, as well as favorable results when cancer cells are irradiated and then treated with GL-ONC1 in animal models. This Phase I study seeks to evaluate the safety, tolerability and early signs of efficacy of GL-ONC1 administered intravenously in combination with standard of care (SOC) radiation therapy (RT) and cisplatin (CDDP)in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer. Patients will be individually assessed for safety and dose limiting toxicity. Viral colonization in tumors, replication and anti-tumoral activity will also be evaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of histologically or cytologically documented Stage III to IVB primary, nonmetastatic head and neck cancer for newly diagnosed patients with no prior diseaserelated treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation treatment, surgery, etc.). American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage IIIIVB disease (2010 manual, 7th edition), based on standard diagnostic workup. 18 years or older. ECOG performance status of ≤ 2. Laboratory data obtained within 14 days prior to Treatment Day 1, with adequate hepatic and renal function defined as follows: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3; Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3; Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; AST or ALT ≤ 2× upper limit of normal (ULN); Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; Creatinine clearance (CC) ≥ 50 mL/min. Pulse oximetry reading of 92% or higher at rest on room air. Signed informed consent Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and agree to practice effective birth control during treatment phase and up to 60 days after the last virus application. Male patients must agree to practice effective birth control during the study and for 60 days following administration of last treatment of virus. Clinical, radiographic, or pathologic evidence of distant metastatic disease. Patients with fever, active immunosuppressive systemic infection or a suppressed immune system, including AIDS or HIV positivity and known hepatitis infections (HCV or HBC. Eligible patients must have an HIV test conducted within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment with a negative test result. Any form of prior anticancer treatment. Diseaserelated surgery, excluding biopsy. Patients with CNS (Central Nervous System) tumors. Any other open wounds. Concurrent small pox vaccination for 4 weeks before study therapy and during study treatment. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy or with immune system disorders, including autoimmune diseases. Prior splenectomy. Previous organ transplantation. Patients with clinically significant dermatological disorders, as judged by the clinical investigator (e.g., eczema or psoriasis), any skin lesions or ulcers, any history of atopic dermatitis, or any history of Darier's disease (Keratosis Follicularis). Clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association: Class III or IV). Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent. Known allergy to ovalbumin or egg products. Prior gene therapy treatments or prior therapy with cytolytic virus of any type.</criteria>
