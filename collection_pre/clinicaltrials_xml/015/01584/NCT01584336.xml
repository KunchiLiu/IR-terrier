	<brief_title>Laparoscopy-assisted Total Gastrectomy for Clinical Stage I Gastric Cancer (KLASS-03)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer remains one of the most common neoplasms in Asia and some western countries, although the incidence is decreasing worldwide. Recently,as the rate of detection of early gastric cancer has increased and surgical techniques have been developed, laparoscopic procedures have been introduced and tried for the treatment of early-stage gastric cancer. Already the prospective, randomized trials for safety and oncologic outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer had been tried, but the large-scaled, prospective study for laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) is seldom. One reason for the low popularity is that LATG requires the dissection of lymph nodes at the splenic hilum or along the short gastric arteries and the other reason is that the reconstruction after total gastrectomy is also more complicated. The third reason is that the chance for total gastrectomy is less frequent than distal gastrectomy because of the low incidence of upper gastric cancer. This KLASS-03 trial is a prospective, multicenter trial for LATG for early upper gastric cancer. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of postoperative morbidity and mortality and the second purpose is to evaluate the surgical outcomes after several methods of reconstruction in laparoscopic total gastrectomy and the postoperative course of LATG patients.</detailed_description>
