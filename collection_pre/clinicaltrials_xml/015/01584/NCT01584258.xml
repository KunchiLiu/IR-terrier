	<brief_summary>This study is an international multicentre randomised study of organ confined low and intermediate risk prostate cancer and is composed of two parallel randomisation schemes based on applicability of surgery as a treatment for the patient. Patients for whom surgery is a consideration are randomised to either laparoscopic prostatectomy or prostate SBRT. Patients for whom surgery is not a consideration are randomised to either conventionally fractionated radiation therapy or prostate SBRT. Efficacy, toxicity and quality of life outcomes will be compared across the pairs in each randomisation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All of the following criteria are mandatory for inclusion: Histological confirmation of prostate adenocarcinoma with a minimum of 10 biopsy cores taken within 18 months of randomisation. Gleason score ≤ 3+4 Men aged ≥18 Clinical and MRI stage T1c T2c, N0X, M0X (TNM 6th Edition [72], See Appendix 1) PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml Preenrollment PSA must be completed within 60 days of randomisation Patients belonging in one of the following risk groups according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (www.nccn.org): Low risk: Clinical stage T1T2a and Gleason ≤ 6 and PSA &lt; 10 ng/ml, or Intermediate risk includes any one of the following: Clinical stage T2b orT2c PSA 1020 ng/ml or Gleason 3+4 WHO performance status 0 2 Prostate volume ≤ 90 cc measured within 6 months of randomisation (height*width*length *π/6) Ability of the research subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Exclusion criteria: One of the following criteria is sufficient for exclusion: Clinical stage T3 or greater Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3 High risk disease defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (www.nccn.org) Previous malignancy within the last 2 years (except basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), or if previous malignancy is expected to significantly compromise 5 year survival Prior pelvic radiotherapy Prior androgen deprivation therapy (including LHRH agonists and antagonists and antiandrogens) Any prior active treatment for prostate cancer. Patients previously on active surveillance are eligible if they continue to meet all other eligibility criteria. Life expectancy &lt;5 years Bilateral hip prostheses or any other implants/hardware that would introduce substantial CT artifacts Medical conditions likely to make radiotherapy inadvisable eg inflammatory bowel disease, significant urinary symptoms Anticoagulation with warfarin/ bleeding tendency making fiducial placement or surgery unsafe in the opinion of the clinician (see section 11, Treatment).
