	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to evaluate the effects, on microcirculation of septic patient, of three types of RBCs: 1- fresh standard RBCs (storage &lt;10 days); 2-leukodepleted RBCs and 3-old standard RBCs (storage &gt;15 days) respectively. Before and 1 hour after the transfusion, microcirculation is evaluated using Sidestream Dark Field Imaging (SDF) and Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) with vascular occlusion test. We also monitor temperature, heart rate, mean blood pressure, hemochrome, blood gases, blood lactates and SOFA score.</brief_summary>
