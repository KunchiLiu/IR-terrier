	<brief_summary>The interest in using L-asparaginase in pancreatic cancer arose from in vitro and in vivo studies data showing an anti-neoplastic effect on pancreatic tumor cell lines. Interestingly, these studies suggest an additional effect of L-asparaginase associated to gemcitabine.GRASPA is a suspension of red blood cells encapsulating L-asparaginase. The aim of this phase I clinical trial is to evaluate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of GRASPA on locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic tumors, after therapy failure of first or second line chemotherapy using gemcitabine.</brief_summary>
