	<brief_summary>This study expands upon pilot data for feasibility since May 2011. The study aims to evaluate the effect of rapid test availability on use of targeted spectrum antibiotics for non-MRSA abscesses in ambulatory patients in the Emergency Department (ED). The multi-institutional study will assess the feasibility of providing the GeneXpert® MRSA/SA SSTI assay to the ED and evaluate the impact of delivering the test result to clinicians in real-time on patient management decisions regarding the use of antimicrobial agents. Patients are randomized to standard culture (control arm) or to the GeneXpert® assay plus standard culture.</brief_summary>
