	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the efficacy of once daily dose of SAR302503 in subjects previously treated with ruxolitinib and with a current diagnosis of intermediate-1 with symptoms, Intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (Post-PV MF), or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (Post-ET MF) based on the reduction of spleen volume at the end of 6 treatment cycles; Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effect of SAR302503 on Myelofibrosis (MF) associated symptoms as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) diary - To evaluate the durability of splenic response - To evaluate the splenic response to SAR302503 by palpation at the end of Cycle 6 - To evaluate the splenic response to SAR302503 at the end of Cycle 3 - To evaluate the effect of SAR302503 on the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F allele burden - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAR302503 in this population - To evaluate plasma concentrations of SAR302503 for population PK analysis, if warranted</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II, Open Label, Single Arm Study of SAR302503 In Myelofibrosis Patients Previously Treated With Ruxolitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The expected duration of the treatment in this study is approximately 8 months, based on a maximum 28-day screening period, followed by a 6-month (6-cycle) treatment period, and an EOT visit for subjects who will not continue the treatment after completing the 6 cycles of SAR302503, or discontinue the treatment early for any reasons as well as a follow-up visit which should occur 30 days after the last administration of SAR302503. Patients who continue to benefit clinically will be allowed to remain on study medication beyond the 6-month treatment period until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
