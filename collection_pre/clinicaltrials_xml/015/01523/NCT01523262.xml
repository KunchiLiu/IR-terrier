	<brief_summary>Primary To investigate whether peripheral predonditioning induced by brief, intermittent constriction of blood supply to an arm can reduce the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia in patients operated electively for infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Secondary To investigate the impact of peripheral preconditioning on perioperative inflammatory response. To investigate whether peripheral preconditoning can protect against perioperative myocardial infarction and reduced cardiac pump function.</brief_summary>
