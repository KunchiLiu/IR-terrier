	<brief_summary>The complex regional pain syndrom is a weighty disease that often results in a lifelong disability. Mostly this disease appears unilateral after comparatively mundane fractures or operations. In early stages CRPS shows inflammatory processes. These inflammatory components can be seen as edema and vasodilatation. These inflammatory processes lead us to the hypothesis that selective COX-2-inhibitors might help patients with CRPS.</brief_summary>
