	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to extend our knowledge concerning the clinical performance of two dental filling materials in molars. The study will compare two high-strength glass-ionomer filling materials. The investigators hypothesize that after two years (1) the clinical performance of both filling materials shows a similar survival rate, (2) the ChemFil Rock fillings show similar or higher incidence of fracture than Fuji IX GP fillings.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this longitudinal prospective randomized control clinical trial, posterior restorations (Class II) will be placed and evaluated for their clinical performance. The study will compare two restorative systems currently on the market in USA: both high-strength glass-ionomer (GI) restorative materials. The study restorations will be monitored for a period of up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
