	<brief_summary>The objective of the study was to compare treatment with two different oral formulations of metoprolol, metoprolol immediate release (IR) and metoprolol extended release (CR/XL) in patients with acute myocardial infarction regarding the following: Pharmacokinetics, peak and trough plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration curve. Pharmacodynamics, hourly means of Holter recorded heart rate. Tolerability. An open, randomised design with two parallel groups was employed.</brief_summary>
