	<brief_summary>Pyronaridine: artesunate (Pyramax) is an antimalarial fixed-dose combination therapy which has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and effective treatment in patients with Plasmodium falciparum and vivax malaria. This open-label Phase I study has two parts: a drug-drug interaction part intended to investigate the interaction of Pyramax in the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2D6 probe metoprolol and a re-dosing evaluation part intended to investigate the differences on the changes in liver enzymes induced by Pyramax in a first and in a second treatment course and the effect of the redosing interval on the changes in liver enzymes induced by Pyramax in a first and in a second treatment course.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Study of Pyronaridine-artesunate and Metoprolol and Pyronaridine-artesunate Re-dosing Study in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy subjects will be randomised to either arm A (sequential metoprolol single dose and Pyramax 3 days course + metoprolol on the last day starting 7 days after Pyramax single dose followed by Pyramax redosing with another 3 days course 90 days later) or arm B (2 courses of 3-days Pyramax separated by 60 days). Each arm will include 22 subjects. Subjects will be followed for tolerability and pharmacokinetics for 42 days following each start of Pyramax dosing period. Subjects will be considered to have completed the study at Day 140 (arm A) or at Day 103 (arm B). Any adverse event ongoing at the time of study completion will be followed until resolution unless no further change is expected according to the investigator.</detailed_description>
