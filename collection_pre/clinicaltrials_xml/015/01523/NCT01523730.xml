	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking rates are extremely high in persons with schizophrenia and this increases the risk of disease and death due to tobacco-related disorders. One of the features of schizophrenia is reduced cognitive abilities, such as poor attention and memory. It is thought that people with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes to reduce these cognitive problems, as nicotine can improve cognitive function in these people. When people with schizophrenia stop smoking it causes further cognitive difficulties, which makes quitting harder for them compared to people without schizophrenia. A method called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) allows clinicians to give repeated magnetic pulses through the scalp to cause changes in brain activity and behaviour. rTMS can improve cognitive function in people with schizophrenia. Studies have also shown that rTMS can reduce tobacco craving and consumption of cigarettes. Therefore, we believe that rTMS will improve the cognitive deficits observed during cigarette smoking abstinence and help reduce cravings for cigarettes. Ultimately, rTMS may help smokers with schizophrenia who can't quit smoking with available treatments. This study will examine the effect of rTMS on tobacco cravings and cognitive problems produced by overnight abstinence from cigarette smoking in persons with schizophrenia in comparison to people without mental illness who smoke. Important information about the potential of rTMS for the treatment of cognitive deficits and tobacco addiction in schizophrenia will be obtained. Providing more effective smoking cessation treatments in people with schizophrenia may lead to improved physical and mental health for these patients, who are extremely susceptible to tobacco addiction and tobacco-related illness.</brief_summary>
