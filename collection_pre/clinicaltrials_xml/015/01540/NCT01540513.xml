	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate diagnostic imaging techniques using 124I-NM404 PET/CT in human brain tumors. This goal will be accomplished by quantifying tumor uptake and determining the optimal PET/CT protocol, comparing PET tumor uptake to MRI, and calculating tumor dosimetry. The long-term goals of this research are to improve the diagnosis and treatment of malignant brain tumors by using radioiodinated NM404</brief_summary>
