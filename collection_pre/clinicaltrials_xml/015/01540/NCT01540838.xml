	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this trial is to test if mortality of childhood bacterial meningitis can be reduced by slow, continuous infusion of cefotaxime initially, instead of the traditional bolus administration four times daily (qid), combined with high-dose paracetamol orally, when both treatments are executed for the first 4 days. The series will be collected at Hospital Pediátrico David Bernardino, Luanda, Angola. The recruitment of patients begins, the conditions permitting, in early 2012. The criteria for patient participation is a child at the age of 2 months to 15 years who presents with the symptoms and signs suggestive of bacterial meningitis, for whom a lumbar puncture is performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis suggests bacterial meningitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Slow Initial β-lactam Infusion With High-dose Paracetamol to Improve the Outcomes of Childhood Bacterial Meningitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal objective of the study is to examine if mortality of childhood bacterial meningitis can be reduced by slow continuous infusion of cefotaxime combined with high-dose paracetamol orally for the first 4 days (instead of the traditional qid administration of cefotaxime without concomitant paracetamol). Children qualifying for entry (see criteria below), whose guardian has given informed consent,will be randomized into 2 treatment arms (see details below)and receive the treatments in a double blind fashion (see details below). Primary and secondary outcomes (detailed below) will be evaluated according to predefined criteria and time points (see below). Results will be analyzed for all patients in ITT datasets and in prespecified subgroups (etiology, nutritional status, etc.) in both crude and adjusted analysis. The efficacy results will be expressed as OR with 95% confidence intervals.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility criteria: The study entry is assessed for all children at age 2 months 15 years who present at these centers with the symptoms and signs suggestive of BM, and to whom lumbar puncture is performed. Inclusion criteria: All patients whose cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) turns out to be cloudy, positive by Gram staining or latex agglutination, or shows at least 50 leukocytes per mm3, will be enrolled in the study. Participants: Exclusion criteria Exclusion criteria: 1. Trauma, or relevant underlying illness such as intracranial shunt, previous neurological abnormality (cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome, meningitis) 2. Previous hearing impairment (if known) 3. Immunosuppression, except HIV infection 4. More than one parenteral dose of a pretreatment antimicrobial. Children with oral antimicrobials are included, this information being marked in the FOLLOWUP sheet. 5. Active tuberculosis (if tuberculotic meningitis is diagnosed during trial, it will be included in intentiontotreat (ITT) analysis) 6. Known hepatic disease.</criteria>
