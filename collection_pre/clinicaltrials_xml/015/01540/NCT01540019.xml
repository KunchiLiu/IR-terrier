	<brief_summary>Denutrition, lost of weight and anorexia are present in many oncologic patients at any time of the disease. Anorexia is the spontaneous loss of appetite and many changes in the metabolism are made in this case, leading to this syndrome called anorexia-cachexia, that includes changes in the tumoral response and inflammatory pathways. The guaraná (Paullinia cupana) is originally from Brazil and Venezuela and has been used culturally for headaches, muscle pains, depression and others. As it has shown a good response and tolerability for fatigue, the investigators decide to try guaraná for anorexia. Patients will receive guaraná as capsules of 50 mg twice daily, for 4 weeks, and will be weighted and respond questionaries about quality of life.</brief_summary>
