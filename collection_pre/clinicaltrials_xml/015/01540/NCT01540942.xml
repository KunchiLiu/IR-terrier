	<brief_title>Impact of Disease Activity and Nutrition Treat on Postoperative Recurrence and Complications After Bowel Resection for Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators want to assess the impact of possible risk factors on intestinal resection and postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease (CD) and to evaluate the disease course. In our clinical treatments, the investigators found that perioperative CDAI and nutrition treatment may have same impact on postoperative recurrence and complication in Crohn's disease. The investigators design this study to test it. The study prepare to collect the clinical data of patients who need bowel resection for CD to analyzed. The investigators divide those patients into two groups (N,I group). They accept intestinal nutrition with the respective aim that get the inflammatory index (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Crohns Disease Activity Index (CDAI)) norm or nutritional index norm before they accept surgery. Postoperative recurrence and complications in patients will be recorded and compared.</detailed_description>
