	<brief_summary>Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common problem. Symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) are present in approximately 50% of patients with POP. For many women the accompanying symptoms of OAB are an important reason for seeking help for their POP. Surgical repair of prolapse may improve OAB complaints. Persisting or de novo OAB symptoms are strongly correlated with dissatisfaction with the final results of an operation for POP. The primary aim of this research project is to investigate the difference in prevalence (i.e. improvement) of OAB and bothersome OAB symptoms at 6 and 12 months after POP repair surgery. The secondary objectives are to determine changes in bladder function at 6 and 12 months after surgery and to identify predictive factors for persistence, disappearance or de novo symptoms of OAB after POP surgery. Women who present with POP and who will undergo surgical treatment will be evaluated at baseline before their surgery and will be followed for the duration of one year after surgery.</brief_summary>
