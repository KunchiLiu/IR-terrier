	<brief_title>Role of Melatonin Supplementation in Follicular Fluid of in Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Patients With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that causes infertility due to anovulation in women of reproductive age. Anovulation and also decreased oocyte and embryo quality may be cause of infertility in women with PCOS. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce oxidative stress which may be responsible for poor oocyte quality. The ROS generation from mononuclear cells is elevated in women with PCOS and a significant increment of lipid peroxidation products in women with PCOS has been reported. Melatonin is a documented powerful free radical scavenger and a broad spectrum antioxidant. It has been observed that a non-PCOS group co-treated with inositol, folic acid, and melatonin (Inofolic Plus by LO.LI.Pharma) results in a significantly greater mean number of mature oocytes, and a lower mean number of immature oocytes in patients with low oocyte quality history when compared to treatment only with inositol and folic acid (Inofolic by LO.LI.Pharma). The aim of the study is to evaluate the possible effects of melatonin supplementation on the main IVF outcomes during ovarian stimulation of patients with PCOS. From July 2009 to December 2011, 358 patients with PCOS (Rotterdam criteria) were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial.</detailed_description>
