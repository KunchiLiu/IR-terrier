	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate if the prior knowledge of the individual mesenteric vascular anatomy of patients represents an advantage in performing laparoscopic colorectal resections. The investigators want demonstrate that the three-dimensional reconstruction of colonic vascular anatomy, acquired with a CT angiography, may lead to a more effective and less extensive dissection and to a fewer intraoperative and postoperative complications.</brief_summary>
