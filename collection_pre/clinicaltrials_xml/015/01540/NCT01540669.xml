	<brief_title>Dose-Responsive Effect of Polydextrose on Whole Gut Transit Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given the promising, yet largely unsubstantiated, benefits of fiber supplementation, particularly polydextrose, on symptoms of functional constipation, the objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 2-week supplementation of a proprietary polydextrose fiber product, in a dose-ranging fashion, on whole gut transit time and gastrointestinal symptoms in adults with functional constipation.</detailed_description>
