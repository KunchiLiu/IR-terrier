	<brief_title>Controlled Human Malaria Infection by Intradermal Injection of Plasmodium Falciparum Sporozoites in Tanzanian Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) is a critical component of malaria vaccine and drug development and is an important element of any strategy for accelerating the development of new tools for malaria control, elimination and eradication. Until now, CHMI has been performed in malaria naïve subjects from countries not endemic for malaria using both infectious mosquitoes and recently, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ). Results from these studies report significant infection success in all study subjects and an excellent safety profile. The conduct of CHMI studies in malaria endemic populations will allow early understanding of responses to new vaccines and drugs in endemic country populations and for direct comparisons between previously exposed and non-exposed individuals. Performing CHMI studies in malaria endemic countries will reduce associated costs, speed-up the process of testing and substantially contribute to the acceleration of the malaria vaccine and drug research and development processes. This study to be conducted in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, aims to see whether people in endemic countries with minimal previous history of malaria are suitable for CHMI using PfSPZ Challenge. This study will also assess whether the success rate of the experiment is improved by lowering the volume of injection and increasing the number of inoculations. Hence, the study will contribute towards improvements in the CHMI studies using syringe and needle inoculation of sporozoites.</detailed_description>
