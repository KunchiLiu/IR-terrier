	<brief_title>Low Salicylate Diet in Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is clinically diagnosed in patients who suffer from allergy to aspirin, asthma, nasal polyps, and chronic sinusitis. Patients with AERD are often resistant to medical management of nasal polyps, and require multiple endoscopic sinus surgeries to manage recurrences of nasal polyps. Control of AERD can be obtained through aspirin desensitization, which consists of taking aspirin every day. However, there are substantial risks and adverse side effects to taking moderate amounts of aspirin daily. Furthermore, patients experience progressively worsening nasal and respiratory disease even with complete avoidance of aspirin and other NSAIDs. The active and major component in aspirin/NSAIDs is salicylate, which is also found naturally in some foods. Diet modification is a cost-effective intervention that has the potential to provide long-term remission of AERD. Our study will evaluate whether a low salicylate diet, which is a more cost effective and benign intervention with minimal risks, will improve nasal, sinus or respiratory symptoms, such as congestion, sinusitis, smell, or asthma.</detailed_description>
