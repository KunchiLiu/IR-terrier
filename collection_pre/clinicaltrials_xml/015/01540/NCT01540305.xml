	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were randomly administered either real (n = 12) or sham (n = 10) rTMS, once a day, 5 days a week, for 2 weeks. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated schedule. Subjects and scale-rater physician were blind to treatment status of individuals. Only the rTMS administrator was aware of group allocations. Treatment response was assessed by self-and clinician-rated scales before treatment, immediately after treatment and 3 months thereafter, with the same examiner following a subject throughout the study. All patients included in the study had failed adequate pharmacological treatment for at least 2 antiobsessional drugs. Their prescription drugs were continued without change in dosage regimens throughout the study.</detailed_description>
