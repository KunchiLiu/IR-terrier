	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, randomized withdrawal study comparing CNV1014802 with placebo in patients with trigeminal neuralgia who have successfully responded to CNV1014802 in an initial open-label phase. Patients will participate in an initial open-label treatment period of 21 days of CNV1014802 150mg three times a day (tid). Responders will be randomized to 28 days of CNV1014802 150mg tid or placebo. Following an interim analysis after 10 evaluable patients have completed the open-label phase, the dose regimen may be increased to 350mg twice a day (bid) for the remainder of the trial if the responder rate is less than 60%.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase IIa Withdrawal Study of CNV1014802 in Patients With Trigeminal Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to be randomised and enter the double-blind placebo controlled phase of the study, patients must satisfy at least one of the following criteria: - 30% or more decrease in number of paroxysms (either spontaneous, evoked, or both) - 30% reduction in the severity of pain experienced during the paroxysm (either spontaneous, evoked or both) - A Patient Global Improvement of Change rating of much improved/very much improved The response will be compared with the baseline recordings of pain made in the 7 day run-in period. If a patient meets one of these criteria they are termed a responder, and will be eligible to be randomized into the double-blind treatment phase. During the double-blind randomised phase, patients will be evaluated to determine if they meet the failure criteria at each clinic visit which will occur every 7 days in the double-blind treatment period. The number of failures on CNV1014802 versus number of failures on placebo during the double-blind treatment period will be the primary outcome of the study. Patients will be classified as a treatment failure if they meet one of the following criteria: - 50% increase in the frequency of paroxysms compared to the final 7 days of the open-label period - 50% increase in the severity of pain experienced in the paroxysms compared to the final 7 days of the open-label period - A Patient Global Improvement of Change rating of much worse/very much worse - The patient discontinues the study due to 'Lack of Efficacy' - The patient discontinues due to an adverse reaction or poor tolerability considered to be related to study medication</detailed_description>
