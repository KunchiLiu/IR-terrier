	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) practically requires moderate to deep sedation by a combination of benzodiazepine and opioid. Propofol as a sole agent may cause oversedation. A combination (cocktail) of infused propofol, meperidine, and midazolam can reduce the dosage of propofol and may result in a lower risk of oversedation. The investigators prospectively compare the efficacy, recovery time, patient satisfactory, and side effects between cocktail and conventional sedations in patients undergoing ERCP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cocktail Sedation Containing Propofol Versus Conventional Sedation for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ERCP patients were prospectively randomized into 2 groups; the cocktail group and the controls. For induction, a combination of 25 mg of meperidine and 2.5 mg of midazolam were injected in both groups. In the cocktail group, a bolus dose of propofol 1 mg/kg was administered and continuously infused. In the controls, 25 mg of meperidine or 2.5 mg/kg of midazolam were titrated to maintain the level of sedation.</detailed_description>
