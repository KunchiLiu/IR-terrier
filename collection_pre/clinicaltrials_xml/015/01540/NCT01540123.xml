	<brief_summary>Berry fruits are widely recognised as natural functional food products. They contain several different phytochemicals which have potential to modulate human health and wellbeing. There is however some debate regarding the mechanisms driving their health promoting properties. Despite the wide health promoting properties of fruit extracts reported in the literature, considerable interest over the past decade has primarily been focused on their roles in reducing risk factors associated with cancer and heart disease. Consequently, there remains a paucity of actual scientific information on their role in modulating brain functions, such as mood, learning and memory, any decrements of which have very negative impacts on the quality of life. Fruit phytochemicals from other sources have been shown to mediate both peripheral and cerebral blood flow. However, a modulation of cerebral blood flow has not been shown with berries as yet. Cerebral blood flow must be maintained to ensure a constant delivery of oxygen and glucose as well as the removal of waste products. The modulation of cerebral blood flow via supplementation of berry polyphenols could therefore be a potential way to positively modulate human cognitive behavior. The link between acute increases in cerebral blood flow and increased cognition is currently a little weak but it could give a good platform for long term behavioral and health benefits via increased cerebral/peripheral blood flow and decreased MAO-B activity. The aims of the study are therefore to investigate the impact of the berry extract on digital volume pulse, blood pressure and cerebral blood flow.</brief_summary>
