	<brief_title>Mindfulness-based Therapy in Chronic Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the current randomized waiting-list-controlled pilot study, we investigate a new manualized therapeutic approach, which is based on mindfulness- and body-psychotherapy and which has been specifically developed for the treatment of tinnitus patients (Tinnitus Atemtherapie; http://www.maria-holl.de/). Essential components of the treatment program include mindfulness, meditation, selfmassage, and breathing exercises. These components are intended to help patients use their inner resources to accept responsibility for themselves, become more self-sufficient and develop symptom acceptance.</detailed_description>
