	<brief_summary>This study compares the effects of depression screening and case management to usual care in cardiology outpatients with documented evidence of coronary heart disease. Despite strong evidence that depression is a risk factor for cardiac events, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of depression screening in cardiac patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depression Outpatient Cardiology Screening Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression and cardiovascular disease are highly comorbid, and depression is a risk factor for psychosocial morbidity, poor adherence to medical treatment regimens, physical inactivity, poor physical functioning, and medical morbidity and mortality in cardiac patients, especially following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The American Heart Association recently recommended that all cardiac patients be screened for depression in order to improve identification and treatment of this risk factor. Patients are screened for depression during an outpatient cardiology visit and those that screen positive will be contacted for enrollment into this study. Patients are then randomized to receive collaborative care involving the patient, the patient's primary care physician (PCP), the cardiologist and the nurse case manager, or usual care (the patient is informed he/she screened positive for depression and is advised to contact their PCP and/or cardiologist). The PCP and/or cardiologist are free to evaluate, treat and refer that patient to mental health services as they deem necessary. Patients in both groups will be monitored for depression severity and duration at 3, 6 and 12 months after enrollment. The course of their depression since enrollment or last follow-up includes remissions, new onsets, relapses, recurrences, and treatment will be determined.</detailed_description>
