	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the change of extravascular lung water (EVLW), cytokine and oxygenation parameters in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after alveolar recruitment maneuver.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recruitment on Extravascular Lung Water in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation is a prospective randomized control study. Informed consents will be obtained from all patients or their surrogates prior to the procedure of alveolar recruitment maneuver and PiCCO monitoring system. Patients and methods: From September 2010 to September 2012, consecutive patients with ALI/ARDS undergo alveolar recruitment maneuver will be enrolled at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan. EVLW will be measured by PiCCO monitoring system, alveolar recruitment maneuver will be setting by protocol under supervision of chest physicians and respiratory therapists. Serum cytokine such as endothelin-1, TNF-, IL-6, Tie-1, Tie-2, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2,VEGF and thrombomodulin will be measured.</detailed_description>
