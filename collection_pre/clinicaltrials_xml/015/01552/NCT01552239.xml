	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Modern radiotherapy techniques in a neoadjuvant setting have the potential to minimize morbidity and maximize efficacy. An additional boost dose can be provided locally by HDR-brachytherapy in patients with positive margins after tumor resection. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the safety and efficacy of a combination of modern radiotherapy elements applied to the tumor and small volumes of surrounding normal tissue (IMRT, IGRT; brachytherapy in case of positive resection margin) and see how well it works in treating patients with High-Risk Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Extremities.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic and radiographic proof of localized highrisk soft tissue sarcoma meeting the following criteria: Lesion originates in extremity upper extremity lesions may occur from the medial border of the scapula to tumors as far distal as the finger tips lower extremity regions include hip girdle tumors commencing at the iliac crest, excluding lesions arising from within the pelvis, and extends to include lesions as far distal as the toes AJCC Stage II or III disease (except T1atumors or N1) Primary presentation or local recurrence after biopsy or inadequate surgery resulting in residual tumor in crosssectional imaging Tumors must be considered resectable according to cross sectional imaging, or potentially resectable after preoperative radiotherapy ECOG Performance Status 02 Informed Consent Diagnosis of the following: Primitive neuroectodermal tumor Soft tissue Ewing`s sarcoma Extraskeletal osteo or chondrosarcoma Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumors) Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans Regional nodal disease or unequivocal distant metastasis Life expectancy &lt; 1 year Pregnancy Major medical illness that would preclude study treatment History of major wound complication or recurrent skin infection Known HIV positivity &lt; 2 weeks elapsed from prior surgery or cytotoxic chemotherapy persisting acute toxicities &gt; grade 1 in tumorbearing limb resulting from prior treatment with anticancer modalities Cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy or investigational agents concurrent to study treatment Prior radiotherapy to the site of present STS.
