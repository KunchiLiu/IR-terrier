	<brief_summary>Weakness and impairment of the upper limb is a common contributing factor to post stroke disability. Specially designed robotic systems have been developed to try to improve this. The investigators already know that their use helps improve limb function after stroke when it has been present for many months. The investigators do not know whether they can help early after stroke and enhance recovery of limb function, and perhaps prevent weakness becoming chronic. The investigators plan a randomised controlled blinded study to explore the benefits of robot assisted therapy early after stroke in 80 stroke survivors. Participants will be randomised by 7 days after stroke to standard care or to robotic therapy (40 participants per study group). Standard of care will be rehabilitation therapy according to local guidelines delivered by NHS multidisciplinary team. Robotic therapy sessions lasts approximately one hour and consists of a series of tasks in first the unimpaired then impaired limb. The robotic-assisted therapy will consist of a series of taks including circle-drawing, reaching targets and holding/moving against moderate resistance. Twelve sessions of therapy within the first 4 weeks after randomisation will be delivered. This study will take 3 years to complete.</brief_summary>
