	<brief_summary>Purpose To evaluate whether adding a transversus abdominis plane block in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine requirements during the first 24 hours postoperatively. Forty-six patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy will be randomized into two groups: 1. Group treatment TAP (n=23) will receive the following analgesia: - US guided transversus abdominis plane block performed with 40ml of 0.375% levobupivacaine (20 ml per side) after general anaesthesia induction, before surgical start - Morphine PCA with loading dose i.v. titrated by the PACU nurse if pain &gt; 5/10 at rest 2. Group control will receive: - Morphine PCA with loading dose i.v. titrated by the PACU nurse if pain &gt; 5/10 at rest Primary Outcome Measures: Morphine consumption (mg) (Time Frame: 24 hours) in Groups TAP and Control Secondary Outcome Measures: - Pain at rest and during movement quantified as Numerical Rating Scores (0-10) for pain when resting in bed and during cough during the first 24 hours postoperatively - Time to PACU dimission, evaluated as patient's achievement of a White's score &gt; or = 12/14 - Time to home discharge, evaluated as patient's achievement of a PADDS score &gt; or = 9 - Functional patient capacity as measured before surgery and whenever a White's score &gt; or = 12 will be reached (2minute walking test) - Eventual side effects such as nausea/vomiting</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After the start of the study, we had a higher drop out size than expected. We therefore added a 13% of patient to initial power calculation to compensate for drop outs. Total number of patients enrolled = 52 (46 + 6) Total number of patients who completed the study = 44</detailed_description>
