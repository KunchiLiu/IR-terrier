	<brief_summary>A comparison of three different devices using near infrared spectroscopy to measure the regional oxygenation. Both absolute values, reproducibility of measurements and sensitivity to changes will be estimated. The study hypothesis is that NONIN EQUANOX 7600 with sensor Model 8004CA, INVOS 5100c with sensor SAFB-SM and FORE-SIGHT with medium sensor have similar characteristics.</brief_summary>
