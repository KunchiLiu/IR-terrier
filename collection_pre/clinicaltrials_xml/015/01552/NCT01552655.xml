	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to elucidate the value of dual-time-point PET/CT in the recurrence of breast cancer and to determine whether the method is better than the modalities used in the standard work up. 150 patients with suspected breast cancer recurrence will be included. All patients will undergo dual-time-point PET/CT, CT of thorax and upper abdomen and bone scintigraphy. After completion of the examinations the early and the late PET/CT scan will be compared with each other, the diagnostic CT-scan and the bone scintigraphy. A verification of suspicious findings will be done by biopsy, if the area is accessible. If a biopsy cannot be obtained, the presence of recurrence will be verified with additional imaging follow-up to ensure the highest possible confidence. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative and positive predictive value (NPV/PPV) will be calculated for each modality (incl. early and late PET/CT).</brief_summary>
