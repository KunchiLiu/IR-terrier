	<brief_title>L-Arginine, Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Dimethylarginine (SDMA/ADMA) in Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication with severe implications deteriorating overall prognosis. Nitric oxide (NO)-signal transduction plays an important role in mediating renal damage. NO is produced by NO-synthase (NOS) with L-arginine as its substrate. Endogenous L-Arginine derivatives, asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginines (ADMA/SDMA), inhibit NO-production directly (AMDA) by blocking NOS activity or indirectly (SDMA) by blocking cellular L-Arginine uptake. It is well known that SDMA and ADMA are markers of renal function (SDMA) and cardiovascular risk (ADMA/SDMA) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Moreover, ADMA and SDMA possibly even trigger cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD. However, there is only little information about the regulation and the influence of ADMA/SDMA in acute kidney injury.</detailed_description>
