In addition, QGE031 levels in the blood will be measured and the effect of QGE031 on markers in the blood and skin will be evaluated. Comparisons of the effect of QGE31 will be made with placebo and also cyclosporine, a treatment already established as being effective in atopic dermatitis.</brief_summary>
