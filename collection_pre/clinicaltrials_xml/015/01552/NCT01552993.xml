	<brief_title>Registration and Treatment of Pain During Eye Examination of Prematurity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a feared complication of premature birth. If discovered in time, the disease can be treated, and impaired vision or blindness can be reduced. Premature infants are therefore examined regularly after birth. However, the examination is painful and stressful for the infant. Painful experiences might lead to a pathological stress response later in life and should therefore be prevented. This is a double blinded, controlled and randomized study where the infants are examined and assessed either with or without the use of paracetamol.</detailed_description>
