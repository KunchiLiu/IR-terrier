	<brief_title>Fidaxomicin to Prevent Clostridium Difficile Colonization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A novel approach to prevent C. difficile infection is to use compounds with activity against C. difficile as primary prophylaxis in high risk patients. Chemoprophylaxis theoretically can prevent C. difficile infection by two mechanisms. It may reduce transmission from asymptomatic C. difficile carriers by reducing the number of spores shed in the stool and prevent replication and subsequent toxin production of the organisms in patients at risk for C. difficile infection.</detailed_description>
