	<brief_summary>This is an open-label (both the physician and healthy volunteer know which medication will be administered), single-dose, 6- dosing period study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone (process by which oxycodone is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body). This study will consist of three parts that will take place over approximately 90 days. Part 1 of the study has 4 dosing periods, while Parts 2 and 3 have one dosing period each.</brief_summary>
