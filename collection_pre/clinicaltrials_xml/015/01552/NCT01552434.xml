	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Avastin (bevacizumab) and Torisel (temsirolimus) that can be given in combination with either valproic acid or cetuximab to patients with advanced cancer that is refractory. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied. Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels, which may help to slow or block the growth of cancer. Temsirolimus is designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells to die. Valproic acid is an anti-seizure drug that may be able to activate tumor-fighting genes, causing cancer cells to die. Cetuximab is designed to block a certain protein, called EGFR, that is thought to cause cancer cells to grow. This may cause cancer cells to die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab, Temsirolimus Alone and in Combination With Valproic Acid or Cetuximab in Patients With Advanced Malignancy and Other Indications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible, you will be assigned to a study drug combination that the study doctor thinks is in your best interest: - Drug Combination 1: Temsirolimus, bevacizumab, and cetuximab - Drug Combination 2: Temsirolimus, bevacizumab, and valproic acid - Drug Combination 3: Temsirolimus and bevacizumab Dose Escalation Group: You will be assigned to a dose level of your study drug combination based on when you joined this study. Up to 11 dose levels will be tested for Study Drug Combination 1. Up to 10 dose levels will be tested for Study Drug Combinations 2 and 3. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level of each combination. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found. Dose Expansion Group: After the highest tolerable dose is found, up to an additional 10 participants, called the "dose expansion group," will receive each study drug combination at that dose. Ovarian Expansion Group: Up to 14 additional participants with ovarian cancer, called the "ovarian expansion group," will receive Drug Combination 3 at the highest tolerable dose. Study Drug Administration: The study drugs will be given in cycles. Cycles will be about 28 days or longer, depending on any side effects you may have. You will be given bevacizumab by vein on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive it over 90 minutes. If you tolerate it well in Cycle 1, you will receive it over 60 minutes in Cycle 2. If you then tolerate it well in Cycle 2, you will receive it over 30 minutes in Cycle 3. As long as you still tolerate it well, you will receive it over 30 minutes in Cycle 4 and further cycles. You will be given temsirolimus by vein on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. During Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive it over 60 minutes. If you tolerate it well on Day 1 of Cycle 1, it will be given over 30 minutes for all future doses, as long you continue to tolerate it well. If you are taking Drug Combination 1, you will be given cetuximab by vein 1 time every week. The first time you receive cetuximab, it will be given over 2 hours. Every time you receive cetuximab after that, it will be given over 1 hour. If you are taking Drug Combination 2, you will take valproic acid by mouth 1 time each day in each cycle. The drug can be taken with or without food. Study Visits: One (1) time each week during Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine tests. - Urine will be collected for routine tests only during the first week of Cycle 1. Every 4 weeks during Cycles 2 and beyond: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests. After Cycle 2, you will have a CT or MRI scan after every 2 cycles to check the status of the disease. Ovarian Expansion Group: If you are in the ovarian expansion group you will have additional testing as follows: - You will have extra blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) drawn during Cycle 1. The blood will be used for biomarker testing. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug. This blood will be drawn: - Before you begin taking the study drugs - On Day 1 at about 1, 4, 8, and 24 -36 hours after the start of your first infusion - On Day 6, 7, or 8 - On Day 15 - At the end of Cycle 1 - You will have 2 core needle biopsies for biomarker testing during the screening visit and at the end of Cycle 1. These samples will be used to learn how the study drug combination acts in the body and to learn its effect on cancer cells. To perform a core needle biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed using a hollow core needle that has a cutting edge. - You will have a dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scan to check the status of the disease: - At screening - 24-48 hours after the start of Cycle 1 - At the end of Cycle 1 Like a regular MRI scan, the DCE-MRI scan involves passing part or all of the body into a long, narrow tube scanner that is open at both ends. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drug combination for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of colorectal cancer and a type of lung cancer. Temsirolimus is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of kidney cancer that has spread. Cetuximab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of colorectal cancer and a type of head and neck cancer. Valproic acid is FDA approved and commercially available to help control seizures. The combination of bevacizumab and temsirolimus is not FDA approved to treat advanced cancer. The combination of bevacizumab and temsirolimus with cetuximab or valproic acid is not FDA approved to treat advanced cancer. At this time, each study drug combination is being used for research only. Up to 216 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
