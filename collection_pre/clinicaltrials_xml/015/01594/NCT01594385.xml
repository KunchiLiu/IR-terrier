	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to test the effects of Seprafilm adhesion barrier on patients who are undergoing open abdomen damage control management for traumatic injuries when compared to no adhesion barrier use. Specifically, the researchers wish to study the effects of Seprafilm adhesion barrier on: - the number and intensity of adhesions, - whether there is any difference between treatment groups (Seprafilm vs. no Seprafilm) who go on to successful definitive abdominal closure, - rate of occurrence of secondary complications (such as abscesses) associated with short- and long-term beneficial effects of reducing adhesion formation,and - whether there is any difference between treatment groups regarding patient functional recovery.</brief_summary>
