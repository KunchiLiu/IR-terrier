	<brief_summary>Investigators intend to conduct a prospective randomized trial to compare vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral colposuspension to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy with sacrocervicopexy. Both surgeries are minimally-invasive surgical standards of care for uterine prolapse repair. Nobody knows if one procedure is superior to the other, as they have not been compared directly. The investigators hypothesize that there is no difference in objective, subjective, or cost-effectiveness between the two procedures for up to two years after surgery.</brief_summary>
