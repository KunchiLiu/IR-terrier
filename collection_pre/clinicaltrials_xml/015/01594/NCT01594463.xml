	<brief_summary>Late intrauterine growth restriction is infrequently diagnosed with an overall sensitivity of 40 % in low-risk pregnancies. In addition, late intrauterine growth restriction may be associated with intrauterine death and poor neonatal outcomes i.e. birth asphyxia and hospitalization in intensive care unit. The investigators hypothesis that a later third trimester routine ultrasound may be more accurate to diagnose late intrauterine growth restriction.</brief_summary>
