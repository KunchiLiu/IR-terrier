	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who have a high risk for serious suicide behavior will demonstrate a speech pattern that has a relationship to language patterns found in suicide notes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Linguistic Characteristics of Suicidal Patients in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In an average week the CCHMC Emergency Department (ED) evaluates 40 patients with suicidal behavior. Currently, there is no systematic method for assessment of suicide risk in these patients and often, emergency department staff are required to make judgments about the disposition of these patients without a full understanding of the patient's risk for another serious suicide attempt. This pilot project involves experts in child psychiatry, biomedical informatics, and emergency medicine to collect pilot data for developing a method to estimate the risk of serious suicidal behavior based on computational linguistics.</detailed_description>
