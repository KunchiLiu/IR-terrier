Thrombocytopenia&lt;75,000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count&lt;1,500/mm3, and/or leukopenia&lt;4,000/mm3 7. Severe hypercholesterolemia (350mg/dl) or hypertriglyceridemia (&gt;500mg/dl) (However, patients with controlled hyperlipidemia are eligible for the study.) 8. Use of other investigational drugs for 30 days before enrollment in the study 9. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years before enrollment in the study, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases 10.
