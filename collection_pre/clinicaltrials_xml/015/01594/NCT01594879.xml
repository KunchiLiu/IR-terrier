	<brief_summary>A prospective multicenter trial has been started in Korea to investigate the treatment efficacy of Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) plus Medroxyprogesterone Acetate(MPA) in Young Women with Early Stage Endometrial Cancer. The standard treatment for endometrial cancer is total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal cytology, and lymph node dissection. However, young patients who desire to preserve their potential for fertility may find this standard treatment difficult to accept. Therefore, the conservative treatment for these patients has remained a challenge. A number of studies have reported the effectiveness of hormonal therapy using systemic progestin in women clinically diagnosed with early endometrial adenocarcinoma at stage IA, grade 1, who want to maintain reproductive potential. In addition, several recent studies reported the use of LNG-IUS to treat patients at a high risk of perioperative complications who cannot tolerate systemic progesterone because of its adverse effects. Nevertheless, there has been no prospective multicenter trial that investigated the effectiveness of treatment with systemic progesterone in combination with intrauterine progesterone in young women with endometrial cancer. Therefore, the investigators conducted a prospective trial of the treatment of the presumably early-stage grade 1 endometrial cancer in young women who desire to preserve fertility by using oral MPA in combination with LNG-IUS. Young patients with histologically confirmed grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma that is presumably confined to the endometrium, who desired to preserve fertility potential go through LNG-IUS insertion and are administered MPA at a dosage of 500 mg/d concurrently. Follow-up and treatment response assessment were implemented at a 3-month interval with office endometrial aspiration biopsy with LNG-IUS in place and dilatation and curettage after removal of LNG-IUS. The primary endpoint is response rate. Secondary endpoint is to estimate the consistency of the results between office endometrial aspiration biopsy and dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Plus LNG-IUS in Young Women With Early Stage Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE: This prospective study aims to analyze the treatment efficacy of LNG-IUS plus MPA in Young Women with Early Stage Endometrial Cancer and to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of office endometrial aspiration biopsy with LNG-IUS in place compared with dilatation and curettage after removal of LNG-IUS. ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoints of this study is response rate. Secondary endpoint is to estimate the consistency of the results between office endometrial aspiration biopsy and dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) procedure. STUDY SETTING AND PROTOCOL REVIEW: This study is a single arm, prospective multi-institutional study. Its protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each clinical trial institution. PLANNED CLINICAL TRIAL PERIOD: Patient Selection and Enrollment: 24 month after IRB approval of clinical trial Institution. TREATMENT METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma that is presumably confined to the endometrium went through LNG-IUS insertion and were administered MPA at a dosage of 500 mg/day concurrently. Follow-up and treatment response assessment were implemented at a 3-month interval with transvaginal ultrasonography, endometrial aspiration biopsy with LNG-IUS in place and D&amp;C after removal of LNG-IUS. The biopsy findings are compared. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 1. General Name/Brand name: Mirena - SCHERING Active ingredient: levonorgestrel 52mg Description: Mirena is a hormone-releasing T-shaped intrauterine system. A removal thread is attached to a loop at the end of the vertical stem of the T-body. 2. General Name/Brand name:Farlutal tab. 500mg/ Pfizer Active ingredient: Medroxyprogesterone Acetate PLANNED NUMBER OF SUBJECT 39 patients with biopsy proven grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma that is presumably confined to the endometrium. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The primary objective of this study is to estimate the treatment efficacy of the oral MPA in combination with LNG-IUS in early stage endometrial cancer in terms of their response rate. The sample size needed for this estimation would be 39 patients after considering 10% of follow-up loss. The Secondary objective is to estimate the consistency of the office endometrial aspiration biopsy and D&amp;C. Kappa statistics will be used</detailed_description>
