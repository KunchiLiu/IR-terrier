	<brief_summary>This study aims to demonstrate that, when given concomitantly with a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) antagonist and a corticosteroid, a single 150 mg intravenous (IV) dose of fosaprepitant given on Day 1 is superior to the control regimen of 5-HT3 antagonist and corticosteroid only, in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC).</brief_summary>
