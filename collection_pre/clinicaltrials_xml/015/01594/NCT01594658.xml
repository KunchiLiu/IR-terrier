	<brief_summary>The venous ulcer due to venous insufficiency causes an important morbility to those people suffering from this condition. Most of therapies available under the obligatory health plan (POS, acronym in spanish) to date cover the cleaning of the ulcerous lesion and its medical handling using saline solutions, topical antibiotics and elastic dressings, implying an important intake from health resources due to its chronicity and the delay in ulcers healing, which usually takes periods ranging from 6 months to several years. therapeutical alternatives, which can guarantee optimal, fast and persistent in time healings, should be identified. The aim of this study is to determine the percentage of healing of active venous ulcers (using a clinical, etiological, anatomic and physiopathologic classification (CEAP), C6) following ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy of superficial venous reflux in patients with chronic venous ulceration after six months from the intervention, compared with conservative medical handling. The investigators expect that the ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy of superficial venous reflux will diminish the time of ulcer healing compared with standard handling.</brief_summary>
