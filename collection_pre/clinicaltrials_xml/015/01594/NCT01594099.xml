	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Cervical Cancer in Elderly Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concurrent radiotherapy is the standard treatment of inoperable cervical cancer .Due to the physical conditions, elderly patients usually associated with medical complications, so generally just receive radiotherapy alone. Recently, some retrospective studies have shown that the impact of chemotherapy did not cause an increase in the complication rate among elderly patients as compared to younger patients with cervical cancer, and may improve the survival when concurrent with radiotherapy. Cisplatin and paclitaxel are two effective drug in treating cervical cancer, but whether they are safe enough for elderly when concurrent with radiotherapy, there are no clearly reports. In this study ,we replace the conventional dose chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin or lipsome paclitaxel , to compare the efficiency and safety of weekly cisplatin / liposome paclitaxel concurrent chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone in the treatment of cervical cancer in elderly patients.</detailed_description>
