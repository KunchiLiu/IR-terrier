	<brief_summary>Induction of general anesthesia induces frequently arterial hypotension. The short term goal of this study is to evaluate if preemptive volume loading prevents such complication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Preemptive Volume Loading to Prevent Arterial Hypotension During Induction of General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, prospective study which will include a total of 200 patients who are scheduled to undergo elective surgery. The research participants will be randomly assigned to - a control group that will receive a low preemptive volume loading (50 mL of gelatin), - a protocol group that will receive a high preemptive volume loading (500 mL of gelatin). Volume loading is preceded by the measurement of stroke volume and cardiac output before and after a passive leg elevation test and followed by a standardized anesthetic protocol.</detailed_description>
