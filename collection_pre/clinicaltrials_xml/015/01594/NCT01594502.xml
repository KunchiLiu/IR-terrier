	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to apply cutting-edge imaging approaches, incorporating machine-learning for pattern recognition and multispectral analysis, to the development and validation of intermediate endpoint biomarkers in benign tissue that characterize the response to 5α-reductase inhibitor chemoprevention as well as the risk of prostate cancer among men with negative biopsies.</brief_summary>
