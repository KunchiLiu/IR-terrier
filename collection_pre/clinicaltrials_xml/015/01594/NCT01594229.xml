	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary efficacy of ABT-199 in combination with Bendamustine/Rituximab in approximately 60 subjects with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-199 in approximately 60 subjects when administered in combination with Bendamustine/Rituximab following a dose escalation scheme, with the objective of defining the dose limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must have histologically documented diagnosis of nonHodgkin's lymphoma as defined by a Bcell neoplasm in the World Health Organization classification scheme except as noted in exclusion criteria. Subject (nondiffuse large Bcell lymphoma) must have relapsed or refractory nonHodgkin's lymphoma, and require treatment in the opinion of the investigator. Subject with diffuse large Bcell lymphoma must have relapsed diffuse large Bcell lymphoma or must have progressed after salvage therapy (with or without standard chemotherapy) for diffuse large Bcell lymphoma. The subject must have received first line therapy with RituximabCyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunomycin, Vincristine (Oncovin), Prednisone (RCHOP) [or a similar standard rituximabcontaining frontline chemoimmunotherapy regimen including, but not limited to Etoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine (Oncovin), Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin (Hydrochloride) + Rituximab (EPOCH + R); Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide, Procarbazine, Prednisone (RCEPP); Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Mitoxantrone (Novantrone), Vincristine (Oncovin), Prednisone (RCNOP); DoseadjustedEtoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine(Oncovin), Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin (Hydrocloride) (DAEPOCH); and Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide, Vincristine (Oncovin), Prednisone (RCEOP)]. Subject must have adequate coagulation, renal, and hepatic function, per laboratory reference range at Screening. Subject has been diagnosed with PostTransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease, Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkittlike lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Subject has refractory diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, defined as meeting any of the following criteria: Subject progressed during or within 3 months of completion of a planned course of firstline therapy with RituximabCyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunomycin, Vincristine (Oncovin), Prednisone (RCHOP) or an equivalent regimen; Subject had no response (i.e., stable disease only) to firstline therapy with RCyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunomycin, Vincristine (Oncovin), Prednisone (RCHOP) or an equivalent regimen; Subject progressed during or within 2 months of completion of their last planned course of salvage therapy with chemotherapy (with or without rituximab, may include autologous stem cell transplant). Subject has tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subject has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class greater or equal to 2. Class 2 is defined as cardiac disease in which patients are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity, results in fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea or anginal pain. Subject has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, or hepatic disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this study.</criteria>
