	<brief_summary>The SIMBIOSE trial is a large multicenter phase III prospective randomized controlled single blinded trial comparing the use of biological mesh versus traditional wound care without biological mesh in patients with an infected incisional ventral hernia. The primary endpoint is 6-month infectious and/or wound morbidity. Secondary endpoints are wound infection rate at 45 days, 3 months and 1 year, recurrent hernia rates at 1, 2 and 3 years, postoperative pain, quality of life, time to healing, need for wound reoperation, impact of the cross-linked mesh structure, and medico-economic evaluation. One hundred patients need to be included.</brief_summary>
