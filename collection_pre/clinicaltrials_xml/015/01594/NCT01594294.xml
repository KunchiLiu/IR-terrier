	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the effect of the repeated usage of 2 different care systems (one hydrogen peroxide based cleaning and disinfecting system and one PHMB containing multipurpose system) with ACUVUE® 2® and AIR OPTIX® AQUA contact lenses worn on a daily wear basis for a 3-month period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Marketed Contact Lens Disinfectant Systems on Eyelid Tissues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was divided into 2 periods, a Screening Phase and an Investigational Phase. During the Screening Phase, subjects were fitted and dispensed with either ACUVUE® 2® (for current hydrogel wearers) or AIR OPTIX® AQUA (for current silicone hydrogel wearers) contact lenses and used COMPLETE® MPS Easy Rub® Formula to clean and disinfect their lenses. At the completion of the Screening Phase, the symptomatic status of the subjects was re-assessed. Those subjects who qualified proceeded to the Investigational Phase and were dispensed with new pair of study contact lenses identical to the lenses they wore during the Screening Phase to use in conjunction with the allocated study care product, CLEAR CARE® /AOSEPT® Plus or ReNu MultiPlus®.</detailed_description>
