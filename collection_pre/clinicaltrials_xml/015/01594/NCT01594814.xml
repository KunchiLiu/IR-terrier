	<brief_summary>Atrioventricular nodal reciprocating tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) are two similar supraventricular re-entry tachycardias (SVT) emerging in relatively young age in patients without apparent structural heart disease or significant comorbidities. The treatment of choice in those patients is radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The PPRA study is a prospective observational study developed to thoroughly analyze quality of life, utility and willingness-to-pay of Polish patients undergoing RF ablation of AVNRT or AVRT. Based on collected data the investigators will prepare a profile of patient who will benefit most from radiofrequency ablation and who should be scheduled in first place for the ablation in case of problems with accessibility to this service. What is more an analysis of medical and indirect costs of care will be performed.</brief_summary>
