	<brief_summary>This is a device study in some respects, in that specialized centrifuges are commonly used to make platelet rich plasma, and we are studying the use of standard laboratory equipment to do so. However, it is primarily interventional in that we will evaluate the percentage success of trainees in the concentration of viable platelets to more than 4X baseline using a generic speed centrifuge and a single spin method.</brief_summary>
