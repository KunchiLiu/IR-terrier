	<brief_summary>Regular physical activity is now recognized as a key element of good physical and mental health and this all ages. MAIN GOAL : Evaluate the effectiveness of physical training associated with a cognitive training in improving the cognitive function of patients diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). DESIGN : Controlled randomized monocentric and prospective study with clinical benefit for the patient with three groups : one physical training and cognitive exercise group, one physical training without cognitive exercise group and one control group. In agreement with the literature on the effects of physiological stress on cognitive performance, the investigators expect the best cognitive test scores in groups with exercise training compared with controls (35% versus 80% error), and better scores on the MMSE, IALD, depression Scale, Index of Pittsburg sleep quality and quality of Life Questionnaire. Furthermore the investigators hypothesize that this positive effect is greater in the physical training and cognitive exercise group compared with the physical training group only.</brief_summary>
