	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached epidemic proportions and is rapidly becoming the one of most common causes of chronic liver disease in children. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is generally considered the result of a series of liver injuries, commonly referred as "multi-hit" hypothesis. Insulin resistance and increased serum levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) are considered the main primary hits that lead to the excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes resulting in steatosis. Has been reported that a diet rich in high-viscosity fiber improves glycemic control and lipid profile, suggesting a therapeutic potential role in the treatment of NAFLD. Aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of glucomannan in children affected by non alcoholic fatty liver disease.</brief_summary>
