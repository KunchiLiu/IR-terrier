	<brief_summary>1. Background: The ideal method to remove small colorectal polyps in patients who are taking antithrombotic agents is unknown. 2. Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate postpolypectomy bleeding and the complete retrieval rate after the removal by colon snare transection without electrocautery for small polyps in patients who are taking antithrombotic agents. 3. Design: A prospective, consecutive study. 4. Setting: Municipal hospital outpatients. 5. Interventions: Polypectomy by cold snare technique (Cold polypectomy) was performed for colorectal polyps up to 10 mm in diameter in patients who continue to take antithrombotic agents. The primary outcome measure was bleeding within two weeks after polypectomy. Secondary outcome measure was the complete retrieval rate of colorectal polyps based on the pathological examination.</brief_summary>
