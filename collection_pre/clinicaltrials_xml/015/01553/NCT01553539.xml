	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well therapeutic angiotensin-(1-7) works as second-line therapy or third-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic sarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Therapeutic angiotensin-(1-7) may stop the growth of sarcoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Funding Source - FDA Office of Orphan Drug Products (OOPD)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Angiotensin-(1-7) in Treating Patients With Metastatic Sarcoma That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the response rate of chemotherapy-refractory sarcomas to 20 mg per day of single-agent Ang(Angiotensin)-(1-7) or 10 mg per day of single-agent Ang-(1-7) if excessive toxicity is observed at the 20 mg dose. II. To evaluate toxicities associated with single-agent Ang-(1-7) when given to patients with chemotherapy-refractory sarcomas. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with Ang-(1-7). II. To evaluate accumulation of Ang-(1-7) after 21 days of continuous treatment and quantify changes in plasma levels of angiogenic peptides including placental growth factor (PlGF). OUTLINE: Patients receive therapeutic angiotensin-(1-7) subcutaneously (SC) once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
