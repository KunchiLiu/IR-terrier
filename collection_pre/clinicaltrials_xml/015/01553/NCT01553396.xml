	<brief_title>Muscle Strength and Functional Autonomy of Elderly Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the muscle strength levels and functional autonomy of elderly women with impaired muscle-skeletal system depending on the normal IGF-1 level. The target-population was composed by elderly women aged between 60 and 75 years (age: 67.79 ± 5.11 years, BMI: 28.01 ± 5.4), residents of an asylum, with IGF-1 levels within the normal values for the age (normo-IGF-1). Evaluations of the muscle strength (1-RM test) and the functional autonomy (GDLAM Protocol) in the performance of activities of daily living (ADL), and a measurement of basal serum levels of IGF-1 (Chemiluminescence method) were performed.</detailed_description>
