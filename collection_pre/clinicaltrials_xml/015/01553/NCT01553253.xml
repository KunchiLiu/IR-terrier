	<brief_summary>Chronic Pain is a wellknown complication after cholecystectomy. Intensity of the pain in the first week after the operation is a predictive factor for the development of chronic pain, but it is unknown whether the risk is more related to one of the different components of acute pain (ie somatic, visceral, referred). Furthermore the chronic pain has not been systematically described in terms of type of pain or sensory abnormalities etc. (allodynia, hyperalgesia etc.). The purpose of the study is to examine whether intensity of components of acute pain is predictive for development of chronic pain after cholecystectomy and to characterize the chronic pain by quantitative sensory testing. DNA-samples are collected to examine genetical factors, important for perception of pain, and the development of chronic pain.</brief_summary>
