	<brief_summary>This is an open label, multicenter, exploratory, single arm, two-stage study aiming to explore efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination (LD) as first line therapy in previously untreated patients with primary Plasma Cell leukemia (PPCL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint was response rate according to International Uniform Criteria; secondary endpoints were: i) time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS, and overall survival (OS); ii) percentage of eligible PPCL patients able to mobilize and collect peripheral blood stem cells after LD treatment; iii) percentage of eligible PPCL patients able to undergo autologous or allogeneic stem cells transplantation after LD treatment; iv) serious/severe adverse event (SAEs) rate.</detailed_description>
