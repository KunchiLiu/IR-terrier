	<brief_summary>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 5% of school-age children and 3.5% of adults worldwide. This condition is under-recognised in France and other European countries and, therefore, under-diagnosed. As part of the European Network for Adult ADHD, the investigators translated into French a structure interview called the Diagnostic Interview for Adult ADHD (DIVA). The investigators also translated rating scales such as the ASRS and the WURS. Validation studies are rare in France. The aim of this study is to include two groups of 50 adults whether they have or not ADHD with respect of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Revision 4(DSM-IV) criteria as implemented in the DIVA (i.e. actual at adulthood and past in childhood). Subjects have to fill out a booklet of questionnaires including the WHO's Adult ADHD Symptom Rating Scale (ASRS) (screening tool for actual diagnosis) and the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS, a screening tool for ADHD in childhood with respect of the Utah criteria). The investigator will be able to compare the actual criteria for ADHD between the ASRS and the DIVA, and the past criteria for ADHD between the WURS and the DIVA. Finally, an estimate of the prevalence of ADHD in adults will be computed.</brief_summary>
