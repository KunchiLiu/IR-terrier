	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well low-dose lenalidomide works compared with high-dose lenalidomide in treating younger patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or optic nerve pathway gliomas that have come back (recurrent), have not responded to treatment (refractory), or are growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressive). Lenalidomide may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether low-dose lenalidomide is more or less effective than high-dose lenalidomide in treating patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or optic nerve pathway gliomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose or High-Dose Lenalidomide in Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent, Refractory, or Progressive Pilocytic Astrocytoma or Optic Pathway Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the objective response rate in children with recurrent, refractory, or progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with Regimen A low-dose (20 mg/m^2/dose) or Regimen B high-dose (115 mg/m^2/dose) lenalidomide. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) (based on standard two-dimensional tumor measurements, determined by each institution) of children with recurrent, refractory, or progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with lenalidomide. II. To compare response categories and EFS across the 3 magnetic resonance (MR) sequences (T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR], T1-weighted post-contrast). III. To correlate steady-state pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (1 sample obtained between days 5-21) with objective response and EFS. IV. To evaluate toxicities of long-term lenalidomide use. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I (Regimen A): Patients receive low-dose lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II (Regimen B): Patients receive high-dose lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for approximately 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a body surface area (BSA) &gt;= 0.4 m^2 at the time of study enrollment Patients must have a pilocytic astrocytoma or optic pathway glioma that has relapsed, progressed, or become refractory to conventional therapy; patients with neurofibromatosis (NF1) are eligible Patients must have histologic verification of malignancy; histologic confirmation for patients with optic pathway gliomas will not be required Patients must have measurable residual disease, defined as tumor that is measurable in two perpendicular diameters on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); for a lesion to be considered measurable, it must be at least twice the slice thickness on MRI (i.e. visible on more than one slice) To document the degree of residual tumor, the following must be obtained: All patients must have a brain MRI with and without contrast (gadolinium) within 1 week prior to study enrollment; for patients on steroids, baseline MRI scans must be performed after at least 1 week at a stable or decreasing dose of steroids All patients with a history of spinal or leptomeningeal disease, and those patients with symptoms suspicious of spinal disease, must have a spine MRI with and without contrast (gadolinium) performed within 2 weeks prior to study enrollment Patients must have a Lansky or Karnofsky performance status score of &gt;= 60%; use Karnofsky for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky for patients =&lt; 16 years of age Patients must have been treated with at least one prior treatment regimen that included carboplatin; patients who have received prior radiation therapy for this tumor are eligible Patients must have recovered (to Common Toxicity Criteria [CTC] version [v.]4.0 =&lt; grade 1 unless indicated below) from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study, with the exception of alopecia, weight changes and grade I or II lymphopenia Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: must not have received within 3 weeks of entry onto this study (6 weeks if prior nitrosourea or mitomycinC) Biologic (antineoplastic agent): at least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent; for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur Immunotherapy: at least 42 days after the completion of any type of immunotherapy, e.g. tumor vaccines Monoclonal antibodies: at least 3 halflives of the antibody after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody Radiation therapy (RT): patients must have had their last fraction of craniospinal RT &gt;= 6 months prior to study entry and their last fraction of focal RT &gt;= 4 weeks prior to study entry; if the lesion used for onstudy criteria is in the radiation field, there must be evidence of tumor progression after radiation therapy was completed Study specific limitations on prior therapy: Patients who have received thalidomide are eligible if all acute thalidomiderelated toxicity has resolved Patients must not have received lenalidomide previously Growth factor(s): must not have received within 2 weeks of entry onto this study Steroids: patients who are receiving corticosteroids must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to baseline MRI Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000/uL Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/uL (transfusion independent) Hemoglobin &gt;= 8.0 g/dL (may receive red blood cell [RBC] transfusions) Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate(GFR) &gt;= 70 mL/min/m^2 OR a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows: 0.4 mg/dL (1 month to &lt;
