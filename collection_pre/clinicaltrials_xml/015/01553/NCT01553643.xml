	<brief_summary>Intracranial arterial prominent stenosis (IAPS) is one of main cause of stroke especially in Asia. Although antiplatelet aggregative or anticoagulant agent and even surgical operation are used to treat patients with IAPS, the incidence of stroke occurrence still remains high. In addition, symptomatic IAPS most common cause continuous deterioration, thus, increase the incidence of stroke. Therefore, there is a good method to reduce the inceidence of stroke that is to prevent the progressive deterioration of IAPS. Huang-Chi-Wu-Wu-Tang is made of Astrgalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Gge , Paeonia lactiflora Pall , Cinnamom Twig , Zingiber officinale Rose , Ziziphus jujube Mill , and can treat hemiplegia in the traditional Chinese medicine writings. Astragaloside IV is a component of Astrgalus membranaceus, may reduce th cerebral infarction area in middle cerebral arterial occlusion mice. The investigators previous studies have known that paeoniflorin that a component of Paeonia lactiflora Pall can decrease the cerebral infarction area and neurological deficit in middle cerebral arterial occlusion rats. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of Huang-Chi-Wu-Wu-Tang on patients with IAPS.</brief_summary>
