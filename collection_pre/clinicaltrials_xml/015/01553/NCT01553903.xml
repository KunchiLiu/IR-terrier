	<brief_summary>This is a biomedical study of interventional type which includes 29 patients on 9 months: 8 months recruiting and 1 month follow up. Patients with hormone dependent breast cancer metastatic or non-metastatic, for which an indication of hormonal therapy treatment (with tamoxifen or anti-aromatase) is retained, will be enrolled in this study. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility for the determination of Oxysterols (CT, CE, OCDO) in this patient population, before and after the initiation of treatment (ie, at D0 before and D28 after beginning of treatment).</brief_summary>
