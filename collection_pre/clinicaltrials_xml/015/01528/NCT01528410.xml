	<brief_summary>This is a multicentre, open, randomised, and controlled trial conducted in sixty (60) patients diagnosed with refractory or recurrent ascites. Patients will be randomised (enrolled) to either treatment arm A- implanted with the ALFApump System or treatment arm B-standard of care with evacuation large volume paracentesis. The main aims of the study are to determine the paracentesis free survival, defined as the time to the first large volume therapeutic paracentesis &gt; 5 litres. The secondary aims are to assess non-inferiority of cirrhosis-related complications in the group of patients randomized to the ALFApump system group, as well as nutritional effects, resource utilisation, patient quality of life and survival non-inferiority.</brief_summary>

Advanced hepatocarcinoma, defined as one which exceeds Milan criteria. 9. Obstructive uropathy, residual urinary volume exceeding 100 ml, or any bladder anomaly which might contraindicate implantation of the device. 10.
