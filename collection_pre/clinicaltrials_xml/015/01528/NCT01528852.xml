	<brief_summary>In a community-based controlled trial among children to evaluate if use of 4% Chlorhexidine cleansing solution on umbilical cord of infants in first 10 days of life results in - Reduction in neonatal mortality (deaths in first 28 days of life) - Reduction in umbilical cord infections (defined by moderate or severe redness of the cord) during first 28 days of life - Reduction in umbilical cord infections (defined by pus formation with any degree of redness) during first 28 days of life. The double blind part of study uses a control preparation without chlorhexidine (CHX) as control group while in the sub-study dry cord care group is also evaluated as second control. Hypothesis is that CHX group will have lower mortality and umbilical cord infections while control group and dry cord group will be similar as shown in a previous study in Nepal.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project Goal: The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of cord cleansing with Chlorhexidine in the first 10 days of life in reducing neonatal mortality and morbidity. The study would provide a proof of principle for an intervention that could easily be scaled up. Objectives of formative phase: - Using TIPS (Trials of Improved Practices) methodology to evaluate the acceptance and impediments if any to practice of using liquid solution for cord cleaning including washing of hands with soap before and after use. - To compare 3 modes (3 different packaging with application using cotton ball, dropper bottle and squeeze tube) of delivery for cord cleaning in terms of acceptance, ease of use and effectiveness in covering the target area. Objectives of the main Trial : Primary Objectives: In a double-blind community-based randomized controlled trial among 24,000 children to evaluate the efficacy of application of 4% Chlorhexidine cleansing solution on umbilical cord of infants in first 10 days of life compared to infants cleansed with a similar control solution without Chlorhexidine for: - Reduction in neonatal mortality (deaths in first 28 days of life). - Reduction in umbilical cord infections (defined by moderate or severe redness of the cord) during first 28 days of life. - Reduction in umbilical cord infections (defined by pus formation with any degree of redness) during first 28 days of life. Secondary Objectives: In a nested sub-study among 12,000 births (8000 from 24,000 double blind main study and 4000 additional births) randomized to three groups: Chlorhexidine cord care (n=4000), control solution cord care (n=4000) and dry cord care (n=4000): - To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of traditionally used "field definitions of omphalitis" based on a combination of signs and symptom in comparison to culture results using state of art sample collection/transport, culture and bacterial identification. - To evaluate reductions in bacterial colonization rates from a) umbilical cord tip, b) stump and base area in Chlorhexidine and Control Solution groups compared to currently recommended dry cord care.</detailed_description>
