	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of CBASP for Individuals With Co-occurring Chronic Depression and Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study examines the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) in reducing both alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms in adults who are chronically depressed and alcohol dependent. Participants will receive a 20-session course of CBASP psychotherapy over a period of 21 weeks and will be assessed for severity of pretreatment psychological abuse and trauma as well as pre and posttreatment interpersonal functioning. Two primary hypotheses are to be tested: 1) demonstrate that CBASP is effective in reducing depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-24 ratings) and alcohol consumption (drinks per drinking day) in this chronically depressed alcohol dependent cohort when posttreatment ratings are compared to pretreatment levels; and 2) demonstrate that acquisition of feeling safe with the therapist and acquisition of the ability to perceive the interpersonal consequences of one's behavior will significantly increase from pre to posttreatment levels and will be associated with reductions in drinking and depressive symptoms.</detailed_description>
