	<brief_title>Comparison of Bowel Cleansing Methods for Colonoscopy in Hospitalized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inadequate bowel preparation may lead to a longer colonoscopy, and to an inability to identify lesions. PEG can provide a rapid orthograde peroral approach to colonic lavage without producing significant fluid or electrolyte changes. Thus PEG is now commonly used for bowel preparation. However, large amounts and unsatisfactory taste of PEG solution are generally poorly tolerated, especially in hospitalized patients who had comorbidity and restricted ambulation. Recently, a new PEG-based bowel cleansing agents became available. It combines PEG with a high dose of ascorbic acid or bisacodyl. Although many studies reported the efficacy of these combined solution for colonoscopy, but efficacy in hospitalized patients was under-recognized.</detailed_description>
