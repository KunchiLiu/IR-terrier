	<brief_summary>In this clinical trial, the investigators want to know if cabazitaxel is more effective than methotrexate for patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in palliative treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Two Treatments in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal aim is to evaluate the efficacy of cabazitaxel in patients with palliative head and neck previously treated with platinum-based therapy. The study design is a non comparative randomized phase II trial: ARM 1: cabazitaxel (20 mg/m2, every 3 weeks) versus ARM 2 methotrexate (40 mg/m2, weekly). Cabazitaxel dose will be increased to 25mg/m2 for the second and subsequent cycles, in the absence of non-hematological AE &gt; grade 2 and hematological AE &gt; grade 3 during the first cycle. (maximum 10 cycles). The aim of the randomization is to offer a valid internal control group by avoiding possible selection bias. However, results obtained in the two treatment group will not be formally compared as this is not the objective of a phase II study. Tumor check-up will be performed every 9 weeks. Treatment will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities according to the patient or the investigator. A maximum of 10 cycles of cabazitaxel will be given.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiation. 2. At least one measurable lesion by MRI or CTscan according to RECIST 1.1. 3. Progressive disease within 1 year after first line platinumbased chemotherapy given either as a part of the multimodal curative treatment or in the palliative setting. 4. ECOG performance status 0 2, in stable medical condition 5. Patients must have an expected survival of at least 3 months 6. Paraffinembedded tumor tissue available for immunohistochemistry but not mandatory 7. Patients must be over 18 years old and must be able to give written informed consent. 8. Women of childbearing age or sexually active female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine within the 7 days prior to enrollment). 9. Patients must have adequate organ function (Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/100 ml, Neutrophils ≥ 1,500/mm3, Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, total bilirubin &lt;1 time the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 1.5 1.5 x ULN for age, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 1.5 ´ ULN for age , serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x ULN for age. 10. Signed informed consent prior to beginning protocol specific procedure. 11. Sexually active patients must use effective contraception during the period of therapy and up to 150 days after the last treatment dose. Acceptable contraception includes, but is not limited to: oral hormone therapy, partner vasectomy, or double barrier contraception (which is defined as a male condom plus spermicide in combination with either a female condom, or diaphragm, or cervical cap or intrauterine device) 1. Nonsquamous head and neck cancer 2. Nasopharynx cancer 3. More than two lines of chemotherapy for palliative treatment 4. Surgery or investigational drugs or chemotherapy within 4 weeks before study inclusion. Curative radiation therapy (6070 Gy) within 8 weeks. For palliative radiation therapy (i.e 8 Gy on a painful lesion) no delay is needed. 5. Previous treatment with cabazitaxel 6. Significant active cardiac disease including: uncontrolled high blood pressure according to the CTCAE 4 grading, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, or serious cardiac arrhythmias 7. Other uncontrolled illnesses (active infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders, uncontrolled diabetes …) 8. Previous malignancy from which the patient has been diseasefree for &lt; 5years, as other than SCCHN. 9. Previous treatments with taxanes and/or antiEGFR therapy are not an exclusion criteria. 10. Active grade &gt; 2 peripheral neuropathy 11. Active grade &gt; 2 stomatitis 12. Known brain or leptomeningeal involvement 13. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction (&gt; grade 3) to polysorbate 80 containing drugs 14. Concurrent or planned treatment with strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A/5. A oneweek washout period is necessary for patients who are already on these treatments. 15. Organic brain syndrome or significant psychiatric abnormality that would preclude participation in the full protocol and follow up.</criteria>
