	<brief_summary>It is well-established that myocardial infarction (MI) associated with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) predicts the poor outcome. Nevertheless, the cardioprotective therapies to limit myocardial injury after CABG are lacking. Previous studies have shown that curcuminoids suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and decrease the occurrence of cardiomyocytic apoptosis after cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in animal models. The investigators aim to evaluate whether curcuminoids prevent MI after CABG, compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
