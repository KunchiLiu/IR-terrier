	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to examine the efficacy of tart cherry juice on sleep quality, quantity, and timing. Naturally circulating melatonin is instrumental in regulating sleep/wake schedules. Tart Montmorency cherries (Prunus Cerasus) contain high levels of melatonin and may be a useful intervention to supplement for realignment of circadian phase and by increasing the robustness of circadian amplitude. In normal healthy adults, with experimentally induced phase advanced circadian misalignment, the administration of a 3mg supplement of melatonin significantly increased sleep architecture characteristics. In this study we want to examine the efficacy of tart cherry juice in increasing urinary levels of melatonin and the subsequent impact this will have on sleep parameters.</detailed_description>
