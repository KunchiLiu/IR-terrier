	<brief_summary>In children with excessive knock knees it may be necessary to use guided growth (small surgical procedure) so the child outgrows the condition before maturity. A new implant is on the market and the investigators compare this implant (8plate) with the old technique (staples) in a randomised setup. The hypothesis is that the 8plate provides a faster correction rate and that this treatment is superior to stapling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stapling Versus 8plate for Correction of Genu Valgus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Correcting angulating deformities of the lower limb is a subject of major interest in paediatric orthopaedics. Epiphysiodesis is the technique by which unilateral bone growth is stopped. Traditionally this has been performed with staple technique. The 8-plate technique is new and advocated because it is believed to reduce the risk of premature closure of the growth plate compared to stapling. The benefit of the 8-plate technique has not yet been proven in experimental or randomised clinical studies.</detailed_description>
