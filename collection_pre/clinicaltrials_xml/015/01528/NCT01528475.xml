	<brief_summary>This is a large pragmatic, randomized controlled trial comparing pre-hospital initiation of therapeutic hypothermia by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers to conventional post-resuscitation care. The goal of this trial is to increase the proportion of cardiac arrest patients that are appropriately treated in-hospital with therapeutic hypothermia to reach the target body temperature within 6 hours of hospital arrival. The investigators believe that EMS-initiation of cooling will be a powerful reminder to in-hospital clinicians to continue therapeutic hypothermia, and will lead to care improvements across a health system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initiation of Cooling by EMS to Promote Adoption of In-hospital Hypothermia in Cardiac Arrest Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a large pragmatic, randomized controlled trial comparing pre-hospital initiation of therapeutic hypothermia by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers to conventional post-resuscitation care. The goal of this trial is to increase the proportion of cardiac arrest patients that are appropriately treated in-hospital with therapeutic hypothermia to reach the target body temperature within 6 hours of hospital arrival. The investigators believe that EMS-initiation of cooling will be a powerful reminder to in-hospital clinicians to continue therapeutic hypothermia, and will lead to care improvements across a health system. This study builds on our previous work using large hospital networks hospitals to improve the delivery of evidence-based practice. The primary research question is as follows: Does pre-hospital initiation of therapeutic hypothermia by EMS providers increase the proportion of comatose out of hospital cardiac arrest patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) that are successfully cooled to a target temperature of 32 to 34 degrees Celsius within 6 hours of emergency department arrival, compared to usual post-resuscitation care provided in the field? The primary outcome is the proportion of included patients that are successfully cooled to reach target temperature of 32 to 34 degrees Celsius within 6 hours of emergency department arrival.</detailed_description>
