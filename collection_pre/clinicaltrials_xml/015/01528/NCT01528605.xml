	<brief_title>Effects of Lutein and Zeaxanthin Supplementation on Early Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an early hallmark of irreversible vision impairment accompanying with senescence of macular. Given the fact in treatment, prevention strategy is thought to be an efficient and robust approach to diminish early AMD patients in low-income countries, however, feasible cocktail provision in most developing nations remain mysteries. Here we proposed an effective cocktail treatment with different amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin could increase the macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and serum xanthophylls concentrations among randomized Chinese AMD patients; and might improve visual function measured by visual performance indices such as best-spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), contrast sensitivity (CSF), flash recovery time (FRT), multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and microperimetry.</detailed_description>
