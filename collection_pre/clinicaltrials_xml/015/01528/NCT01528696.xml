	<brief_summary>Obese patients undergoing cesarean section are at high risk for wound complications, which occur in approximately 20% of patients. This is a randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether the risk for wound-related complications can be reduced by covering the incision with a silver-impregnated dressing in the postoperative period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Silver Impregnated Dressings to Reduce Wound Complications in Obese Patients at Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study's purpose was to evaluate the effect of a FDA approved silver-impregnated dressing on cesarean wound complications in obese women. It was initiated and 37 women were randomized, but because of logistical barriers, we were unable to gather outcome data either by the intended survey or by chart review. When it became clear that we would be unable to complete the study, recruitment was terminated and further attempts at data gathering were stopped. While a small number of photographs were taken as intended, they were lost due to a technological failure prior to any analysis. Therefore no outcome data could be analyzed. Nonetheless, as patients of the University of Michigan Health System, all research subjects received health care treatment appropriate to their medical condition and circumstances.</detailed_description>
