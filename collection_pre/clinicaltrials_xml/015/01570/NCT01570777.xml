	<brief_summary>The DENER-HTN study is a, multicenter, prospective, open, randomized, controlled study of the effectiveness and costs of renal denervation in addition to standardized medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone in subjects with resistant hypertension. Bilateral renal denervation will be performed using the Symplicity Catheter - a percutaneous system that delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy through the luminal surface of the renal artery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The DENER-HTN study is a, multicenter, prospective, open, randomized, controlled study of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of renal denervation plus standardized optimal antihypertensive treatment compared to standardized optimal antihypertensive treatment alone in patients with proven resistant hypertension. Patients with essential resistant hypertension will first enter a 4-week run-in period during which they will receive a standardized triple combination therapy (diuretic+ ACE inhibitor+ CCB at maximal dose). After 4 weeks of standardized triple therapy patients will be randomized to renal denervation + optimal antihypertensive treatment compared to standardized optimal antihypertensive treatment if daytime ambulatory BP remains ≥ 135 and/or 85 mmHg. Bilateral renal denervation will be performed using the Symplicity Catheter (Medtronic ®) - a percutaneous system that delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy through the luminal surface of the renal artery. Study amendment: Extended follow-up of 48 months for all randomized patients.</detailed_description>
