	<brief_summary>Ivermectin is currently the best drug to cure strongyloidiasis, but the "standard" single dose of 200 mcg/kg is probably not enough to guarantee cure. As strongyloidiasis can be fatal in immunosuppressed patients, it is mandatory to define the optimal dosage to eradicate the parasite. Aim of this study is to define the most effective dose schedule of ivermectin to cure strongyloidiasis.</brief_summary>
