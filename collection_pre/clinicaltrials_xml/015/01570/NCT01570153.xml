	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a non-invasive monitor that measures how much fluid is in the body as well as various blood tests for their ability to predict worsening kidney function in patients with heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomonitoring and Cardiorenal Syndrome in Heart Failure(BIONICS-HF) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our specific aims are to: 1. Evaluate the individual and collective ability of pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), soluble (s)ST2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) for predicting in-hospital worsening renal function (WRF) in patients evaluated in emergency department (ED)with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF)compared to a model of clinical variables alone. 2. Evaluate the individual and collective ability of NT-proBNP, sST2, NGAL, and BIVA for identifying the correct cause of in-hospital WRF in patients evaluated in the ED with ADHF. 3. Evaluate the individual and collective ability of NT-pro-BNP, sST2, NGAL, and BIVA for predicting outcomes (all-cause death, all-cause re-hospitalization, initiation of renal replacement therapy by 180 days) in patients with ADHF.</detailed_description>
