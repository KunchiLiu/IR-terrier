	<detailed_description>Positively Smoke Free on the Web is the first web-based cessation program developed expressly for people living with HIV (PLWH) who smoke tobacco. It is a resource that is ready for clinical use, but its feasibility and efficacy have yet to be studied. Main study goals are (1) to evaluate the website's feasibility (i.e., recruitment, adherence, retention, and satisfaction) in a cohort of 69 PLWH smokers, and (2) to complete a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of the online program to standard care (total N = 138) with a primary outcome of 3 month point-prevalence abstinence.</detailed_description>
