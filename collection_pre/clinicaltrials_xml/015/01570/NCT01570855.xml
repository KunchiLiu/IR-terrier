	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to screen chemotherapy drugs currently used to treat lung cancer and determine the most effective treatment based on results of chemo sensitivity testing on the patients own cancer cells in the laboratory. The results of this screening will not influence the patients treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The chemosensitivity assay will be performed on tissue obtained during the diagnostic fine needle aspiration, core biopsy, or excisional biopsy of the lung lesion. Cancer cells (Bulk of tumor) and Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) will be isolated and expanded in the laboratory. The drug screening assay will be used to evaluate the response of the CSCs and of the cancer cells to the various chemotherapy regimens.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>suspected or confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer undergoing a fine needle aspiration, core biopsy, or excisional biopsy for diagnosis. Chemotherapy must be clinically indicated for treatment of the patient's qualifying disease Patient must be at least 18 years of age Patient must have signed an IRB approved informed consent form for the data collection study prior to entry of data into the enrollment form in the database. Patient pathology shows benign pathology for sample submitted Patient is not indicated to receive chemotherapy for their disease</criteria>
