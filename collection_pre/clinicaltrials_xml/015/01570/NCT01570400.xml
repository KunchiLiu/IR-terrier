	<brief_title>Treatment of Social Phobia With Combined Cognitive Bias Modification and iCBT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have shown that individuals with social phobia have attention biases, often focusing on or avoiding aversive stimuli (such as judging facial expressions) and thereby reinforcing the bias. Computerized training programs have been developed to implicitly direct the users attention. In this study, such a program -- combined with an established, well-researched and proven effective form of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) -- will be provided to 128 participants that meet the diagnostic criteria for social phobia, and the pre/post-measurements will be compared. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups, receiving one of two variants of the cognitive bias modification program (both receive iCBT).</detailed_description>
