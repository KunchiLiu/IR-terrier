	<brief_summary>By including in this study patients with significant worsening of their lung volumes and / or their DLCO (carbon monoxide diffusing capacity) in the previous year, on the basis of an open retrospective study we recently conducted, we hope to demonstrate that a strategy combining prednisone and intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy is accompanied by an increase in the frequency stabilization / improvement of lung volumes and / or DLCO of patients at 12 months of 15% in the placebo and prednisone cyclophosphamide 50% in cyclophosphamide and prednisone.We also hope to demonstrate significant decrease in the number of patients excluded for failure in the CYC arm as compared to the placebo arm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Systemic Sclerosis Associated Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized prospective multicenter study evaluating the efficacy against placebo of cyclophosphamide in combination with prednisone in the treatment of systemic sclerosis related interstitial lung disease. Patients will be allocated, after randomization into two groups receiving both corticosteroids: a group of patients receiving placebo of cyclophosphamide and a group of patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide will be administered IV at a dose of 0.7 g / m (maximum 1200 mg) every 4 weeks. In patients over 65 or if the creatinine clearance below 30 ml / min the dose should be reduced to 0.6 g / m². The duration of treatment with cyclophosphamide will be 12 months.</detailed_description>
