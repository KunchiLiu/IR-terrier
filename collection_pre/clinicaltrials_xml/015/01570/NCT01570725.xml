	<brief_summary>Background. Preoperative anxiety is a common problem for patients who undergo surgical operations, being often associated with a number of negative behaviours during and after the surgical experience. Since drug treatments alone have frequently proved to be inadequate to reduce stress and anxiety in surgical contexts, in the last decades there has been an increased interest in non invasive complementary and alternative medical therapies (CAM), including music, relaxation, guided imagery, hypnosis, etc. that reduce pain and tension during pre and post operative phases. Virtual reality can be considered an innovative form of e-health-based CAM therapy having gained recognition as a means of attenuating pain during medical procedures. VR reduces distress and pain perception by providing a particularly intense form of immersive distraction that taxes the patient's limited attention capacity, resulting in the withdrawal of attention from the real, noxious, external stimulus with a subsequent reduction in pain and stress. Objective. The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of a small, portable and immersive virtual reality system to reduce anxiety in a sample of patients who underwent ambulatory surgical operations under local or regional anaesthesia.</brief_summary>
