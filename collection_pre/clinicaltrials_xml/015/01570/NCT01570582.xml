	<criteria>Patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube cancer bokmakam or pathological diagnosis of recurrent states there must be must be present. Pathologically Serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, malignant Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS) have been diagnosed with possible participation. Patients with CA125 (biochemical recurrence), as described below elevation or clinically measurable lesions or the measurement is not possible, as there should be evidence of recurrence. If at least one (record as the longest diameter) can be accurately measured in at least one lesion that is defined. For each lesion, such as MRI or CT, when measured by traditional methods should be at least 20mm spiral CT (spiral CT) have been measured to be less than 10mm when. Neutrophil (ANC) by 1500 / ㎣ more Platelet count 100,000 / ㎣ more Serum creatinine concentration 1.5mg/dL (133mol / l) or creatinine clearance less than 60ml/min should be at least two. Patients must be at least 18 years of age. Patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube cancer bokmakam or pathological diagnosis of recurrent states there must be must be present.</criteria>
