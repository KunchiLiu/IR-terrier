	<brief_summary>Making a limb transiently ischemic induces ischemic tolerance in distant organs such as the heart. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety and initial efficacy of using briefly repetitive bilateral limb ischemic preconditioning (BLIPC) to protect the brain in octogenarians with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis.</brief_summary>
