	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to learn more about how children with mental health problems, including bipolar disorder (BD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), differ from children without these problems. The investigators want to understand how these 4 groups of children differ in brain activity, function, and structure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Imaging and Computer Games in Children With Either Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, Anxiety or Healthy Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has 2 visits (total time ~6 hours): Visit #1 (2-3 hours), includes: (a) detailed description of study and study consent, (b) interviews about the child's mental health, mood, and behavior, and (c) a screening IQ test (word games, playing with blocks). If a child fits our study criteria, they will play some special computer games, provide a spit sample for DNA, and parents/children will complete questionnaires. All children fitting our study criteria, will also be invited to complete visit #2 (2 hours) consisting of a special MRI brain scan at Brown University (Providence, RI). To make sure all children feel comfortable in the MRI, they will spend time in our practice MRI (i.e., "MRI simulator") that looks and sounds just like the real MRI. During the actual MRI, children will play a computerized game in which they can win and lose points. The MRI lasts one and a half hours (at most). Participants are compensated for their time.</detailed_description>
