	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is considered to be a major public health problem. The prevalence of OSAS is estimated at 2% and 4% for adult women and men respectively, most of whom are undiagnosed and untreated. The prevalence of snoring in children is high - 5% in the age group of 6 and less and about 1.5% above. The in-lab sleep study using full Polysomnography (PSG) and the manual scoring criteria set by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine was considered the gold standard for OSAS diagnosis. The high cost of in-lab full night PSG, together with long waiting lists for sleep studies, have led to the commonly used procedure of "split-night" for OSAS patients, as well as to the development of a variety of ambulatory sleep study systems. The primary study objective is to compare the efficacy of the WatchPAT200 (WP200), as an ambulatory device for aiding in the diagnosis of sleep disorders for subjects from age 5 to 90, to the manual scoring of the PSG that serves as a "gold standard".</brief_summary>
