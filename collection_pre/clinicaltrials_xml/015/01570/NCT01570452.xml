	<brief_summary>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been shown to be involved in cancer biology. Significant expression of MMP-7 (matrilysin) in colorectal cancer is mainly associated with metastatic disease even though it is expressed in most tumor states. Our purpose is to analyse MMP-7 in bowel and lymph nodes of different tumor stages and to evaluate its expression as a potential biomarker of cancer disease in patients surgically treated for benign and malignant colorectal tumors. Tumoral tissue, lymph nodes and serum samples from recruited Patients plus serum samples from healthy volunteers are analysed for matrilysin expression by histology, immunohistochemistry, ELISA and Western blotting. If Matrilysin increases with increasing dysplasia and cancer disease stage in tumor tissue as well as in the regional lymph nodes it might be used as a complement in investigating suspected locally advanced cancer.</brief_summary>
