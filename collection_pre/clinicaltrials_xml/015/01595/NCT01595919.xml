	<brief_summary>The objective of the current study is to determine the effects of an ad libitum intake of 1% milk, fruit juice, regular cola, diet cola and water, as part of a pizza meal, on meal food intake, appetite and postprandial blood glucose in healthy men and women. We hypothesize that 1% milk will reduce food intake and result in better post-meal glycemic response compared to the other beverages.</brief_summary>
