	<brief_title>The Diagnosis of Biliary Tract Neoplasm by Diffusion Weighted Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of diffusion weighted imaging(DWI) combined with MRCP of 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of suspected malignant bile duct diseases.People with suspected Biliary Tract Neoplasm based on clinical symptoms(such as jaundice and thinness with unknown reasons)and CA-199 value raises are included.Diagnosis divided into two steps: the first one，only provide conventional MR sequences and MRCP images to make a diagnosis; the second step,provide the DWI images additionally, combining the image data before to make a diagnosis.Hypothesis is that DWI sequence should be regularly added into MRCP examination for improving diagnosis rate of Biliary Tract Neoplasm.</detailed_description>
