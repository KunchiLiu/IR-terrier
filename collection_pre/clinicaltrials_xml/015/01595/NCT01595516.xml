	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that nebivolol will improve endothelial t-PA release in adult humans with elevated blood pressure to a greater extent than either metoprolol or placebo. The investigators further hypothesize that the improvement in the capacity of the vascular endothelium to release t-PA with nebivolol is mediated, in part, by the compound's antioxidant properties.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects will be men and women of all races and ethnic backgrounds aged 4565 years. Subjects will be prehypertensive/hypertensive defined as resting systolic blood pressure &gt;125 mmHg and &lt;160 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt;80 mmHg and &lt;100 mmHg. All of the women in the study will be postmenopausal and not receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) currently or in the preceding 3year period. Candidates will be sedentary as determined from the Stanford Physical Activity Questionnaire (&lt;35 kcal/wk) and will not have engaged in any program of regular physical activity for at least 1 year prior to the study. Candidates who smoke (currently or in the past 7 years), report more than lowrisk alcohol consumption as defined as no more than 14 standard drinks/wk and no more than 4 standard drinks/day for men and 7 standard drinks/wk and 3 standard drinks/day for women (a standard drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, 1Â½ ounces of 80proof distilled spirits). Potential candidates who are taking cardiovascularacting (i.e. statins, blood pressure medication and aspirin) medications will not be eligible. Fasting plasma glucose &gt;126 mg/dL. Potential candidates with a resting heart rate of &lt; 50 beats/minute will be excluded. Use of hormone replacement therapy. In hypertensive subjects, a seated systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or a seated diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg will be excluded.</criteria>
