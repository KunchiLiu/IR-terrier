	<brief_summary>Exposure to Mozart music significantly lowers resting energy expenditure (REE) in healthy preterm infants. Whether this finding is related to music per-se or to music by Mozart is unknown. The objective is to study whether J.S. Bach music has a lowering effect on REE similar to that of Mozart music.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bach Music in Preterm Infants: No "Mozart Effect" on Resting Energy Expenditure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Preterm infants at post menstrual age of 3037 weeks who were appropriate for gestational age, clinically and thermally stable, gavagefed, were eligible for recruitment. At the time of the study they were all tolerating full enteral feeding (150160 cc/kg weight/day) without significant gastric residuals (&lt;5% of total feed), they were all growing steadily, and had no electrolyte imbalance. All infants who were recruited successfully passed a hearing screening test prior to discharge (otoacoustic emission and automated auditory brainstem response) Infants with significant complications of prematurity such as intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leucomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, active apneas of prematurity, patent ductus arteriosus, active infection, electrolyte imbalance and major congenital anomalies.</criteria>
