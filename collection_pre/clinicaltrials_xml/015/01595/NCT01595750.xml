	<brief_summary>REVASC is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which will involve 150 patients with chronic bronchitis and COPD diagnosed cardiovascular disease. The recruitment period beginimg in the coming weeks, will last nine months. Patients included in the study will receive treatment for three months with roflumilast 500 mg (75 patients) or placebo (75 patients) in a randomized manner. The CIBERES, as promoter of this study is expected to release final results for the third quarter of 2013. Eight centers in Madrid will be involved in this clinical trial: Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Hospital La Princesa, Hospital Gregorio Maranon Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Hospital La Paz, Hospital Ramón y Cajal Hospital Doce de Octubre and Hospital Puerta del Hierro. Roflumilast is a potent phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (PDE4). Its clinical efficacy has been studied in an extensive clinical program involving over 12,000 patients with COPD. In these studies, roflumilast (in combination with long-acting bronchodilators) reduced the number of exacerbations and improved lung function, especially in those patients with associated chronic bronchitis.</brief_summary>
