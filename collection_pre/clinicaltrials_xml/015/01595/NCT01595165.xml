	<brief_summary>Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has gained popularity for the control of postoperative pain in various surgeries. Three studies showed inconsistent result on pain control after TAP block in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The TAP technique used in these studies was classic ultrasound guided TAP block. Besides periumbilical incision, sub-xiphoid incision is usually made during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As typical posterior TAP rarely extend above T8, the investigators undergo subcostal TAP block for this type of surgery. The investigators are going to investigate the effect of subcostal TAP on early postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</brief_summary>
