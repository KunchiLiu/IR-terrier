	<brief_summary>Studies in overweight and obese subjects show a decline in resting metabolic rate (RMR) even after moderate caloric restriction. Yet the onset and course of such a metabolic adaption is still unclear. Lower resting metabolic rates were also reported after gastric banding bariatric surgery but have not yet been investigated in subjects after gastric bypass. The purpose of this study is to investigate the consequences on resting metabolic rate in subjects with obesity after moderate caloric restriction or gastric bypass.</brief_summary>
