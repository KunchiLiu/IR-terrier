	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Stress Free Now: an Internet-based Mindfulness Program for Stress Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic, severe stress, a risk factor for premature aging and myocardial infarction, affects 35% of North Americans. Stress management programs, while effective, may be prohibitively resource intensive or difficult to access by broad populations. This research is examining whether an online stress management program - Stress Free NowÂ© (SFN) - can achieve meaningful improvements in measures of stress and wellbeing. We are also examining whether improvements in wellbeing and stress can be enhanced through an online, internet based support group which share experiences as they go through the Stress Free Now program. This program is modeled after an intensive group program, called Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which has shown benefits across a broad array of medical issues in addition to more specific stress related problems. This is a three arm randomized controlled trial which will last for 12 weeks. Participants will be randomized into one of the study arms: Non intervention Control, Stress Free Now and Stress Free Now + Message Board. We aim at enrolling 600 participants, with the expectation that 50% will complete the study (100 per group). A series of questionnaires will be collected at baseline, at the end of the 8-week program and at follow up at week 12. Outcome measured are stress, mindfulness, vitality, physical, social and emotional health, transcendence and self-acceptance. We will also ask participants to complete a weekly log to measure program adherence and usage.</detailed_description>
