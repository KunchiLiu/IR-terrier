	<brief_summary>The main objective of this protocol is to compare the impact on renal function of two different immunosuppressive regimens in patients with de novo renal transplant. Renal function will be accurately evaluated by measuring the clearance of iohexol. The protocol will also evaluate the efficacy and safety in a short term of these two different immunosuppressive regimens.</brief_summary>
