	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) as adjunct on non surgical periodontal therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 40 individuals will be selected and divided in two groups. On the treatment stage, the control group (Group C) will receive standard non surgical periodontal treatment. The Test Group (Group T) will be treated with PDT as an adjunct to non surgical periodontal treatment. The treatment will be repeated 4 times in two weeks, followed by dental prophylaxis every 15 days until accomplish 3 months. The follow-up will be done for 6 months. The clinical parameters measured will be: plaque index, pocket depth, bleeding on probing, relative clinical insertion level and suppuration. In addition, the evaluation of crevicular fluid volume and the levels of IL-1, TNF-Î±, subgingival microbiota by the hybridization DNA-DNA Checkerboard technique. The investigators expect to find identical or better results for the test group.</brief_summary>
