	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy with or without rituximab works in treating younger patients with stage III-IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma or B-cell acute leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibody, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy together with rituximab is more effective in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or B-cell acute leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Rituximab in Treating Younger Patients With Stage III-IV Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or B-Cell Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. For the patients with advanced stage B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)/Burkitt acute leukemia (B-AL) (stage III and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; twice the institutional upper limit of the adult normal values (Nx2), any stage IV or B-AL), to test whether adding 6 injections of rituximab to standard Lymphome Malin B (LMB) chemotherapy regimen, improves the event-free survival (EFS) compared with LMB chemotherapy alone. (Phase III) II. For patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBL), to evaluate the EFS following treatment with the regimen dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride (DA-EPOCH)-rituximab. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study the complete remission (CR) rate and the overall survival (OS). II. To evaluate safety on all study arms including toxic deaths, adverse events recorded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) version (V)4 (non hematological toxicity grade &gt;= 3, infections grade 3 to 5), cardiac toxicity (CTC grade 2-5 and evolution of left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular shortening fraction), number of days with platelets transfusion, intensive care unit admission and number of days with red cells transfusion, rituximab infusion reactions. III. To study the rate of patients with immunoglobulin (Ig) (G, A, and M) levels abnormally low and lymphocyte count abnormally low at 1 year and until 5-year follow-up, and to study the need for immunoglobulin infusions, and levels of post (previous and re-) vaccination antibodies at 1 year. IV. To study long term (at least 5 years) risks of the use of rituximab plus chemotherapy compared with LMB chemotherapy alone in children and adolescents with advanced stage B-NHL/B-AL (all events related [certain and probable] to therapy). (Phase III) V. To study the long term risk of DA-EPOCH-R regimen, especially the cardiac risk related to doxorubicin given at higher dose than usual in children, but infused over 96 hours (i.e., evaluation of CTC grade 2-5 and evolution of left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular shortening fraction). (Phase II) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain data on positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) scan in childhood pediatric B-cell NHL. (Exploratory) II. To evaluate the potential prognostic value of Minimal Disseminated Disease (MDD) and Minimal Residual disease (MRD) in correlation with outcome. (Exploratory - Phase III) III. To perform an economic study comparing the cost-effectiveness ratio between 2 therapeutic strategies: LMB chemotherapy with versus LMB chemotherapy without rituximab. (Exploratory - Phase III) IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of rituximab in combination with LMB chemotherapy in a subset of patients. (Exploratory - Phase III) OUTLINE: Phase II (patients with PMLBL): Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1; prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV on day on days 1-5; etoposide IV continuously on days 1-4; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously on days 1-4; vincristine sulfate IV continuously on days 1-4; and cyclophosphamide IV on day 5.
