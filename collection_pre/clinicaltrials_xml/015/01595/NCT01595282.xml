	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effect of pre-procedural ketorolac to ibuprofen on immediate post-procedural pain scores in patients undergoing first trimester suction curettage with local anesthesia only. Our primary hypothesis is that IM ketorolac compared to oral ibuprofen will result in an approximate 30% reduction in pain scores on a 21-point numerical rating scale immediately after the procedure. Secondary hypotheses include: - Pain scores on the 21-point scale will also be significantly lower in the ketorolac group immediately after cervical dilation and 15 minutes post-procedure. - Fewer patients in the ketorolac group will rate their pain as "severe" on a subjective pain rating scale. - Patients in the ketorolac group will be more satisfied with their pain control. - Side effects will be similar between groups.</brief_summary>
