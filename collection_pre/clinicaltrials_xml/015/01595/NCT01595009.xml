	<brief_summary>To provide everolimus to patients with p-NET, GI or lung NETs before potential everolimus approval, the expanded access study CRAD001K24133 was designed to provide treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until 30 May 2012, whichever occurs first. In this study, 60 patients with GI or lung NETs were enrolled in Germany and there are still approximately 40 patients benefiting from everolimus treatment. To provide the study medication to these patients beyond 30 May 2012, this open label extension will allow those patients who have been experiencing clinical benefit from everolimus treatment and who did not suffer from unacceptable toxicity to continue to receive treatment with the therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until study end on 31 May 2014, whichever comes first. Patients will be followed for safety and tolerability and for efficacy of everolimus.</brief_summary>
