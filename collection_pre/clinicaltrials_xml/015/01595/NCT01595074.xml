	<brief_summary>This research trial studies biomarkers in predicting treatment response in samples from patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Predicting Treatment Response in Samples From Patients With Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Adjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Validation of the 15-gene prognostic and predictive messenger (m) ribonucleic acid (RNA) signature on Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE)-Bio formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) tumor samples. II. Exploratory evaluation of the prognostic and predictive values of known potential oncogenic mutations using LACE-Bio FFPE tumor samples. III. Exploratory evaluation of the prognostic and predictive values of gene copy variations using LACE-Bio FFPE tumor samples. IV. Exploratory identification and evaluation of prognostic and predictive value of novel genomic aberrations discovered by Next Generation Sequencing on LACE-Bio tumor samples. OUTLINE: Archived RNA and DNA samples are analyzed for gene expression, mutations, and variations by reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), mass spectrometry (MassARRAY), molecular inversion probe assay, and microarray assays. Results are then compared with patients' clinical outcomes.</detailed_description>
