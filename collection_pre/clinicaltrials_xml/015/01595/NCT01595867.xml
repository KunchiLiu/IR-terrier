	<brief_summary>This was a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3 way crossover study designed to evaluate the relative abuse potential of crushed EMBEDAÂ® compared to morphine sulfate CR tablets and placebo in healthy male and female, non-dependent, recreational opioid users. An appropriate dose of morphine sulfate CR (i.e., 30 mg, 60 or 90 mg) was to be selected during Part A of the study (Dose Selection Phase). Each subject participated in the study for up to (approximately) 16 weeks and was confined in the clinic for a total of up to 12 nights.</brief_summary>

Diagnosis of substance and/or alcohol dependence (excluding caffeine and nicotine), as assessed by the Investigator using the DSM IVTR criteria. Has participated in, is currently participating in, or is seeking treatment for substance and or alcoholrelated disorders (excluding nicotine and caffeine). Has any condition in which an opioid is contraindicated; e.g., significant respiratory depression, acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia, or is suspected of having paralytic ileus. Allergy or history of hypersensitivity to morphine sulfate, other opioids, naltrexone hydrochloride, naloxone, and/or lactose.
