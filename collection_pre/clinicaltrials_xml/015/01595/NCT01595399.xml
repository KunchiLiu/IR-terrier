	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare heart rate in infants who receive atropine as a part of their medication before intubation to those who do not. To be able to find out , we need to divided babies into 2 groups; group 1 : receives atropine + sedation + muscle relaxant group 2 : receives water or saline ( placebo group) + sedation + muscle relaxant Then we need to compare heart rate during intubation and duration of intubation between the 2 groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atropine Versus no Atropine for Neonatal Rapid Sequence Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that premedication for intubation with fentanyl and succinylcholine alone will maintain equal stability of heart rate and oxygen saturation without a prolongation of time to completion of intubation when compared to a protocol using atropine, fentanyl and succinylcholine. In order to answer this question we plan to undertake a prospective randomized double blinded control trial of use of atropine as an adjunct for elective intubation of infants less than 46 weeks postmenstrual age.</detailed_description>
