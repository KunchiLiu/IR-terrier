	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that [18F]FDG PET is a a better method than clinical and laboratory values for the identification and assessment of inflammatory activity in patients with Takayasu Arteritis (TA), allowing long-term follow-up with a precise evaluation of response to therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact and Utility of PET Versus Clinical Score for the Assessment of Inflammatory Activity in Takayasu Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory activity and fibrosis are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with Takayasu arteritis. The investigators objective is to determine the utility of using 18F-FDG PET in the basal evaluation and follow-up of patients and compare the results with Dabague's clinical score.</detailed_description>
