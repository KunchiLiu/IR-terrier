	<brief_summary>Health care benefits and services are received through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), a component of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Over 40,000 Veterans across the Veterans Health Administration are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), a chronic condition that affects motor function as well as cognition, mood, sleep, and autonomic function. There are not enough subspecialists to manage every Veteran with Parkinson's disease. However, a care model of nurse care managers as catalysts and advocates using needs assessments, evidence-based protocols, and VHA and community access coordination mechanisms to optimize Parkinson's disease care may improve quality of Parkinson's disease care and patient-centered outcomes. If efficacious, this model may be practical to disseminate via an existing VHA national consortium network for Parkinson's disease. Objectives are (1) to implement then analyze via a randomized controlled trial whether a nurse-led, coordinated care management intervention, Care Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease (CHAPS), compared to usual care will improve adherence to evidence-based practice guidelines and improve health outcomes in Veterans with Parkinson's disease in a region of the southwest United States, and (2) to analyze extent of implementation of the CHAPS intervention and its costs to determine how the intervention can be made sustainable and disseminated throughout Veterans Affairs Medical Centers if efficacious.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial to Test the "Coordinated Care for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease" Intervention in the Veterans Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A series of investigations on Parkinson's disease (PD), following the Veterans Affairs Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (VA QUERI) process, have been conducted by the investigators' research team. This work has (1) developed and updated a comprehensive set of evidence-based quality indicators for PD care, (2) documented gaps in Veterans Health Administration-delivered care relative to these indicators, and (3) identified variations in care and factors associated with those variations. Under the Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development Nursing Research Initiative pilot study, the Task Force of several Veterans Health Administration and community champions including key clinicians treating patients with PD at VA Medical Centers in Los Angeles, Loma Linda, Long Beach, and San Diego, California; and Las Vegas, Nevada) and advocates from five local PD resource groups convened, developed, and refined assessment tools and protocols to achieve adherence to a set of 38 Parkinson's disease indicators ranked highest priority by the Task Force. A total of 26 Veterans with PD enrolled in the pilot study. Project staff administered the newly-developed PD quality improvement assessment tools to these veterans. Staff and enrolled Veterans provided ongoing feedback to refine the tools. In a 5-year randomized controlled trial, a total of 345 Veterans with PD have been recruited and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receiving 18 months of a PD care management intervention, "Care Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease" (CHAPS) or usual care. Eligible participants at Greater Los Angeles (GLA), Las Vegas, Loma Linda, Long Beach and San Diego VISN 22 (VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network) facilities are being identified through administrative data and vetted by physicians. The 18-month multi-faceted nurse-led intervention incorporates PD quality improvement (QI) tools to enhance proactive patient-centered care delivery. PDQI tools include a structured telephone assessment administered by a nurse to identify medical problems and unmet needs; problem-specific evidence-based interventions organized into treatment plans including follow-up/monitoring protocols; message templates and patient notebooks (Siebens Health Care Notebooks) to enrich communication with providers; protocols to engage patients, families, and the community to enhance VA and community care for affected Veterans; Veteran self-management materials; and a care management workflow MS Access database programmed with these care coordination tools. Research interviewers, blinded to randomization status, survey participants by telephone at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. The first 204 participants will be administered a 24-month survey to account for a delay in intervention implementation during Year 2. Study participants are thanked for their time to completed the surveys. Medical records will be abstracted at 18 months. Analyses will be conducted to measure quality indicator adherence, health outcomes, and health service utilization. A process evaluation to gain perspectives on implementation strengths and weaknesses, and a cost analysis to assess relationships between costs and program outcomes will be conducted, providing new knowledge to aid in future dissemination of the CHAPS program in a "National Rollout" according to the VA Quality Enhancement Research Initiative QUERI process.</detailed_description>
