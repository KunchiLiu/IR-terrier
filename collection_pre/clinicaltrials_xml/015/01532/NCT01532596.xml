	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test if an 8-week mindfulness meditation training (vs a wait-list control condition) program reduces neurobehavioral reactivity and improves affect regulation in a sample of older adults, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, we will examine if mindfulness meditation training reduces loneliness and markers of chronic inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is well established that mindfulness meditation interventions improve a wide-range of mental and physical health outcomes in stressed patient populations, although the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. It has been suggested that mindfulness training may reduce reactivity to stimuli and improve regulation, although these mechanisms have not been examined (using functional neuroimaging). Additionally, it is well-established that loneliness and inflammation are major risk factors for morbidity and mortality in older adults, although it is currently unknown whether mindfulness meditation training may reduce these risk factors. The purpose of the proposed study is to test if mindfulness meditation training (vs a wait-list control condition) reduces neurobehavioral reactivity and improves affect regulation in a sample of healthy older adults, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, we will examine whether mindfulness meditation training reduces loneliness and markers of inflammation. Participants will be recruited in the Los Angeles area and randomly assigned to the 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention or to a wait-list. All participants will provide a blood sample and complete a psychosocial survey before and after the intervention, and complete a 60-minute neuroimaging assessment before and after the MBSR program. All participants who are randomly assigned to the wait-list will be offered the MBSR intervention after the 8-week intervention period and then complete an additional post-test assessment after completing the MBSR program (which will include a blood sample, psychosocial survey, and a neuroimaging assessment). Participants will complete neuroimaging tasks (where they will be presented with words, pictures, and sounds) before and after receiving the MBSR intervention, which will assess neural activity and regulation responses before and after mindfulness meditation training.</detailed_description>
