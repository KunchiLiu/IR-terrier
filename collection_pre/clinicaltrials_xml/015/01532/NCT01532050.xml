	<brief_summary>The present research intends to focus clinically on selecting the right type of patient for mandibular advancement devices (MAD) therapy using screening tools such as advanced imaging and computational methods based on CT-Scan images as well as drug-induced sleep nasendoscopy techniques with simulation of the mandibular repositioning. The core of the research project relies on known and established methods accepted in several neighboring fields, but aims at the transfer of this knowledge by integrating it into this new domain. Doing so, the proposed biomedical research is directed towards clinical applications that incorporate innovative developments on the level of the diagnosis and therapy of a specific disease, being obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Furthermore, this study aims at registering objective compliance during MAD therapy.</brief_summary>
