	<brief_summary>Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is described as being a successful procedure. These results are often derived from clinical general shoulder examinations, which are then classified as 'excellent', 'good', 'fair' or 'poor'. However, the cut-off points for these classifications vary and sometimes modified scores are used. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is performed to improve quality of life. Therefore, disease specific health-related quality of life patient-administered questionnaires are needed. The WORC is a quality of life questionnaire designed for patients with disorders of the rotator cuff. The score is validated for rotator cuff disease, but not for rotator cuff repair specifically. The aim of this study is to investigate reliability, validity and responsiveness of WORC in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index in Patients With Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An approved translation of the WORC into Dutch is used. In this prospective study three groups of patients are used: 1.Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; 2.Disorders of the rotator cuff without rupture; 3.Shoulder instability. The WORC, SF-36 and the Constant Score are obtained twice before therapy is started to measure reliability and validity. Responsiveness is tested by obtaining the same tests after therapy.</detailed_description>
