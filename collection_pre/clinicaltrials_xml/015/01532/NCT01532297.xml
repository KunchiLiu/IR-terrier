	<brief_summary>Study investigating the safety and efficacy of the citrate dialysis solution compared to standard acetate dialysis solution. Use of citrate dialysis solution is not associated with a clinically relevant development of adverse events. It is hypothesized that citrate dialysate may provide a local anticoagulation effect in the dialyser improving removal of uremic toxins.</brief_summary>
