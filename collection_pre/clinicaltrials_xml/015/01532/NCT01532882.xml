	<brief_summary>Diosmin has a well established use status in improvement of the symptoms of venolymphatic insufficiency: heavy legs, pain, primo-decubitus restlessness and as complement treatment of capillary fragility. Nevertheless, diosmin 600 mg did not benefit from a rigorous clinical study versus placebo, to establish its efficacy in the pain relief in Chronic Venous Disease (CVD). The aim of this project led by Dr. Guex is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of diosmin 600 mg - DIOVENORÂ® on the painful symptoms of CVD of the lower limbs, in a multicentre, controlled, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.</brief_summary>
