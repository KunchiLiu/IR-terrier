	<brief_summary>The rFVIIa (Novoseven) has been tested in traumatic hemorrhage but its efficiency has not been proven yet in this context. A national register has been set up in France identifying the patients which received rFVIIa. Those patients had persistent and active bleeding after severe trauma despite surgery and/or interventional radiology embolization. The aim of this present study is to report the first clinical results in those situations of patients treated with rFVIIa.</brief_summary>
