	<brief_summary>Failure rates of up to 30% are reported after proximal humeral fractures despite angular-stable devices. This may devastate not only the functional outcome but also the independence of elderly patients. To increase bone mineral density and thereby holding-strength augmentation is an option. Autologous bone-graft, as current gold-standard, though is questionable in osteoporosis since osteoprogenitors are dysfunctional and the harvesting-morbidity considerable. Adipose tissue seems an alternative cell-source even in presence of osteoporosis. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells isolated from lipoaspirates display osteogenic and vasculogenic potential and can be harvested in high numbers. Expansion associated with costly good-manufacturers-practice facilities is avoidable, so are repeated interventions. These cells have been successfully used to generate osteogenic composite grafts with intrinsic vascularity in preclinical models. For translation into clinical practice after a 20 patient external pilot a prospective randomized controlled trial with 270 patients is planned. For the trial lipoaspiration precedes open reduction and internal fixation in individuals over 60 years presenting with a proximal humeral fracture after low-energy trauma. Cells are isolated (Cellution®800/CRS) and wrapped around hydroxyapatite microgranules after embedding in a fibrin-gel for augmentation of the typical bone-void. Clinical/radiological follow-up is at 6 and 12 weeks for immediate complications and after 6, 9 and 12 months. Functional assessment is performed after 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months using the Quick-Dash- and Constant-Score. The primary outcome is a reduction in secondary dislocation by 50% during the first postoperative year. Secondary dislocation is diagnosed on plain radiographs by an independent board certified radiologist specialised in musculoskeletal imaging if one or more of the following criteria are met: - More than 20° varus collapse of the humeral head fragment in relation to the humeral shaft - Screw penetration through the humeral head</brief_summary>
