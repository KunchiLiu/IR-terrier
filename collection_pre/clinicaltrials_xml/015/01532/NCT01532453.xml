	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to investigate the prevention of actinic keratoses and squamous cell carcinomas by local application of MD-3511356 in comparison to standard sun protection measures in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label multicenter, randomized, inter-individual comparative, prospective clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MD 3511356 sunscreen in preventing AK and SCC in post transplant immune-suppressed patients compared to standard of care. The present multicenter trial is intended to contribute to the evidence that daily sun protection will have a prophylactic effect in this high risk population of chronically immune compromised patients.</detailed_description>
