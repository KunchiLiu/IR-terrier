	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Topical AP611074 Gel to Treat Genital Warts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genital warts (GW; also called condylomas or condylomata acuminata) are lesions caused by infection of Human papillomavirus (HPV)(specifically HPV-6 or HPV-11 types, found in &gt; 95% of lesions). GW are sexually transmitted and affect about 1% of the sexually active population. GW represent a distressful condition for social and sexual life, especially in the cases of external condylomas. No HPV-specific antiviral treatment exists to date, and all existing therapies (either surgical or drug) have limited efficacy, with a significant level of GW recurrences and are associated with local skin reactions. AP611074 is a synthetic new chemical entity that is a potent and selective inhibitor of the interaction between two viral proteins from HPV6 and HPV11, an interaction that is a necessary step for HPV DNA replication and thus viral production. AP611074 is the "first in class" specific HPV antiviral described to treat condyloma caused by HPV infection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main Male or female patient aged between 18 and 55 years. External condylomas, 115 lesions, nonconfluent and individually isolated. Lesions must not be internal (ie, they must not penetrate the urethral meatus, vagina or anal canal); their visualization must be complete by patients and investigators without major facilitation maneuvers and easily documented by digital pictures. Lesions should have a total surface smaller than 5 cm2, and an individual surface smaller than 1 cm2; lesions should be easily measured using a "French Catheter Scale". Lesions to be treated should have appeared between 16 months before screening and patients should not have received any previous condyloma treatment since their appearance. For patients having previous episodes of condyloma lesions, they shouldn't have received any condyloma treatment for at least 12 months before screening. Main Patients with any history or presence of cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, metabolic, hematological, neurologic, psychiatric, systemic or infectious disease that, in the Investigator's judgment, prevents the patients from participating to the study. Patients with VIN or PIN (intraepithelial neoplasia of vulva or penis; ie, Bowenoid papulosis), or genital disease (ie, lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus, dermatitis, psoriasis, bullous diseases, systemic diseases with genital manifestations) requiring treatment. Patients with fibroepithelial polyps or scaly nonviral papillomas, seborrheic keratosis, follicular papules, syringoma, or circumscribed lymphangiomas. Patients whose skin condition or coloration would interfere with the observation and the followup of the lesions during the study. Patients for whom a proper followup of the lesions during the study will not be possible, because of hair growth in the treatment area.</criteria>
