	<brief_summary>The use of Event Related Potentials (ERP) and neurocognitive performance in patients following concussion has been examined previously in small cohorts and relatively long after concussion occurred. However, little is known about the immediate changes in brain activity in specific brain regions and connectivity across them associated with performance on specific neurocognitive tests following a concussion, and the subsequent changes over time. The proposed study will provide initial evidence for the feasibility of an ERP based biomarker for concussion reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as brain functional connectivity associated with concussion.</brief_summary>
