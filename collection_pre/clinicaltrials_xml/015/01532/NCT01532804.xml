	<brief_summary>This phase 2 trial aims to evaluate the continued use of bevacizumab with raltitrexed and oxaliplatin combination versus FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose disease has progressed after irinotecan-based chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>2nd-line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients are randomly allocated to receive either bevacizumab with raltitrexed and oxaliplatin combination or bevacizumab with FOLFOX 6 combination. Random allocation schedule is performed using a minimization technique for the following stratification factors: - Center - Number of metastatic sites: 1 versus &gt; 1 - Bevacizumab-based first-line therapy: Yes versus No</detailed_description>
