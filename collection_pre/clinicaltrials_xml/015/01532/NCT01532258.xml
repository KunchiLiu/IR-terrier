	<brief_title>Effectiveness of an Eight Week Online Mediterranean Based Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible participants will be identified by primary care providers or their staff at clinical outpatient site(s). Study is 3-arm randomized control trial where participants will be randomized to 1) Control group (CTL)-will not receive access to online program nor intervention for first 12 weeks; 2) GFFY-1-will receive access to online program without MA intervention 3) GFFY-2-will receive access to online program and MA intervention with weekly phone call. The core of the intervention is an 8-week Mediterranean diet and behavioral online program called "Go! Foods for You (GFFY)" which is offered on the Cleveland Clinic's 360.5.com website. The research will last for 24 weeks. Questionnaire data and biometric measurements will be collected at pre and post intervention (0-8 weeks) and at followup (12 and 24 weeks). Regardless of randomization, participants will be asked to provide their weight every week and an activity log at the end of each week of the program. A urine sample to measure F2-isoprostane will be collected at week 0 and 12 for GFFY-2 and CTL groups. A preparatory phase requiring the involvement of MAs to provide weekly support to participants is necessary to test process and communication with MAs. Enrollment of 10-20 volunteers for the preparatory phase is desired. Data collected during this phase will not be part of study analysis. To test data collection process, we may ask a few participants to complete baseline questionnaire only.</detailed_description>
