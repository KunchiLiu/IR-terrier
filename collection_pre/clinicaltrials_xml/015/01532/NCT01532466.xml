	<brief_title>The Effect of Priming Intravenous Rocuronium on Fentanyl-Induced Coughing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fentanyl is widely used for analgesia and anesthesia because of its rapid onset, its intense analgesic effect, and is associated with lessened cardiovascular depression and low histamine release. Although the cough reflex is usually transient and self-limiting, it should be avoided in situations such as elevated intracranial, intraocular, or intra-abdominal pressure, and unstable hemodynamics. The cause of FIC is unclear. One hypothesis is that vocal cord spasms might induce coughing because of fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity and histamine release. Muscle relaxants are commonly used to treat this condition. This study hypothesizes that priming muscle relaxants could prevent or suppress FIC. This study investigates whether the muscle relaxant rocuronium attenuates FIC effectively.</detailed_description>
