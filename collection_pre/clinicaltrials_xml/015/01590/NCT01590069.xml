	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is find the highest tolerable dose of interleukin-2 (IL-2) that can be given as an inhaled mist to patients with lung metastases. The safety of this drug using this administration will also be studied. IL-2 is a protein that triggers white blood cells, called natural killer cells or T-cells, to kill cancer cells. When given as a shot or by vein, IL-2 has been known to cause fevers and flu-like side effects, including rashes, fatigue, and extra fluid in the skin or lungs. These symptoms are less when IL-2 is inhaled as a mist into your body.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of IL-2 based on when you join this study. Up to 8 dose levels of IL-2 will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of IL-2 is found. Study Drug Administration: You will take IL-2 daily on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. You will not take IL-2 on Days 22-28. You will be taught in the clinic how to prepare the drug at home. To take IL-2, you will breathe the drug mist through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer machine, which will be provided. You will be told how to use the machine. You should bring the machine with you to the study visits. Each day you take IL-2, you will write down the date and the day of the study cycle. You will also measure and record your heart rate and the level of oxygen in your blood. You will be provided with a pulse oximeter to measure your oxygen level. Each day while you are on study, you will use a small hand-held device to test your lung function and answer questions about side effects you may be having. You will measure your lung function by blowing hard for 5-7 seconds into the device. The device will also prompt you to answer questions about side effects you may be having. The device will send this information to MD Anderson using your internet connection. This will be described to you in more detail, and you will be shown how to use the device. Study Visits: At all study visits, you will be asked about any drugs that you may be taking or any side effects that you may be having. On Day 1 of Cycle 1: -Before your first dose, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected to test immune function. On Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1: - Your medical history will be recorded. - Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 1 of Cycle 2: - Your medical history will be recorded. - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 and beyond: - Your medical history will be recorded. - Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 22 of Cycle 2 and beyond: - Your medical history will be recorded. - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw may include a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant. You may have a urine test if you are able to become pregnant. - You will have a lung function test. - The amount of oxygen in your blood will be measured by a pulse oximeter. - You will have a CT scan and x-ray of your chest. - Before your first dose, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected to test immune function. Your local doctor may draw the blood and you may be contacted by phone about side effects and medical history. The study team will explain to you how this will be arranged, if possible. You will have to return to the clinic before the start of each new cycle, to receive your study drug supply for the next cycle. End of Treatment Visit: Within 14 days after your last dose of study drug: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.This routine blood draw may include a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant. You may have a urine test if you are able to become pregnant. - You will have a lung function test. - The amount of oxygen in your blood will be measured by a pulse oximeter. - You will have a CT scan and x-ray of your chest. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.</detailed_description>

Patients must have recovered to &lt;/= grade 1 toxicity (except alopecia and hearing loss) from any prior chemotherapy, other investigational therapy, hormonal, biological, targeted agents. 7. No radiotherapy within 2 weeks: Exception: patients may receive palliative low dose radiotherapy (30 Gy or less) for lesions outside the lung at the discretion of the treating physician. Palliative radiotherapy could be given before aerosol treatment is started if necessary. 8. Subjects have to be able to read and understand English. 9. Patients with advanced cancer with resectable lung metastases. 10. Patients with sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, or melanoma or with known disease outside the lungs and/or thorax. 1.
