	<brief_title>Ability of Partial Inverse Agonist, Iomazenil, to Block Ethanol Effects in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol is abused commonly, but there is no antidote for alcohol intoxication the way naltrexone or naloxone is an antidote for opioids. A medication that has the potential to block alcohol actions in the Central Nervous System could act as a unique medication in the treatment of alcohol intoxication and alcoholism. This project is evaluating the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, iomazenil, as an agent that could reverse alcohol's effects on subjective intoxication, alcohol's effects on driving using a driving simulator and on measures of electrophysiology in the laboratory in healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
