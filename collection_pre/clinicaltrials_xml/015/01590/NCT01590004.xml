	<brief_summary>This study aims to develop a technical description of lumbar medial branch ablation using the LumbarCool system. The procedure uses cooled radiofrequency (cooled-RF) technology in treating patients with diagnosed lumbar facet joint pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Technical Description of Cooled Radiofrequency Ablation of Lumbar Medial Branches for the Treatment of Lumbar Facet Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label, single center clinical study to be enrolled at George Washington University Medical Center. This study will consist of 10 patients and each patient will be assessed at pre-treatment, pre-discharge, and at 1 and 3 months post treatment. Outcomes to be evaluated include: pain severity, disability, and the occurrence of adverse events.</detailed_description>
