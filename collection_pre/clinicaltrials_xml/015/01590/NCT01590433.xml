	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a study that will investigate the possible mechanisms of weight loss associated with exenatide treatment and the metabolic characteristics of high responders (i.e. subjects who achieve greater than 5% weight loss) to exenatide treatment. The investigators will also examine the magnitude and duration of weight loss among a cohort of high responders over 52 weeks of treatment, and at 3 and 6 months following treatment. Hypothesis: The mechanisms of weight loss with exenatide are not fully understood, and weight loss responses to exenatide are highly variable, possibly reflecting distinct metabolic parameters. By identifying and following a group of obese women who lose greater than 5% body weight after short-term exenatide treatment, the investigators can gain insights into the possible mechanisms of weight loss and assess long-term weight loss with this pharmacotherapeutic intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Outcomes The primary objectives of this study is: - To investigate possible mechanisms and patterns of weight loss with exenatide treatment, especially among individuals who have robust early weight loss (greater than 5% weight loss in 12 weeks) with exenatide. Secondary Outcomes Our secondary objective is to identify metabolic characteristics that predict robust response to exenatide treatment. Outcome measurements: - Weight - Body composition - Resting energy expenditure (REE) - Mixed meal test - Thermic effect of food - Serum metabolic parameters - Hunger/Nausea/Satiety visual analog scales (VAS) - Physical activity monitoring Study Population The study population will be generally healthy, non-diabetic women age 18-70 years with BMI 28-48 kg/m^2.</detailed_description>
