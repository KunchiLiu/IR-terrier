	<brief_summary>In this open-label monocentric explorative pilot trial the objective is to show the biodistribution of TNFα by administration of radiolabeled anti-TNFα in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and spondylarthropathy. The anti-TNFα used in this trial is certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®), a pegylated Fab'-fragment of a monoclonal antibody with high specificity for TNFα. Certolizumab pegol will be radiolabeled with 99mTechnetium. The aim of this study is to show the TNFα triggered inflammation process in the inflamed joints, especially in patients who have very early joint damage where currently other imaging methods such as X-rays are not sensitive enough for detection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS (5 PATIENTS) Age between 18 and 70 yearsold with documented diagnosis (clinical evaluation, xray hands and feet minimum 2 months before inclusion) of rheumatoid arthritis minimum 3 months and maximum 15 years according to ACR criteria 1987. At least 8 tender and 8 swollen joints with inadequate response to at least 2 diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) of which one is Methotrexate (MTX). Methotrexate must have been administered at least 3 months before baseline and doses and route must be stable for at least 2 months before baseline. Minimum dosage of MTX is 10 mg weekly and maximum dosage is 25 mg weekly. HAQ (Health assessment Score) score at least 25 at baseline and DAS 28(Disease Activity Score) &gt; 3.7 at baseline. All patients are biological naïve patients. Negative for Tuberculosis (TB) (also in history) and negative screening for TB (Mantoux test / xray thorax) Female patients must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year or must underwent surgery so that they cannot become pregnant. Women of child bearing potential must use adequate contraception throughout the study and 12 weeks after the last dose of certolizumab pegol. Patient need to understand the study and sign an informed consent form approved by the ethics committee before participation in this study. INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH AXIAL SPONDYLARTHROPATY (15 PATIENTS) Age between 18 and 70years old with presence of a documented diagnosis of spondylarthropathy according to current ASAS criteria valid for all of the 3 subgroups (early axial, early peripheral and established axial) 10 patients with axial SpA must fulfill current ASAS criteria for AxSpA and 5 of them need to fulfill the current modified New York criteria: Chronic low back pain &gt; 3 months and onset of age &lt; 45 years Active inflammatory injury on sacroiliac joints on MRI. Active inflammatory injuries are defined as oedema of bone in or around the sacroiliac joints, compatible with active injuries seen on axial SpA with STIR (short tau inversion recovery) MRI Inadequate response on previously, optimal use of min 2 NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) in a antiinflammatory dosage during 3 months or a medical contraindication for use of NSAIDs BASDAI score ≥ 4 5 patients with peripheral SpA must have presence of clinical peripheral arthritis or enthesitis or dactylitis with active disease activity, even under a stable dose of sulfasalazine during 3 months AND presence of one of the following: Psoriasis of skin Inflammatory bowel disease Positive HLA B27 sacroiliitis on image (Xray or MRI of the sacroiliac joints) all patients are antiTNF naive No active tuberculosis (in medical history as current) and negative screening for latent TB (Mantoux test and Xray thorax). Female patients must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year or must underwent surgery so that they cannot become pregnant. Women of child bearing potential must use adequate contraception throughout the study and 12 weeks after the last dose of certolizumab pegol. Patient need to understand the study and sign an informed consent form approved by the ethics committee before participation in this study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY PATIENTS Patients cannot have treatment with experimental biological and nonbiological therapy in the last 3 months or 5times the halflive prior to baseline visit Patients who had previously treatment with antiTNF Patients who had previously treatment with rituximab and/or abatacept Known hypersensitivity to certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®) or one of it compounds Current or recent medical history of progressive uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardial, neurological or cerebral diseases. Severe or life threatening infections in the last 6 months; signs of current or recent infection Active or latent tuberculosis: in case one or more of the 3 criteria are positive: medical history of TB, recent (&lt; 6 months) Xray chest or recent positive PPD skin Known history or current viral hepatitis B of hepatitis C Known HIV infection Malignancy or history of a malignancy History of lymphproliferative disease or signs/symptoms suggestive fort his disease.
