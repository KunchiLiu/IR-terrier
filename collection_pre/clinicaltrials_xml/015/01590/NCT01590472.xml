	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate the possibility that a person's genes put a person at a higher risk of developing mesothelioma. The investigators will examine genes from DNA (genetic material) isolated from blood. This study will also examine the impact of environmental and work exposures and family history of common cancers on the development of mesothelioma. The genetic markers in this study will basically identify how a person's body processes frequently encountered environmental pollutants and will not tell about chromosomes, specific diseases, or other potential health problems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Do Your Genes Put You at a Higher Risk of Developing Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mesothelioma is a cancer that develops from serosal surfaces usually in response to prior asbestos exposure. A history of asbestos exposure can be elicited in more than 80% of mesothelioma victims. However, asbestos exposure alone is not sufficient to cause the development of mesothelioma. Nearly 27 million individuals in the US, were exposed to asbestos in the work place between 1940 and 1979 but just 3,000 new cases of mesothelioma are diagnosed each year. Therefore, the investigators hypothesis is that genetic variation in addition to asbestos exposure, and host factors contribute to the development of mesothelioma. It is estimated, based on the investigators preliminary studies, that a population in excess of 1,000 subjects with mesothelioma is required to perform a valid GWAS. Therefore a multicenter approach is necessary to collect data and DNA on sufficient numbers with mesothelioma to adequately evaluate genetic risk. It is the aim of this proposal to develop a consortium of mesothelioma investigators to share phenotypic data and DNA samples and to perform genome wide association scanning (GWAS).</detailed_description>
