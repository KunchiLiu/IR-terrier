	<brief_summary>This is a three-part (Part A, Part B, and Part C), open-label, multicenter study of boceprevir in pediatric participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 (GT1). In Part A and Part B, efficacy and safety will be evaluated in participants with CHC GT1 who are non-cirrhotic, treatment naïves (Part A) or who are non-cirrhotic, treatment failures to (peg)interferon/ribavirin or who are cirrhotics (whether treatment naïve or treatment failure) (Part B). Part C is long-term follow up and no study treatment will be administered during this period, but participants who do not achieve viral clearance will be allowed to receive other treatments for CHC.</brief_summary>
