	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine if Vitamin C administration to septic patients will result in an improvement in organ dysfunction which occurs during a septic illness. Hypothesis: 1. Vitamin C in sepsis will reduce the injury to organs 2. Vitamin C will reduce the length of time on a ventilator, length of stay in the intensive care unit and in hospital.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will measure biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation and oxidative stress. These biomarkers have been shown to be increased during periods of oxidative stress eg post-operative, trauma, sepsis. The investigators will determine if Vitamin C administration decreases oxidative stress and as a result, a decrease in the markers of organ dysfunction eg SOFA Scores. Ultimately, if the investigators show a decrease in injury to organs, will this result in a better outcome for patients.</detailed_description>
