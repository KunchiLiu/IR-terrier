	<brief_title>Use of Epidermal Expansion System for Epidermal Grafting on Hypopigmented Skin and Surgical Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluates a novel micrografting technique to determine how it will influence the repigmentation of selected areas of hypopigmentation, and how it will influence the healing and pigmentation of surgical skin wounds. The Epidermal Expansion System (designed by MoMelan Technologies) will generate an array of small microblisters and transfer the micrografts to a sterile FDA cleared wound dressing for application to the subject's acute wound or prepared recipient site. The sponsor hypothesizes that applying expanded micrografts to target sites will result in rapid healing of acute wounds and in repigmentation of hypopigmented skin as well as and provide improved cosmetic outcomes.</detailed_description>
