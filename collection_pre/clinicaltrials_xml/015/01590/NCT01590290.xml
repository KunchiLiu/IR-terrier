	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a pay for performance model in contrast to the traditional "fee for service" model may improve the number of patients discharged being treated in accordance with Joint Commission on Health Care JCAHO (a non-for profit organization that accredits health care organizations) standards and standard of care for management of hyperlipidemia In this study the investigators will evaluate these two models by training resident physicians (doctors in training) on JCAHO core measures and specific criteria related to accepted standard of care for acute myocardial infarction and heart failure. The physicians will be randomized to a pay for performance or a fee for service model. Then a medical record review will be performed on patient records that received a discharge diagnosis of myocardial infarction or heart failure and were cared for by the physician subjects</brief_summary>
