	<brief_summary>Clinical alopecia occurs due to miniaturization of the hair shafts as well as loss of active production of hair shafts. PRFM has been shown to induce dermal angiogenesis, and anecdotal findings of improvement of hair appearance after PRFM injection in the scalp suggest that PRFM may play a role in the treatment of thinning hair. Patients will be treated on a monthly basis with intradermal injections of autologous PRFM for 3 months. Changes in hair density will be assessed by comparing pre- and post-treatment photographs and non-invasive measurements of hair density at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 months after initial treatment.</brief_summary>
