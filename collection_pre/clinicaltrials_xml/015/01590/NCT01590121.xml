	<brief_summary>Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a condition in which sufferers have abnormal blood vessels which makes them more likely to bleed than other people, particularly in the lungs, which results in low blood oxygen levels. Flying may make this worse and cause problems. The investigators want to know if there are an increased number of problems on flights compared to on land. The investigators currently do not have any evidence based guidelines on air travel to best advice people who suffer with HHT. The investigators would therefore like to ask individuals who have HHT about their experience on a flight, using a postal questionnaire.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia Flight Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) previously reviewed at HHTIC London will be sent an invitation to participate in a short questionnaire study. Quantitative variables from the questionnaires for statistical analysis will be the number of individuals responding (and number of questionnaires sent out); number of flights taken and number of complications, subgrouped by type, and flight duration in hours. Complication rates will be expressed as proportion of person flight hours. The quantitative data from the questionnaire will then be compared with quantitative data from patients' medical records using non parametric methods such as Mann Whitney for univariate analyses.</detailed_description>
