	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to demonstrate the clinical benefits of diclofenac (added to standard anticoagulant therapy) over placebo in normotensive patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism and right ventricular dysfunction. The secondary objective is to assess the safety after administration of diclofenac in normotensive patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism and right ventricular dysfunction.</brief_summary>
