Another requirement was disease progression, as indicated by increasing serum levels of PSA on three consecutive measurements obtained at least one week apart or findings on physical examination or imaging studies. 4. Normal cardiac function was required. 1. patients had a Karnofsky performancestatus score of at most 60 percent 2. prior treatment with cytotoxic agents or radioisotopes 3. with history of another cancer within the preceding five years, brain or leptomeningeal metastases, symptomatic peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or higher, and other serious medical condition.</criteria>
