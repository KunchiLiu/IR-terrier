	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to show that the variation of the subaortic velocity time integral after a mini test by filling 100 cc of normal saline over 1 minute (ΔITV100) is predictive of response to filling (defined as an increase in aortic velocity time integral measured by transthoracic ultrasound over 15% after administration of 500 cc of normal saline over 15 minutes) in non-ventilated shock patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study include: - To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the variation of the velocity time integral after administration of 100 cc of normal saline over 1 minute (ΔITV100) to predict the response to the filling. - To study the inter-observer variation of ΔITV100 measurement. - To compare ΔITV100 to other clinical and radiological parameters for predicting response to filling (initial value of the subaortic velocity time integral, variation in mitral E wave, E / A, respiratory variation of the diameter of the inferior vena cava, marbling clinical evolution score.</detailed_description>
