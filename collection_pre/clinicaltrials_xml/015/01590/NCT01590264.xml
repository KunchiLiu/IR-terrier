	<brief_summary>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a novel brain stimulation technique that uses pulsating magnetic fields to stimulate underlying neurons in the cerebral cortex. The investigators propose an open-label pilot study investigating the effectiveness of rTMS in the treatment of tinnitus stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area known to be important for mood and attention, along with stimulation of the left temporoparietal cortex (TPC). This is a feasibility pilot study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS Bimodal Treatment For Tinnitus: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Converging data implicate structures of the brain that are important for mood and attention as playing a role in the maintenance of tinnitus; suggesting an alternative rTMS treatment approach that targets these structures. A growing number of studies demonstrate involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. rTMS stimulation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in association with stimulation in the temporoparietal cortex has been shown to increase the durability of the TPC stimulation. The independent effect of rTMS stimulation to the DLPFC is not known. Studies in depression suggest that increasing the intensity and duration of stimulation has beneficial treatment effects. However, the field is new and more work is needed to assess the effectiveness of this treatment, predictors and correlates of response, and safety. Recent exciting work in schizophrenia used a bimodal (DLPFC and TPC) treatment approach in pharmacologically non-responsive patients. The study used high-frequency stimulation to the left DLPFC and low-frequency stimulation to the left TPC. Bimodal rTMS stimulation of left DLPFC and left TPC induced clinical improvement in pharmacologically non-responsive schizophrenia patients and may have improved their short-term verbal memories.57</detailed_description>
