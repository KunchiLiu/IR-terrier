	<detailed_description>Detailed Description: Infection and inadequate diet are proximate risk factors for under-nutrition and early life growth faltering; the two processes likely act reciprocally in a vicious cycle that perpetuates physiologic and metabolic deficits and increases the risk of mortality. Children who exhibit growth faltering are more likely to have deficits in cognitive development and long-term human capital, and are more likely to have children who also suffer from growth deficits - perpetuating the cycle into the next generation. There are two probable interdependent pathways that link enteric infections to child growth and development. The first pathway includes repeated infections the lead to acute illness or parasitic infection in the first years of life, which increase the risk of stunting and subsequent cognitive deficits in childhood and later in life. The second pathway is through a subclinical condition called environmental enteropathy (EE). There is limited evidence to demonstrate whether or not water quality, sanitation, and hand washing (WASH) interventions can improve measures of EE, child growth and development, and whether nutritional interventions could be enhanced if provided concurrently with WASH interventions. To help fill this evidence gap, the WASH Benefits study will deliver randomized interventions designed to reduce infection and improve nutrition, and will measure intervention effects on child illness, growth and development. WASH Benefits includes two, comparable but standalone trials in Bangladesh and Kenya that are registered under separate protocols. In Bangladesh, the study will include 720 clusters, and each cluster will enroll 8 household compounds (baris) with pregnant women in their second or third trimester. The study will randomize 90 clusters to each of 6 active intervention arms (water quality, sanitation, hand washing, combined WSH, nutrition, nutrition+WSH), and 180 clusters to a standard practices non-intervention arm. Children born into the cohort will be followed for 2 years after the intervention, with measurements at 12 and 24 months after intervention delivery. (anticipated age range: 20 - 27 months old at the final measurement). At the 12- and 24-month follow-up visits, the study will collect child anthropometric measurements and caregiver-reported diarrhea. In the final visit the study will administer a test to measure child development outcomes. The study will collect urine, blood, and stool specimens from a subsample of 1,500 children distributed across four arms of the study (Control, combined WSH, Nutrition, Nutrition+WSH) to measure biomarkers of gut function and intestinal parasitic infections at the 12- and 24-month follow-up visits. In addition, the study will collect specimens (blood, stool) from children 18 - 27 months old at baseline who are living in the same compound as target children to test for intestinal parasitic infections. At 24-months in all arms, the study will collect specimens stool from target children, children 18 - 27 months old at baseline, a school-aged child, and an adult who are living in the same compound as target children to test for intestinal parasitic infections. At 36-months in all arms, the study will collect specimens stool from target children, a school-aged child, and an adult who are living in the same compound as target children to test for intestinal parasitic infections.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(1) Infants (target child) will be eligible to participate in the study if they are: 1. They are in utero at the baseline survey 2. Their parents/guardians are planning to stay in the study village for the next 12 months (if a mother is planning to give birth at her natal home and then return, she will still be a candidate for enrollment) (2) Children &lt; 36 months old at baseline that are living in the compound of a target child will be eligible to participate in diarrhea measurement if: 1. They are &lt; 36 months old at the baseline survey 2. Their parents/guardians are planning to stay in the study village for the next 12 months (3) Children 18 27 months old at baseline that are living in the compound of a target child will be eligible to participate in intestinal parasite specimen collection if: 1. They are 18 27 months old at the baseline survey 2. Their parents/guardians are planning to stay in the study village for the next 12 months</criteria>
