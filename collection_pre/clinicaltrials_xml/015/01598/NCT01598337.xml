	<brief_title>The Effect Of Antiplatelets Therapy On Saphenous Vein Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a commonly used revascularization strategy in patients with severe coronary artery disease. Saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) are the most frequently used conduits for this procedure. Unlike arterial grafts, SVGs are particularly susceptible to occlusive thrombosis during the first post-operative year, which exposes patients to increased risks of death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of antiplatelets (Tirafiban and Prasugrel) on the incidence of early and intermediate graft patency after CABG. Patients will undergo planned cardiac Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) predischarge (at 1 week) and CTA/coronary angiography (CAG) at 6 months to 1 year follow-up. CTA at baseline (predischarge) and follow-up CTA/CAG at 6-12 months after CABG will be used to evaluate graft patency.</detailed_description>
