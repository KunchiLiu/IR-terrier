	<brief_summary>The Lateral Tibial Tunnel technique is a new concept in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) surgery. In this technique a tibial tunnel is drilled from the antero-lateral side of the tibia towards the ACL footprint. This technique allows the surgeon to deal with bone stock problems in the antero-medial part of the tibia as often encountered in ACL revision surgery. In ACL revision surgery it is often impossible to perform a one-stage revision surgery procedure due to bone stock deficiency in the antero-medial side of the tibia. It is hypothesized that the Lateral tibial tunnel technique allows the surgeon to perform a one-stage procedure instead of a two stage procedure. Furthermore the lateral tibial tunnel technique allows better graft fixation in two-stage ACL revision surgery. Several biomechanical studies proved biomechanical superiority of the new technique compared to the classical technique.</brief_summary>
