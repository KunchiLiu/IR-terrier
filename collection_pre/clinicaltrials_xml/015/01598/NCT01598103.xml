	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SAF312 in patients with overactive bladder disease due to spinal cord lesions. The overactive bladder of patients who qualify for this study is insufficiently managed by antimuscarinic therapy, or patients poorly tolerate the treatment with antimuscarinic drugs. The efficacy of SAF312 will be primarily determined via urodynamic measurements.</brief_summary>
