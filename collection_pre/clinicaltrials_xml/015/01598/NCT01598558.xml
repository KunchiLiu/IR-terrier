	<brief_summary>Rituximab is an antibody targeted against the CD20 antigen found primarily on B-cells. Therefore, an imaging agent targeting CD20 expression may provide a more accurate evaluation of extent of disease and response to therapy than the current standard of care, F-18 FDG PET/CT. The main purpose of the study is to investigate a new PET/CT imaging probe for detection and follow up of lymphoma. Following are the 3 aims of the study: a) Phase I testing in lymphoma patients of Cu-64 labelled Rituxan for defining normal tracer biodistribution, stability, pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry; b) comparison of Cu-64 Rituxan and F-18 FDG PET/CT in lymphoma patients; c) evaluation of changes in uptake of Cu-64 Rituxan in response to rituximab-based treatment in CD20-positive B-cell NHL</brief_summary>
