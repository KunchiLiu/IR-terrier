	<brief_summary>Approximately 30% of patients who are candidates for bone marrow transplants do not have an HLA-matched, or close to matched, donor available. For this reason, doctors have been testing ways to make transplants from HLA-partially matched donors as safe and effective as transplants from HLA-matched donors. This study is being done to test the safety and the treatment results of a specific kind of transplant. In this transplant, blood from two donors will be used. Each donor will share one half of your HLA type. Blood from both donors will be transplanted at the same time.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Malignant conditions for which CD34+ selected, Tcell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is indicated such as: AML in 1st remission for patients whose AML does not have 'good risk' cytogenetic features (i.e. t 8;21, t15;17, inv 16). Secondary AML in 1st remission AML in 1st relapse or &gt; 2nd remission ALL/LL in 1st remission clinical or molecular features indicating a high risk for relapse; or ALL &gt; 2nd remission CML failing to respond to or not tolerating Imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib in first chronic phase of disease; or CML in accelerated phase or second chronic phase. NonHodgkins lymphoma with chemoresponsive disease in any of the following categories: a) intermediate or high grade lymphomas who have failed to achieve a first CR or have relapsed following a 1st remission who are not candidates for autologous transplants. any NHL in remission which is considered not curable with chemotherapy alone and not eligible/appropriate for autologous transplant. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS): RA/RCMD with high risk cytogenetic features or transfusion dependence, RAEB1 and RAEB2 and Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) evolved from MDS, who are not eligible for transplantation under protocol IRB 08008. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: CMML1 and CMML2. Other rare lethal disorders of Hematopoiesis and Lymphopoiesis for which a Tcell depleted transplant is indicated (e.g. hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; refractory aplastic anemia or conjugated cytopenias; nonSCID lethal genetic immunodeficiencies such as Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome, CD40 ligand deficiency, ALPS). Patients may be of either gender and of any racial or ethnic background. Patients must have a Karnofsky (adult) or Lansky (pediatric) Performance Status &gt; 70%. Patients must have adequate organ function measured by: Cardiac: asymptomatic or if symptomatic then LVEF at rest must be &gt; 50% and must improve with exercise. Hepatic: &lt; 3x ULN ALT and &lt; 2.0x ULN total serum bilirubin, unless there is congenital benign hyperbilirubinemia. Renal: serum creatinine &lt;1.2 mg/dl or if serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then CrCl &gt; 40 ml/min (measured or calculated/estimated) Pulmonary: asymptomatic or if symptomatic, DLCO &gt; 50% of predicted (corrected for hemoglobin) Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an informed consent form. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding Uncontrolled viral, bacterial or fungal infection Patient seropositive for HIVI/II; HTLV I/II Presence of leukemia in the CNS. Donor Each donor must meet criteria outlined by institutional policies Donor must have adequate peripheral venous catheter access for leukapheresis or must agree to placement of a central catheter. Donor Evidence of active infection (including urinary tract infection, or upper respiratory tract infection), viral hepatitis exposure (on screening), unless only HBS Ab+ and HBV DNA negative, or serologic evidence of exposure or infection with HIVI/II or HTLVI/II If donors do not meet institutional guidelines, exclusion will be considered.</criteria>
