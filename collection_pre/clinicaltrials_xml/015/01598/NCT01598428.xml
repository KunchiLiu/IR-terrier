	<brief_summary>- The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects of anterior capsule polishing on effective lens position (ELP) and actual axial movement of the intraocular lens (IOL) by measuring anterior chamber depth (ACD) - patients with bilateral age-related cataract undergo bilateral uneventful cataract surgeries with in-the- bag implantation of a single-piece hydrophobic acrylic foldable IOL (SN60WF). The anterior capsule was extensively polished using Whitman Shepherd Double-Ended Capsule Polisher in one eye randomly, and the other not. The ACD was measured 1day, 1 week, 1month, 3 months and 6 months with anterior segment Optical Coherence Tomograph (AS-OCT) postoperatively. The actual axial movement of IOL was defined as the root mean square (RMS) of the change in ELP at each visit.</brief_summary>
