	<brief_summary>This is a randomized control study that involves a combination of a drug treatment, behavioral health, and placebo controls. Some participants will receive a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain called Tramadol HC1 IR. Others will receive an inactive pill, called a placebo. There will also be 2 different types of behavioral health treatments, Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Health Education (HE) both of which have been recommended for the treatment of patients with FM by the American Pain Society. There are 4 possible study treatment combinations: 1. Tramadol + CBT, 2. Tramadol + HE, 3. Placebo + CBT, 4. Placebo + HE. Although Tramadol, CBT, and HE have been shown to have some benefits for FM patients, there have been no studies that have evaluated the combination of medication and a behavioral health treatment. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the benefits of the 4 combinations listed.</brief_summary>
