Biopsy will be performed if patients have genital lesions consistent with genital warts of the external genitalia or perianal area. All patients will be provided with an informed consent for the excision biopsy procedure, before performing the biopsy of the lesion. Biopsy specimens will be held in a formol 10% solution and will be sent to the pathologist. A portion of each sample will be processed for histological analysis, which will be performed by one pathologist. The remainder of each specimen will be saved to extract DNA for PCR analysis. All biopsies will be analyzed by the same pathologist who will confirm the histology of the lesion. A part of the specimen will be kept frozen and if the biopsy confirm genital warts by histology; then the specimen will be analyzed by PCR for the presence of DNA HPV 6 and 11. The PCR analysis will be done by microarrays. Detection is performed in a subtype of array platform system which detects the different types of virus. The reports will be as undetectable / detectable and type.
