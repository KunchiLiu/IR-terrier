	<brief_title>Internet Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Effects on Depressive Cognitions and Brain Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The need for mental health services is high among military personnel but perceived stigma and other barriers prevent many Soldiers from obtaining the help they need. Alternative mental health treatment approaches that mitigate stigma and increase access and compliance are greatly needed. One promising treatment approach that has shown efficacy in preliminary research and which may address issues related to stigma and barriers to care, is internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT). Internet-based treatments offer brief, interactive, and structured treatment approaches that can be completed by individuals relatively anonymously, in the convenience and privacy of their own homes, and according to their own schedules. Such interventions could offer Soldiers an alternative treatment method that minimizes stigma by allowing private and quasi-anonymous access to treatment and which minimizes barriers to care by enhancing access and maximizing schedule flexibility. Emerging evidence suggests that iCBT is a particularly promising and well-accepted approach for treating large numbers of individuals while minimizing cost and clinicians' time demand. The study of internet-based and other computer-assisted therapies is currently in its infancy and most studies still lack sufficient methodological rigor to firmly establish the efficacy and applicability of these approaches. The proposed project will provide the most comprehensive evaluation of iCBT to date by employing functional neuroimaging techniques, neurocognitive testing of implicit negative biases and responses to negative feedback, and assessment of resilience and coping capacities in addition to standard symptom-based outcome measures.</detailed_description>
