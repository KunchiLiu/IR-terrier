	<brief_title>Single-operator Wire-guided Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Cannulation Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new single-operator wire-guided cannulation technique was performed on all patients. All procedures were performed by the same experienced endoscopist, but with different assistants in two groups (with an experienced one in Group A, and a new trained one in Group B).
