	<brief_summary>Elevated LDL-cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. In patients with heart disease LDL-cholesterol should be lowered to levels below 70 mg/dl to prevent progression of disease. In most patients life style modification together with lipid lowering drug therapy is sufficient to achieve this goal. In some patients with severe forms of hypercholesterolemia, this may not be sufficient to reach goals and regular lipid apheresis (a costly and time intensive form of therapy) may be performed. Mipomersen is a new drug (apoB antisense oligonucleotide) that can lower LDL-cholesterol even in the most severe forms of LDL-hypercholesterolemia by 25-47%. It is unknown whether and to what extent mipomersen can decrease LDL-cholesterol in patients treated with regular apheresis. Phase 1 of the study will test how 6 months of weekly therapy with mipomersen affects LDL-cholesterol in patients with severe LDL-hypercholesterolemia treated with regular apheresis. Phase 2 will test in how many patients this will result in a meaningful reduction of apheresis time, apheresis frequency or if apheresis can be stopped completely.</brief_summary>

The patient has previously received mipomersen treatment. The patient is on chronic systemic corticosteroids or anabolic agents except for replacement therapy. The patient has received treatment with another investigational drug, biological agent, or device within 4 weeks of screening or 5 halflives of the study agent, whichever is longer. The patient has a current or a recent history of drug or alcohol abuse, or unwillingness to limit alcohol consumption to within moderate limits (maximum 20 g alcohol per day and 80 g alcohol per week for males; maximum 10 g alcohol per day and 40 g alcohol per week for females). Patient not able to give consent. Patient without legal capacity who is unable to understand the nature, scope, significance and consequences of this clinical trial. Known history of hypersensitivity to the investigational drug or to drugs with a similar chemical structure Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial or participation in any clinical trial involving administration of an investigational medicinal product within 30 days prior to the beginning of the clinical trial. Patient with a physical or psychiatric condition which at the investigator's discretion may put the patient at risk, may confound the trial results, or may interfere with the patient's participation in this clinical trial Known or persistent abuse of medication, drugs or alcohol</criteria>
