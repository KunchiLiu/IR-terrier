	<brief_summary>The study is aimed to revise the current criteria for the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and the decisional thresholds to start treatment. The accuracy of current diagnostic tests will be compared with that of new tests, which could potentially become more accurate reference standards. This could lead to the definition of a more accurate and effective diagnostic algorithm.</brief_summary>
