	<brief_summary>Cannabis use disorders are an important public health problem in the United States, but no effective pharmacotherapies are available to treat these disorders. People with schizophrenia are more likely than healthy people to abuse cannabis. Cannabis use may worsen clinical outcomes in this group, making the identification of pharmacotherapy to treat cannabis dependence in those with schizophrenia important. The investigators intend to test the combination of dronabinol, a cannabinoid agonist, and the α2-adrenergic agonist clonidine, for cannabis dependence in subjects with schizophrenia. The combination of dronabinol and clonidine may alleviate cannabis withdrawal symptoms while allowing treatment-seeking outpatients to benefit from medical management (MM) sessions when they are trying to stop using cannabis. The investigators propose to assess the relationship of dronabinol and clonidine, when added to MM, on cannabis use patterns in cannabis-dependent patients with schizophrenia. Hypothesis: The investigators predict that combination pharmacotherapy of dronabinol and clonidine will significantly reduce cannabis use compared to those receiving placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination of Dronabinol and Clonidine for Cannabis Dependence in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive either the combination of dronabinol and clonidine or placebo in addition to medical management (MM) over a 10-week treatment period. Following treatment completion, subjects will have follow-up visits until 14 weeks after treatment initiation. This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of the combination of dronabinol and clonidine for cannabis dependence and will establish effect sizes for a larger trial. Cannabis use disorders are highly prevalent in the United States and rising among high school seniors, making the identification of efficacious treatments for cannabis dependence of critical clinical and public health significance. Schizophrenia is overrepresented among those with cannabis dependence. At the completion of this study, the investigators hope to have improved our understanding of the relationship of the pharmacotherapy combination of dronabinol and clondine on cannabis use.</detailed_description>
