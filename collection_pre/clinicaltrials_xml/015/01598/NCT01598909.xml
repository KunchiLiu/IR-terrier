	<brief_summary>Arnica ointment is currently used in homeopathic preparations for strains and bruises. In the field of plastic surgery, some surgeons advise patients undergoing blepharoplasty to use Arnica in order to prevent postoperative ecchymosis, swelling and pain. Thus far, no decent study evaluated the efficacy of topical Arnica ointment in reducing ecchymosis or surgical outcome after upper blepharoplasty. We hypothesize that application of Arnica ointment postoperatively will reduce the development of ecchymosis and improve outcome.</brief_summary>
