	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine whether the expression levels of a novel class of molecules, called microRNAs, are associated with acute graft-versus-host disease frequency and severity. Acute graft-versus-host disease is a Acute GVHD is a medical condition that can become very serious. It happens when the donor cells attack and damage your tissues after transplant.</detailed_description>
