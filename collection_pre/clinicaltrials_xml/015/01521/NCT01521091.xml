	<brief_summary>Chromoendoscopy (indigo carmine or acetic acid) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) could make accurate evaluation in predicting of invasive depth of colorectal neoplasia. NBI could be the first choice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Diagnostic Accuracy for Predicting Histology of Colorectal Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the diagnostic accuracy of chromoendoscopy indigo carmine or acetic acid and NBI for differentiating neoplastic from non-neoplastic colorectal lesions, differentiating adenomas from carcinomas, and differentiating early carcinomas from invasive ones. Included colorectal lesions consecutively distribute in a 1:1 ratio to 2 groups.</detailed_description>
