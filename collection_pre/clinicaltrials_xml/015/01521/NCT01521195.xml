	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to examine the relationship between DO2 and VO2 in critically ill patients requiring an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machine. This machine can provide complete support of heart and lung function. In so doing, the investigators will be able to avoid physiologic coupling by increasing DO2 mechanically, by increasing blood flow through the ECMO circuit. Null Hypothesis: Increased oxygen delivery, by means of an increased rate of extracorporeal blood flow, is not associated with an increase in oxygen consumption. Alternate Hypothesis: Increased oxygen delivery, by means of an increased rate of extracorporeal blood flow, is associated with an increase in oxygen consumption.</brief_summary>
