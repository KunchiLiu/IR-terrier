	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the baseline variability of a panel of tissue (tumor and adjacent) and blood-based biomarkers obtained from participants with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary hypothesis is that the upper bound of the 80% Confidence Interval of log beta-catenin protein or messenger RNA (mRNA) expression from one core needle biopsy (CNB) equivalent is =&lt; 0.65.</brief_summary>
