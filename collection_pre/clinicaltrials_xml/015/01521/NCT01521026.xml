	<brief_summary>This research on cognitive training addresses the following questions: 1. Does cognitive training lead to improved cognition, functional abilities, psychiatric symptoms, treatment adherence, or quality of life in patients with psychoses? 2. What are the neurocognitive and non-cognitive factors that predict good outcomes following cognitive rehabilitation? In addition to verbal learning and memory, immediate verbal memory, vigilance, and executive functioning, the cognitive training intervention attempted to improve prospective memory ability (i.e., the ability to remember to do things in the future, such as take medications or attend a doctor's appointment).</brief_summary>
