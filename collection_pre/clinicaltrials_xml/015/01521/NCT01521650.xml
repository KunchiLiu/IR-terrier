	<brief_summary>Longer surgical procedures require intubation and there is a potential risk of contaminating the lower airways with pathogenic bacteria from the mouth and oropharynx. Healthy people seldom have pathogenic bacteria originating from the gastro-intestinal canal but those do occur among patients, both in those not so sick and patients with more severe problems. For ICU patients we have seen a reduction of emerging enteric bacteria in patients given oral care with probiotics and this is a pilot study to explore the possibility of the same kind of positive effects in patients due for longer (more than 4 hours of anesthesia) procedures. Randomisation - No prophylaxis - Preparation with a probiotic suspension before intubation. Cultures - oropharynx - before treatment - after intubation - before extubation - day 1 postoperatively - tracheal secretions - after intubation - before extubation</brief_summary>
