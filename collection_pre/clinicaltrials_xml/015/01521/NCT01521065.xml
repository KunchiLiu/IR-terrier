	<brief_title>An Open-label Study to Evaluate the Clinical and Economic Benefits of I-Ray in Patients With Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to confirm the clinical and economic benefits of low voltage external beam radiotherapy with the IRay with respect to number of anti-VEGF injections and frequency of ophthalmic assessments during the one year interval following treatment in subjects with neovascular AMD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have neovascular AMD and have received an antiVEGF injections within 1 month prior to entering the study, and have the need for further treatment with antiVEGF therapy. Must have a total lesion size of &lt;12 disc areas and a CNV lesion with the greatest linear dimension of &lt;6 mm, but not greater than 3 mm from the center of the fovea to the furthest point on lesion perimeter. Must have provided informed consent, documented it in writing, and have been given a copy of the signed informed consent form. Must be willing and able to return for scheduled treatment and followup examinations for the 3year duration of the study. Must be at least 50 years of age. Women must be postmenopausal â‰¥1 year or surgically sterilized. Must have best corrected visual acuity of greater than or equal to 24 letters in the study eye and at least 20 letters in the fellow eye (if both eyes meet all the study criteria, then the eye with the worst vision should be selected as the study eye). Present with any implanted device, where the device labeling specifically contraindicates subjects undergoing xrays. An axial length of &lt;20 mm (because of limitations of the IRay device) or &gt;26 mm (to exclude subjects with pathologic myopia). Evidence of diabetes or retinal findings consistent with diabetic retinopathy, or retinopathy for any cause. Prior or concurrent therapies in the study eye for age related macular degeneration (other than intravitreal antiVEGF), including submacular surgery, subfoveal thermal laser photocoagulation (with or without photographic evidence), transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) and ocular photodynamic therapy.</criteria>
