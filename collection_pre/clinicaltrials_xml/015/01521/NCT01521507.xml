	<brief_summary>The study objective is to evaluate the long-term treatment effectiveness for adult patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and evaporative dry eye by: 1) comparing the LipiFlow® System to a standardized daily warm compress and eyelid hygiene control therapy over a duration of 3 Months; and 2) evaluating the LipiFlow® alone and in combination with other MGD and dry eye treatments over a duration of up to 12 Months. This is a post-market, non-significant risk, prospective and multi-center clinical trial divided into two stages. The first stage from enrollment to 3 Months is an open-label, randomized controlled design to compare the effectiveness of a single LipiFlow® System treatment to a standardized daily warm compress and eyelid hygiene Control therapy with Crossover LipiFlow® treatment of the Control subjects at 3 Months. The second stage, occurring between 3 and 12 Months, is an observational design to evaluate the effectiveness of LipiFlow® alone and in combination with other MGD and dry eye treatments over a duration of up to 12 Months. Subjects are entered into the following subgroups based on the subject's self-assessment of the adequacy of symptom relief and protocol-defined criteria for additional treatment. 1. One LipiFlow® Treatment: Subjects who receive only one LipiFlow® treatment. 2. Two LipiFlow® Treatments: Subjects who receive a second LipiFlow® treatment. 3. Combination Treatment: Subjects who receive one or two LipiFlow® treatments followed by other MGD or dry eye treatment, as prescribed by the physician.</brief_summary>
