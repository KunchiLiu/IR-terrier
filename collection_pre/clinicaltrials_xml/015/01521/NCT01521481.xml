	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Inguinal Field Block (Genitofemoral, Iliohypogastric and Ilioinguinal Nerve Block) for Inguinal Hernia Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal hernia repair accounts for 10-15% of all operations in general surgery. Moderate to severe pain can occur at the first day after inguinal hernia repair in 25% of patients at rest and in 60% during activity. On day 6 after the operation the incidence can be as high as 11% at rest and 33% during activity. Ultrasound imaging for regional anesthesia techniques have improved the success and safety rate of nerve blocks. We hypothesized that a procedure consisting of an ultrasound-guided inguinal field block (genitofemoral, iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerve block and incision line infiltration) could effectively control postoperative pain compared to selective unilateral subarachnoid anesthesia.</detailed_description>
