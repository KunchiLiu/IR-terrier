	<criteria>The following inclusion criteria include, but are not limited to: 1. Adults ≥ 18 years of age with foveal centerinvolved macular edema (ME) secondary to BRVO diagnosed within 12 months before the screening visit 2.

Provide signed informed consent The following exclusion criteria include, but are not limited to: 1. Current bilateral manifestation of BRVO 2. Uncontrolled glaucoma defined as ≥ 25 mmHg on optimal medical regimen, or previous filtration surgery in either the study eye or the fellow eye 3.

Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) 5. Previous use of intraocular corticosteroids or antiangiogenic drugs in the study eye 6. Use of periocular corticosteroids in the study eye within 3 months before day 1 7. Use of intraocular or periocular corticosteroids or antiangiogenic drugs in the fellow eye within 3 months before day 1 8. Previous administration of systemic antiangiogenic medications 9.
