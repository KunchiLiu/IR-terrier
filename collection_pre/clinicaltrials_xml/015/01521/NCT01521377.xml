	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, placebo controlled, four period incomplete block,crossover thorough QT study to estimate the effect of repeat dose GSK573719/GW642444M (Vilanterol) combination and GSK573719 monotherapy on the QTc interval in healthy male and female subjects compared with placebo. At least 100 subjects will receive, four of five possible, 10-day repeat dose treatments. Treatments are placebo with a moxifloxacin placebo on day 10, placebo with moxifloxacin (400mg) on day 10, GSK573719/Vilanterol combination (125/25μg) with moxifloxacin placebo on day 10, GSK573719/Vilanterol combinatio (500/100μg) with moxifloxacin placebo on day 10, or GSK573719 (500μg) with a moxifloxacin placebo on day 10. All treatments are double blind except for moxifloxacin (400mg) and moxifloxacin placebo controls, given as a single-blind single dose on Day 10 of the appropriate treatment period. Primary endpoints are individual time-matched changes from baseline QTcF for GSK573719/Vilanterol combination (125/25μg) and GSK573719 (500μg), 0-24 hours after dosing on Day 10. Secondary endpoints will include individual time-matched changes from baseline in QTcF for GSK573719/Vilanterol combination (500/100μg) and moxifloxacin (400mcg) 0-24 hours after dosing on Day 10. Also changes from baseline in QTci, QTcB, QT, QRS, RR, PR and ventricular rate at each time point after 10 days dosing of each GSK573719 and GSK573719/Vilanterol treatment and single dose moxifloxacin (400mg). Maximal change from baseline 0-24hours after dosing on day 10 will be derived for QTcF, QTci and QTcB for each treatment. Plasma concentrations on Day 10 (0-24 hours) and pharmacokinetic parameters of GSK573719 and Vilanterol will also be derived. Key assessments: 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG), pharmacokinetics. Safety will be assessed by blood pressure, heart rate, clinical laboratory safety tests and collection of adverse events (AEs).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator believes that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until after the Follow Up visit AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Body weight ≥ 45 kg and BMI within the range 18 29.5 kg/m2 (inclusive). Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. No significant abnormality on 12lead ECG at screening, including the following specific requirements: Ventricular rate ≥ 40 beats per minute PR interval ≤ 210msec Q waves &lt; 30msec (up to 50 ms permitted in lead III only) QRS interval to be ≥ 60msec and &lt; 120msec The waveforms must enable the QT interval to be clearly defined QTcF interval must be &lt; 450msec (machine or manual reading). A 24 hour Holter ECG at screening that demonstrates no clinically significant abnormalities or finding that could interfere with interpretation of the study results, when assessed by an appropriately trained and experienced reviewer Subjects who are able to use the Novel DPIsatisfactorily. Capable of giving written informed consent and a signed and dated written informed consent is obtained, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Normal spirometry (FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC ≥ 70%). Nonsmokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked)). Available to complete the study.

History of tendon disease/disorder related to quinolone treatment. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, including moxifloxacin, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.
