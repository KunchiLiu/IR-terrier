	<brief_summary>Excessive alcohol consumption in university students continues for be a serious public health concern with a variety of negative consequences. There have been a number of different brief interventions developed to address this issue among university students. The current project will add to this literature by evaluating the use of a personalized feedback intervention (www.CheckYourDrinkingU.net; CYDU). Specifically, this trial will examine whether providing access to the CYDU will result in short-term reductions in drinking. This issue is important as use of these interventions is not a mandatory requirement for university students so the issue is whether making materials of this type available leads to any reductions in risky drinking. It is hypothesized that students provided access to the CYDU will display greater reductions in drinking at a six-week follow-up as compared to students who were not provided access to the CYDU.</brief_summary>
