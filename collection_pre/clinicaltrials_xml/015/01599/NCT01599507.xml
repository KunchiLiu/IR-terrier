Any clinically significant infection or evidence of an underlying infection such as a white blood cell count (WBC) &gt; ULN during screening on two separate occasions, 3. Positive for any of the following: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); antihepatitis C virus antibody (antiHCV Ab) 4. History of chronic liver disease 5. New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure 6. Chronic inflammatory disease other than glomerulonephritis that could impact erythropoiesis (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease) even if it is currently in remission 7. Active or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, or a known coagulation disorder 8. Hemoglobinopathy (e.g., homozygous sicklecell disease, thalassemia of all types, etc.) 9. Hematological disorders, including myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, or pure red cell aplasia 10. History of hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, polycystic kidney disease, or anephric 11. Active hemolysis or diagnosis of hemolytic syndrome 12. Known bone marrow fibrosis 13. Uncontrolled or symptomatic secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH&gt;600ng/L) 14. Any prior organ transplantation 15. Drugtreated gastroparesis, shortbowel syndrome, or any other gastrointestinal condition that may lead to reduced absorption of study drug 16. Serum albumin &lt;3 g/dL 17. History of alcohol or drug abuse; or a positive drug screen for a substance that has not been prescribed for the subject 18. Prior treatment with FG4592 19. Use of an investigational medication or treatment, or carryover effect of an investigational treatment expected, during the screening visit, treatment and followup period. 20. Use of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) during the screening visit to Day 1 or plans to use TCM during the study unless approved in advance by the Medical Monitor</criteria>
