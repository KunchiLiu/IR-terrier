	<brief_summary>People with rheumatic disease often have decreased strength, muscle mass, and bone mineral density due to repeated bouts of inflammation, normal effects of aging, disuse, and inactivity. The medications used to quell the disease process, such as prednisone, can also have detrimental effects on body composition, strength, and functional capacity. The investigators propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and effects of resistance exercise in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and vasculitis. The unique resistance protocol the investigators propose involves performing movements in a slow and controlled fashion (i.e., no acceleration or use of momentum in the lifting and lowering of the resistance) to minimize force on the joints and connective tissues. This will be conducted in an individually-supervised environment with a new generation of exercise equipment that will accommodate their musculoskeletal capabilities and allow for reproducibility of the exercise protocol. The investigators intend to investigate the feasibility, safety, musculoskeletal, and psychological effects of this resistance exercise protocol in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis by testing their strength, body composition, functional ability, mood, and quality of life before and after this 16-week resistance exercise intervention.</brief_summary>
