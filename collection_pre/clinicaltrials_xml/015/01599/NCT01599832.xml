	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effects pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) (also called VotrientÂ®) may have on MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, blood pressure, and various proteins in the blood. Pazopanib is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treating renal cell cancer. It is an agent that prevents angiogenesis, which is new blood vessel formation. The use of pazopanib described in this study is a standard of care, but the additional MRI and blood tests that will be performed are experimental</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Measuring Effects of Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether a K^trans rise from nadir is predictive of subsequent tumor growth. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the association between changes in mean ambulatory blood pressure measurements, K^trans, and tumor size changes with pazopanib therapy. II. To determine the association between changes in soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR2) measurements, K^trans, and tumor size changes with pazopanib therapy. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) as pharmacogenomic biomarkers. II. To model tumor growth kinetics using radiologic tumor size measurements. III. To explore other serum and plasma based putative biomarkers of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibition. OUTLINE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at baseline, day 8, and prior to courses 3, 5, and 7. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of studyspecific procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and followup; procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management (e.g., blood count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as specified in the protocol Histologically confirmed diagnosis of clear cell renal cancer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less Measurable disease at least 2 cm in the shortest dimension in the abdomen or pelvis No clinical contraindication to contrast enhanced MRI No prior pazopanib therapy Archived tumor tissue must be provided for all subjects Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 X 10^9/L Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL (5.6 mmol/L); subjects may not have had a transfusion within 7 days of screening assessment Platelets &gt;= 100 X 10^9/L Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =&lt;

1; if UPC &gt;= 1, then a 24hour urine protein must be assessed; subjects must have a 24hour urine protein value &lt; 1 g to be eligible A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant), including any female who has had: A hysterectomy A bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy) A bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal Subjects not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total cessation of menses for &gt;= 1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value &gt; 40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt; 140 pmol/L) Subjects using HRT must have experienced total cessation of menses for &gt;= 1 year and be greater than 45 years of age OR have had documented evidence of menopause based on FSH and estradiol concentrations prior to initiation of HRT Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate contraception; acceptable contraceptive methods include: Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days after the last dose of investigational product Oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen Implants of levonorgestrel Estrogenic vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patches Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject Double barrier method: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) Not lactating; female subjects who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study drug and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 14 days following the last dose of study drug Prior malignancy;
