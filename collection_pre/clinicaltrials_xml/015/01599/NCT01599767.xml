	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the pain associated with spinal cord injury. This study is part of the Spaulding-Harvard Model System. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when compared to sham stimulation, using a 3 week stimulation schedule- 1 week of stimulation (5 consecutive days) followed by 2 weeks of stimulation (10 consecutive days) after a 3-month follow up visit. The subject will also have follow ups at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the second course of stimulation. If a subject receives sham during the experiment, he/she may enroll in an open-label portion of the study and receive 10 days of active stimulation.</brief_summary>
