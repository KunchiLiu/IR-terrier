	<brief_summary>Positron emission tomography uses various radioactive tracers to measure the metabolic activity in a none-invasive way, and specially to follow the activity of the disease during the treatments. Among those new tracers, fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) arouses a lot of interest. This new tool would allow to image and follow time wise acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The investigators want, with the (18F-FLT), to characterise the aggressivity of the tumors and the prognostic before and after chemotherapy treatment. The aim of this study is to be able to identify earlier the responders, because if they are detected sooner, these patients will benefit from more aggressive treatments.</brief_summary>
