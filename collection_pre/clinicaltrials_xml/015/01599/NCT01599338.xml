	<brief_summary>Besides their potential action in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), GLP-1 analogues decrease satiety and food intake leading to a significant weight loss in patients. However, little is known about their effects on food hedonic sensations and taste perception. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of Liraglutide on the liking and wanting components of the food reward system, taste sensitivity and sensory specific satiety in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. According to the review of literature in animal models, it is expected that Liraglutide will modify food preference and gustative perception in humans. Thirty T2DM patients will be studied before and after 3 months of treatment with Liraglutide (1.2 mg/day). Same tests will be carried out on two consecutive days before and after the treatment administration. Olfactory liking, recalled liking and wanting for several food items will be assessed. Sensory specific satiety will be measured as well as detection thresholds for salty, sweet and bitter tastes. Subjects will also answer questionnaires on hunger, pleasure in eating, and food intake.</brief_summary>
