	<brief_summary>Despite modern advances in treatment, heart failure continues to carry a poor prognosis with high morbidity and mortality rates. Hence, there remains a major interest in the development of novel therapeutic agents for this debilitating condition. Urocortins have recently shot into limelight with their potential role in the pathophysiology and treatment of heart failure. Recent studies by the investigators group (REC no: 09/S1103/41) have confirmed that Urocortin 2 and 3 are potent arterial vasodilators, the effects of which are reproducible and well tolerated in healthy male volunteers. Previous studies using heart failure models in animals1-7, as well studies in heart failure patients (Urocortin 2), suggest that there is great scope for Urocortins as novel biomarkers and as potential therapeutic agents in heart failure. With this in mind, the investigators wish to study the local vasomotor effects of these peptides in greater detail in patients with heart failure.</brief_summary>
