	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based behavioral activation(BA) treatment for depression by comparing it to in-person BA treatment in Soldiers and Veterans with Major and Minor Depressive Disorder. We will test the hypothesis that 8 sessions of in-home BA delivered via a webcam will be as safe and effective in reducing symptoms of hopelessness and depression as in-person BA treatment for depression.</brief_summary>
