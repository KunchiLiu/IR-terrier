	<brief_summary>This study, conducted in India, will be recruiting women participants who are between the ages of 18 and 42, and who have an indication for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), but have not yet undergone in-vitro fertilization and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The study is designed to compare the difference in oocyte (immature egg cell) production after administration of the investigative drug, MK-8962 (corifollitropin alfa) + recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (recFSH), in contrast to use of only the reference drug, recFSH.</brief_summary>
