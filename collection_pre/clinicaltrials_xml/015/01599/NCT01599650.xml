	<brief_summary>This study will generate comparative data for 0.5-mg ranibizumab using PRN dosing administered with or without adjunctive laser treatment versus laser photocoagulation (the current standard of care) up to Month 6 in patients with visual impairment due to ME secondary to BRVO. Additionally the results of this study will provide long-term (24-month) safety and efficacy data for ranibizumab, administered with or without adjunctive laser treatment in this indication.</brief_summary>
