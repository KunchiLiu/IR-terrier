	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study were: To compare repeated doses of YF476 at 2 dose levels, placebo and omeprazole with respect to their effect on basal- and food- stimulated gastric pH in healthy volunteers. To compare repeated doses of YF476 at 2 dose levels, placebo and omeprazole with respect to their effect on basal and meal stimulated pH. To assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of repeated doses of YF476 in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Repeated Doses of YF476, Omeprazole and Placebo on Stomach Acidity in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>YF476 is clearly a potent and selective gastrin/CCK-B antagonist and should inhibit basal and meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion, enhance gastric emptying of a liquid meal and increase lower oesphageal sphincter pressure in man. Therefore YF476 might benefit patients with reflux oesophagitis. YF476 has been well tolerated in healthy volunteers at single doses up to 100mg and remarkably well tolerated at repeat doses in animals up to 350 times the maximum dose planned for the proposed study. A range of doses of YF476 (25 and 100mg twice daily) will be administered to steady state. 24-hour ambulatory gastric pH will be monitored via an intragastric pH electrode to assess the effect of YF476 on basal and meal stimulated gastric pH. Although there is variability between subjects with respect to the effects of food and drug treatment on gastric pH, the methodology for measurement of ambulatory gastric pH is robust.</detailed_description>
