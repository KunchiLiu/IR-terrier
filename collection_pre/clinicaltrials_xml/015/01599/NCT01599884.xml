	<brief_summary>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is described as having mucolytic and antioxidant properties. It is widely prescribed for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly for those who have accompanying symptoms of chronic cough and sputum production. Randomized, placebo controlled indicate that it is safe and that it may have some clinical benefit when used at relatively low doses. It is postulated that substantially higher doses of NAC will be well-tolerated and will provide better symptom control while also decreasing blood makers of oxidant stress and inflammation.</brief_summary>
