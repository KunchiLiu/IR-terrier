	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effectiveness of using lower-intensity radiation and chemotherapy to treat human papillomavirus (HPV) associated low-risk oropharyngeal and/or unknown primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. The cure rate for this type of cancer is estimated to be high, &gt; 90%. The standard treatment for this cancer is 7 weeks of radiation with 3 high doses of cisplatin. Sometimes surgery is performed afterwards. This standard regimen causes a lot of side effects and long term complications. This study is evaluating whether a lower dose of radiation and chemotherapy may provide a similar cure rate as the longer, more intensive standard regimen. Patients in this study will receive 1 less week of radiation and a lower weekly dose of chemotherapy followed by a limited surgical evaluation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>De-intensification of Radiation and Chemotherapy for Low-Risk Human Papillomavirus-related Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim is to evaluate the pathological response rate of HPV positive and/or p16 positive low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) after de-intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients will receive 54 to 60 Gy of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent weekly intravenous cisplatin (30 mg/m2). Diagnostic imaging (CT and/or MRI) will be obtained 4 to 8 weeks after completion of CRT to assess response. All patients will have surgical resection of any clinically apparent residual primary tumor or biopsy of the primary site if there is no evidence of residual tumor and will undergo a limited neck dissection to encompass at least those nodal level(s) that were positive pre-treatment, 4 to 14 weeks after CRT. The primary endpoint of this study is the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) after CRT. Longitudinal assessments of quality of life and patient reported outcomes will be obtained prior to, during, and after CRT.</detailed_description>
