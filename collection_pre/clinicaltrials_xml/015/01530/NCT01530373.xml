	<brief_summary>Hot flashes present a considerable problem for many breast cancer patients; these symptoms may be intensified by hormonal therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen. This study examines the value of solifenacin (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist) in reducing hot flashes, compared with clonidine (a medication often used for treating hot flashes).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Solifenacin Compared to Clonidine for Reducing Hot Flashes Among Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There has been considerable interest in developing new treatment strategies for managing hot flashes among women with breast cancer, in view of the limitations associated with currently available treatments. This randomized study evaluates the safety and efficacy of 3 weeks of solifenacin compared to 3 weeks of clonidine, for women receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen) for breast cancer.</detailed_description>
