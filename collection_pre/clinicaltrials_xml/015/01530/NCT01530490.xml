	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether, in GnRH agonist in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles, where there is a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), the addition of cabergoline to the hydroxyethyl starch infusion could decrease OHSS incidence and severity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabergoline and Hydroxyethyl Starch in Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women undergoing IVF cycles with GnRH agonist protocols, at risk of OHSS (more than 20 follicles observed larger than 12 mm in diameter and/or estradiol levels of 3000-5000 pg/mL). Slow infusion of 500 ml of 6% HES during follicular aspiration alone or combined with 0.5 mg cabergoline administration for 8 days, starting on the day of hCG administration.</detailed_description>
