	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to examine the performance of three common DXA machines (1) Lunar iDXA, (2) Lunar Prodigy and (3) Hologic Discovery A in measuring bone density and body fat.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DXA Precision and Accuracy Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For this study, two specific groups of volunteers will be recruited. In one group, the scan will measure bone density and in the other group the scan will measure fat. The groups will be broken into weight groups to determine which of the scanners the subject will be scanned on. Subjects will have the option to participate in either one or both groups.</detailed_description>
