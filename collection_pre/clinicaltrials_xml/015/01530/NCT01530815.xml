	<brief_title>Bupivicaine to Reduce Postoperative Pain in Laparoscopic Ventral Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to test different methods for pain management following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. We hypothesize that local analgesic injection between the abdominal wall and mesh intraoperatively during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair will result in a 20% decrease in the use of post-surgery pain medication in the first four hours after surgery.</detailed_description>
