	<brief_summary>The study aims to assess the agreement between respiratory mechanics parameters measured noninvasively by means of brief airways occlusions at the beginning of inspiration and the reference parameters obtained with standard techniques of esophageal and gastric pressure under static and dynamic conditions in a mixed population of ICU patients mechanically ventilated in pressure support ventilation mode.</brief_summary>
