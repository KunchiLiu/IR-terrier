	<brief_summary>Regional tissue oxygenation (rStO2) can be monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. The investigators planned a SafeBoosC phase II trial to test if a reduction of the burden of hyper- and hypoxia can be accomplished during the first three days of life in infants born before 28 completed weeks of gestation. The investigators developed a treatment guideline and a randomised trial design to evaluate if cerebral rStO2 spent out of range in %hours can be reduced by 50%. The present trial is a non-randomised pilot study of the intervention in 10 infants.</brief_summary>
