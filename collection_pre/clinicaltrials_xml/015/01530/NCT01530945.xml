	<brief_summary>Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) must manage not only the demands of dialysis and comorbid conditions but also associated symptoms and acute life-threatening events that contribute to functional limitations and increased risk of mortality. Yet little is known about the trajectories of quality of life dimensions in patients with ESKD when they experience acute life-threatening episodes, to guide palliative care for this population. In this prospective, descriptive study, we will identify trajectories of symptoms, physical functioning, psychosocial needs, and emotional and spiritual well-being in 200 patients with ESKD who are at a high risk of experiencing acute life-threatening events and mortality within 12 months.</brief_summary>
