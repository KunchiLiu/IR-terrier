	<brief_title>Second Line Therapy in Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biliary tract adenocarcinoma is an uncommon tumor with a poor prognosis and a median overall survival (OS) rarely exceeding 6 months. Less than 25% of patients are resectable at diagnosis and, even in this subset of patients, relapse rate is high. An improvement of OS and quality of life for patients receiving chemotherapy versus best supportive care was demonstrated in advanced disease. Recently, cisplatin and gemcitabine combination was identified as the new standard first-line chemotherapy, yielding a median progression free survival (PFS) and median OS of 8.5 and 11.7 months, respectively. Despite the outcome improvement, disease progression is a constant and approximately half of patients failing upfront treatment has a good performance status and are willing to undergo further treatment. No standard salvage chemotherapy regimen has been identified. Clinical trials are difficult to perform due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these tumors and to the lack of interest of the pharmaceutical industry. Fluoropyrimidines and mitomycin C have been considered the basis of palliative chemotherapy for a long time. The investigators decided to explore the activity, in terms of PFS, of capecitabine alone or combined with mitomycin C as second-line therapy in patients with pathological diagnosis of advanced biliary tract cancer and progressive disease after gemcitabine and cisplatin, by means of an open label randomized multicentric phase II trial.</detailed_description>

At the time of start of treatment, at least 2 weeks must have elapsed since completion of prior chemotherapy, minor surgery and radiotherapy (provided that no more than 25% of bone marrow reserve has been irradiated). 10. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of any prior chemotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy to NCI CTC (Version 4.03) grade ≤ 1 for hematologic toxicities and ≤ 2 for non hematologic toxicities, with the exception of alopecia. 11. Able and willing to comply with scheduled visits, therapy plans, and laboratory tests required in this protocol. 1. Previous or concurrent malignancies at other sites with the exception of surgically cured carcinoma insite of the cervix and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and of other neoplasm without evidence of disease at least from 5 years. 2. Known brain metastases. 3. Previous secondline or adjuvant treatment. 4. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs. 5. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia) ≤1 year prior to dosing. 6. Clinically significant disease including: Cerebral Vascular Accident; other serious underlying medical condition(s) which could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the study. 7. History of interstitial lung disease (eg, pneumonia or pulmonary fibrosis) or evidence of interstitial lung disease on baseline chest CT scan 8. Known positive tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active hepatitis B or hepatitis C 9. Subject who is pregnant or breast feeding 10. Woman or man of childbearing potential not consenting to use adequate contraceptive precautions ie. double barrier contraceptive methods (e.g., diaphragm plus condom), or abstinence during the course of the study and for 6 months after the last study drug administration for women, and 1 month for men 11. Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule</criteria>
