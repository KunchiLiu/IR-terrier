	<brief_summary>The Karachi-based Pakistan Diabetes Prevention Study aims to address key issues in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Approximately 20,000 people From four communities will be screened for diabetes risk factors using a non-invasive diabetes risk-score system. Those found to be at increased risk will be given an oral glucose tolerance test. People who, after the oral glucose tolerance test, are identified as having prediabetes will have the opportunity to take part in the Pakistan Diabetes Prevention Study lifestyle intervention. This consists of culturally adjusted preventive strategies focusing on diet and physical activity in real-life settings. Another important aspect of this trial will be to assess the impact of urban planning on the prevalence of obesity and diabetes.</brief_summary>
