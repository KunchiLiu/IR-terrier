	<brief_title>ST- Depression on Electrocardiogram During Caesarean Section in Regional Anaesthesia in Women With Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ST depression on electrocardiograms has been reported in healthy women undergoing cesarean section in regional anesthesia. The investigators examined whether there was a difference in the occurrence of electrocardiogram changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia (ST depressions) in preeclamptic patients randomized to five or ten units of oxytocin during cesarean section with regional anesthesia. In a double-blind randomized controlled study preeclamptic patients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were randomized to 5 or 10 units of oxytocin, given as an intravenous bolus. A Holter monitor was used to record electrocardiograms. Non-invasive blood pressure and heart rate were monitored.</detailed_description>
