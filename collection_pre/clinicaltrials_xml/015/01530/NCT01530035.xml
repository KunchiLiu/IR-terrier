	<brief_summary>A one-year intervention study of 41 healthy elderly men aged 65-75-years.Of these, 24 subjects are untrained men with no regular training activity for the last 5 years. After medical screening and pre-testing, they will be randomized into a football group (n=9), a strength-training group (n=9) or a sedentary control group (n=6). Additional 17 subjects are recruited from local football clubs and have been active football players for the last 40 years. Training will be performed 3x1 hour per week and evaluation will take place after 0, 3 and 12 months. Primary endpoints will be changes in cardiac and vascular structure and function measured by advanced echocardiography (tissue Doppler and speckle tracking imaging), and peripheral arterial tonometry (Endo--‚ÄêPAT device). Secondary endpoints will be evaluation of potential changes in VO2 max, blood pressure, muscle capillaries, lipid profile, circulating catecholamines, body composition, and insulin resistance.</brief_summary>
