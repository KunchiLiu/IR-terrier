	<brief_summary>This is a diagnostic validation study for a combined Syphilis/HIV test made by MBio Diagnostics, Inc (MBio, Boulder, CO, USA). Although the MBio Syphilis/HIV diagnostic platform is designed for use at point of care (POC), it is made to provide similar performance as reference standards. Diagnosing HIV and syphilis accurately with a single POC test will save time for clinic health workers and technicians, reduce loss-to follow-up caused by lengthy delays for lab-based tests, and save costs by eliminating the need for multiple tests. For this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the MBio HIV/Syphilis Serology System point-of-care diagnostic test will be determined using reference tests performed under controlled laboratory conditions. For this, clients receiving routine care in the ANCs at the New Nyanza Provincial General Hospital (NNPGH) and Kisumu District Hospital (KDH) will be consented to provide blood for the proposed study. Study volunteers will receive HIV and syphilis rapid tests provided as part of routine care, and will donate an additional blood for evaluating the MBio test against the reference tests in a laboratory setting. This study is an investigational prototype, not for product registration. The results from this study will be used to inform product development of a second iteration of the MBio device design. At the time that the device is ready to be registered, it will undergo another field evaluation at which time it will be submitted to the appropriate regulatory body. Because the MBIO device is an HIV test, the device would be submitted to National AIDS &amp; STI Control Program (NASCOP), which is the appropriate regulatory body for HIV tests in Kenya.</brief_summary>
