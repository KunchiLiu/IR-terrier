	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of two different interventions aimed at improving health outcomes among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who are at high risk of CKD progression. Specifically, this study will examine how best to implement a provider-level intervention (access to a CKD-registry) and a patient-oriented intervention (automated telephone self-management (ATSM) + health coach) on patient health outcomes, with a 2x2 factorial design.</brief_summary>
