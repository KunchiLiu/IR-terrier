	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the dose response relationship regarding blood loss, PK, PD and clinical outcomes of MDCO-2010 in comparison to placebo and tranexamic acid in patients undergoing primary cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the study is to define minimally effective dose of MDCO-2010.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study to Compare MDCO-2010 vs Placebo and Tranexamic Acid in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a two-stage, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter Phase II dose-selection study to compare antifibrinolytic MDCO-2010 vs tranexamic acid and placebo in reducing blood loss. This study was designed to examine a broad range of doses to fully characterize the dose-response relationship between MDCO-2010 dose, plasma PK, PD, and clinical effects. In Stage 1, 90 patients were to be enrolled into one of six treatment groups with 15 patients per group: four groups were to receive MDCO-2010, one group was to receive tranexamic acid, and one group was to receive placebo. Stage 2 was to be an expansion of Stage 1. The study was terminated after 49 patients were enrolled into Stage 1.</detailed_description>
