	<brief_summary>This is an Open-label, randomized study in Type 1 diabetics looking at exposure and response (PK/PD) of TI using GEN2C Inhaler versus rapid acting analog.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Technosphere Insulin Inhalation Powder &amp; Subcutaneous Rapid-Acting Analog in Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with Type 1 diabetes will be randomized to either one dose of TI inhaled using the Gen2C device, or one dose of subcutaneously injected Rapid Acting Analog (RAA) and crossed over. Crossover Sequences: Sequence #1: Period 1 - one 20 U cartridge of TI; Period 2 - 8 U of RAA Sequence #2: Period 1 - 8 U RAA; Period 2 - one 20 U cartridge of TI An euglycemic clamp procedure will be performed at each dosing visit. The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the one dose of TI Inhalation Powder using the Gen2C inhaler as compared to one dose of subcutaneous RAA.</detailed_description>

Adequate birth control is defined as using oral, percutaneous, or transdermal contraceptives; condoms and diaphragms (double barrier) with a spermicide; or intrauterine devices. Postmenopausal for the purposes of this clinical study includes experiencing amenorrhea for 2 or more years or being surgically sterile Inability, in the opinion of the PI or a designee, to adequately inhale TI Inhalation Powder Any subject who, in the opinion of the PI or a designee, appears to not be qualified for this study</criteria>
