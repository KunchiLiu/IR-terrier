	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if everolimus combined with reduced exposure CNI (TAC) is efficacious and safe and will support corticosteroid elimination compared to a standard exposure CNI (TAC) + MMF + steroid regimen after paediatric kidney transplantation. An additional purpose of the study is to assess the effect of the combination of EVR and reduced exposure CNI (TAC) on renal function. This study is part of the requirements of the Paediatric Investigational Plan approved by Paediatric Committee at the European Medicines Agency (PDCO/EMA) on September 10, 2010, and is intended to support the indication of everolimus in the prevention of acute rejection in paediatric recipients of a renal transplant.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria at baseline: 1. Written informed consent/assent must be obtained from the parent(s) or legal guardian before any assessment is performed. 2. Primary or secondary paediatric kidney transplant recipient aged greater than or equal to 1 year and younger than 18 years receiving a deceased donor or nonHLA identical living donor (related or unrelated) renal transplant. Inclusion criteria at randomization: 1. Patients on TAC + MMF + steroids. 2. Renal function with eGFR &gt; 40 ml/min/1.73 m2 (Schwartz formula abbreviated). Exclusion criteria at baseline: 1. Recipients of kidneys from donors with known renal disease (such as diabetes nephropathy, nephrosclerosis), at the time of transplant. 2. Recipients of a kidney with a cold ischemia time &gt; 24 hours. 3. History of hypersensitivity or contraindications to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical classes, or to any of the excipients. 4. History of malignancy of any organ system treated or untreated, carrying possible risk of recurrence according to current guidelines (Appendix 10 of protocol). Exclusion criteria at randomization: 1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of randomization, or within 30 days or 5 halflives prior randomization, whichever is longer. 2. Patients with ongoing or recently (within 2 weeks prior to randomization) treated episodes of acute rejection (any grade) or a steroid resistant acute rejection at the time of randomization. 3. Patients who experienced acute cellular rejection (Banff ≥1B) or any antibody mediated acute rejection or patients considered at high risk of antibody mediated acute rejection by the investigator assessment (e.g. presence of newly formed DSA, histological suspicion) at any time before randomization (as the DSA quantitative threshold to define high risk is not fully established, the assessment of the risk will be made after discussion between the laboratory expert and the investigator who will take into account all information available and apply best judgment). 4. Patients with ongoing wound healing problems, clinically significant wound infection requiring continued therapy or other severe surgical complication in the opinion of the investigator. 5. Patients who are treated with drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and can not discontinue the treatment (see Appendix 6 for list of medications). 6. Patients with nephrotic range proteinuria (protein to creatinine ratio ≥2.0 mg/mg or 200 mg/mmol (Hogg, 2003).</criteria>
