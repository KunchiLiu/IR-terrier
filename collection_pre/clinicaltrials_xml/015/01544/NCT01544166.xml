	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to collect data on the way gadobutrol is taken into, moves around, and is eliminated from, the body of children aged 0 to less than 2 years. The study will also evaluate safety and tolerability, and efficacy of gadobutrol. A maximum total amount of approximately 5 ml of blood will be needed for these analyses which will be drawn within 2-3 days. Gadobutrol is a contrast agent used for enhancement of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), potentially allowing better visibility of tissues in the body. Children aged under 2 years scheduled for a routine contrast-enhanced MRI examination of any body region may take part in this study, in which case they will receive gadobutrol as contrast agent intravenously at the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg (0.1 ml/Kg) of body weight. Only subjects without renal insufficiency of any intensity (i.e. estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt;80% of age adjusted normal value calculated based on the Schwartz formula) will be included in the trial. The duration of this study as a whole is around 1 year and the total number of children to be enrolled is 50. A child will be expected to take part in the study for around 7 days.</brief_summary>
