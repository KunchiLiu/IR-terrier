	<brief_summary>This research project consists of a prospective diagnostic study conducted on patients with clinical suspicion of rhabdomyolysis admitted to the emergency rooms of the University Hospitals of Nimes, Montpellier, Paris, Nice and Toulon Inter Army Hospital. The main objective of this study is to determine whether the plasma level of Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) may be retained as a predictor of acute renal failure (ARF) occurring within 48 hours after admission for rhabdomyolysis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this are: - to study plasma NGAL levels on admission to the emergency ward as a marker of morbidity and mortality by considering the following factors: duration of hospitalization, need for extracorporeal blood purification, ICU admission, death. - to study the delay between the onset of the proposed cause of rhabdomyolysis and treatment initiation - to study the delay between treatment initiation and the occurrence of ARF.</detailed_description>
