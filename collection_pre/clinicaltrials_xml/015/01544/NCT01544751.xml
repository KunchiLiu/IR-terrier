	<brief_summary>The first line approach to NAFLD is currently based on diet and lifestyle modification. Aim of our Unit is to compare the efficacy of two different doses of metformin (1 g/day and 2 g/day) with atorvastatin (20 mg/day) on amelioration of inflammatory and cardiometabolic parameters, ultrasound signs and clinical scores associated with liver fibrosis in early-stage NAFLD non-diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Pharmacological Treatment: Metformin Versus Atorvastatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease that encompasses both simple steatosis and non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH. There is currently no therapy that is of proven benefit for these liver disorders both of which are closely associated with insulin resistance and features of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, hyperlipidaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The first line approach to NAFLD is currently based on diet and lifestyle modification. However, dietary treatment is limited by the lack of compliance and the frequent regain of weight at follow-up. Aim of our Unit is to compare the efficacy of two different doses of metformin (1 g/day and 2 g/day) with atorvastatin (20 mg/day) on amelioration of inflammatory and cardiometabolic parameters, ultrasound signs and clinical scores associated with liver fibrosis in early-stage NAFLD non-diabetic patients. The investigators will enrol obese or overweight non-diabetic patients with ultrasonographic diagnosis of hepatic steatosis at early stage (NAFLD). The investigators will exclude from the study patients with clinical-biochemical and ultrasound markers of disease severity (age, BMI, lipid profile, AST, ALT, Angulo, BAAT and HAIR clinical fibrosis scores, signs of portal hypertension and posterior attenuation of the deep liver parenchyma at US). Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of three groups for 12 months of study treatment. The first group (n=50) will receive metformin (1g/day) plus dietary treatment; the second group (n=50) will be given metformin (2 g/day) and the third group (n=50) will be treated with atorvastatin (20 mg/day). All participants will be followed-up at 3, 6, 9, 12 months intervals after randomization. We will compare the effects of two doses of metformin with atorvastatin on the amelioration of both inflammatory (PCR, TNF-a , IL-6) and metabolic parameters (lipid profile, BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, 2-h glucose tolerance test, insulin, transaminases, adiponectin,leptin, HOMA-IR index and VAI index). Furthermore, we will assess the improvement under drug treatment of liver steatosis on the basis of US signs (liver echogenicity and stiffness) and of fibrosis scoring systems (Angulo, BAAT and HAIR scores). In conclusion, considering the increasing prevalence of NAFLD and its strong association with cardiovascular diseases and cancer, the investigators expect to identify a safe pharmacological regimen that, in addition to dietary treatment, may ameliorate or even reverse this liver disease and the underlying risk factors. This study could have an important social impact in terms of both preventive and therapeutic interventions.</detailed_description>
