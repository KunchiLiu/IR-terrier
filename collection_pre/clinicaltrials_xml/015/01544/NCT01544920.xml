	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of two boceprevir (BOC)-containing therapeutic regimens in the treatment of naïve participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 who have the IL28B CC allele. The regimens differ in the treatment for participants who achieve undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) at the end of the peginterferon alfa-2a (peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) 4 week lead-in. Participants receive either peg-IFN + RBV (Arm 1) or BOC + peg-IFN + RBV (Arm 2). The hypothesis is that Arm 2 is noninferior to Arm 1 in the proportion of participants with undetectable HCV RNA at Follow-Up (FU) Week 24.</brief_summary>
