	<brief_summary>Current asthma medicines include inhalers. A common type of inhaler is called a 'beta-agonist' (e.g. salbutamol). They improve asthma symptoms by stimulating areas in the airway causing it to widen. Although these drugs are useful short term, long term use can make asthma worse in some people. 'Beta-blockers' are the complete opposite type of medication. Just now they are avoided in patients with asthma. Beta-blockers cause problems in asthmatics in the short term, including severe asthma attacks. The other mainstay of inhaler treatment for asthma is inhaled steroid or 'preventer' medication. These work by dampening down the inflammation in the lungs that occurs in asthma. New research has suggested that longer term use of beta-blockers can also reduce airway inflammation which may improve asthma control. This research was done in asthmatic patients who didn't need inhaled steroids to control their asthma. At the moment the investigators are studying to see if there is a benefit of beta-blocker use for asthma over and above asthmatics own usual doses of inhaled steroids. In this study, the investigators will be trying to find out if adding a beta blocker to a smaller dose of steroid inhaler has the same effect on asthma control as just using a higher dose of steroid inhaler by itself.</brief_summary>
