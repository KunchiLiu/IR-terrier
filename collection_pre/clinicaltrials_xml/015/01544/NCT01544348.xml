Diagnostic IgE levels are further restricted for subjects enrolling into each cohort, with the following levels required at Screening: Cohorts 1 and 2: 30700 IU/mL; Cohort 3: 30700 IU/mL (4 subjects), greater than (&gt;) 7001,200 IU/mL (4 subjects), and &gt;1,200 IU/mL (4 subjects); Cohort 4a: 30500 IU/mL; Cohort 4b: &gt;700 IU/mL; Cohorts 5 and 6: 30700 IU/mL (4 subjects per cohort) and &gt;700 IU/mL (6 subjects per cohort) or Japanese Cohorts 79: greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 IU/mL Nonsmoker for &gt;=6 months Obsolete criteria as no longer require Positive in vitro IgE fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (FEIA) response A forced expiration volume in one second (FEV1) &gt;= 80 percent (%) predicted in subjects with asthma. Nonasthmatic subjects with FEV1 &gt;=80% predicted, or with FEV1 less than (&lt;) 80% predicted but who, in the opinion of the investigator, do not have lung disease Ability and willingness to complete the followup period through Day 85 as required by the protocol. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study results Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study Employees of the clinical study site or any other individuals involved with the conduct of the study, or immediate family members of such individuals Exposure to an antiIgE monoclonal antibodies (MAb) within 12 months prior to Screening Positive drug screen at Screening or Day 1. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids, and benzodiazepines History of regular alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to Screening History of sensitivity to any component of the investigational product formulation or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, contraindicates their participation Subjects with abnormal liver function test values (aspartate transaminase [AST] and alanine transaminase [ALT]) at Screening as defined as follows: a) Liver function test values &gt;= 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol Positive test or history of hepatitis B or positive hepatitis C Positive test or history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or subject is known to be HIV seropositive History of cancer, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or in situ carcinoma of the cervix treated with apparent success Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or lactating Plans to donate blood during the study period HyperIgE syndrome or bronchopulmonary aspergillosis Prior history of Immune Complex Disease or type 3 hypersensitivity reactions to MAb administration Known history of prior infusion reaction to MAb administration History of untreated parasitic/helminthic infection within 6 months prior to Screening Uses any of the following medications: a) Oral corticosteroids b) Medium to high dose Immunocorticosteroids (ICS)/ longacting beta agonists (LABA) c) Immunosuppressives d) Beta blockers If receiving allergy immunotherapy, must be on stable dose for 3 months.
