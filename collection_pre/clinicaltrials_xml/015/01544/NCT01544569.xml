	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with rhabdoid tumors in the laboratory may help doctor learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify genes related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from young patients with rhabdoid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers in Samples From Young Patients With Rhabdoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To investigate the expression and function of transposons in 50 primary rhabdoid tumors. OUTLINE: Freshly frozen rhabdoid tumors will be studied using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to establish the genomic location of transposons. Protein expression in rhabdoid tumor tissue microarrays is also analyzed.</detailed_description>
