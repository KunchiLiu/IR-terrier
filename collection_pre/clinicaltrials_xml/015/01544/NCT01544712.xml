	<brief_summary>In stage 3 Osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head, a beneficial effect of bone marrow grafting was reported with a reduction of the functional evolution and the necessity of a total prosthesis placement in a non-controlled retrospective trial. Based on this experience, the investigators would like to start a randomized controlled double blind study on the effect of autologous implantation of autologous bone marrow cells into the necrotic lesion of stage 3 ON of the femoral head.</brief_summary>
