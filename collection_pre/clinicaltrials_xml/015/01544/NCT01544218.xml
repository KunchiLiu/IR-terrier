	<brief_summary>Alcohol use is a serious health threat to the 26% youth in the US with chronic medical conditions. While alcohol use can significantly impact an underlying illness and its safe/effective management, medical specialists rarely screen their adolescent patients for alcohol use. The investigators will validate a new, brief alcohol- screening tool with 9-18 year old youth with chronic medical conditions. Comprehensive assessment information will be collected and analyzed to describe relationships between youth alcohol use, other substance use, and chronic disease outcomes and findings integrated into the validated screen as actionable clinician guidance and health advice.</brief_summary>
