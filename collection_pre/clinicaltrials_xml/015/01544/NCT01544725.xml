	<brief_summary>Using Ketamine for procedural sedation in adults is often uncomfortable for emergency physicians because of the significant proportion of patients experimenting recovery agitation. The investigators believe that combining propofol to ketamine, the proportion of recovery agitation will be significantly lowered. The objectives of this double-blinded, randomized controlled trial are to compare the proportion of recovery agitation in adults receiving procedural sedation with ketamine-propofol versus ketamine alone, and to compare the proportion of other classical procedural sedation side-effects and parameters such as respiratory depression, hypotension, sedation duration, time of recovery, procedural failures, and levels of satisfaction.</brief_summary>
