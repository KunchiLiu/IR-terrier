	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of the CGE physical therapy protocol versus a standard physical therapy protocol of the shoulder by measuring the following after 1 month of physical therapy: the FI2S score including validated measures of pain, glenohumeral joint range of motion in the three planes, the ability to perform certain everyday activities and the strength of forward elevation measured with a dynamometer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives: - To study the evolution of passive glenohumeral range of motion - To study the evolution of the global range of passive and active motion for each method used - To evaluate functional recovery (DASH) - To evaluate the impact on quality of life (SF36) - To study the difference in visual analog scale scores for pain during physical therapy sessions - Compare the two methods/groups after three months.</detailed_description>
