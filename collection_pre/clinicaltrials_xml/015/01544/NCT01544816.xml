FOCP must abstain from sexual activity that could result in a pregnancy, or use acceptable contraceptives throughout the period of study treatment exposure. Acceptable contraceptives include IUDs, hormonal contraceptives (oral, implanted or injectable) and double barrier methods (such as condom or diaphragm with spermicidal gel). If hormonal contraceptives are used, the period of use must be sufficiently long to achieve pharmacological effectiveness prior to study treatment exposure (refer to individual product information for details on onset of effectiveness). FOCP who are not currently sexually active, must agree to use acceptable contraception, as defined above, if they decide to become sexually active during the period of study treatment exposure . 7. The subject is in good physical and mental health based on a general medical history. 8. The subject has adequate visual and auditory acuity and cognitive ability to complete the assessments and is capable of understanding and following instructions for the performance tests within the normal, ageadjusted range (within one SD) at screening. 9. Must be able and willing to obtain a minimum of 7 hours of sleep the night prior to each study visit. 10. The subject is willing and able to comply with all requirements defined within this protocol. 11. The subject reports having a snack at least two afternoons per week. 12. The subject reports experiencing an "afternoon slump". Exclusion Criteria 1. The subject has a current Axis I or Axis II comorbid psychiatric diagnosis or other symptomatic manifestations that, in the opinion of the examining physician (Investigator), will contraindicate treatment with caffeine. 2. Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder 3. BMI ≤ 19 or ≥ 30 kg/m2. 4. The subject has documented allergies, adverse reactions, or intolerance to caffeine. 5. The subject has any significant medical illness or condition for which caffeine is contraindicated. 6. The subject has a history of drug dependence or substance use disorder based upon DSMIVTR criteria (excluding nicotine). 7. The subject has a positive urine drug or alcohol drug test result (to include nicotine). 8. The subject has participated in an investigational study or received an investigational drug within the past 28 days. 9. The subject has used nicotine products within 30 days of screening or during the duration of the study. 10. The subject is taking medications, that have CNS effects or affect performance, (such as sedating antihistamines and decongestant sympathomimetics, either oral or topical), and may interfere with efficacy or safety assessments. 11. The subject has a concurrent chronic or acute illness (such as allergic rhinitis or severe cold), disability, or other condition that might confound the results of rating tests administered in the study or that might increase risk to the subject. Similarly, the subject will be excluded if he or she has any additional conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, would preclude the subject from completing the study or would not be in the best interest of the subject. This would include any significant illness or unstable medical condition that could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol. 12. The female subject is pregnant or lactating or planning on becoming pregnant during the study 13. Hypertension or other chronic medical conditions 14.
