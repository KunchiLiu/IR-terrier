	<brief_summary>A new approach for single stage implant based breast reconstruction (BR) is the use of a titanium-coated polypropylene mesh (TCPM) as an alternative to acellular dermal matrix (ADM). These TCPM have a good biocompatibility and can be used in a similar way as ADM. This study addresses indications, limitations and complications of TCPM in implant based breast reconstruction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An alternative to ADM is the usage of a titanium-coated polypropylene mesh (TCPM=TiLOOP(R) Bra), which is approved for breast reconstruction in Europe. The surgical approach is identical in comparison to ADM reconstruction and has been described previously. This titanium coated lightweight mesh consists of a monofilament structure and was initially invented for hernia repair which has a good biocompatibility. Observed cellular reactions like proliferation and apoptosis were at the lowest level when using this lightweight TCPM compared to not titanium-coated meshes (pure polypropylene (PP), pure lightweight PP mesh or PP mesh incorporating resorbable polyglactic acid). Histopathological analysis of an intraoperative sample of a TCPM after expander/implant BR demonstrated a well incorporated mesh with only weak inflammatory reactions. Preliminary data of in-vitro investigations at the investigators institute confirms the good biocompatibility of this TCPM in distinctive breast tissues (fibroblasts, fat cells, muscle cells) Although meshes are used in a large scale there are no sufficient clinical data regarding safety and outcome. In this multicenter study the investigators are able to investigate a large cohort of patients undergoing implant based breast reconstruction using a TCPM.</detailed_description>
