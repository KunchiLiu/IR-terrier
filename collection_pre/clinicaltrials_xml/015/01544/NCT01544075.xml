	<brief_summary>With the present study the investigators wish to examine if reconceptualisation of pain, by educating chronic whiplash-associated disorders (CWAD) patients on the neurophysiology of pain, in combination with psychologic innoculation is able to influence maladaptive (pain) cognitions, pain (inhibition) and movement performance, and reduce symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pain Neurophysiology Education in Combination With Psychologic Inoculation in Chronic Whiplash</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results from a previous pilot study conducted by the same investigators suggest that intensive pain neurophysiology education (PNE) is able to increase pain thresholds and improve pain behavior and pain-free movement performance in patients with CWAD. However these results have not been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. In addition, it has been emphasized that PNE is not a standalone treatment and that future research should examine PNE in combination with other treatment modalities. Another treatment modality that challenges people's beliefs and barriers is psychological inoculation (PI). However, it has not yet been examined if PI could be a useful component in the rehabilitation of chronic pain patients.</detailed_description>
