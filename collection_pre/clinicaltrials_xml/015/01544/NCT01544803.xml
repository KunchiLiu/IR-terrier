	<brief_summary>Objectives: This study compares the efficacy of eScreen and Alkoholhjalpen in a three-armed randomized controlled design, measuring outcomes in terms of changes in problematic alcohol use up to one year after study recruitment. The eScreen brief Internet intervention for problematic alcohol and drug use offers self-screening, in-depth self-reporting, personalized feedback and treatment recommendations as well as an electronic diary. Progress over time is shown in diagrams detailing consumption levels. A more extensive Internet intervention for problematic alcohol use, Alkoholhjalpen,provides CBT- and MI-based psycho-education with a solution-oriented focus, electronic diary and moderated chat-forum. Method: Participants with problematic alcohol use (AUDIT &gt;7 for men and &gt;5 for women) are randomized into one of three groups: T1, eScreen referral (n=211); T2, Alkoholhjalpen referral (n=211); Control group (n=211). Outcomes on alcohol use as well as health-related symptoms are assessed after 3, 6 and 12 months. The first hypothesis is that all three groups will reduce their alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems at follow-ups compared to the baseline level. The second hypothesis is that there will be no differences between participants in the eScreen and the Alkoholhjalpen group in reduction of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems at follow-ups. The third hypothesis is that participants in the eScreen and the Alkoholhjalpen group will show a greater reduction in alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems compared to the control group (no intervention) at follow-ups. For a greater understanding of the study results possible other interventions received by the study participants for their problematic alcohol use during these 12 months of study participation will be investigated.</brief_summary>
