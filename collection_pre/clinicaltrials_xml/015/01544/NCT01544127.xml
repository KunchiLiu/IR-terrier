	<brief_title>Motivational Interviewing to Prevent Suicide in High Risk Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Veterans who receive health care from the VA are at elevated risk for suicide, and the number of Veterans at high risk may be growing. Although the months following discharge from psychiatric hospitalization are a period of acute risk for Veterans, there is a dearth of empirically supported treatments tailored to psychiatric inpatients and no studies examining treatments for psychiatrically hospitalized Veterans. This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of an adaptation of Motivational Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation (MI-SI) on the severity of suicidal ideation in psychiatrically hospitalized Veterans at high risk for suicide. Participants will be recruited from the Acute Psychiatric Inpatient Unit at the Syracuse VA Medical Center. To meet high-risk criteria, Veterans must score over two on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), which is prospectively predictive of death by suicide. Participants will complete a screening assessment to confirm eligibility and a baseline assessment of risk factors for suicide. They will be randomized to receive Motivational Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation (MI-SI) plus treatment as usual (TAU), or TAU alone. The MI-SI group will receive two sessions of MI-SI during hospitalization and one telephone booster session after discharge. Participants in both conditions will be asked to complete telephone follow-up interviews at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge. Change in the severity of suicidal ideation will be measured using the SSI.</detailed_description>
