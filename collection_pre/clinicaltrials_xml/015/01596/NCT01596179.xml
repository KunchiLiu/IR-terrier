	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Technology Enhanced Nurse Navigator Trial (TENN) Trial is to find the best way to provide breast cancer patients with information through a computer connected to the internet. The study will determine if giving information during treatment may help patients cope better with their treatment. The hypothesis is that participants assigned to receive Technology-Enhanced Nurse-directed Navigation will be more likely to adhere to treatment regimens and have improved symptom management than women who have access to the education portal only.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment for breast cancer has been proven to decrease death from breast cancer. The key to the success of treatment is getting the right dose at the right time, but many women do not receive optimum treatment. Treatment delays, missed appointments, and failure to take medication on a regular basis lead to poorer survival from breast cancer. In a study among low income women only 60% of women adhered to the treatment, that is, taking their medication at least 80% of the time. Twenty percent of women, who were supposed to take 5 years of hormone treatment, had stopped their medication in the first year. Similar problems occur with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Many barriers interfere with adherence to treatment, including poor symptom management, missed appointments, and cancelled appointments. Nurse navigation can help manage and minimize symptoms, assist with appointment reminders, and answer questions to obtain optimum breast cancer treatment. The goal of the proposed study is to rigorously test the delivery of nurse-navigation through a web-based knowledge and communication portal (Technology Enhanced Nurse-directed Navigation (TENN) for its impact on treatment adherence and symptom management. The success of this program will be measured by improved treatment adherence, health outcome measures such as fatigue and symptom management, patient-reported quality of life, reduced distress, and patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
