	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FG-4592 in maintaining and/or correcting hemoglobin (Hb) given to subjects with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis and receiving epoetin alfa.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of FG-4592 in Subjects With End-Stage Renal Disease Receiving Maintenance Hemodialysis in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose ranging study with three consecutive dose escalation cohorts. The study objectives are to demonstrate that FG-4592 is effective in maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) levels when converting from epoetin alfa and to establish optimum starting doses and dose adjustment regimens for Hb maintenance.</detailed_description>
