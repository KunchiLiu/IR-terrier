	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if using a lactoferrin supplement will improve taste perception. Lactoferrin is a type of protein that is naturally produced in the body and is commonly found in saliva.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bovine Lactoferrin in Reducing Taste Disturbances in Patients With Colorectal Cancer Receiving Oxaliplatin-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin (bovine lactoferrin) supplementation on self-reported taste and smell disturbances in patients with colorectal cancer receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the baseline lipid peroxidation byproducts in saliva in these patients as measured by the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) assay. II. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the ability of these patients to generate increased lipid peroxidation byproducts when challenged with a weak iron containing solution. III. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on self-reported general quality of life and on specific self-reported anorexia/cachexia issues in patients with established chemotherapy-induced taste disturbances. IV. To assess the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with oxaliplatin-based therapy induced taste changes OUTLINE: Patients receive bovine lactoferrin orally (PO) (rinse or tablet) thrice daily (TID) for 1 month. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 and 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal carcinoma There are no restrictions on the amount or types of prior therapy Eligible patients must be receiving ongoing chemotherapy with an oxaliplatin containingregimen which is planned to continue for at least one month following enrollment in this trial Any dose or schedule of oxaliplatin administration is allowed as long as patients have selfreported taste disturbance that has either: 1) developed since the initiation of oxaliplatinbased therapy, or 2) a preexisting, treatmentinduced taste disturbance has subjectively worsened since initiating oxaliplatinbased therapy Patients must have normal baseline selfreported taste perception prior to the development of colorectal carcinoma Life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients with a subjective history of an extreme dry mouth syndrome that prevents them from producing adequate amounts of saliva (approximately 2 mL in 1520 min) Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive Patients with any of the following conditions: untreated gastrointestinal reflux disease; untreated diabetes mellitus; active thrush; active oral infection; active mucositis Patients who are known to be pregnant or who are breastfeeding are excluded</criteria>
