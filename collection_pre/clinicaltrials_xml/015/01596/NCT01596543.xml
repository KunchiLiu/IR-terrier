	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of partial and complete sleep deprivation on exercise heat tolerance. Twelve healthy young male volunteers will participate in the study. They will arrive to our lab four times, in each visit the will undergo VO2 test and Heat Tolerance Test (HTT) after sleeping different amount of hours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Partial and Complete Sleep Deprivation on Heat Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The volunteers will arrive to our lab fout times- During their first visit they will go through a VO2 max test in order to evaluate their aerobic fitness, and their physiological efficiency will be measured. During their second visit they will go through an exercise heat tolerance test according to our validated protocol after a full night sleep. During the third and fourth visit they will go through an exercise heat tolerance test and a measurement of their physiological efficiency after a partial and complete sleep deprivation, respectively. The physiological tests will take place in the heat chamber that is located at the Heller Institute of Medical Research. The results will be then analyzed, and a comparison between the physiological measurements during the heat tolerance tests and the physiological efficiency tests after the various sleep conditions will be performed.</detailed_description>
