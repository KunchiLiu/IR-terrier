	<brief_summary>Cancer cachexia is a complex metabolic process affecting up to 80% of patients suffering from an advanced-stage cancer. Moreover, 20 to 40% of all cancer deaths are caused directly by cachexia. Head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer patients are nutritionally vulnerable since tumour localisation can interfere with food intake, since alcohol and tobacco abuse - two etiological risk factors of H&amp;N cancer - are associated with nutritional deficits, and since the intensive treatment can lead to progressive weight loss. Recently, omega-3 fatty acids have gained interest for their beneficial effects in several diseases. Moreover, nutritional supplementation enriched with omega-3 FA could potentially maintain body weight in cancer patients undergoing intensive treatment. Aims In this study, the investigators want to evaluate the use of omega-3 FA supplementation as nutritional and the investigators would like to identify potential risk factors, biomarkers and objective measurement tools which can predict therapy-induced cachexia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Omega-3 Supplements on the Prevention of Cachexia in Head and Neck Cancer Treated With Radio(Chemo)Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design A prospective, placebo-controlled trial. H&amp;N cancer patients eligible for curative treatment will be randomised to receive standard nutritional support with placebo (15ml/day Sunflower oil, control group) or nutritional support with omega-3 FA supplementation (15ml/day Echium oil, experimental group) during radio(chemo)therapy. All patients will undergo a nutritional screening (Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment), a quality of life evaluation (EORTC QLQ C30 &amp; HN35) and will be asked to keep a 3-day food diary at the start of their therapy, and again during the 4th week and the end of therapy. Body composition and grip strength will be measured with bio-electrical impedance (BIA) analysis, Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the JAMAR® hydraulic hand dynamometer once at baseline, and again in the 4th week of therapy. Blood samples are collected at baseline, and in the 4th week of therapy to (1) verify compliance rate by measuring fatty acid concentration, (2) verify the presence of potential biomarkers that can predict cachexia and (3) to detect the presence of SNPs associated with severe acute dysphagia. Demographic data, tumour characteristics and therapy-related toxicity will also be collected. Population Newly diagnosed non-metastatic (stage I-IVB) head and neck cancer patients (≥18 or older) eligible for curative primary or adjuvant radiotherapy with or without systemic therapy</detailed_description>
