	<brief_summary>To the best of our knowledge, a possible relation between smoking and heat injuries or heat intolerance was never scientifically examined, although such a relation is logical according to the observations that smoking has a thermogenic effect, decreases physical fitness and affects the body's heat dissipation.16 healthy young male volunteers will participate in the study, 8 smokers and 8 non-smokers. They will arrive to our lab four or six times. They will perform VO2 test and heat tolerance test (HTT) in different conditions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>16 healthy young male volunteers will participate in the study, 8 smokers and 8 non-smokers. They will arrive to our lab four or five times. During their first visit they will go through a VO2 max test in order to evaluate their aerobic fitness, and their physiological efficiency. During their second visit all subjects will go through the same test after exposure to nicotine. During the smokers' third visit they will go through the same test, after exposure to cigarette smoking. During the non-smokers third visit and the smokers fourth visit - they will go through an exercise heat tolerance test without prior smoking. During the fifth visit the smokers will go through an exercise heat tolerance test after exposure to cigarette smoking. During the smokers' sixth visit and the non-smokers fourth visit they will go through an HTT after exposure to nicotine.</detailed_description>
