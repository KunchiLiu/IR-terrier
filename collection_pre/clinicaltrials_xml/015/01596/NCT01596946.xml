	<brief_summary>Though partner notification is mandatory to perform of Chlamydia trachomatis infected individuals in Sweden, there was a 10-15% annually increase of reported cases between 1997 and 2007 indicating that partner notification may not be effective in preventing transmission. The investigators wanted to determine whether there was any difference in time between home-sampling and clinical testing as a tool of partner notification measured from eliciting of partners to date of testing.</brief_summary>
