	<brief_title>Combined Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Cognitive Treatment in Blast Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The most common blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI)-associated problems are cognitive deficits, such as executive functioning and memory. This study evaluates a combined rehabilitation program: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cognitive therapy for treatment of patients with bTBI. TMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, which is not painful and does not involve any needles or any form of surgery. It acts by delivering a magnetic stimulation to a particular brain region. Half of the study participants will receive cognitive intervention with active TMS, and a control group will receive cognitive intervention with sham TMS. This study takes place in Boston, Massachusetts: at the VA Boston Healthcare System and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.</detailed_description>
