	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To investigate the effects of repeated subcutaneous doses of lixisenatide 20 μg once daily (QD) as compared to liraglutide 1.2 mg QD or 1.8 mg QD in reducing post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG) assessed as area under the plasma glucose-concentration-time curve (AUC) after a standardized breakfast at the end of a 8-week treatment period in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not adequately controlled with insulin glargine (± metformin). Secondary Objectives: - To assess the effects of lixisenatide 20 μg QD as compared to liraglutide 1.2 QD or 1.8 mg QD after an 8-week treatment period in participants with T2DM not adequately controlled with insulin glargine (± metformin) on: - Post-prandial C-peptide, glucagon and appetite perceptions after a standardized breakfast, - Appetite perceptions after standardized dinner, - Gastric emptying after a standardized labelled test meal, - Fasting plasma glucose, 24-hour plasma glucose profile, - Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), - Insulin glargine dose, - 7-point self monitored plasma glucose (SMPG), - Body weight and waist circumference, - 24-hour heart rate and blood pressure, - To assess lixisenatide and liraglutide safety and tolerability as add on treatment to insulin glargine (± metformin).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Participants with T2DM diagnosed at least 1 year before the screening visit. Treatment with neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) or insulin glargine for at least 3 months and at a stable dose (±20%) of at least 10 IU/day (for at least 2 months prior to screening) alone or combined with a stable dose of metformin with or without dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor or sulfonylurea. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥6.5 and ≤9.5%. Body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 40 kg/m^2. Exclusion criteria: Pregnant women or breastfeeding women. Clinically relevant history of gastrointestinal disease associated with prolonged nausea and vomiting, including, but not limited to, gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux disease requiring medical treatment within 6 months prior to the time of screening. Any previous treatment with lixisenatide or participation in a previous study with lixisenatide (AVE0010), and any previous treatment with liraglutide stopped for safety concern or lack of efficacy. Allergic reaction to any glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) agonist in the past (eg, exenatide) or to metacresol. History of unexplained pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, stomach/gastric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease. Personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or a genetic condition that predisposes to MTC.
