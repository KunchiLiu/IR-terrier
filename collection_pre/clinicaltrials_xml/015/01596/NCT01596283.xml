	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help us learn what is the best amount of fluid to administer to patients during liver surgery. Patients will receive either an amount for this surgery based on weight, blood pressure, heart rate and urine output or an amount guided by a computerized system (FloTrac) that helps doctors know how much fluid each patient needs. The FloTrac calculates the amount of fluid patients needs on a minute-to-minute basis, based on real time information like blood pressure, pulse and the ability of the heart and blood vessels to maintain normal vital signs.</brief_summary>
