	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are to extensively study the levels of CD25-Receptors saturation and expression obtained with 2 different doses of Simulect® in combination with Neoral® (i.e to demonstrate that saturation and expression vary according to the dose of Simulect® given), and to study the levels of CD25-Receptors saturation without Neoral® and compare them to the data with Neoral®. It will be conducted in low risk de novo adult renal transplant recipients until 12 weeks post-transplant, receiving either a cumulative dose of 40 or 80 mg of Simulect® in combination with Neoral®, or a cumulative dose of 80 mg of Simulect® in a calcineurin inhibitor free immunosuppressant therapy.</brief_summary>
