	<brief_summary>The Breathe Ventilator is a lightweight, wearable ventilator that has received U.S. FDA clearance for use in patients with respiratory difficulty. The investigators believe that the Breathe NIOV system will reduce the work of the diaphragm and breathing by providing added tidal volume and oxygen. This will be a study in 14 patients with severe-to-very severe chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) to assess their work of breathing while using the NIOV system as measured by esophageal and stomach pressures.</brief_summary>
