	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to provide participants in economically depressed areas of Jordan essential knowledge, practical skills, and intimate support groups—called microclinics—for managing their diabetes. Microclinics consist of 2-8 individuals from pre-existing social networks (friends, relatives, coworkers, neighbors, etc) that voluntarily participate in ongoing education and medical monitoring from local health care professionals, learning and practicing diabetes management strategies, sharing much-needed medical supplies, and exchanging social support in the form of regular micro-clinic meetings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Jordan Diabetes Microclinic Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Global Microclinic Project seeks to empower people to prevent and manage diseases in economically depressed areas Jordan. The project seeks to more broadly link health education opportunities in the form of lectures and seminars with practical experience through workshops and hands-on learning, ultimately resulting in the creation of microclinics. Microclinics are intimate support groups of diabetic patients (2-8 per clinic) who meet in their homes and businesses in order to share the costs of maintaining medical monitoring equipment and supplies, come together to support one another in the management of diabetes, collectively utilize vital treatment options, and receive personalized screening, education and management tools from medical professionals. The microclinics concept is ideal for the management of chronic disorders such as diabetes, a disease which requires ongoing education about diet and exercise and regular monitoring of health indices such as blood glucose levels and weight change. Indeed, the microclinics model has been established successfully in the West Bank specifically to combat diabetes. The goal here is to extend the model to Jordan and to establish microclinics in a collaborative effort with the Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) and the Jordanian Ministry of Health (MoH).</detailed_description>
