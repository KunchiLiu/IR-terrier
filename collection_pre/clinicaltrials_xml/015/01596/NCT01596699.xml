	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the addition of clofarabine, a new chemotherapy agent, to a standard busulfan and fludarabine conditioning treatment has. The study will also look at what causes some people to have high drug levels of these medications in their body compared to other people that may have low drug levels even if they all receive the same dose of medication.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must be ≥ 3 months and ≤30 years of age. Stratum A: NonMalignant Diseases, including: Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes Hemoglobinopathies or transfusiondependent RBC defects Congenital Immunodeficiencies Metabolic Diseases known to be treatable with HCT (e.g. Hurler's) Other Bone Marrow Stem Cell Defects (e.g. Osteopetrosis) Severe Immune Dysregulation / Autoimmune Syndromes with at least transient prior response to immunosuppressive therapy Stratum B: Myeloid Malignancies, including: AML, in greater than first clinical remission, or in CR1 but with detectable disease (≥0.1% Blasts by MRD or Flow, or Positive Cytogenetics), or in CR1 but with a matched sibling UCB donor. MDS JMML CML, with detectable disease by PCR Patients must have a suitable donor based on the UCSF Pediatric BMT SOP. 10/10 (HLAA, B, C, DR, DQ) matching will be done for related and adult unrelated donors; 8/8 (HLAA, B, C, DR) for umbilical cord blood donors. Patients with nonmalignant diseases will generally be eligible only if they have a mismatched donor, or an accepted clinical reason to be considered highrisk for rejection. Liver transaminases (AST/ALT) and Direct Bilirubin less than twice the upper limit of normal within 2 weeks of admission. Cardiac Shortening Fraction ≥27% within 4 weeks of admission. Creatinine clearance by Schwartz formula, GFR or 24 hr urine collection ≥50 cc/min/1.73 m2, within 4 weeks of admission. Pulmonary diffusion capacity ≥50% of predicted corrected for anemia/lung volume within 4 weeks of admission. If unable to do PFT's, then no active lung disease by CXR and/or O2 Sat ≥90% on room air. Fanconi Anemia Dyskeratosis Congenita A known syndrome with increased sensitivity to radiation or alkylating agents Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease eligible for a nonmyeloablative HCT trial A mismatched donor for whom ex vivo Tcell depletion of the donor stem cells is planned</criteria>
