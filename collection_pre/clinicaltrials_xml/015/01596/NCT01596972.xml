	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to determine if a self-administered semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test and telephone pregnancy symptom questionnaire can reduce the percentage of women with a complete uterine evacuation who require a clinic or lab visit to confirm completion. The investigators hypothesize that women with complete uterine evacuation will be less likely to require a follow-up clinic or lab visit by using a standardized pregnancy questionnaire and home SQ-UPT, than by using serum hCG as the objective measure of completion.</brief_summary>
