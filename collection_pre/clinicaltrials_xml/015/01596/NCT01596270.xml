	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAR245409 tablets administered once or twice a day in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate blood levels of SAR245409 after administration of SAR245409 tablets once or twice a day in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma. - To evaluate the effect of food on blood levels of SAR245409 after administration of SAR245409 tablets in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma. - To evaluate the effect of SAR245409 on the body after administration of SAR245409 tablets once or twice a day in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma. - To obtain information on how SAR245409 administered once or twice a day to patients with solid tumors or lymphoma affect disease symptoms and study treatment side effects as reported by the patients on a questionnaire. - To explore the antitumor activity of SAR245409 tablets administered once or twice a day to patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.</brief_summary>
