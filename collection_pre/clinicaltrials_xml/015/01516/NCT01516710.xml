	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare outcomes of laparoscopic versus open liver resection for colorectal metastases in a prospective and randomized study. The study will include all non-anatomic liver resections in our institution. The primary end point is that the use of laparoscopic technique significantly can reduce the frequency of complications to liver resection. Secondary end points are 5-year survival, immediate surgical outcomes, quality of life and degree of impairment of the immune system.</brief_summary>
