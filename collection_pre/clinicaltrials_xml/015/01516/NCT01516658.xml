	<brief_summary>HYBRID study is prospective randomized open label controlled multi center trial, to compare Hydrocoil and bare platinum coil for recanalization after endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HYdrogel Coil Versus Bare Platinum Coil in Recanalization Imaging Data Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At least one Hydrocoil have to use in Hydrocoil arm, and only bare platinum coil have to use in Control arm. Primary endpoint is recanalization within 1 year after embolization, and secondary endpoint are: 1. aneurysmal rupture within 1 year after embolization 2. any event within 30 days after embolization 3. recanalization within 6 months after embolization 4. aneurysmal retreatment within 1 year after embolization 5. aneurysmal rupture and any death within 1 year after embolization 6. any stroke within 1 year after embolization 7. any stroke, death hemorrhagic event, aneurysmal recanalization or retreatment within 1 year after embolization 8. change in aneurysmal occlusion 9. any comlicaion within 1 year after embolization 10. %length of Hydrocoil, maximum diameter of aneurysm, volume embolization ratio.</detailed_description>
