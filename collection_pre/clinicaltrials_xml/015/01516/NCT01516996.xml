	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Nimotuzumab Plus Neoadjuvant and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy to Treat Oropharynx and Hypopharynx Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck(LA-SCCHN) poses one of the most complex management challenges. This stage of disease is still potentially curable, but requires combined-modality therapy. Recent studies have showed that induction chemotherapy（neoadjuvant）reduced the 3-year distant relapse rate. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy(CCRT), on the other hand, has demonstrated a significant and consistent benefit in local control rates, but its impact on distant failure is inconsistent. Nimotuzumab is a novel EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibody that has the potential.to be used as a single agent or as a radio- and chemotherapy sensitizer for the treatment of SCCHN. Thus, investigators conducted a randomized, multicenter phaseⅡ study to compare the efficiency and safety of adding nimotuzumab to neoadjuvant and CCRT with neoadjuvant and CCRT in the treatment of patients with locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and hypopharynx.</detailed_description>
