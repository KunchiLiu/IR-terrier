	<brief_summary>Photosensitivity is well documented among lupus patients and is one of the diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Photosensitivity is highly prevalent in lupus and has a wide range of clinical presentations. However, photosensitivity is a poorly defined in lupus and its pathogenesis is not well understood. The purpose of this study is to characterize the early clinical and histopathological changes in lupus skin that occur as a response to ultraviolet light.</brief_summary>
