	<brief_title>Salvage Therapy With High Dose Oral Clarithromycin in Relapsed or Refractory Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 6-month regimen of oral clarithromycin has been associated with a 35% ORR in patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Responses were more common among patients with conjunctival lymphoma. This could be explained at least in part by the elimination of clarithromycin by tears, suggesting that a higher tumor bioavailability of this antibiotic could result in a higher activity. Thus, a higher dose of clarithromycin could be associated with a higher tumor bioavailability in tissues other than the conjunctiva.</detailed_description>
