	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 g/ day of CaPre™ in reducing fasting plasma serum triglycerides over a four week period in patients with mild-to-high hypertriglyceridemia as compared to the standard of care alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assess the Safety and Efficacy of NKPL66 (CaPre™) in the Treatment of Mild-to-high Hypertriglyceridemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The data generated from preclinical studies, as well as data accumulated from preclinical and clinical studies conducted with the precursor of CaPre™, NKO® , a natural health product (NPN: 80006416), have shown that CaPre™ is a safe product and well tolerated. In addition, there are preclinical data demonstrating that CaPre™ is effective in reducing circulating plasma concentrations of triglycerides. This effect is also accompanied by the regulation of other blood lipids, glucose tolerance and inflammatory biomarkers. These studies have been conducted in several preclinical adult phenotypes: (1) Healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, (2) obese and dyslipidemic Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats and(3-5) in three distinct murine phenotypes (normal wild-type C57BL/6, human ApoA-I transgenic mice and homozygous LDL-receptor knockout). As the prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders progressively increase over the years, it is expected that there will be an augmentation in the necessity for new anti-dyslipidemic medications that can most importantly be added in combination to other treatments. Current treatment methods address a specific target indication, but do not offer complete management of dyslipidemia. We are now left with the option to either inadequately treat patients suffering from cardiovascular and metabolic disorders or, to prescribe combination treatments hoping to address the risk factors while mitigating their known side effects. A treatment gap exists since there is no medication that increases HDL-cholesterol and reduces triglycerides while reducing LDL-cholesterol without side effects. At present there is a need to assess the effectiveness of CaPre™ in reducing triglycerides in patients with high hypertriglyceridemia. The current study will address these issues and will generate the evidence that will be required to determine whether this product could be effectively used in the clinical management of this patient population.</detailed_description>
