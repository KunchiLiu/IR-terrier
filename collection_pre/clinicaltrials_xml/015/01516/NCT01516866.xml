	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a newer imaging technique, called 18F-Sodium Fluoride (NaF) positron emission tomography (PET). NaF is a tracer (dye) that is very sensitive for changes in bone. By using this tracer with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, our ability to evaluate and measure changes in bone lesions could be greatly improved.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sodium Fluoride (NaF) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) in Patients With Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) With Microtubule Directed Chemo or AR-directed Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will look at how repeatable the NaF PET scans are before treatment. Scans will also be performed after standard chemotherapy or hormone-directed treatment. This will allow evaluation of how the NaF PET scans change with the chemotherapy or hormone-directed therapy. In addition, NaF PET scans will be compared with standard computed tomography (CT) and bone scans, as well as prostate specific antigen (PSA). This information could be used to develop better ways to measure prostate cancer bone lesions. In turn, this could be used to better evaluate treatment effects of standard chemotherapy and other new drugs being developed to treat prostate cancer.</detailed_description>
