	<brief_summary>This multi-site randomized controlled trial compares the effectiveness of Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) as developed by Cohen, Mannarino &amp; Deblinger (2006) with a wait-list condition in a population of children aged 7-16 years who were exposed to traumatic events beyond the age of three years, at least three months ago, and developed Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Primary aims are to provide evidence that TF-CBT exceeds spontaneous remission of posttraumatic stress symptoms and to assess maintenance of treatment gains at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Secondary aims are to evaluate the effectiveness of TF-CBT in reducing other psychopathology and cognitive distortions of patients and caregivers and to explore moderators and mediators of treatment response. The trial will contribute to implement an evidence-based treatment for traumatized children across a variety of healthcare settings in Germany. The novel aspect is to evaluate the effectiveness of TF-CBT with a broad range of traumatized "real-world" patients in the context of the German mental healthcare system.</brief_summary>
