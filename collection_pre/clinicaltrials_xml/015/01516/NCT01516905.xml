	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate diagnostic imaging techniques using 124I-NM404 PET/CT in humans with brain metastases and GBMs. This goal will be accomplished by determining the optimal PET/CT protocol and comparing PET tumor uptake to MRI and calculating tumor dosimetry. A future aim of this study will be to compare non-invasive PET/CT and MRI findings with pathological specimens, which is the gold standard but is invasive and impractical in many cases, to determine the sensitivity and specificity of both techniques for accurately detecting tumor infiltration. The data obtained from this study will be used to develop larger diagnostic and therapeutic trials in brain tumors. The long-term goals of this research are to improve the diagnosis and treatment of malignant brain tumors by using radioiodinated NM404.</brief_summary>
