	<detailed_description>Eligible participants with screening central laboratory low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) values ≥ 75 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L) were instructed to follow National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP) Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet and were assigned to 1 of the following 4 background lipid-lowering therapies for a 4-week stabilization period based upon their screening LDL-C and its distance from the individual's required goal as stipulated by their NCEP ATP III risk category: 1. no drug therapy required - diet alone 2. low dose drug therapy required - diet plus atorvastatin 10 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD) 3. high dose drug therapy required - diet plus atorvastatin 80 mg PO QD 4. maximal drug therapy required - diet plus atorvastatin 80 mg PO QD plus ezetimibe 10 mg PO QD. If the participant met entry criteria at the end of the lipid stabilization period they were randomized 2:1 to receive evolocumab 420 mg or placebo subcutaneously once a month for 52 weeks in addition to their background therapy.</detailed_description>
