	<brief_title>Promoting Healthy Lifestyles Using Mobile Phones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We want to learn if conceptually-based behavioral interventions for promoting increased physical activity and decreased sedentary behavior via state-of-the-art mobile phones will be efficacious at improving these behaviors relative to commercially available Android applications as a control. If efficacious, these types of intervention programs could be disseminated to a wide variety of sedentary and underactive adults at a relatively low cost. This could have a potentially significant impact on promoting improved health such as reduced obesity, a key problem within the U.S.</detailed_description>
