	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess the rate of early discontinuation from randomized Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for any reason other than confirmation of the negative HIV infection status of the index person in patients receiving HIV PEP for at least 28 and a maximum of 30 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP) With Darunavir/Ritonavir (DRV/r)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), open-label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention), active-controlled (patients are assigned to either a recognized effective treatment or the study medication), parallel-group (each treatment group will be treated at the same time), multicenter study comparing DRV/r PEP (DRV/r administered with 2 NRTIs selected at the discretion of the investigator) to standard of care PEP (as per German-Austrian guidelines) in patients at risk of HIV infection due to HIV exposure through occupational injury and non-occupational exposure. This study consists of screening period, treatment period and a follow up period. HIV PEP will be administered for a total of at least 28 days and maximum of 30 days during treatment period, including any prestudy HIV PEP initiated before screening. Approximately 318 patients will be screened and enrolled to ensure that at least 131 patients are randomly assigned to receive DRV/r PEP or standard of care PEP. Safety will be evaluated during the entire study period. Data relating to a patient's functional impairment in conjunction with HIV PEP will be collected on Day 1 as baseline data, and further on Days 14 and 28 as well as at Month 3.</detailed_description>
