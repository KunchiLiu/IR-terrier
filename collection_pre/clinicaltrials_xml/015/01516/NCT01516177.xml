	<brief_summary>This is an observational study for people who have received a kidney transplant within the past 1 to 5 years. Researchers in this study are looking for a certain pattern of genes and cells in the blood that has been found in a group of rare transplant patients who do not need immunosuppression. The study goal is to find out how common this pattern is in transplant patients, as a first step in determining if it can be used to personalize anti-rejection drug regimens better.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following surgery, kidney transplant patients must take medications in order to prevent rejection of their transplanted organ. These medications can be very effective. Called immunosuppressive drugs, they work by reducing the activity of the immune system. Because of this, however, they can also have serious side effects, including increased risks of serious infections and certain types of cancer. The ITN Registry of Tolerant Kidney Transplant Recipients recently identified a rare group of people whose immune system has accepted their transplant without continued use of immunosuppressive drugs. Researchers have found that these patients have a unique pattern of cells and genes expressed in their blood compared to other transplant patients. The ARTIST study will ask the questions "Are there other transplant patients who show this pattern?" and "If so, how often?" The goal is to find out if there are other transplant patients who are taking immunosuppression who also show this pattern of genes. If there are others, then this pattern may one day be useful in identifying transplant patients who could reduce the dose of immunosuppression they need without fear of rejection. Researchers are seeking adults who have received a kidney transplant within the past 1 to 5 years. Participants will be asked to attend 3 short appointments with study doctors over a period of 2 years. At these visits, doctors will request demographic and clinical information, relevant medical histories and blood and urine samples. Participants will be compensated for their time. It is important to note that this is an observational study only. Other than receiving consultations and advice from the transplant team, there is no direct medical benefit to participating. However, by participating, patients may play an active part in helping doctors learn to control kidney transplant rejection more effectively, with fewer drugs.</detailed_description>
