	<brief_summary>This is a 4-arm cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether patient financial incentives directly integrated into primary care can improve fecal occult blood test (FOBT) completion rates. We will recruit primary care patients at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center (PVAMC) in 2 stages. In stage 1, we hypothesize that, compared to usual care, $5, $10, $20 incentives will each lead to a statistically significant increase in the rate of FOBT completion. We also hypothesize that there will be a direct dose-response relationship between the incentive amount and rates of FOBT completion. In stage 2, we hypothesize that a lottery-based incentive and a raffle-based incentive will both lead to a statistically significant increase in the rate of FOBT completion compared to a fixed payment incentive with an equivalent dollar per patient value.</brief_summary>
