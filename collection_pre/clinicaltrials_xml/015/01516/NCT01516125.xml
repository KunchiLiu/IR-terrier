	<brief_title>Screening of Healthy Adults for Genetic Variations That Control Fatty Acid Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy African American and Caucasian persons will be screened for specific differences in genes that control how fats are processed in the body. Persons with the needed genotypes will be added to a database of healthy persons who may be asked to join a larger study comparing differences in diet on lipid metabolism and inflammatory biomarkers as well as future studies. A key hypothesis for the larger study is that variations in genes involved in lipid metabolism play a role in determining levels of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs).</detailed_description>
