	<brief_title>Phase II Early Behavioral Intervention in BMT w/ Sleep Disturbance-Assess QOL+Fatigue+Cognitive f(x)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To provide preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBT-I) on insomnia in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To provide preliminary data on the influence of BBT-I on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and cognitive status in BMT recipients. II. To provide preliminary data on the influence of BBT-I on quality-of-life (QOL) in BMT recipients. OUTLINE: Patients complete the BBT-I, comprising the following modules: 1) "What to expect" in terms of fatigue and insomnia as it occurs with cancer and cancer treatment; 2) A review of the Spielman Model of insomnia; 3) A discussion (based on the Spielman Model) regarding how insomnia and fatigue may co-occur and interact in the context of cancer and cancer treatment; 4) An introduction to the concept and practice of Stimulus Control Therapy; 5) An introduction to Sleep Scheduling Specifically modified for cancer patients; 6) Sleep Compression; and 7) Concomitant Medications and Substance Use. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.</detailed_description>
