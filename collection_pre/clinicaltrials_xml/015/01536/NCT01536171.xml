	<brief_summary>This experimental study will compare impact forces and metabolic cost in runners (N=20; ages 18-45 years, who already use a forefoot strike running gait) in two treadmill running test sessions (shod vs barefoot running)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peak Impact Forces and Metabolic Cost During Mid-Forefoot Striking in Shod Versus Barefoot Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: To identify if differences in metabolic cost exist between barefoot versus cushioned shod FM strikers during an acute bout of running exercise. Hypothesis: The metabolic cost will be higher in the cushioned shod runners with forefoot and midfoot strike compared to the barefoot runners. Specific Aim 2: To identify if differences in peak impact forces exist between barefoot versus cushioned shod runners in forefoot-midfoot (FM) strikers. Hypothesis: Peak impact forces will be higher in the barefoot runners with a forefoot and midfoot striking running style compared to the cushioned shod runners with a forefoot and midfoot striking running style.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>trained runners with a running foot striking style of either initial forefoot or midfoot strike. run on average at least 20 miles/week be able to run for at least 20 minutes at one session free of any orthopedic limitation history of lower extremity injury within the last 6 months prior to testing rearfoot strike running style does not run in a cushioned shoe on any occasion runs on average &lt; 20 miles/week unable to run for 20 minutes or greater presence of any open wound or deformity on the feet which would prevent participant from running barefoot neurologic injury that would preclude normal running activity.</criteria>
