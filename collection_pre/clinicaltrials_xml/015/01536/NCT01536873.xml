	<brief_title>Dolutegravir Expanded Access Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ING114916 is an open-label, multi-center EAP to allow access to patients with HIV-1 infection who have documented raltegravir or elvitegravir resistance, have limited treatment options and require dolutegravir to construct a viable anti-retroviral regimen for therapy. Patients must not be eligible for another ongoing dolutegravir clinical trial in order to participate in this EAP. The duration of patient accrual into the study will extend until dolutegravir receives local (by country) regulatory approval.</detailed_description>
