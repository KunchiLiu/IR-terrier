	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for many patients with kidney failure. Sometimes a transplanted kidney is rejected by the patient's immune system. Many types of immune system cells, including B cells, are active in rejection. B cells produce antibodies against anything the body sees as non-self, like germs or a transplanted kidney. Most medicines that help prevent transplant rejection affect cells other than B cells. Belimumab is a medication used to treat a disease called lupus. Belimumab slows development of antibody-producing B cells. This study will test whether belimumab works on parts of the immune system that cause rejection. Twenty to thirty adults getting a kidney transplant will be in this study. Like flipping a coin, a computer will randomly assign half to be given belimumab and half to be given placebo (a fake medicine). Patients and doctors will not know which medicine was assigned until the study is over. A total of 7 doses of study medicine will be given through a vein. One dose will be given during transplant surgery, and the other 6 will be given 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks after transplant surgery. Usual transplant medicines will also be given. After all of the doses have been given, patients will be watched and tested at 24, 36, and 52 weeks after the transplant surgery. Blood samples will be tested to see what study medicines do to the immune system in transplant patients. If patients get a kidney biopsy, the samples will be tested to see if belimumab had any effect. Patients will be asked many questions to see if they are having any side effects. The study will be done at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and Guys &amp;St Thomas Hospital in London, United Kingdom. A pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, is funding the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible for kidney transplantation: Considered eligible for transplantation after undergoing multidisciplinary evaluation at the institution at which the transplantation will be performed Donor characteristics: Receiving a deceased donor kidney or a living donor kidney allograft Age &amp; Gender: Male or female between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent Female Subjects: Not pregnant or nursing and at least one of the following conditions apply: a. Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. In the absence of confirmatory laboratory assessments [(a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 million international units per milliliter (MIU/mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram per milliliter (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole per liter [pmol/L])] in questionable cases, female subjects will be required to use one of the contraception methods as described by the investigator or designee, until confirmatory results become available; b. Questionable postmenopausal status and agrees to use one of the contraception methods as described by the investigator or designee, from Day 0 until 16 weeks after the last dose of investigational product or until postmenopausal status is confirmed with a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MIU/mL and estradiol status who are using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) will be required to use one of the contraception methods as described by the investigator or designee, until postmenopausal status is confirmed. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method; c. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods as described by the investigator or designee, from Day 0 until 16 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Liver function (most recent values available before transplantation): alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2x upper limit of normal (ULN); bilirubin &lt;= 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Immunosuppressants: at the time of transplantation, planned to receive a combination of immunosuppressants including basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisolone Donor characteristics: receiving a kidney allograft from a donor with any of the following characteristics: a) cold ischemic time exceeding 36 hours; b) age &lt; 5 years old; c) for donors after brain death (DBD), age &gt;70 years old; d) for donors after cardiac death (DCD) age &gt;70 years old; e) ABO blood type incompatible against the recipient; f) 0 0 0 HLAA B DR mismatch against the recipient by National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT criteria; g) T and/or Bcell positive crossmatch by complement dependent cytotoxicity or flow cytometry against the recipient. Note : (In some situations it may be that a preexisting T and/or Bcell positive crossmatch by complement dependent cytotoxicity or flow cytometry against the recipient will only be fully revealed immediately after the transplant; in such situations they will be recorded as having met exclusion criteria and withdraw from further involvement in the study; h) serology positive for hepatitis B (except hepatitis B surface antibody and prior vaccination), hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Transplant other than kidney: has previously received a hematopoietic stem cell/marrow transplant or an organ transplant other than a kidney (with the exception of corneal transplantation) Planned immunosuppressant regimen: are being considered for steroidfree or alemtuzumab induction Prior therapy at any time: has ever received any of the following: a) Bcell targeted therapy (e.g., rituximab, other antiCD20 agents, antiCD22 [epratuzumab], antiCD52 [alemtuzumab], BLySreceptor fusion protein [BR3], TACI fragment, crystallizable (Fc), or belimumab) 364 Day prior therapy: has received any of the following within 364 days before Day 0: a) Cyclophosphamide; b) Abatacept; c) A biologic investigational agent other than Bcell targeted therapy [e.g., abetimus sodium, anti CD40L antibody (e.g., BG9588/ IDEC 131; investigational agent applies to any drug not approved for sale in the country in which it is being used] 90 Day prior therapy: has received any of the following within 90 days before Day 0: a) Anti Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or antiInterleukin (IL)6 therapy (e.g., adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, tocilizumab); b) Interleukin1 receptor antagonists (e.g., anakinra); c) Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG); d) Plasmapheresis, leukapheresis 60 Day prior therapy: has received any of the following within 60 days before Day 0: a) A nonbiologic investigational agent (investigational agent applies to any drug not approved for sale in the country in which it is being used); b) Any new immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agent; tacrolimus, Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and corticosteroids are permitted. Inhaled steroids and new topical immunosuppressive agents (e.g., eye drops, topical creams) are also allowed. 30 Day prior therapy: has received any of the following within 30 days before Day 0: a) A live vaccine; b) An increase in dose of an immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agent (decreases in dose or discontinuations are permitted).
