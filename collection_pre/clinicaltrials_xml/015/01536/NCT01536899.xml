	<brief_summary>The investigators are interested in understanding personal factors such as medical conditions and mental health, as well as social and economic factors, that influence marijuana (and other substance) use in HIV-positive patients. Several alternative hypotheses will be evaluated in the proposed project: 1. healthier patients may self-select marijuana use; 2. marijuana use may be associated with consequences that create barriers to seeking healthcare; 3. marijuana use may have medicinal value that reduces the need for such care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medical Marijuana Use in HIV+ Patients Prospective Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will involve a total of 5 interviews with clinical research staff members, the total involvement will be for about 1 year. The first interview will establish a baseline of current behaviors and health status; this will take about 3-4 hours. This interview will take place at the Tolan Park Medical Building, located at 3901 Chrysler Service Dr. The remaining 4 interviews - which will be shorter in length - will be conducted about 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the baseline interview; each follow-up interview will take about 2 hours.The purpose of the 4 remaining interviews is to assess changes in behaviors and health status over time. We will collect urine samples at each of the 5 interview sessions to assess health and illicit drug use.</detailed_description>
