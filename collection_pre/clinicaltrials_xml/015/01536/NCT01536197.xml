	<brief_summary>The investigators wish to study the effects of two forms of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass and lap banding. The surgery is not part of the clinical trial. If your insurance does not cover the procedure, then the patient is responsible for payment of the surgical process. The investigators are doing pre and post surgery testing to provide a better understanding of the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight-loss on taste perception.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Taste Perception Pre and Post Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery is the most effective weight loss therapy for obesity. However, the mechanisms responsible for decreased food intake are incompletely understood. One possible mechanism that could account for decreased food intake is changes in taste perception. Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to provide a better understanding of the effects of bariatric surgery-induced weight-loss on taste perception.</detailed_description>
