	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate if liraglutide adjunct to insulin treatment changes the glucagon response during hypoglycaemia in subjects with type 1 diabetes compared with conventional insulin treatment after 4 weeks' treatment with liraglutide or placebo. Subjects will initially be randomised to one of the three dose groups, and subsequently randomly allocated to one of two treatment sequences (liraglutide/placebo or placebo/liraglutide).</brief_summary>
