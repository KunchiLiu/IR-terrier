	<brief_summary>This is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active treatment, parallel group induction study in subjects with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease. Subjects will receive one of two doses (500 milligrams once daily, 500 milligrams twice daily) of GSK1605786A for 12 weeks. The primary objective of the study is to induce clinical response (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] decrease from baseline of at least 100 points) and/or remission (CDAI score less than 150) with GSK1605786A at Week 12 in subjects with active Crohn's disease to qualify subjects for enrolment into a 52 week maintenance study (CCX114157). Secondary objectives will include assessment of the safety and evaluation of the efficacy in induction of clinical response or remission. Safety will be assessed by recording of adverse events and assessment of changes in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs and electrocardiogram. Population pharmacokinetics will evaluate the two doses of GSK1605786A. Health outcomes assessments will include changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, SF-36, EQ-5D, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Crohn's Disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Active Treatment Study to Induce Clinical Response and/or Remission With GSK1605786A in Subjects With Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, active treatment, parallel group study designed to induce clinical response and/or clinical remission with two oral doses of GSK1605786A (500 milligrams once daily, 500 milligrams twice daily) over a 12-week treatment period in subjects with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease. The primary objective of this study is to qualify subjects for enrolment into a follow up 52 week maintenance study CCX114157. Subjects who achieve induction of clinical response (CDAI decrease from baseline of at least 100 points) or remission (CDAI score less than 150) at Week 12 following treatment with GSK1605786A will be eligible for enrolment into the maintenance study CCX114157. Secondary objectives will include assessment of the safety and evaluation of the efficacy in induction of clinical response or remission. The study is planned to randomise approximately 900 subjects (450 subjects per group) with active Crohn's disease who have been diagnosed for at least 4 months, with documented history of disease in the small and/or large intestine, and characterised by a CDAI score between 220 to 450 (inclusive). Subjects will be required to have evidence of current active inflammation by elevated C-reactive protein (greater than the upper limit of normal of the highly sensitive C-reactive protein test) OR an elevated level of faecal calprotectin. Subjects will be allowed to participate in the study while continuing on stable doses of agents typically used to treat Crohn's disease. Inclusion of subjects who received prior treatment with an anti-tumor necrosis factor agent and discontinued due to loss or lack of efficacy will be limited to approximately 50 percent of the study population. Following a 3-week screening period, subjects will be randomised at baseline to receive blinded treatment with one of two doses of GSK1605786A (500 milligrams once daily or twice daily) for 12 weeks. All subjects meeting the definition of responder (CDAI decrease from baseline of at least 100 points) or who are in remission (CDAI score less than 150 points) at Week 12 will be eligible for randomisation into an ongoing maintenance study (CCX114157). Subjects who do not meet the definition of responder or who are not in remission at Week 12 will not be eligible to participate in study CCX114157. For subjects who complete the study the minimum duration of participation is 15 weeks and the maximum duration is 19 weeks.</detailed_description>
