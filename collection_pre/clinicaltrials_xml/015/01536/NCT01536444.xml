	<brief_title>Use of the Epidermal Micrografts for Wound Healing After Mohs or Excisional Surgery for Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluates a novel micrografting technique to determine how it will influence the healing and cosmetic result of selected post surgical wounds in 12 subjects. The Epidermal Expansion System (designed by MoMelan Technologies) will generate an array of small microblisters and transfer the micrografts to a sterile wound dressing for application to the subject's surgical area. The sponsor hypothesizes that applying expanded micrografts to wounds that otherwise would have healed by second intention alone will hasten healing and possibly reduce scarring.</detailed_description>
