	<brief_title>Comparison of Rapid Thrombelastography and Conventional Coagulation Testing for Haemostatic Resuscitation in Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized study comparing rapid thrombelastography (r-TEG) with conventional coagulation testing for diagnosing post-injury coagulopathy and guiding haemostatic resuscitation strategy in severely injured patients arriving at the trauma center who are likely to require transfusion therapy. Our global hypothesis is that: 1. r-TEG is an effective tool for early identification of specific coagulation abnormalities via real time analysis, providing rapid results at the point of care (POC), 2. r-TEG can be used to guide resuscitation strategy by permitting transfusion based upon individual patient deficits, 3. r-TEG will result in appropriate transfusion of plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets in the individual trauma patient, 4. r-TEG will result in reduced transfusion requirements in patients with post-injury coagulopathy. Our specific study aims are: 1. To compare r-TEG parameters [TEG-ACT, alpha angle, K value, MA (maximum amplitude), G value (clot strength), and fibrinolysis (EPL=estimated percent lysis)] with conventional coagulation testing [aPTT, INR, platelet count, fibrinogen level, D-dimer] in their ability to diagnose and monitor coagulation abnormalities in the trauma patient specifically. 2. To compare blood product administration (packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and apheresis platelets) in the first 24 hours post-injury when transfusion is guided by r-TEG versus conventional coagulation tests. 3. To determine whether normalization of r-TEG values predicts cessation of coagulopathic bleeding better than normalization of conventional clinical coagulation tests based upon clinical impressions of the treating surgeons and review of operative records and outcome. 4. To determine and compare patterns of transfusion ratios of packed red blood cells: fresh frozen plasma: platelets for resuscitation of patients with post-injury coagulopathy in the r-TEG versus conventional coagulation test guided groups for the first 24 hours post-injury. 5. To determine and compare the timeframes of blood product administration throughout the first 24 hours post-injury when transfusion is guided by r-TEG versus conventional coagulation testing. 6. To compare the incidence of hemorrhage-related deaths as: very early mortality (&lt;2 hours post-injury), early (2&lt;6 hours post-injury) and delayed (6-24 post-injury) based upon review of death/autopsy records for date, time and cause of death in patients whose resuscitation is guided by r-TEG versus conventional coagulation testing. 7. To compare a) the incidence of transfusion associated lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure (MOF); b) the length of stay in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and the number of ventilator free days in the SICU; and c) late mortality (&gt;24 hour to Day 30), including day number and cause of death, in patients whose resuscitation is guided by r-TEG versus conventional coagulation testing.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female, age &gt;18 years admitted to Denver Health Medical Center. 2. Blunt or penetrating trauma sustained &lt; 6 hours before admission, with Injury Severity Score &gt; 15 (ISS&gt;15), likely to require transfusion of RBC within 6 hours from admission as indicated by clinical assessment. 1. Age &lt; 18 years. 2. Documented chronic liver disease (total bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL). Advanced cirrhosis discovered on laparotomy will be a criterion for study withdrawal and exclusion of conventional coagulation or rTEG/TEG data from the analysis). 3. Known inherited defects of coagulation function (e.g. hemophilia, Von Willebrand's disease). 4. Prisoner. 5. Pregnancy.</criteria>
