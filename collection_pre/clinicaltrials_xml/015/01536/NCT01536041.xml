	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are: i. to determine the effect of single oral doses (20 and 200 mg) of ONO-6950 versus placebo on exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) as percent attenuation in the decrease of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after exercise challenge ii. to determine the safety and tolerability of single dose administrations of 20 and 200 mg of ONO-6950 in asthmatic patients. The secondary objectives of this study are: i. to compare the effect of different (20 and 200 mg) single oral doses of ONO-6950 versus montelukast (10 mg) on EIB as percent attenuation in the decrease of FEV1 after exercise challenge ii. to determine the ratio of responders/non-responders in FEV1 for different (20 and 200 mg) single oral doses of ONO-6950 in comparison to montelukast (10 mg) and placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Placebo and Active Controlled Study of ONO-6950 in Asthmatic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will examine if ONO-6950 could alleviate EIB in asthmatic patients. Eligible patients will complete a randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover study. During each of four evaluation periods, patients will be administered a single dose of either 20 or 200 mg ONO-6950, 10 mg Montelukast, or placebo. Each evaluation period include various assessments following exercise challenge in an ambulatory setting.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients of both genders, between 18 to 60 years of age, with bronchial asthma for at least 6 months and history of exercise induced bronchospasm Patients with FEV1 ≥ 70% of predicted after withholding shortacting β agonists for at least 8 hours prior to testing Screening exercise challenge demonstrates that the patient experiences a fall in FEV1 of ≥ 20% Nonsmokers with free from the usage of nicotinecontaining products at least for a year prior to screening Previous history of lifethreatening asthma, respiratory tract infection and/or exacerbation of asthma within 6 weeks prior to the first screening visit History of being unable to tolerate or complete an exercise challenge and clinically significant multiple drug or food allergies Past or present disorders and diseases including, but are not limited to cardiovascular, malignancy, hepatic, renal, hematological, neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, or pulmonary other than asthma Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR) or seasonal allergic asthma,with significant symptoms that may confound study assessment Significant safety laboratory, ECG, or vital sign abnormalities that would place the patient at undue risk during the study procedures</criteria>
