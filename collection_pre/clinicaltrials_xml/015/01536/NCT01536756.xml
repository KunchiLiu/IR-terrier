	<brief_summary>Evidence shows that depression was found to be associated with physical inactivity and on the other hand, high prevalence of depression was also found in patients with chronic pain. Structured physical rehabilitation program with exercises as main component and pain management provided by physiotherapy has been proved by overseas studies to be effective in reducing the psychological symptoms of depression through increasing the physical fitness and relieving the pain. Literatures also reported a strong sociocultural influence on the prevalence of depression and the manifestations of their clinical signs and symptoms in patients suffered from mental health problems between Chinese and Western societies. The benefits of physical rehabilitation program in the management of depression cannot be assumed in the Chinese population. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a structured "Physical Rehabilitation Program" for Chinese patients diagnosed with depressive disorder (mild to severe severity) on the physical fitness and negative psychological symptoms of the recruited patients. The Hypothesis are: 1. The Physical Rehabilitation Program is effective in improving the physical fitness in Chinese patients with depressive disorders. 2. The Physical Rehabilitation Program is effective in alleviating the negative psychological symptoms in Chinese patients with depressive disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Structured Physical Rehabilitation Program for Chinese Patients With Depressive Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty-four Chinese patients who are diagnosed as depressive disorders with age between 18 and 64 years old, fulfilling the inclusion criteria (stated at the attached study proposal) will be recruited for a 12-week physical rehabilitation program with forty-two patients for the intervention group (n=42) and equal sample size for the control group (patient put on the waiting list for the Physical Rehabilitation Program). All patients will be allocated to either the intervention group or control group by computer generated block randomization with block size of 6 persons using StatsDirect Software, version 2.7.8. The subjects of the control group will be asked to maintain their usual activities while awaiting for the physical rehabilitation program at the 12-week waiting time. They will be allowed to receive any other usual medical services including social services and psychotherapy but not physiotherapy services. At the end of the 3rd month, the control group will be recruited into the Physical Rehabilitation Program. Patients in the control group will then join in as the intervention group and follow the intervention and assessment protocol. All the patients will be instructed not to disclose their grouping to the assessor. Sub-group analysis will be conducted for further in-depth analysis of the subjects in the intervention group having clinical manifestations of pain interference as triage by the 7 items in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - short form - Chinese version. Outcome measures on the physical and mental domains will be conducted: at baseline (T1-before commencement of program), end of the 3rd month (T2-end of program for intervention group; end of the waiting time of control group), 12 months (T3-one year long term follow-up for the intervention group). Validity and reliability of all the adopted outcome measures were reported in medical literatures. There is no reported harmful effect on all interventions and there is no pain or discomfort for all of the testing procedures. Physical outcome measures include body composition (body mass index, percentage of body fat); flexibility (sit and reach flexibility); muscular endurance (1-minute sit-up count); muscle strength (hand grip strength, isometric quadriceps strength); cardiovascular endurance (maximal oxygen consumption) and physical functioning (Brief Pain Inventory- Chinese version). Mental outcome measures include depression, anxiety &amp; stress (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) - Chinese version); depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale- Chinese version) and self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale- Chinese version). The findings will serve as pilot program for rolling out of the services for Chinese patients with depressive disorders to other clusters / hospital and reference base for future territory-wide profile study on this clientele and randomized controlled trials.</detailed_description>
