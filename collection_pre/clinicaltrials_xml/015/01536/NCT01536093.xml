	<brief_summary>Colostrum is rich in cytokines and other immune agents that may provide immunomodulatory protection against nosocomial infection in extremely premature infants. However, most of them could not proceed enteral feedings due to clinical instability in the first few days. Recent studies supports oropharyngeal administration as a potentially safe and effective delivery method for immunologic benefits and only small amount of colostrum could be administrated for immune therapy for extremely premature babies. The purpose of this study is to determine the beneficial effects of oropharyngeal administration of colostrum for immunologic aspects in extremely low gestational age infants and evaluated the safety of this method to extremely premature infants in the first few days of life.</brief_summary>
