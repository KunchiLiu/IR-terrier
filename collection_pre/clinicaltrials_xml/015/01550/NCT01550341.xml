	<detailed_description>STRIDE2 will assist in identifying and monitoring individuals' HIV risk behaviors and provide resources to seek treatment for their HIV care and substance use. The goal of STRIDE2 is to examine if there are differences in HIV, drug use, and other outcomes between individuals receiving treatment versus individuals actively using, not actively using and not in treatment, and individuals on Methadone, Suboxone, or in some other treatment.</detailed_description>
