	<brief_summary>Background. Headache is one of the most common causes of consultation in primary health care and neurology in Europe. Cervical muscle tension can maintain a restriction of joint motion at the suboccipital level, facilitating the referred head pain. Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of two manual therapy treatments for tension-type headache. Methods. A randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted, for a period of 4 weeks and a follow-up at one month post-treatment. Eighty-four patients with tension-type headache were assigned to 4 groups (3 treatment groups and 1 control group). Treatments included manual therapy of suboccipital soft tissue inhibition, occiput-atlas-axis global manipulation, and a combination of both techniques. Outcome measures were: impact of headache, disability caused by headache, ranges of motion of the craniocervical junction, frequency and intensity of headache, and associated headache symptoms. Results. After 8 weeks, there were significant improvements in impact of headache (p=0.01), disability (p=0.001), and craniocervical flexion (p=0.03) for the suboccipital soft tissue inhibition group; in headache impact and disability (p=0.000), pain intensity (p=0.02) and craniocervical flexion (p=0.004) and extension (p=0.04) for the occiput-atlas-axis group; and in impact (p=0.002), functional disability (p=0.000), headache frequency (p=0.002) and intensity (p=0.001), craniocervical flexion (p=0.008) and extension (p=0.003) and associated headache symptoms (p=0.01) for the combined therapy group, with effect sizes from medium to large. Conclusions. Occiput-atlas-axis and combined therapy group treatments are more effective than suboccipital soft tissue inhibition for tension-type headache. The treatment with suboccipital soft tissue inhibition, despite producing less significant results, also has positive effects on different aspects of headache.</brief_summary>
