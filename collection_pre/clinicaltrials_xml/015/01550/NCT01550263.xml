	<brief_title>Psychological Distress and Outcomes in Hip Preservation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The correlation between increasing psychological distress and worsening surgical outcomes has been extensively documented in patients undergoing spine surgery. However, we have no reason to believe that patients with hip pathology are uniquely exempt from the influence of psychosocial factors. To our knowledge, no study has been done to evaluate the effect of pre-operative psychological distress on outcomes after hip preservation surgery. We therefore propose to use the DRAM to measure pre-operative distress in patients undergoing open or arthroscopic hip preservation surgery and to compare these pre-operative distress scores with post-operative outcomes. We hope the information we gain will allow clinicians to comprehensively evaluate the patient with hip pain and to make more informed choices about operative treatment.</detailed_description>
