	<brief_title>Impact of Aspiration Thrombectomy During Carotid Stenting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies have demonstrated that carotid artery stenting is a safe and effective alternative to carotid endarterectomy for high or standard risk patients with symptomatic stenosis. Despite the routine use of embolic protection devices, numerous studies have shown that carotid stenting is associated with a higher degree of intracranial emboli by diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain. A potential solution to minimize this effect is the use of aspiration prior to distal embolic protection removal.</detailed_description>
