	<brief_summary>The investigators analyze the clinical outcome of steroid withdrawal protocol starting at 3 months after kidney transplantation using tacrolimus, Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF), and basiliximab. This study is an open-label, prospective, controlled clinical trial in a single center. Those patients who fulfill the entry criteria could enter in this prospective controlled trial of steroid withdrawal three months after transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steroid Withdrawal Immunosuppression After Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Those patients who fulfill the entry criteria enter in this prospective controlled trial of steroid withdrawal starting at three months after transplantation. The entry criteria include 1) no episode of clinically treated nor biopsy confirmed acute rejection up to entry; 2) serum creatinine level equal to or less than 2 mg/mL on three separate measurements; 3) no proteinuria (urine protein less than 1000 mg/24 hours; 4) tacrolimus trough level &gt; 5 ng/ml without signs of nephrotoxicity; 5) agreement to follow the study protocol. For the patients who enter into the protocol, prednisolone would be slowly withdrawn by 2.5 mg in every two weeks until 8 weeks after entering the protocol (5 months post-transplantation). The patients visit every week, and they are closely monitored with symptoms and signs, blood cell count, chemistry, and urinalysis.</detailed_description>
