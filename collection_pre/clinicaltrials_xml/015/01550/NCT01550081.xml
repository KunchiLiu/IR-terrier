	<brief_summary>Aerobic interval training is shown to be superior in increasing oxygen uptake in both healthy and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), compared to moderate continuous training. However, in cardiac rehabilitation exercise groups, exercise intensity is usually controlled with perceived exertion (Borg scale). The investigators will investigate degree of agreement between target heart rate and perceived exertion during interval training in cardiac rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
