	<brief_summary>This study aims to identify electrophysiological correlates of impaired perceptual and linguistic processes in chronic schizophrenic patients, un-medicated first-episode schizophrenic patients and their healthy relatives. Following administrating some questionnaires (demographic details and psychiatric history questionnaire, handedness questionnaire, reading abilities test and positive and negative symptoms questionnaire) and performing a perception test and a verbal abstract intelligence test, participants will conduct a brain scan during a series of perceptual and linguistic tasks.</brief_summary>
