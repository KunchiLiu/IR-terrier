	<brief_summary>Several methods have been demonstrated to improve intubating conditions during sevoflurane induction in children. These include opioids, propofol, and addition of neuromuscular blocking agents in pediatric patients. But the study about the comparison of these agents has been uncommon. Frenectomy is common procedure to treat ankyloglossia. It is a short procedure performed under general anesthesia. The investigators aimed to compare intubating conditions among children with propofol, alfentanil or rocuronium after sevoflurane induction.</brief_summary>
