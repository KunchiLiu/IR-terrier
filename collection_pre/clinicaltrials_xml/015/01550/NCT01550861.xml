	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Natural in vitro Fertilization and in vitro maturation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vitro Maturation (IVM) of Human Oocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Collection of one mature egg from a follicle in the ovary without gonadotropin medications (natural cycle IVF) results in low pregnancy rates. One way to improve natural cycle IVF is to combine this procedure with the removal of immature eggs from the ovary and mature these eggs in the laboratory ( in vitro maturation-IVM). The in vitro mature eggs are fertilized and the resultant embryos are cultured using conventional IVF techniques.</detailed_description>
