	<brief_summary>This study seeks to determine if non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) taste detection thresholds change with repeated testing. Threshold testing for NEFA taste has been reported by a number of laboratories, including our own; however, these studies have reported data for only one testing occasion. The investigators seek to conduct repeated testing to measure the test-retest reliability of these methods. The investigators believe that with repeated exposure to NEFA, a person's sensitivity increases. The investigators are also testing the efficiency of testing by two methods (forced-choice ascending trial versus staircase). Additionally, the association between taste responses, diet and BMI will be explored.</brief_summary>
