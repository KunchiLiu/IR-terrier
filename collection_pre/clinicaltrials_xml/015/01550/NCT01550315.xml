	<brief_summary>The investigators will test the hypothesis that markers of vascular endothelial dysfunction will be exaggerated acutely with an extreme high sodium diet compared to an extreme low-sodium diet. The investigators will compare patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia (POTS) to healthy control subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Dietary Sodium Intake on Vascular Endothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will involve a crossover design in which each subject will be assessed (as below) while on a very low-sodium (10 mEq/day) diet compared with a very high-sodium diet. These acute dietary interventions will be part of the parent study ("Dietary Salt in Postural Tachcyardia Syndrome" funded by R01 HL102387) for 4-5 days at the time of the study. Dietary success will be assessed using a 24h urine for sodium and creatinine as a part of the parent study. Blood will be drawn and collected in a fasting state for future assay and analysis of the following tests: - Glucose, Insulin (glucose impairment, insulin resistance) - Fasting lipid profile - C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) (inflammatory state) - Inflammatory cytokines (inflammatory state) - aliquots (future analysis) Pulsitile Arterial Tonometry (PAT) Protocol Calf Blood Flow in Reactive Hyperemia (CBF-RH) - venous occlusion plethysmography Evaluation of Forearm-Mediated Dilation</detailed_description>

Able and willing to provide informed consent Overt cause for postural tachycardia (such as acute dehydration) Inability to give, or withdrawal of, informed consent Pregnant Other factors which in the investigator's opinion would prevent the subject from completing the protocol.</criteria>
