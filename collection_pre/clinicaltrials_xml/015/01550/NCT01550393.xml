	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies biomarkers in urine from patients with Wilms tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Urine Samples From Patients With Wilms Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To validate the prognostic performance of specific-candidate Wilms tumor markers by measuring their urinary concentration using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in urine specimens collected at diagnosis from 50 patients with favorable histology Wilms tumor who relapsed and 50 patients who did not relapse. OUTLINE: Urine specimens are analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for biomarkers.</detailed_description>
