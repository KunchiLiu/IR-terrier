	<brief_summary>People with schizophrenia often have problems with negative symptoms; expressing and identifying their emotions, their amount of speech, motivation and interests, feelings of purpose, social skills, and experiencing enjoyment. For this reason, new interventions are being developed to treat these problems. One new intervention is the Motivation and Engagement (MOVE) Program. The MOVE program is a new program which consists of weekly meetings for 9 months between a patient and a trainer. The weekly meetings will consist of goal setting and organization of the home to make daily tasks more manageable. During the weekly meetings the patient and trainer will discuss emotions and the trainer will help the patient identify their emotions. The researchers hope to learn whether MOVE will help improve the problems. If it works the researchers will do a larger study comparing MOVE to other treatments that have addressed some of the problems already. The therapist will ask you if the sessions can be audio taped to ensure that the therapist is doing a helpful job for you. They will also ask if the session can be video taped so that the tapes can be used to train other therapists learning about MOVE. The choice to do either of these is voluntary and you can continue to participate in the study if you choose not to have the session be audio and/or video taped.You will be provided a University Release document to provide that permission if you so choose.</brief_summary>
