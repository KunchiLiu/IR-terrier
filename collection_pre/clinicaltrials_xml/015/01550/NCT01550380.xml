	<brief_summary>This is a phase II open label fixed dose study in subjects with advanced, metastatic, or refractory endometrial or ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with PI3 kinase pathway activation as demonstrated by PIK3CA gene mutation, PTEN gene mutation, or PTEN null/low protein expression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BKM120 in Advanced, Metastatic, or Recurrent Endometrial Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given the mechanisms of action and the safety profiles and tolerability of BKM120 (NVP-BKM120), the use of this agent may provide benefit to patients with endometrial and ovarian cancer. Endometrial and ovarian cancer are leading causes of cancer death in women and there are limited treatment options for those with metastatic or refractory disease. Alterations of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway have been identified in many cancers, including endometrial and ovarian cancers. Tumors with PI3K mutations have demonstrated sensitivity to this compound therefore justifying use of this agent in subjects with endometrial or ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Therefore use of this agent in cancer patients with PI3 kinase pathway activation offers a reasonable treatment option. Patients will be initially treated with single agent BKM120 for 28 days at a dose of 100mg per day. CT response will be adjudged post BKM120 therapy at day 28. If there is no significant progression on CT scan, patients will be continued on BKM120 for another two cycles (28 days per cycle [+/- 3 days]). Response assessments will then be done at that time (after the third 28 day cycle). If there is no significant progression on CT scan, then the patients will continue BKM120 with response assessments using standard CT criteria every two cycles (28 days per cycle [+/- 3 days]) thereafter. If disease progression is observed, patient will have completed the study. Patient will be seen within 30 days for end of treatment visit.</detailed_description>

Patients who are currently taking therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium or any other coumadinderivative anticoagulant. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding or adults of reproductive potential not employing an effective method of birth control. Double barrier contraceptives must be used through the trial by both sexes. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study. Women of childbearing potential, defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 72 hours prior to initiating treatment. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the treatment for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug discontinuation). The highly effective contraception is defined as either: 1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 2. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment. 3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient. 4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b): Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring must use condom during treatment, for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period. Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection History of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with the investigator</criteria>
