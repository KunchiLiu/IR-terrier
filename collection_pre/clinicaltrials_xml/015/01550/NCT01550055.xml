	<brief_title>Study of Cetuximab to Treat KRAS Wild Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CMAB009 is a recombinant, human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds specifically to the extracellular domain of EGFR. It is composed of the Fv regions of a murine anti-EGFR antibody with human IgG1 heavy and k light chain constant regions and it is expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells. It is a biosimilar of cetuximab (C225, Erbitux®) and it is developed by Shanghai Zhangjiang Biotechnology Limited Company and produced by Biomabs. Phase I study results suggest that CMAB009 showed well-tolerated safety profile and primary efficacy. This multicenter, open-label study was to determine whether adding cetuximab (CMAB009) to irinotecan increased the response rate and prolongs survival in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) previously treated with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin.</detailed_description>
