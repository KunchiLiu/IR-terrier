	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that a pedometer-based motivated 6-months walking program will result in sustainable enhanced PA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STEP: Enhanced Physical Activity in Children and Youth With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enhanced PA will in turn positively influence health, social participation and QoL of sedentary CWE through multiple pathways. These will involve biomedical factors (i.e. attention deficit, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders); and contextual environmental and personal factors that include psychosocial factors at the child, family and community level (Figure 1).21 These factors may include family stressors, social support, self-efficacy, and autonomy.22 We expect that enhanced, sustained PA will improve health, functioning and QoL of CWE through its potential neuroprotective and circadian rhythm regulatory effects, and by increasing social participation, promoting a positive outlook on life and self-image, decreasing worries and concerns, decreasing emotional problems and the concealment of epilepsy, and delaying secondary health complications.</detailed_description>
