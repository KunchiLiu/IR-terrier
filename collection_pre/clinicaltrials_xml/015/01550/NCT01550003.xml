	<brief_summary>A Multicenter, Open-label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol in Children and Adolescents With Moderately to Severely Active Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pediatric Arthritis Study of Certolizumab Pegol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall study consists of a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks and an Open-Label Treatment Period which will continue until the approval of the marketing application for the Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) indication in the subject's country or region or until further notice from UCB (approximately 4-6 years duration; depending on region). A Final Visit will be conducted 12 weeks after last dose of study medication. Overall, study visits will occur monthly during the first 6 months and every 2 months afterwards. All patients will receive active treatment with Certolizumab Pegol. The dose will depend on actual weight. Home dosing will be allowed between study visits. If less than 50 % of the study population achieves an adequate response to the treatment (American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 30 % (PedACR30) response) at Week 16, the study will be entirely discontinued.</detailed_description>
