	<brief_summary>Recent studies demonstrated that prolonged rhythm observation increases the detection of atrial fibrillation in patients prior diagnosed as cryptogenic stroke. Detection of atrial fibrillation in these patients has important therapeutic implications for the anticoagulation regimen. However, data on optimal monitoring duration and method of AF detection are limited.</brief_summary>
