	<brief_title>Effect of Intravenous Fluid Supplementation on Serum Bilirubin and Cardiorespiratory Parameters in Preterm Infants During Phototherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 preterm infants (GA â‰¤ 32 week) were assigned randomly to either receive a fluid supplementation due to short term demand (control group, n=30;) or a 20% extra fluid supplementation (study group, n=30) during intermediate phototherapy. Collected data: - cardiorespiratory parameters(heart rate, blood pressure, SaO2 and capillary refill time, breathing rate, temperature) and a pain score was completed at the first day of phototherapy - The maximum total serum bilirubin levels (TSB) within one week after onset of phototherapy</detailed_description>
