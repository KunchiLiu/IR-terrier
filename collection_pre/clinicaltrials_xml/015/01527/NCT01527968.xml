	<brief_summary>TXA and EACA have been reported to reduce blood loss in cardiac and neuro surgery, but there is no literature available comparing the two in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The investigators want to determine if TXA or EACA compared with placebo are effective and safe for blood loss prevention in TKA by comparing blood loss, transfusion rates, and total cost.</brief_summary>
