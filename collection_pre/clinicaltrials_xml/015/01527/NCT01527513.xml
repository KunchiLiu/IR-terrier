	<brief_title>Effects of Eslicarbazepine Acetate (Esl, Bia 2-093) on Cognitive Function in Children With Partial Onset Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a 2-part multicentre study in approximately 117 patients. Part I of the study will consist of a 4-week prospective observational baseline period, a 12-week double-blind period (4-week up-titration and 8-week maintenance), and a tapering-off period. After the screening visit (V1), patients will enter the baseline period. At the end of the baseline period (V2), eligible patients will be randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to receive double-blind treatment with Eslicarbazepine acetate or Placebo in addition to concomitant therapy with 1 or 2 Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs). Concomitant AED therapy will be kept stable during the whole study. Initial dose of the study treatment will be 10 mg/kg/day. After 2-weeks on 10 mg/kg/day, the dose will be up-titrated to 20 mg/kg/day (maximum 1200 mg/day). After 2 weeks on 20 mg/kg/day, dose will be up-titrated to 30 mg/kg/day (maximum 1200 mg/day) and patients will receive this dose for 8 weeks. If intolerable adverse events (AEs) occur, the patient can be down-titrated to the previous dose (only 1 down-titration step will be allowed) or discontinued. After the 8-week maintenance period, the study treatment will be tapered off in 10 mg/kg/day 2 week steps. However, if a patient experiences an increase in seizure frequency (e.g. more than 100% increase vs. baseline) during tapering-off, the patient can proceed directly to the open-label part of the study (Part II). After completion of the last 2-week 10 mg/kg/day step, patients will have the option to enter a 1 year open-label treatment (Part II) with Eslicarbazepine acetate (up to 30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1200 mg/day), or will have a 4 week observational follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At visit 1 (screening), patient must be/have: written informed consent by parent or legal guardian and, where applicable, the patient; age 6 to 16 years, inclusive; a documented diagnosis of epilepsy for at least 12 months prior to screening; at least 2 partial onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening despite treatment with 1 to 2 AEDs in a stable dose regimen; an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of at least 70; current treatment with 1 to 2 AEDs (except oxcarbazepine, benzodiazepines other than clobazam and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)); excepting epilepsy, patient is judged to be in general good health based on medical history, physical examination and clinical laboratory tests; in the opinion of the investigator, able to complete the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) test battery; in case of a girl of childbearing potential, patient presents a serum Bhuman chorionic gonadotropin (B hCG) test consistent with a non gravid state and agrees to remain abstinent or use reliable contraception (if used, hormonal contraception must be combined with a barrier method) starting at screening and continuing until at least the poststudy visit (PSV). At visit 2 (randomisation), patient must be/have: at least 2 partialonset seizures during the 4 week baseline period prior to randomisation (documented in a diary); in case of a girl of childbearing potential, patient presents a urine BhCG test consistent with a nongravid state; stable dose regimen of concomitant AEDs during the 4 week baseline period; diaries satisfactorily completed by the patient or his/her caregiver during the baseline period; satisfactory compliance with the study requirements during the baseline period. At visit 1 (screening), patients must not be/have: only simple partial seizures with no motor symptomatology; primarily generalised seizures; known rapidly progressive neurological disorders (progressive brain disease, epilepsy secondary to progressive cerebral lesion); occurrence of seizures too close to count accurately; history of status epilepticus or cluster seizures (i.e., 3 or more seizures within 30 minutes) within the 3 months prior to screening; seizures of nonepileptic origin; LennoxGastaut syndrome; West syndrome; major psychiatric disorders; seizures of psychogenic origin within the last 2 years; history of schizophrenia or suicide attempt; history of attention deficit disorder or other diseases adversely affecting cognitive abilities; currently treated with oxcarbazepine, benzodiazepines other than clobazam (on a routine or chronic basis) and/or VNS; known hypersensitivity to carboxamide derivatives (oxcarbazepine or carbamazepine); uncontrolled cardiac, renal, hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, metabolic, haematological or oncology disorder; second or third degree atrioventricular blockade; relevant clinical laboratory abnormalities; estimated creatinine clearance (CLCR) &lt;60 mL/min; pregnancy or nursing; treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate in any previous study; participation in other drug clinical trial within the last 2 months; not ensured capability to perform the trial; any other condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the patient's ability to comply with the study protocol. At visit 2 (randomisation), patients must not be / have: â€¢ any condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the patient's ability to comply with the study protocol.</criteria>
