	<brief_title>The Pharmacokinetic Study of Red Yeast Rice Capsule Compared to Lovastatin Tablet in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is two-ways crossover design. The subjects will receive a dose of four 600 mg LipoCol Forte Capsules or 20 mg Mevacor Tablet in fasted state in the morning. There is a minimum of a 6-days washout period before crossover of treatments. Each subject will be admitted before administration of the investigational product in each period. Study responsible personnel will give the subjects a single tablet or four capsules in fasted state in the morning. The blood samples will be drawn prior to the dosing, and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the dosing. Observations will be conducted up to 12 hours after the dosing.
