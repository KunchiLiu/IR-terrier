	<brief_summary>Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the etiology of the weight increase in Depot-medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) users. Method: Prospective study with 100 women, aged 18-40 years old and BMI &lt; 30kg/m², paired with users of a non hormonal method follow for two years. Will be included only women who never used DMPA. There will be evaluated habit, blood pressure, anthropometric measure, distribution of corporal fat, lipids profile and glycemia parameters every six months. Thirty women and their control group will performed a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to evaluate the resistance of insulin, adiponectin,neuropeptide Y, apolipoprotein A/B and arterial evaluation with ultrasound, intimal and media measure. Anova analysis for repeated samples. The metabolic alterations should elucidate the etiology, and the beginning of the sub clinical cardiovascular disease should be shown/discarded with the arterial evaluation.</brief_summary>
