	<brief_summary>This trial is a prospective, open-label, single-arm trial of the safety of a single FT1050-treated CB unit for hematopoietic reconstitution after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for hematologic malignancies. A maximum of 40 eligible adult subjects will be enrolled and treated in the trial at approximately 2-4 centers within the U.S.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Treatment With FT1050 of an Ex-vivo Modulated Umbilical Cord Blood Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will be conducted in three sequential cohorts of 6-12 evaluable subjects each. Cohort 1 will enroll eligible subjects for whom a single CB unit has been identified that meets the minimum HLA-matching criteria and has a minimum pre-cryopreservation total nucleated cell (TNC) dose of at least 2.5 x 10^7 cells/kg. Cohort 2 is identical to Cohort 1, except that the TNC dose of the CB unit must be between 2.0 - &lt;2.5 x 10^7 cells/kg. Finally, Cohort 3 is identical to Cohort 2, except that the TNC dose of the CB unit must be between 1.5 - &lt;2.0 x 10^7 cells/kg. If no safety rules are triggered, the study will proceed to the next dosing cohort. Within a dosing cohort, no more than three subjects may be before Day 42 at any one time, unless they have already engrafted neutrophils. The final dosing cohort is defined as the last cohort where 12 evaluable subjects are treated and no stopping rules are triggered. The corresponding TNC dose level will be considered the minimally acceptable TNC dose level.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects with hematologic malignancies for whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation is deemed clinically appropriate. Eligible diseases and stages include: NonHodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) 2. Lack of 56/6 HLAmatched related or 8/8 HLAA, B, C, DRß1 matched unrelated donor; or unrelated donor not available within appropriate timeframe. Identification of suitable backup CB unit(s) (single unit with precryopreservation cell dose ≥ 2.5 x 10^7 TNC/kg or two units with precryopreservation cell dose ≥ 1.5 x 10^7 TNC/kg each) and meeting minimum HLA match criteria. An acceptable alternative to one or two backup CB unit(s) is the identification of an eligible related haploidentical donor that meets minimum HLA match criteria. 3. Age 1865 years. 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02. 5. Signed IRB approved Informed Consent Form (ICF). 1. The following hematologic malignancies are excluded: Myelofibrosis (Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia) Aplastic anemia. 2. Previous treatment that included an allogeneic transplant 3. Cardiac disease: symptomatic congestive heart failure or evidence of left ventricular 4. dysfunction (Ejection fraction &lt; 40%) as measured by gated radionucleotide ventriculogram or echocardiogram; active angina pectoris, or uncontrolled hypertension; history of myocardial infarction with depressed ejection fraction. 5. Pulmonary disease: symptomatic chronic obstructive lung disease, symptomatic restrictive lung disease, or corrected DLCO of &lt; 50% of predicted, corrected for hemoglobin. 6. Renal disease: serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl and calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 40 mL/min 7. Hepatic disease: serum bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl (except in the case of Gilbert's syndrome or ongoing hemolytic anemia), SGOT or SGPT &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal. 8. Neurologic disease: symptomatic leukoencephalopathy, active CNS malignancy or other neuropsychiatric abnormalities believed to preclude transplantation. 9. HIV antibody. 10. Uncontrolled infection. 11. Pregnancy or breast feeding mother. 12. Inability to comply with the requirements for care after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 13. Participation in a concurrent clinical trial with a novel, unapproved investigational agent &lt; 30 days prior to Day 0.</criteria>
