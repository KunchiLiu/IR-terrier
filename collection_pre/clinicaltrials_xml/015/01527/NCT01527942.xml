	<brief_summary>Bariatric patients usually require the use of either intravenous or oral opioid medications. The use of opioids, however, is often associated with side-effects such as nausea, sedation pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression with often delay patient discharge. This study makes use of intravenous acetaminophen , a non-opioid analgesic preoperatively to determine if this will decrease the use of opioids post-operatively for pain management in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery.</brief_summary>
