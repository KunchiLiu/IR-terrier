	<brief_title>Antazoline in Rapid Cardioversion of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antazoline is a first generation antihistaminic agent with chinidin-like properties. When administered intravenously, antazoline exerts a strong antiarrhythmic effect on supraventricular arrhythmia especially on atrial fibrillation (AF) facilitating rapid conversion to sinus rhythm. Despite relative lack of published data antazoline is marketed in Poland and widely used in cardiology wards and emergency rooms due to its efficacy, safety and rapid onset of action within minutes of administration. To show superiority of antazoline over placebo a sample size of 80 patients was calculated based on following assumptions: two-tailed test, a type I error of 0.01, a power of 90%, efficacy of placebo 5%, efficacy of antazoline 50% and 20% drop-out rate to fulfill the criteria of intention-to-treat analysis. Due to presumed lack of statistical power the secondary end points and safety endpoints will be considered exploratory.</detailed_description>
