	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial is to investigate the potential antioxidant benefits of a cranberry beverage. The investigators hypothesize the chronic consumption of this beverage will improve indices of oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial function, and glucoregulation. The investigators also hypothesize that these benefits will be particularly evident following an oral glucose tolerance test.</brief_summary>
