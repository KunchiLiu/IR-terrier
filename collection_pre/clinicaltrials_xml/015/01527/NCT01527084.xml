	<brief_title>Timing of Surgical Intervention After Percutaneous Catheter Drainage in STEP UP Approach for Severe Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In present study we plan to determine the appropriate timing of surgical intervention after PCD in step up approach of Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN). The investigators also intend to evaluate the role of PCD in obviating the surgical intervention in the management of IPN and evaluate the risks &amp; benefits of extended treatment policy of PCD in step up approach of IPN in comparison to early surgery after PCD.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Pancreatitis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>All patients with diagnosis of IPN (UK GUIDELINES) managed with percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) for 10 to 15 days and not showing significant improvement on PCD will be included 1. Patient showing significant improvement on PCD within 10 days of its insertion.(Significant improvement on PCD is defined as resolution of fever, acceptance of enteral nutrition, decrease in total leukocyte count, reversal of organ system failure) 2. Sterile pancreatic necrosis 3. An acute intra abdominal event ( perforation of hollow viscus, bleeding, or the abdominal compartment syndrome) during or within 10 days after PCD insertion 4. Previous drainage or surgical necrosectomy for infected pancreatic necrosis (ERCP with or without papillotomy is allowed.) 5. Previous exploratory laparotomy for acute abdomen and diagnosis of pancreatitis during laparotomy</criteria>
