	<brief_summary>Primary objective of this study was to assess the intrasession, intersession and interobserver variability of the Pentacam-derived curvature and zernike coefficients in back surface of normal, keratoconic and crosslinked corneas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Pentacam Classic (Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, software version 1.14r04) was used for the sake of the study.Three study groups were formed: 1) Normal 2) Keratoconus group (KC) included patients with progressive keratoconus and 3) Collagen-Cross-linking group (CXL) included keratoconus patients that had been treated with uneventful CXL at least on year prior to their enrollment in the study. Three consecutive scans were obtained by two experienced operators. The same procedure was repeated within two weeks for the assessment of intersession variability. In all cases acceptable maps had at least 10.0mm of corneal coverage. Keratometry (K), asphericity (Q), best-fit toric ellipsoid radius (Rs), eccentricity (ecc) and aberrometry (6.0mm pupil diameter), were analyzed. Furthermore we calculated and studied CRMS and CLRMS in order to better appreciate the visual significance of HOAs. Precision (Pre), repeatability (COR) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), were calculated for evaluating intrasession and intersession repeatability. Bland-Altman analysis was used for assessing interobserver repeatability.</detailed_description>
