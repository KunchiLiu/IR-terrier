	<brief_title>KeleeÂ® Meditation: A Distinctive and Effective Therapeutic Intervention for Stress, Anxiety, and Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Kelee and Kelee meditation (KM) were developed and founded by Ron W. Rathbun. KM is a unique and distinctive form of meditation that is easy to learn and requires only about 10 minutes twice a day to perform. The goal and discipline of KM is the development of one-pointed stillness of mind. To better comprehend how KM is effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, one must understand the difference between concentration and meditation, and the basic principles of the Kelee. Experiencing and understanding the distinction between brain function and mind function are of vital importance in KM. Brain function is associated with the tension-based, intellectual, thinking process and the five physical senses whereas mind function is associated with the relaxation-based, experiential, mental feeling process, self-awareness, and clear perception. Performing KM leads to the calming of brain function and opening to the experience of mind function. With continued practice, persistence, and patience, the practitioner can begin to learn on his own how to examine and understand (ie, troubleshoot) his own thoughts and feelings from a calm, clear internal space that is free from the negative chatter and preconception associated with the brain. This increases self-awareness of the presence of internalized compartments (misperceptions of life that exist as negative thoughts and/or feelings) and the practitioner begins to develop clarity of perception. Clear perception allows one to begin the process of detachment from internalized compartments, which occurs through the cessation of looping followed by the processing of compartments. As each negative compartment dissipates, the practitioner experiences a subtle, but cumulative, corresponding improvement in stress, anxiety, and depression. When the flow of the Kelee is allowed to be, there is balance between the thinking and the feeling process leading to overall well-being, which leads to improved self-efficacy and reinforces the repetition of KM.</detailed_description>
