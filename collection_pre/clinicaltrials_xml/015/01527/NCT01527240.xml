	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to determine whether a single injection of CsA after intravenous thrombolysis can significantly decreased the volume of cerebral infarction at day 30 ± 15 assessed with Flair MRI. Secondary objectives are to determine whether a single injection of CsA after intravenous thrombolysis is safe and effective regarding to death and disability.</brief_summary>
