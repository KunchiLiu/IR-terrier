	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the effect of a diet combining two different functional concepts on markers associated to cardiometabolic risk. The functional concepts are selected on the basis of their reported ability to influence the inflammatory tonus. It is hypothesized that the medium-term consumption of a diet combining low GI-prebiotic foods may positively influence various biomarkers associated with the risk for developing metabolic syndrome and cardiometabolic disease. Also, the combination of functional mechanisms are expected to result in synergistic effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intervention is carried out in healthy women following a randomized crossover design in which an "active" (functional") diet is compared with a control diet formulated in agreement with the Nordic Dietary Recommendations but lacking the functional ingredients of the active regime. The active diet supplies important daily amounts of dried legumes and wholegrain cereal products. Each dietary treatment is applied for 4 weeks separated by a 4-6 week washout period. Subjects are encouraged to maintain a stable body weight under the whole trial.</detailed_description>
