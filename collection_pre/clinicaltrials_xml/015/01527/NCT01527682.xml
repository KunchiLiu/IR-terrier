	<brief_summary>Objectives: The study will assess the ocular hypotensive effect of latanoprost and dorzolamide in a selected sample of patients affected by primary Pediatric Glaucoma (PG), refractory to surgical procedures. Safety will be assessed, too.In the first version of the protocol 96 eyes were forecasted to complete the enrolment. The protocol was then amended and now to complete the study 68 eyes should be included.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design: Single arm, prospective, experimental study. Due to ethical reasons and in order to adhere as much as possible to current clinical practice, the presence of a control arm is not planned. Due to the non-comparative nature of the study, no blinding of treatment is planned.</detailed_description>
