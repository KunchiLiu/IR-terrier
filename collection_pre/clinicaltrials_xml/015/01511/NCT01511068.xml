	<mesh_term>Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>A diagnosis of PAP caused by biallelic mutations in CSF2RA or CSF2RB associated with impaired GMCSFRalpha or GMCSFRbeta function, respectively, resulting in reduced but nonzero GMCSF signaling Able and willing to give written informed consent / assent as necessary Clinically stable Confirmed diagnosis of a disorder of surfactant production caused by biallelic mutations in ABCA3, SFTPB, or SFTPC Confirmed diagnosis of autoimmune PAP caused by a high level of GMCSF autoantibody Confirmed diagnosis of secondary PAP caused by an underlying clinical disorder known to be associated with the development of PAP, e.g., inhalation of silica or titanium; myelodysplasia and others Treatment with any investigational agent in the 3 months prior to enrollment History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to GMCSF or other yeastderived products History of asthma or other reactive airways disease Known active, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection A serious medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator or data and safety monitoring committee, would make the patient unsuitable for the study</criteria>
