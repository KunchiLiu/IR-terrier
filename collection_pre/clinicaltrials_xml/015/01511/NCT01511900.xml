Prescribed doses of these medications must have been stable for 2 months at the time of first dose. Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination or vital signs at screening Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities as assessed by the investigator. Clinically significant laboratory result as assessed by the Investigator. The patient has a history of clinically significant medical disease including significant allergies (except for untreated, asymptomatic seasonal allergies at the time of dosing), or hematological, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, or neurological disease, other than T2D, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism or depression. History or presence of malignancy within the past 5 years. History of Type 1 diabetes or clinically significant cardiovascular disease (including a history of unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, or New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure within 6 months prior to screening) or clinically significant renal disease.
