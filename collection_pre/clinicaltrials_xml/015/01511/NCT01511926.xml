	<brief_summary>The most common pain-relievers used by patients with rheumatic disorders are called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs are effective and well documented, but they can cause ulcers and gastrointestinal side effects. Vimovo™ is a tablet containing naproxen (NSAID) and a gastroprotective agent called esomeprazole. Patients with rheumatic disorders, who are at risk for developing gastrointestinal side effects, and where lower doses of naproxen or other NSAID treatment is not considered sufficient, could use this tablet. The regulatory authorities in many European countries have approved the use of Vimovo™, but they would like to understand how various factors influence the doctors' decision to prescribe the tablet and what is characterizing the patients receiving it. The aim of the study is to answer these questions.</brief_summary>
