	<brief_summary>The study will assess whether Atazanavir/ritonavir monotherapy provides a non-inferior proportion of virological efficacy with respect to ATV/RTV + 2 NRTIs in patients with stable suppressed viremia and no prior virologic failures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Atazanavir/Ritonavir Monotherapy as Maintenance in Patients With Viral Suppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised (1:1), multicentre, comparative, parallel-group, prospective, open label, non-inferiority controlled clinical trial. Enrolled patients, taking an ATV/r based HAART and with stable HIV-RNA &lt; 50c/ml (24 weeks), will be randomized to: - continue the same regimen ATV/RTV 300mg/100mg OD plus 2 NRTIs (according to the specific dosing schedule) as backbone (HAART arm) with ATV/r - or simplify therapy to ATV/RTV 300mg/100mg OD as monotherapy (Monotherapy arm) with ATV/r The study follow up will be 96 weeks after randomization and primary objective will be evaluated at week 48. Patients will be followed every 4 weeks for the first 16 weeks, and then every 8 weeks until week 48, then every 12 weeks until week 96 or discontinuation ; at each visit the following evaluations will be performed: - clinical assessment. - routine laboratory tests (hematological tests and hematochemistry) including creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, gammaGT; urine analysis, lipid profile, level of HIV-RNA and CD4 cell counts. During follow-up, at randomization, week 48, week 96 or discontinuation, patients will additionally undergo: - Fat redistribution evaluation by DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry - Vertebral and femoral bone mineral density evaluation by DEXA. - ECG; - Glicate haemoglobin. - Adherence assessment (questionnaire and/or pills counts). - Neurocognitive evaluation [HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) evaluated by validated neuropsychological tests]. In case of viral rebound (defined as 2 consecutive measurement of HIV-RNA &gt; 50 c/ml) patients will be immediately contacted in order to perform genotypic tests. Furthermore a plasma PK analysis will also be performed. Any patients with virological rebound will be selected for a reintensification therapy with NRTIs and if not suppressed after 12 weeks they will be discontinued.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV infected patients age &gt; 18 years On treatment with ATV/r plus 2 NRTIs for at least 48 weeks Virological suppression (HIVRNA&lt;50 c/ml) by at least 24 weeks with ATV/r plus 2 NRTIs No virologic failure after the initiation of the first antiretroviral therapy. Previous treatment changes due to toxicity or treatment simplifications will be permitted only if occurred with documented virological suppression. CD4 cells nadir &gt;100 cells/ÂµL PPI and H2receptor antagonists as follows: the protonpump inhibitors should not be used; if H2receptor antagonists are coadministered, a dose equivalent to famotidine 20 mg BID should not be exceeded.
