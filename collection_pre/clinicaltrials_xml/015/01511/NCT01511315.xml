	<criteria>1. Subjects are nonimmunocompromised males or females 18 years of age or older 2. Subjects have moderatetosevere (≥10% total body surface area) plaque psoriasis 3. Subject diagnosed at least 6 months prior to entering the study 4. Negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days before the first dose of ustekinumab in all women (except those surgically sterile or at least 5 years postmenopausal) 5. Sexually active subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use medically acceptable form of contraception during screening and throughout the study. 6. Are considered eligible according to the following tuberculosis (TB) screening criteria: Have no history of latent or active TB prior to screening. An exception is made for subjects currently receiving treatment for latent TB with no evidence of active TB, or who have a history of latent TB and documentation of having completed appropriate treatment for latent TB within 3 years prior to the first administration of study agent. It is the responsibility of the investigator to verify the adequacy of previous antituberculous treatment and provide appropriate documentation. Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or physical examination. Have had no recent close contact with a person with active TB or, if there has been such contact, will be referred to a physician specializing in TB to undergo additional evaluation and, if warranted, receive appropriate treatment for latent TB prior to or simultaneously with the first administration of study agent. Within 1 month prior to the first administration of study agent, have a negative QuantiFERONTB Gold test result, or have a newly identified positive QuantiFERONTB Gold test result in which active TB has been ruled out and for which appropriate treatment for latent TB has been initiated either prior to or simultaneously with the first administration of study agent. The QuantiFERONTB Gold test are not required at screening for subjects with a history of latent TB and ongoing treatment for latent TB or documentation of having completed adequate treatment as described above; Subjects with documentation of having completed adequate treatment as described above are not required to initiate additional treatment for latent TB. Have a chest radiograph both posterioranterior and lateral views, taken within 3 months prior to the first administration of study agent and read by a qualified radiologist, with no evidence of current, active TB or old, inactive TB. 7. Subject meets concomitant medication requirements or agrees to complete a washout for restricted medications prior to starting the study. Washout Period : Must not have initiated or changed any other medications that could affect psoriasis (e.g. beta blockers, lithium salts, antimalarials) within the 4 week period prior to Week 0 or during the study Subjects must not have received immunosuppressive, chemotherapy and/or systemic therapy including oral calcineurin inhibitors (such as cyclosporine), retinoids (Vitamin A and analogues), Methotrexate, Azathioprine, 6thioguanine, Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), Hydroxyurea, or cytokines (such as interferongamma) within the 4 week period prior to Week 0 or during the study Subjects must not have received phototherapy (broadband or narrowband UVB) within the 2 week period prior to Week 0 or during the study. Subjects must not have received photochemotherapy (PUVA) within the 4 week period prior to week 0 or during the study Subjects must not have received TNFα inhibitors (such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab) within the 12 week period prior to Week 0 or during the study Subjects must not have received alefacept within the 12 week period prior to Week 0 or during the study. Subjects must not have received ustekinumab within the 12 week period prior to Week 0 or during the study. Subjects must not have received treatment with an investigational drug within the previous 4 weeks or 5 halflives prior to Week 0 (whichever is longer) or participation in another clinical trial within the 4 week period prior to Week 0 or during the study 1. Subject is younger than 18 years of age. 2. Subject has less than 10% body surface involvement of his/her psoriasis. 3. Subjects with erythrodermic, pustular, or guttate psoriasis 4. History of known or suspected intolerance to any of the ingredients of the investigational study product. 5. Evidence of skin conditions other than psoriasis that would interfere with studyrelated evaluations of psoriasis. 6. Evidence of active infections such as fevers, chills, sweats, or history of untreated Lyme disease and active severe infections within 4 weeks before screening visit, or between the screening and Week 0 visits 7. Subject has a history of listeriosis, untreated TB, persistent or active infections requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV antibiotics, IV antiretrovirals, or IV antifungals within 30 days of baseline, or oral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals for purpose of treating infection, within 14 days of baseline. 8. Have a history of latent or active granulomatous infection, including histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis, prior to screening. 9. Refer to inclusion criteria for information regarding eligibility with a history of latent TB. 10. Have had a Bacille CalmetteGuerin (BCG) vaccination within 12 months of screening. 11. Have a chest radiograph within 3 months prior to the first administration of study agent that shows an abnormality suggestive of malignancy or current active infection, including TB. 12. Have had a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection or opportunistic infection (eg. Cytomegalovirus, pneumocystosis, aspergillosis) within 6 months prior to screening. 13. History of immune compromised status [e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status or other immune suppressing drug] or a congenital or acquired immunodeficiency or subject testing positive for HIV, Hepatitis B, and/or Hepatitis C during screening procedures. 14. Subject has a poorly controlled medical condition including, but not limited to, unstable cardiovascular disease, poorly controlled diabetes, recent stroke, history of recurrent infections, or any other condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation in the study would place the subject at risk 15. Subject has a history of or ongoing drug or alcohol abuse 16. Subject is not willing to comply with washout requirements (see above) 17. Subject is known, or suspected of being unable to comply with the study protocol</criteria>
