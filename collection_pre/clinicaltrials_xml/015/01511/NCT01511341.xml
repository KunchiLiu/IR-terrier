	<brief_summary>Paediatric rheumatisms represent a large group of inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases of the locomotion system. The annual rate incidence of children diagnosed with rheumatic disease in Switzerland (canton of Vaud) is 56.8 for 100'000 children. These children experience a chronic course of the disease impacting on their quality of life and family functioning. Their medical treatment is significant and may last for life. Caring for these children involves a multidisciplinary approach. Control of the disease and management of the symptoms becomes of foremost importance to minimise disability and pain. In addition to medical care, the supporting role of nurses in the care of children with rheumatic diseases and their family aims to limit the potential for further deformity, disability, and psychological complications. In particular, they play a key role in supporting the specialist team caring for patients with rheumatism disease, recognising poor disease control and the need for changes in treatment, providing a resource to patients on treatment options and how to access additional support and advice, and identifying best practice to achieve optimal outcomes for the patients and their family. Nurses also ensure the link between medical practitioner, other health providers, and family, thus play a key role in the follow-up care of the child and its family. Follow-up of children and their family can be ensured by regular telephone consultation (telenursing) made by experienced nurse specialists in rheumatology. However, the effectiveness of telenursing remains to be proven in children with chronic rheumatic diseases. The aim of this study is, therefore, to evaluate the effect of a telephone nursing intervention on the outcomes of family and children with rheumatism chronic disease. This randomised crossover, experimental longitudinal study will be carried out in the outpatient clinic of paediatric rheumatology of a tertiary referral hospital in canton of Vaud. The population will consist of children newly diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatologic diseases and one of their parent. The nurse-led intervention will consist of providing a monthly telephone call by a qualified and experienced nurse specialist in paediatric rheumatology and TN to ensure follow-up of the children and their family. The intervention will focus on providing affective support, health information, and aid to making decision.</brief_summary>
