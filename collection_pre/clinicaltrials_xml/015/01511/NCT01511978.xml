	<brief_title>Effectiveness of 3,4-Diaminopyridine in Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the study are to confirm the safety and to test the efficacy of 3,4-DAP in the treatment of LEMS-related weakness. This is a phase 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal study in subjects with known clinically active LEMS who have been on a chronic stable dose of compassionate distribution Jacobus 3,4-DAP provided through FDA-approved individual investigator-held INDs.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 18 or over 2. Ambulatory while taking 3,4DAP, i.e. the patient can perform the timed up and go (TUG), either with or without an assistive device 3. Established diagnosis of LEMS, with documentation provided 4. Continuous use of JPC 3,4DAP for at least 3 months 5. Minimum of 3 doses per day with no single dose less than 10 mg of 3,4DAP 6. The patient needs to wait about 15 to 30 minutes to experience an unequivocal improvement in a LEMSinduced dysfunction after they take their first dose of 3,4DAP in the morning [a patient who remains in bed past this point by choice may still be eligible] 7. Stable regimen of all LEMSrelated treatments for at least 3 months 8. Stable daily regimen of other medications (prescription and overthecounter) for a minimum of 1 month 9. Willing to chance being tapered off of 3,4DAP 10. Fluency in English 11. If applicable, agrees to use birth control during heterosexual intercourse until at least 2 weeks after completion of study 12. A signed informed consent by the study subject 1. Last monoclonal antibody treatment (e.g. rituximab) was less than 6 months ago (i.e., recent treatment is an exclusion) 2. Clinically significant or poorly controlled condition that in the opinion of the study personnel might pose an unacceptable risk to the patient if entered into the study 3. Respiratory failure requiring intubation while on 3,4DAP with no precipitating event or medication 4. Use of any investigational drug other than 3,4DAP within the last 30 days 5. Pregnant or lactating 6. Current use of other aminopyridines (e.g.4AP) or guanidine 7. Does not display a sufficiently large response to 3,4DAP during the baseline observation period in the CRU to detect a decline during withdrawal of 3,4DAP</criteria>
