	<brief_title>Study of UshStat in Patients With Retinitis Pigmentosa Associated With Usher Syndrome Type 1B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following screening procedures the gene transfer agent will be injected once only under one retina by an opthalmic surgeon under anesthesia. Patients will then have regular follow up visits where general health examinations, blood tests and ophthalmic examinations including best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundoscopy, autofluorescence, Optical Coherence Tomography, perimetry and Electroretinogram will be undertaken. At the end of the study, the patient will be invited to enter in an open-label safety study and long-term follow-up visits (at least once every six months) including ophthalmological examinations and recording of adverse events will continue for 5 years; then the Investigator will follow the patient for a subsequent 10 years at a minimum interval of once a year to monitor delayed adverse events.</detailed_description>

Males must agree to use two forms of contraception if their study partner is of childbearing potential for three months after treatment. Presence of significant ocular abnormalities that would preclude surgery, effective study follow up or interfere with study endpoints. Concomitant systemic diseases that can alter visual function. Contraindication to pupil dilation, anesthesia or eye surgery. Periocular steroids in the last four months prior to screen. Known allergies to the components of the delivery vehicle or diagnostic agents such as dilation drops. Lifethreatening illness or a history of malignancy within 5 years Laboratory test abnormalities that would make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study Intercurrent illnesses or infections 28 days prior to treatment Concurrent antiretroviral or immunosuppressant therapy Men or women who do not agree to use contraception as specified in the inclusion criteria. Pregnant or breastfeeding women Enrollment in any other clinical study during the 48 week study period Treatment with anticoagulants Past history of HIV or hepatitis A, B or C Inability to comply with the demands of the study Any ocular surgery in the study eye within 6 months</criteria>
