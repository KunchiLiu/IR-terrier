	<brief_summary>Proprioceptive weighting changes may explain differences in postural control performance. In addition, the respiratory movement has a disturbing effect on postural balance. Postural balance seems to be impaired in individuals with respiratory disorders. Increased risk of falling is reported in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Besides the essential role of respiration, the diaphragm may also play an important role in the control of the trunk and postural balance. The aim of the study is to clarify whether proprioceptive postural control is impaired in individuals with diaphragm paresis.</brief_summary>
