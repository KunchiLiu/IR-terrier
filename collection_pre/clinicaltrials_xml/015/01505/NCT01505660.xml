	<brief_summary>Among HIV-infected patients, adherence to antiretroviral medications is one of the most important determinants of clinical outcomes including viral suppression, viral resistance, disease progression, and death. Unfortunately poor adherence among patients with HIV is very common, mean levels of adherence in clinical cohorts are 60-75% or less. Alcohol, drug abuse, and mental illness particularly depression symptoms are key predictors of poor adherence, common among HIV-infected individuals, and important to identify and treat among nonadherent patients. This study will examine the ability of patient reported outcomes (PROs) and a targeted care management approach to improve clinical outcomes with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in routine clinical care of patients with HIV. The investigators will determine whether healthcare delivery team notification of PROs including antiretroviral medication adherence and barriers of adherence such as depression and substance abuse along with tailored intervention recommendations and targeted care management leads to improvement in both process and clinical outcomes including patient-reported outcomes. The investigators will examine process outcomes such as use of clinic support services, and patient outcomes such as improvement in adherence, substance use, depression, and HIV-1 RNA levels.</brief_summary>
