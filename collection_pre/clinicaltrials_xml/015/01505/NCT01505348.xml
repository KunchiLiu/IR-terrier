	<brief_title>Effect of Fasting Versus Feeding on the Bone Metabolic Response to Running</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten physically active males aged 28 ± 4 y (mean ± 1SD) completed two, counterbalanced, 8 d trials. After 3 d on a standardised diet, participants performed 60 min of treadmill running at 65% VO2max on Day 4 following an overnight fast (FAST) or a standardised breakfast (FED). Blood samples were collected at baseline, before exercise, during exercise, for 3h after exercise and on four consecutive follow-up days (FU1-FU4). Plasma/serum were analysed for β CTX, P1NP, OC, bone ALP, PTH, ACa, PO4, OPG, cortisol, leptin and ghrelin.</detailed_description>
