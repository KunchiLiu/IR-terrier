	<brief_summary>The objective is to compare the progression of Atrial Fib (AF) burden by continuous monitoring in patients with recently diagnosed paroxysmal AF treated by catheter ablation (PVI) versus anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter Ablation for Recently Diagnosed Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, multicenter clinical trial comparing medical therapy (Group I) with ablation therapy(Group II). Randomization will be determined by opening a sealed envelope. All patients will be implanted with an implantable loop recorder and followed every three months.</detailed_description>
