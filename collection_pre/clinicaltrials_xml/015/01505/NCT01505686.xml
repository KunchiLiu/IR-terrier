	<brief_summary>MRI imaging in clinically evident inguinal hernia is not routinely used. In other painful inguinal conditions (such as sportsmans hernia) inflammatory changes have been detected. The aim of the present study is to determine, whether similar inflammatory changes can be detected with MRI scan in inguinal hernia. Also, patient questionaires are used preoperatively and postoperatively to determine, if preoperative pain scores can be used as a predictive value for postoperative prolonged pain/neuralgia.</brief_summary>
