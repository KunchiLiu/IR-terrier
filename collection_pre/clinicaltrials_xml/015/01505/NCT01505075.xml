	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoints: - Acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 toxicities Secondary Endpoints: - Late GI and GU Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) toxicities - Biochemical disease-free survival - Biopsy positive rate at 3 years - Quality of life using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire - Develop a biobank of DNA and serum extracted from blood and urine to analyze and develop new biomarkers for prostate cancer progression or susceptibility to severe toxicity</detailed_description>

Patients could have been on combined androgen blockade but are excluded if this was started due to PSA progression</criteria>
