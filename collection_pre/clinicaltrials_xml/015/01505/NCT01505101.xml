	<brief_summary>Persons suffering from chronic pain who are treated with long-term opioid therapy are at risk of misusing prescription opioids and developing opioid addiction. Moreover, long-term use of opioids may result in hyperalgesia, which exacerbates opioid craving and consumption. Mindfulness interventions have been shown reduce chronic pain symptoms, addictive processes, and substance use. The investigators hypothesize that relative to a support group control condition, participation in a novel mindfulness-oriented cognitive intervention, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), will result in improved well-being and decreased pain, opioid craving, and opioid misuse behaviors among chronic pain patients receiving opioid therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Few behavioral treatments target the cognitive-affective mediators of opioid misuse and addiction in chronic pain patients. As such, novel, multimodal interventions are needed to effectively target key mechanisms in the risk chain from chronic pain to opioid misuse and addiction. The secondary aim of this study is to explore possible cognitive, affective, and psychophysiological mediators of intervention effects on pain, opioid craving, opioid misuse behaviors, and well-being.</detailed_description>
