	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to clinically demonstrate a phenomenon of measurement error that can occur during placement of a specific type of total knee replacement prosthesis (single radius femoral component) using a certain type of surgical technique (flexion/extension gap balancing).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Surgical Technique With Use of Single-radius Prosthesis in Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Scheduled to undergo primary total knee arthroplasty performed by the principal investigator Use of a single radius posteriorstabilized TKA prosthesis is planned Spinal anesthetic is planned Diagnosis of osteoarthritis Has normal knee ligaments with no history of previous injury or surgery to ligaments, or other pathologic condition Has at least 100 degrees knee flexion preoperatively (measured by long goniometer) Gives valid informed consent Age 18 years or older Patient receives general anesthetic Diagnosis other than osteoarthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis, posttraumatic arthritis) History of any prior knee ligament injury, or any surgery to ligaments Any connective tissue disease affecting integrity of the ligaments (must have normal ligaments) History of long bone fracture in the affected leg Flexion contracture that would interfere with ability to establish extension gap reliably (judgment of investigator) Maximum preoperative knee flexion is less than 100 degrees. Patient is nonambulatory Any preclusion or inability to use navigation Treatment with single radius posterior stabilized TKA prosthesis is not indicated Participation is not in best interest of patient for any reason Cannot or does not give valid informed consent Female patient who is currently pregnant Age less than 18 years Body mass index greater than 40 kg/(m*m) Incarcerated</criteria>
