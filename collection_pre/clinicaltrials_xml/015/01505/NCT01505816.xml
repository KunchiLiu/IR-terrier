	<brief_summary>This prospective nonrandomized study comprised patients with cataract, corneal astigmatism, and motivation for spectacle independence. In all cases, a Rayner M-flexÂ® T toric Intraocular Lens will be implanted in the capsular bag. Three months postoperatively, distance, intermediate, and near visual acuities; spherical equivalent; residual refractive astigmatism; defocus curve; and contrast sensitivity will be evaluated. A patient-satisfaction and visual phenomena questionnaire will also be administered.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visual Outcomes After Implantation of a New Multifocal Intraocular Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative evaluation was performed at 3 months. The uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity were assessed using the 100% contrast Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart, uncorrected intermediate visual acuity at 70 cm, and uncorrected near visual acuity at 40 cm; a binocular defocus curve was constructed using the ETDRS chart at 4 m and adding to the patient's manifest refraction +2.50 to -5.00 D sphere in 0.50 increments. The cylinder axis of the Intraocular lens (IOL) was measured at the slitlamp using the beam protractor after full mydriasis. The mean of the absolute values of degrees the intraocular lens was off axis was determined. Contrast sensitivity was measured using the CSV-1000 HGT instrument (VectorVision, Inc.), which presents a translucent chart divided into 4 cycles with spatial frequencies of 3, 6, 12 and 18 cycles per degree. The background illumination of the translucent chart does not depend on room lighting. All measurements were obtained under mesopic (5 cd/m2) and photopic (85 cd/m2) conditions. The examinations were performed unilaterally at a distance of 2.5 m with Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and an undilated pupil. All measurements were performed under the same conditions. Patient satisfaction and quality of life were assessed by a simple questionnaire. Patients were interviewed 3 months postoperative. Patients were asked about visual disturbances, visual lifestyle activities, spectacle use, and satisfaction with the procedure.</detailed_description>
