	<brief_summary>This project seeks to develop a quantitative imaging biomarker for evaluating and monitoring treatment response in ovarian cancer metastases and assess its potential in monitoring treatment response. This will involve standardising DW-MRI for the abdomen and pelvis across multiple centres and platforms, assessing reproducibility of the measurement in patients planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and assessing its utility as an early response biomarker in patients with platinum-sensitive relapse due to receive therapy with carboplatin. Scanning measurements will be correlated with histopathological markers in tumour samples in order to link the biomarker with response mechanisms.</brief_summary>
