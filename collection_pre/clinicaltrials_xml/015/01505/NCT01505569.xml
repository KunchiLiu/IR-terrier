	<brief_summary>This is a standard of care treatment guideline for high risk or relapsed solid tumors or CNS tumors consisting of a busulfan, melphalan, thiotepa conditioning (for solid tumors) or carboplatin and thiotepa conditioning (for CNS tumors) followed by an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. For solid tumors, if appropriate, disease specific radiation therapy at day +60. For CNS tumors, the conditioning regimen and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant will be given for 3 cycles.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients must have histological verification of malignancy at original diagnosis. Eligible Diseases Arm A: Solid Tumor Ewing's Family Tumors (ES/PNET/DSRCT) metastatic at time of diagnosis and/or relapsed after therapy Renal Tumors relapsed (all histology Wilm's tumor) or at diagnosis (clear cell sarcoma and Rhabdoid tumor) Hepatoblastoma metastatic at time of diagnosis and/or relapsed after therapy Rhabdomyosarcoma metastatic at time of diagnosis and/or relapsed after therapy Soft Tissue Sarcoma chemotherapy responsive metastatic disease or chemotherapy responsive relapsed disease Primary Malignant Brain Neoplasms &lt;18 years of age at diagnosis and/or relapse Retinoblastoma disseminated at diagnosis and/or relapsed Other High Risk Metastatic or Relapsed Solid Tumors to be approved by 2 or more pediatric hematology/oncology and bone marrow transplant (BMT) physicians Arm B: Certain CNS tumors Medulloblastoma: Children less than 36 months (3 years) of age at time of definitive surgery (for histopathologic diagnosis) who have high risk Medulloblastoma, defined as any one of the following: 1. &gt; 1.5 cm2 residual disease following resection for any Medulloblastoma histology 2. lumbar CSF cytology positive for tumor cells by analysis of fluid collected either before definitive surgery or at least 10 days after definitive surgery 3. MRI evidence of (a) gross nodular seeding in the intracranial subarachnoid space or ventricular system distant from primary tumor site, M2; or (b) gross nodular seeding in the spinal subarachnoid space +/ evidence of intracranial seeding, M3; or (c) extraneural metastases, M4, Anaplastic Histologic Variant Medulloblastoma: less than 70 years of age, any metastatic stage, with total or subtotal resection. Infant Medulloblastoma: Children less than 8 months of age at the time of definitive surgery (for histopathologic diagnosis), any histology, any metastatic state, with total or subtotal resection. Supratentorial Primative NeuroEctodermal Tumor (PNET): Children less than 36 months (3 years) of age at time of definitive surgery (for histopathologic diagnosis) with or without metastatic disease Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor (AT/RT): less than 70 years of age with CNS AT/RT (with or without metastatic disease). Other High Risk CNS Tumors to be approved by 2 or more physicians (at least one oncologist and one BMT physician). Arm C: Germ Cell Tumors Confirmation of germ cell tumor (GCT) histology (both seminoma and nonseminoma). Tumor may have originated in any primary site. NOTE: In rare circumstances, patients will be allowed to enroll even if a pathologic diagnosis may not have been established. This would require a clinical situation consistent with the diagnosis of GCT (testicular, peritoneal, retroperitoneal or mediastinal mass, elevated tumor marker levels {HCG ≥ 500; AFP ≥ 500} and typical pattern of metastases). 1. One or more unfavorable prognostic features for achieving a CR with conventionaldose chemotherapy. Unfavorable prognostic features include: 2. extragonadal primary site 3. PD following an incomplete response (IR) to firstline therapy, 4. PD after a conventionaldose salvage (cisplatin + ifosfamide based) regimen Disease Status at Enrollment: Arms A &amp; B, must have fit one of the following: no evidence of disease or stable, nonprogressive disease (defined as nonprogressive abnormalities on physical exam or CT and/or MRI) within 4 weeks of study entry Arm C Evidence of progressive or recurrent GCT (measurable or nonmeasurable) following one or more cisplatinbased chemotherapy, defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria: 1. Tumor biopsy of new or growing or unresectable lesions demonstrating viable nonteratomatous GCT. Patients with incomplete gross resection where viable GCT is found are considered eligible. 2. Consecutive elevated serum tumor markers (HCG or AFP) that are increasing. Increase of an elevated LDH alone does not constitute progressive disease. 3. Development of new or enlarging lesions in the setting of persistently elevated HCG or AFP, even if the HCG and AFP are not continuing to increase. Age and Performance Status Arms A &amp; B Age: 070 years Performance status: Karnofsky Performance Status at least 50% for patients &gt; 16 years of age or Lansky Play Score at least 50 for patients less than or equal to 16 years of age. (Note: Neurologic deficits in patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors must be stable for a minimum of 1 week prior to study entry Arm C Age: 070 years of age Performance status: Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70% for patients &gt; 16 years of age or Lansky Play Score ≥ 70 for patients ≤ 16 years of age Organ Function Arm A Hematologic: hemoglobin of &gt;9 gm/dl and platelet count &gt; 20,000/μl. Patients may receive transfusions as necessary. Renal: Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m^2 or serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age Hepatic: aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase (AST or ALT) ≤ 5 x ULN and bilirubin ≤ 5 x ULN Cardiac: ejection fraction ≥ 45% or no clinical evidence of heart failure Pulmonary: oxygen saturation &gt; 92% at rest (on room air) Arm B Timing: patients must be fully recovered from radiation, induction chemotherapy or surgery prior to receiving consolidation, with minimum elapsed time of 2 weeks. Hematologic: ANC &gt; 750/µl, hemoglobin of &gt;8 gm/dl (may receive PRBC transfusions) and platelet count &gt; 75,000/µl (transfusion independent). Renal: GFR ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m^2 Hepatic: AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN and bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Cardiac: ejection fraction ≥ 45% or no clinical evidence of heart failure Pulmonary: oxygen saturation &gt; 94% at rest (on room air) Central Nervous System: patients with seizure history are allowed if on anticonvulsants and well controlled; patients must not be in status epilepticus, coma or require assisted ventilation Arm C Hematologic: ANC ≥ 750/mm^3, platelets ≥ 75,000/mm^3 Renal: GFR ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m2 or serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 x ULN for age Hepatic: AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN), if hepatic involvement &lt; 5 x ULN; bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x upper limits of normal (ULN) Arms A and C: Patients with a history of CNS tumor involvement are eligible if they have completed treatment for CNS disease (radiotherapy or surgery or chemotherapy), have recovered from or stabilization of the side effects associated with the therapy and have no evidence of progressive CNS disease at the time of enrollment Pregnant or breastfeeding Active, uncontrolled infection and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive constitute progressive disease. Concomitant enrollment on clinical study (such as COG study) that does not allow coenrollment on this standard of care protocol (Arm B only)</criteria>
