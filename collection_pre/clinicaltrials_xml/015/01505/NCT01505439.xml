Estrogen treatment started more than 2 months prior to inclusion is allowed Patients taking an unstable dosage of any drug with anticholinergic side effects, or expected to start such treatment during the study Patients with chronic constipation or history of severe constipation Treatment with any of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, vinblastine, macrolide antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin) or antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, micronazole) Sexually active females of childbearing potential not using reliable contraception for at least 1 month prior to study initiation and not agreeing to use such methods during the entire study period and for at least 1 month thereafter. Reliable contraceptive methods are defined as intrauterine devices (IUDs), combination type contraceptive pills, hormonal implants, double barrier method, injectable contraceptives, surgical procedures (tubal ligation or vasectomy), or continence Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion</criteria>
