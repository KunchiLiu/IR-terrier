	<brief_summary>Vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac surgery is a common complication after cardiac surgery, with negative impact on patient outcomes and hospital costs. Pathogenesis of vasodilatory phenomenon after cardiac surgery remains a matter of controversy. Loss of vascular tone can be partly explained by the depletion of neurohypophyseal arginine vasopressin stores. The investigators hypothesized that the use of arginine vasopressin would be more effective on treatment of shock after cardiac surgery than norepinephrine, decreasing the composite end point of mortality and severe morbidity.</brief_summary>
