	<brief_summary>In previous studies, the investigators have seen that carefully-selected Lactobacillus strains are a good alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of lactational mastitis. The objective of this new study is to check if they can also have a preventive role when administered to women with a history of mastitis with one or more previous infants. Since the investigators have also realized that peripartum antibiotherapy (mainly GBS-targeting intrapartum prophylaxis)is a predisposing factor for mastitis (because of the selection of resistant bacteria), the investigators would also like to test if administration of the strains to GBS-colonized pregnant women may lead to GBS eradication. Therefore, a mastitis-predisposing factor would de avoid.</brief_summary>
