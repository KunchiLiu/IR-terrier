	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of adding 125 mg or 250 mg doses of MK-7655 to imipenem/cilastatin in adults 18 years or older with complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). The primary hypothesis is that the MK-7655 + imipenem/cilastatin treatment regimen is non-inferior to imipenem/cilastatin with respect to the proportion of participants with a favorable microbiological response at completion of intravenous (IV) study therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinically suspected and/or bacteriologically documented cUTI or acute pyelonephritis judged by the investigator to be serious (requiring hospitalization and treatment with IV antibiotic therapy) Pyuria, determined by a midstream cleancatch (MSCC) or catheterized (indwelling or straight catheter) urine specimen with greater than or equal to 10 white blood cells (WBCs) per highpower field (hpf) on standard examination of urine sediment or greater than or equal to 10 WBCs/mm3 in unspun urine One positive urine culture within 48 hours of enrollment Complete obstruction of any portion of the urinary tract (requiring a permanent indwelling urinary catheter or instrumentation), a known ileal loop, or intractable vesicoureteral reflux A temporary indwelling urinary catheter is in place and cannot be removed at study entry. Perinephric or intrarenal abscess or known or suspected prostatitis Uncomplicated UTI Any history of recent accidental trauma to the pelvis or urinary tract Any amount of effective antibiotic therapy after obtaining the urine culture for admission to this study and prior to the administration of the first dose of IV study therapy An infection which has been treated with greater than 24 hours of systemic antibiotic therapy known to be effective against the presumed or documented etiologic pathogen(s) within the 72hour period immediately prior to consideration for entry into the study History of serious allergy, hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis), or any serious reaction to carbapenem antibiotics, any cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta (Î²)lactam agents History of serious allergy, hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis), or any serious reaction to other betalactam inhibitors (e.g., tazobactam, sulbactam, clavulanic acid) History of a seizure disorder Currently being treated with valproic acid or has received treatment with valproic acid in the 2 weeks prior to screening. Rapidly progressive or terminal illness unlikely to survive the approximately 6 to 8 week study period Pregnant or expecting to conceive, breast feeding, or plans to breast feed during the study A response to all study therapy (IV study therapy or subsequent oral ciprofloxacin) within the timeframe of treatment specified in this protocol is considered unlikely. Concurrent infection that would interfere with evaluation of response to the study antibiotics Need for concomitant systemic antimicrobial agents in addition to those designated in the various study treatment groups (use of vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid is allowed for certain infections) cUTI due to a confirmed fungal pathogen Currently receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including use of highdose corticosteroids Prior recipient of a renal transplantation Laboratory abnormalities as specified in protocol History of any other illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in administering the study drug Currently participating in, or has participated in, any other clinical study involving the administration of investigational or experimental medication (not licensed by regulatory agencies) at the time of presentation or during the previous 30 days prior to screening or is anticipated to participate in such a clinical study during the course of this trial Estimated or actual creatinine clearance of &lt;5 mL/minute, or is currently undergoing hemodialysis</criteria>
