	<brief_summary>There are many methods used for the assessment of pain in the area of anesthesia including heart rate variability which reflects the influence of the autonomic nervous system on the heart. An original index, the ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index), quantifies pain during anesthesia. Obstetric epidural analgesia is particularly suited to evaluate ANI in conscious patients with a comparison of ANI with the measurement of pain by a visual analog scale (VAS). Evaluation of ANI is performed just before epidural catheter insertion and during the 10 first minutes after saline, sufentanil or lidocaine epidural administration.</brief_summary>
