	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled on ECOG-2993 clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Samples From Patients With B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify microRNAs that behave as oncogenes or as tumor suppressor genes in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in vitro and in vivo. - To examine if single microRNA or signatures of microRNA correspond to different clinical outcomes in cytogenetically distinct B-ALL groups. OUTLINE: RNA from archived samples are analyzed for microRNA expression profile in vitro and in vivo.</detailed_description>
