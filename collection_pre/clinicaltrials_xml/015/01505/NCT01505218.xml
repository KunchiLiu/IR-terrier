	<brief_summary>Propofol sedation with opioids is used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Combination of sedatives and opioids is associated with increased morbidity/mortality. Delivery of only propofol using a patient-controlled delivery system (patient-controlled sedation, PCS) could be an alternative for this purpose. Comparative studies with PCS for ERCP are few. Therefore, the main objective of this randomized controlled trial was to compare propofol PCS to sedation managed by nurse anaesthetists during ERCP.</brief_summary>
