	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether a culturally tailored, low-cost, primary care/internet based depression prevention intervention (CURB) is superior to wait-list control for African American and Hispanic youth in terms of depression-related outcomes. It is hypothesized that compared to teens in the wait-list control condition, teens in the CURB program will exhibit lower levels of depressed mood and/or more rapid changes in mood during the follow-up time.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Additional aims and hypotheses are provided here: Aim 2: To determine whether or not participants in the CURB primary care/Internet based depression prevention intervention will have a significantly lower cumulative incidence of any depressive episode at 3 months compared to adolescents in the usual care wait-list group. Hypothesis 2: Compared to youth in the wait-list control condition, youth in the CURB program will have a lower incidence of depressive episodes at 6 month follow-up. Aim 3: To determine whether CURB is sustainable in primary care from the perspective of health care professionals and primary care physicians in urban primary care settings. Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that providers will rate the intervention (by component) feasibility, acceptability, willingness to perform intervention and sustainability &gt; 7 on a 1-10 scale (1, not feasible, 10 very feasible).</detailed_description>
