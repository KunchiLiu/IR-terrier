	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Telaprevir in Patients With Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Infection After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter study in genotype 1 chronic HCV infected liver transplant patients who will be treated for 12 weeks with telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours given in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and ribavirin followed by 36 weeks of treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and ribavirin alone. The total treatment duration will be 48 weeks. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study and will include evaluations of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination.</detailed_description>
