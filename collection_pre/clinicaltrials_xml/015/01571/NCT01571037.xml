	<brief_summary>Right ventricular (RV) failure occurs in an estimated 5-41% of cases involving left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and has been shown to adversely affect peri-operative morbidity and mortality. Current therapies to improve RV dysfunction pre and post-operatively are limited. Inhaled milrinone has been shown in several small human studies to be safely tolerated and provide favorable effects on pulmonary hemodynamics. Study Hypothesis: Delivery of inhaled milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, may provide pulmonary artery vasodilation and therefore improved RV function in patients with end stage heart failure receiving HeartMate II LVAD as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or as destination therapy. Specifically, we aim to: - demonstrate safety of inhaled milrinone in this patient cohort - demonstrate efficacy of inhaled milrinone in this patient cohort</brief_summary>
