	<brief_title>Soluble Corn Fiber and Calcium Utilization in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a previous study, soluble corn fiber (SCF) was found to greatly enhance calcium utilization and bone properties in a growing rat model. Because factors that enhance bone density and mineral content can potentially result in a skeleton that will resist fracture later in life, it is important to investigate this potential in adolescents. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of SCF on calcium absorption and retention in adolescent boys and girls. A second objective of this study was to assess whether additional dietary fiber leads to changes in gut microflora which may influence calcium absorption. During this two-phase metabolic camp participants consumed packages of fruit snacks supplemented with either 0 or 6 grams of soluble corn fiber twice a day during the first phase of the study, and switch to the opposite treatment during the second phase, with a 2-week washout period in between. Subjects collected all excreta during both phases and calcium absorption, gut microbiota, height, weight, and bone density were evaluated throughout the 6-week period of the study.</detailed_description>
