	<brief_title>Pregabalin Reduce the Sevoflurane Requirement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a painful and stressful surgical procedure. Pregabalin is a lipophilic structural analogue of the inhibitory Î³-aminobutyric acid by binding to the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels that are widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. Pregabalin has anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sleep-modulating, anti-hyperalgesic, opioid-sparing6 and anti-allodynic properties through inhibition of the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and substance P. These unique characteristics make pregabalin as a useful therapeutic for treating neuropathic pain and acute postoperative pain in several models of incisional injury and inflammatory conditions including laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</detailed_description>
