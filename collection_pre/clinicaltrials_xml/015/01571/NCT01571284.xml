	<brief_title>Safety and Quality of Life Study of Aflibercept in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Previously Treated With an Oxaliplatin-Based Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, Investigator's decision or patient's refusal for further treatment (whichever comes first). Patients will be followed-up during study treatment and for at least 30 days after last administration.</detailed_description>

Less than 4 weeks from prior radiotherapy, prior chemotherapy, prior major surgery (or until the surgical wound is fully healed). Treatment with any investigational drug within the prior 30 days. Treatment with concomitant anticonvulsivant agents that are CYP3A4 inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), unless discontinued &gt;7 days. History of brain metastases, uncontrolled spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease. Prior malignancy (other than colorectal) including prior malignancy from which the patient has been disease free for &lt; 5 years (except adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix). Any of the following within 6 months prior to study inclusion: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, severe congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack. Any of the following within 3 months prior study inclusion: severe gastrointestinal bleeding/hemorrhage, treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive oesophagitis or gastritis, infectious or inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pulmonary embolism or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event. Occurrence of deep vein thrombosis within 4 weeks, prior to study inclusion. Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. Predisposing colonic or small bowel disorders in which the symptoms were uncontrolled. Prior history of chronic enteropathy, inflammatory enteropathy, chronic diarrhea, unresolved bowel obstruction/subobstruction, more than hemicolectomy, extensive small intestine resection with chronic diarrhea. Known Gilbert's syndrome. Unresolved or unstable toxicity from any prior anti cancer therapy at the time of inclusion. History of anaphylaxis or known intolerance to atropine sulphate or loperamide or appropriate antiemetics to be administered in conjunction with FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5Fluorouracil, leucovorin). Severe acute or chronic medical condition, which could impair the ability of the patient to participate to the study. Urine proteincreatinine ratio (UPCR) &gt;1 on morning spot urinalysis or proteinuria &gt; 500 mg/24h. Uncontrolled hypertension within 3 months prior to study inclusion. Patients on anticoagulant therapy with unstable dose of warfarin and/or having an outoftherapeutic range INR within the 4 weeks prior to study inclusion. Evidence of clinically significant bleeding predisposition or underlying coagulopathy, nonhealing wound. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
