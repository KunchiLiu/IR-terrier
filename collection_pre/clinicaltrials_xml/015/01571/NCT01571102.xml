	<brief_summary>In this study we investigate whether physiotherapy offers added value in rehabilitation after meniscectomy compared with no therapy or a home program. The population consists of 180 post-operative meniscus injury patients, operated at UZ Gent, the first 60 patients received no therapy, the next 60 patients were offered a treatment by their home physiotherapist according to our established protocol and the last 60 patients we have prepared a home program . The physiotherapeutic treatment has been prepared based on scientific literature and own experience from the program at Ghent University and internships. It includes exercises to promote mobility, strength and stability and exercises to reduce pain and swelling depending on the phase of tissue repair and evolution of the patient. This schedule will be given to the patient along with the questionnaires at registration of the operation and will serve as a guideline for the physiotherapist for the rehabilitation of the patient after surgery. Monitoring of the evolution will take place by calling the physiotherapist on regular basis. The home program is prepared on the basis of commonly used home exercises after arthroscopy and also includes exercises to promote mobility, strength and stability and exercises to reduce pain and swelling. The difference with the physiotherapeutic treatment is that there is no control and supervision of a physiotherapist and that the treatment is more limited. This program is given with the patient along with the questionnaires at registration of the operation. Pre-operatively and 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively, an evaluation of the current condition of the patient will happen on the basis of standardized questionnaires. Based on the results of these questionnaires, collected at different times, we can determine which treatment provides the best rehabilitation after meniscectomy. The first (preoperative) questionnaire, given at registration of the operation, is completed and given to the nurse of the day hospital on the day of surgery, the other (postoperative) questionnaires are sent electronically to the patient's email address and need to be returned, after filling up. This study spends specific attention to the speed of resumption of work / sports and daily activities and the presence or absence of complaints.</brief_summary>
