	<brief_summary>Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS) is used for the selection of chromosomally normal embryos before the transfer in IVF treatments in many cases. There is great debate in the scientific community as to whether this is an efficient practice in patients of different prognosis. This prospective and randomized study seeks to study the results of chromosomal diagnosis using the new Comparative Genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays technique by practicing Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS) in day three biopsy on one arm of the study and not on the other arm in order to compare the results. The investigators will study the ongoing pregnancy rate of each oocyte retrieval and the ongoing implantation rate with Day 5 embryos (blastocysts) in IVF/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatments of embryos from two different groups of patients: Advanced Age Female Patients (38 - 41 years of age) and Male severe factor (≥2 million spermatozoids/ml.).</brief_summary>
