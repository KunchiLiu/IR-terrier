	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability and the short-term safety and tolerability of TMC435 following administration of 3 single oral doses of 150 mg, given as different formulations in healthy adult participants. In addition, this study is to assess for the acceptability of the taste of both liquid formulations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess Bioavailability &amp; Food Effect of Different Liquid and Capsule Formulations of TMC435.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TMC435 is being investigated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. The current study is a Phase I, open-label (both participant and investigator know the name of the medication given at certain moment), randomized (study medication is assigned by chance) study designed to assess the relative bioavailability and food effect of 2 liquid formulations of TMC435, currently being developed for potential pediatric use, compared to the Phase III 150 mg capsule. Also new capsule concept formulations will be investigated in comparison with the Phase III 150 mg capsule. The study will be performed in healthy adult participants and is divided over 3 panels. Participants will be randomized within a panel. Each participant will receive 3 different treatments according to a classical 6-sequence, 3-period Williams design. In Panel 1 and Panel 2, a single oral dose of 150 mg TMC435 oral suspension respectively with other strength will be compared with the capsule used in Phase III. In Panel 3, two different capsule concept formulations will be compared with the capsule used in Phase III. In panels containing the liquids, formulations will be compared under fasted and fed conditions to investigate the food effect. In all treatments, the participants will receive medication on Day 1 of each treatment. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between subsequent treatments. The main focus of the trial is the pharmacokinetic characteristics of all formulations (level-profile of TMC435 over time in the blood stream). This evaluation requires multiple blood samples from Day 1 till Day 4 in each treatment. Safety assessments (blood and urine tests, blood pressure, pulse, electrocardiogram, and physical examination) will follow a different schedule and will be evaluated from signing of the Informed Consent Form onwards until the last trial-related visit throughout the study.</detailed_description>
