	<brief_title>Hemostasis in Patients With Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with chronic coagulation disorder, laboratory model and clinical data have shown evidence for a rebalanced hemostasis. Previous study showed that the platelet count may not predict the risk of bleeding since the platelet count is not an indicator of platelet function. Thromboelastography may be the choice of investigation when platelet function is in question especially in patients with idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Previous study have shown that maximum clot formation is the most important thromboelastography parameter in predicting bleeding in ITP patients that makes thromboelastography superior to other hemostatic tests. The investigators are trying to evaluate the rebalanced hemostasis in patients with ITP by comparing the value of platelet count, von Willebrand factor antigen level, and thromboelastography parameters.</detailed_description>
