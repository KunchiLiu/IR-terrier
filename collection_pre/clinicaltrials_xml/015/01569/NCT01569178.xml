	<brief_summary>This is a multinational, multicentre, randomised open-label, controlled, parallel-group phase III study. Its aim is to demonstrate that a single intracoronary infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells is safe and reduces all-cause mortality in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction(&lt;/=45%) after successful reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction when compared to a control group of patients undergoing best medical care.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>men and women of any ethnic origin aged≥18years patients with acute STelevation myocardial infarction as defined by the universal definition of AMI (including new LBBB) Patients with acute STelevation myocardial infarction as defined by the universal definition of AMI. Successful acute reperfusion therapy (residual stenosis visually &lt;50% and TIMI flow ≥2) within 24 hours of symptom onset or thrombolysis within 12 hours of symptom onset followed by successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 24 hours after thrombolysis Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% with significant regional wall motion abnormality assessed by quantitative echocardiography (central, independent core lab analysis) 2 to 6 days after reperfusion therapy Open coronary artery suitable for cell infusion supplying the target area of abnormal wall motion Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior randomisation Previously received stem/progenitor cell therapy Pregnant or nursing women Mental condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study or to follow the protocol Necessity to revascularise additional vessels, outside the target coronary artery at the time of progenitor cell infusion (additional revascularisations before, e.g. at the time of acute PCI, are permitted)allowed), unless clinically indicated and according to latest guidelines. This decision should be made at the time of the index procedure and explicitly stated at that time. Cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical support Platelet count &lt;100.000/µl, or hemoglobin &lt;8.5 g/dl Impaired renal function, i.e. creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl Fever or diarrhea within 4 weeks prior screening History of bleeding disorder within 3 months prior screening Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;180 mmHg and diastolic &gt;120 mmHg) Life expectancy of less than two years from any noncardiac cause or uncontrolled neoplastic disease</criteria>
