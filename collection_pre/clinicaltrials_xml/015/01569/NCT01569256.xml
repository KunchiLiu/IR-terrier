	<brief_summary>Cabergoline prevents ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in high risk patients by disrupting follicular fluid hormone microenvironmentally altering the follicular fluid levels of insulin like growth hormone -I (IGF-I), antimullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels in women with PCOS and high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome and Cabergoline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dopamine agonists have been proposed as a prophylactic treatment for OHSS in women with high risk of OHSS, however the possible mechanism of action has not been clearly known. In experimental studies, inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor based pathway was proposed as a possible action of mechanism of dopamine agonists. However the role hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I), inhibin B and antimullerian hormone (AMH) on cabergoline action in OHSS prevention has not been known.</detailed_description>
