	<brief_title>Crossed Leg Sign and it's Correlation With Significant Pathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By determining the correlation of a Crossed Leg Sign with significant pathology, a clinician would then be able to use this correlation to risk stratify his/her patients for significant pathology. Therefore, by determining the sensitivity and specificity of this physical exam finding, the clinician would have a better idea of the patients clinical management, including diagnostic testing and ultimate treatment of the patient. Crossed Leg Sign will be defined in this study as: any patient observed in the Emergency Department with sustained crossed legs. To my knowledge, crossed legs have never been evaluated in regards to it's correlation with significant pathology. This could potentially add another physical exam finding to be used by the clinician.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Any patient observed in the Emergency Department with sustained crossed legs. Any patient not observed to have sustained crossed legs and is not being used as a control.</criteria>
