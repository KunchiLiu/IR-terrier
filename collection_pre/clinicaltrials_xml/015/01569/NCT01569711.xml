	<brief_summary>Depression is a common, recurrent and disabling disorder. Among patients with a chronic course of the disease, 20 to 30% are resistant to antidepressant medications. Among those patients, 50% would not benefit from electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). For such patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of nucleus accumbens is considered.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depression is a common (12-Month Prevalence in the general population: 6%), recurrent and disabling disorder. Among patients with a chronic course of the disease, 20 to 30% are resistant to antidepressant medications. Among those patients not responding favorably to antidepressant medications, 50% would not benefit from ECT. For such patients, surgical interventions have been proposed in the past. Many results support the hypothesis of a dysfunction of the functional loops between cortical and subcortical structures underlying the expression of depressive disorders. Thus, therapeutic intervention focusing on these loops, in patients with chronic depression resistant to treatment, should be an issue and could improve prognosis of these patients. As part of a maximal resistance to antidepressant drug, after failure of a series of bilateral ECT, a surgical functional intervention using DBS of nucleus accumbens is considered. This open-label trial proposes to assess feasibility, safety and efficacy of DBS of nucleus accumbens in patients with chronic depression.</detailed_description>
