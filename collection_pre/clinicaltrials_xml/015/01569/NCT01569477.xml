	<brief_title>Striving to Quit-Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1: To determine the extent to which contingent financial "treatment incentives" (i.e., incentives for biochemical verification visits, treatment engagement, and abstinence) versus "attendance incentives" (i.e., incentives for only attending the biochemical verification visits), increase rates of smoking cessation . Participants will be BadgerCare Plus tobacco users who enroll in Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) services. Aim 2: To determine the extent to which treatment incentives vs. attendance incentives increase rates of engagement in smoking cessation treatment through the WTQL when offered to BadgerCare Plus members who smoke. Aim 3: To determine the cost‐effectiveness of the smoking cessation program when paired with treatment incentives and when paired with attendance incentives. Aim 4: To identify moderating and mediational effects regarding the clinical benefit of incentivized smoking treatment Aim 5: To determine the reach of an incentivized smoking cessation treatment that depends upon primary care clinic staff, a fax‐to‐quit referral mechanism and a state quit line.</detailed_description>
