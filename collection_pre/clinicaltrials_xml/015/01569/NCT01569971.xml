	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating genetic disorder affecting 70,000-100,000 Americans. It is frequently associated with very serious medical complications. For children with SCD, successfully transitioning to adult care is a vital step in ensuring continuity of care, managing their disease, and improving their health outcomes. Transition programs have been created to facilitate the transition process. However, few studies have assessed transition readiness and whether transition program components meet the transition needs of patients and families. The purpose of this study is to explore transitioning from pediatric care to adult care and to assess components of the SJCRH SCD Transition Program from three perspectives: adolescents with SCD, their caregivers, and young adults with SCD who have transitioned to adult care. Data collection methods will include focus groups, questionnaires, and checklists. Qualitative data analysis procedures will be used to examine the data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adolescent, Caregiver, and Young Adult Perspectives of the Transition From Pediatric to Adult Care for Sickle Cell Disease: A Preliminary Evaluation of the Sickle Cell Disease Transition Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, through the use of focus groups and questionnaires, we will identify perceptions of transition from pediatric to adult care, transition readiness, disease knowledge, and self-management skills, and assess components of the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) Sickle Cell Disease Transition Program. Participants will participate in focus groups to discuss transition and transition-related concepts and evaluate components of the transition program. Additionally, participants will complete questionnaires about specific aspects of the transition program and about current disease knowledge and management skills.</detailed_description>
