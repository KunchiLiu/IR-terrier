	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of transvaginally-delivered low level laser therapy (LLLT) versus Sham in the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms in women. The secondary objective is to determine the effect of transvaginally-delivered LLLT vs. sham on the quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Painless Laser Therapy for Overactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial that will include enrollment of up to 200 subjects at up to 3 investigational sites. The study population will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two groups: Sham Laser Group (SLG) and Active Laser Group (ALG). The Sham Laser Group will receive a sham LLLT procedure (no laser energy) and the Active Laser Group will receive an active LLLT procedure (laser energy). Both groups will undergo 3 LLLT procedures per week for 3 weeks, for a total of 9 LLLT procedures. Whether the procedure will be a sham procedure (placebo) or an active LLLT application will be determined by randomization which will assign subjects to be treated with an LCT-1000TM labeled either Laser A or Laser B. The only difference between Laser A and Laser B is that one does not emit laser energy; therefore, both subjects and site research personnel will be blinded as to whether laser energy is actually applied to the subject.</detailed_description>
