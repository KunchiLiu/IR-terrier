	<criteria>1. Male, and female subjects of nonchild bearing potential, 2. Subjects were to weigh at least 50 kg to participate in the study, 3. and body mass index &lt; 40 kg/m2 4. Subjects were able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study; 5. Subjects were able to understand and sign the written informed consent; For renal insufficient subjects: 1. stable renal disease without evidence of renal progressive mild renal function: calculated CrCl of 50≤80 mL/min moderate renal function: calculated CrCl of 30&lt;50 mL/min 2.

A serum creatinine with a calculated CrCl of &gt;80 mL/min 2. Vital signs: oral body temperature between 35.037.2 °C systolic blood pressure, 95140 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure, 60100 mm Hg pulse rate, 4590 bpm 1. Current use of ACE inhibitors, valsartan, and drugs that were known as CYP2C9 substrates, potassiumsparing diuretics; 2. Smokers; 3. History of renal transplant at any time in the past and on immunosuppressant therapy; 4. Dialysis patients; 5. Medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history of a prolonged QTinterval syndrome; 6. Any surgical or medical condition which may significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of any drug substance; Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
