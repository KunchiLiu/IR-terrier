	<brief_summary>Increased white blood cell count at the onset of an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction has been shown to be associated of increased incidence of heart failure and mortality. Now monocytes which are a subset of white blood cells may have a prognostic value for patients presenting with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. A monocyte count of greater than 800/mm3 following acute myocardial infarction has been shown to be associated with increased incidence of left ventricular dysfunction. The investigators study would retrospectively collect data on patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, looking for an association between high monocyte count and the culprit vessel causing the myocardial infarction. The investigators would also investigate whether monocytosis would be a marker of poor prognosis.</brief_summary>
