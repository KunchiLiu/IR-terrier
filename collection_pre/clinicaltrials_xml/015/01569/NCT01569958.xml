	<brief_summary>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive weakness and muscular atrophy due to the degeneration and loss of motor neurons, the nerve cells that, in the central nervous system (motor cortex, brainstem and spinal chord), control voluntary movement. Riluzole, the only drug approved for ALS treatment, modestly slow disease progression. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive technique of neuromodulation that is currently studied as a possible therapeutic tool for several neurological and psychiatric diseases and has been found safe and well tolerated. Based on experimental evidence in animals and human subjects, tDCS is expected to reduce motor cortex excitability and excitotoxicity, that is neuronal injury induced by excessive glutamatergic stimulation, one of postulated pathophysiological mechanisms in ALS. This study will investigate if transcranial direct current stimulation of motor cortex is useful in delaying disease progression and is well tolerated in ALS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation as a Novel Therapeutic Approach in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Cathodic tDCS (1 mA for 20 minutes) will be sequentially applied over the motor cortex of both sides, for five consecutive days every month for twelve months. The control group will receive a sham stimulation that reproduce tactile sensation of real stimulation but has no effects on central nervous system. For stimulation, researchers will employ a CE-certified medical device acting as a micro-processor-controlled constant current source. All patients will take riluzole during the entire period of the study. Fifty-four participants will be recruited from three Italian Centers and randomized to one of two arms of the study. Disease progression and quality of life will be evaluated at baseline and every three months during the study. At each visit adverse events will be reported and tolerability will be assessed through a specific questionnaire.</detailed_description>
