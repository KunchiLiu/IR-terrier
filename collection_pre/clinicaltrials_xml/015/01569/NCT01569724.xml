	<brief_summary>Bexarotene is a RXR-selective retinoid, licensed for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The most frequent adverse effect is hypertriglyceridemia but its mechanism is not well known. The purpose of this study is to research a carbohydrate metabolism disorder associated in bexarotene-induced hypertriglyceridemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorder Frequency in Hypertriglyceridemia Induced by Bexarotene of Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary cutaneous lymphomas are the second group of extra nodal lymphomas after gastrointestinal lymphomas. Bexarotene is licensed for the treatment of epidermotropic cutaneous T cell lymphoma .The most common side effect of bexarotene is hypertriglyceridemia (82%) associated with hypercholesterolemia (30 to 40%). Central hypothyroidism is also present in 40-80% of cases. These adverse effects are dose-dependent. The management of hyperlipidemia induced by bexarotene is difficult. The mechanism of lipid disorder induced by bexarotene is not well known. Associated carbohydrate metabolism disorder could be present and play a role in the bexarotene-induced hyperlipidemia. The main objective is to estimate the frequency of a carbohydrate disorder in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (TG&gt; 1.5 g / L) induced by bexarotene treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, previously free of diabetes, thyroid dysfunction and dyslipidemia.</detailed_description>
