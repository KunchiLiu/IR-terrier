	<brief_title>Low Intensity Physical Activity Leads to Improvement in Brachial-ankle Pulse Wave Velocity of Hemiplegics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a noninvasive method for assessing arterial stiffening in atherosclerosis. In hemiplegics, disuse of the affected limb is associated with the muscle wasting leading to development of local atherosclerosis. The brachial-ankle aortic PWV (baPWV) is an indicator of early stage disuse syndrome, and is measured with a device that is particularly useful in elderly hemiplegics. The LIPA regime was designed to result in an increase of 3.3% (about 40 kcal/day) of daily energy consumption compared to their individual baseline values. This included aerobic exercises and half squats (70Â° knee flexion) for altogether about 20 minutes, once daily. In addition, the subjects performed passive ankle dorsiflexion-plantar flexion, 30 times/minute for 10 min, once daily. The LIPA was aimed at affecting the passive range of motion in ankle, knee, and hip, and weight bearing on the affected leg in standing position.</detailed_description>
