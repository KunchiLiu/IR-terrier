	<detailed_description>Prior research in substance dependence has suggested potential anti-craving effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) when applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of high frequency rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to sham stimulation on craving and alcohol consumption. 150 detoxified patients are randomized either to a high frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC (n = 75) or a sham stimulations (n = 75). Alcohol craving is determined with the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale. Patients are allocated to active and sham rTMS in a 1: 1 ratio, such that 75 patients received active and 75 patients sham rTMS to the left DLPFC (10 Hz frequency, total 10 sessions). The Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ-NOW) and the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) are administered to measure the severity of alcohol craving at baseline, after the last rTMS session and day 15, M1, M3, M6 after. Alcohol drinking is evaluated with Timeline Followback (TLFB).</detailed_description>
