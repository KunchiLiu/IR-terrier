	<criteria>Subjects must have received Lambda in a previous trial and have Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; LOQ at the completion of the required posttreatment followup (must enter this study within 6 months of completion of the required posttreatment followup in the previous trial) NOTE: For blinded parent trials, subjects who have HCV RNA &lt;LOQ at the completion of the required posttreatment followup may enter this study without knowledge of their treatment assignment in the parent study. Subjects who received control agents (eg, pegylatedinterferon alfa) in the previous protocol will be allowed to participate until unblinded treatment information is released; at that time subjects will have the option to continue in the study Subjects must not have been treated with any antiviral or immunomodulatory drug for chronic hepatitis C after completion of the previous study of Lambda</criteria>
