	<brief_title>Capecitabine, Temozolomide and Bevacizumab for Metastatic or Unresectable Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate if the combination of capecitabine and temozolomide with bevacizumab for metastatic or unresectable neuroendocrine tumors will improve response rate (RR) by 62% over historical controls (null RR of 40% to true RR 65%). II. Assess the toxicities using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier analysis. II. To assess O6-methyl guanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) by central pathology (path) review. III. To assess serum hormone marker levels. IV. To evaluate computed tomography (CT) Perfusion as a tool to predict early therapeutic response. (Optional) V. To bank serum for future correlative analyses. OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 10-14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up patients are followed up for 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have histologically confirmed pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that are considered well or moderately differentiated 2. Patients must have metastatic or unresectable disease 3. Patients with prior surgical resection who develop radiological or clinical evidence of metastatic cancer do not require separate histological or cytological confirmation of metastatic disease unless an interval of &gt; 5 years has elapsed between the primary surgery and the development of metastatic disease. Clinicians should consider biopsy of lesions to establish diagnosis of metastatic disease if there is substantial clinical ambiguity regarding the nature or source of apparent metastases. 4. Prior sunitinib and everolimus will be permitted. A washout period of 2 weeks is required prior to first dose on this study. 5. Prior liver directed therapies will be permitted (ie. chemoembolization, radioembolization) as long as target lesions in the liver have demonstrated growth since the liver directed treatment. 6. Prior peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) will be permitted as long as target lesions in the liver have demonstrated growth since the liver directed treatment. 7. Lowdose aspirin (&lt;= 325 mg/d) may be continued in subjects at higher risk for arterial thromboembolic disease. 8. Patients must have a primary or metastatic lesion measurable in at least one dimension by Modified RECIST criteria v1.1 (see Section 4.2) within 4 weeks prior to entry of study. 9. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 02 10. Patients must be &gt;= 18 years of age. 11. Laboratory values &lt;= 2 weeks prior to randomization: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L (&gt;= 1500/mm3) Platelets (PLT) &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L (=&gt; 100,000/mm^3) Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 9 g/dL Serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x ULN Serum bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) &lt;= 3.0 x ULN (&lt;= 5.0 x ULN if liver metastases present). Note: ERCP or percutaneous stenting may be used to normalize the liver function tests. 12. Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks. 13. Ability to give written informed consent according to local guidelines. DiseaseSpecific Exclusions 1. Prior bevacizumab, fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine or 5FU) or temozolomide. 2. Poorly differentiated or high grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors 3. Prior full field radiotherapy &lt;= 4 weeks or limited field radiotherapy &lt;= 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients must have recovered from all therapyrelated toxicities. The site of previous radiotherapy should have evidence of progressive disease if this is the only site of disease. 4. Diagnosis of another malignancy, unless the patient was diagnosed at least 3 years earlier and has been diseasefree for at least 6 months following the completion of curative intent therapy, specifics as follows: Curatively resected nonmelanomatous skin cancer Curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ Patients with organconfined prostate cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease based on prostatespecific antigen (PSA) values are also eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been initiated or a radical prostatectomy has been performed. Other primary solid tumor curatively treated with no known active disease present and no treatment administered for the last 3 years. 5. Concurrent use of other investigational agents and patients who have received investigational drugs &lt;= 4 weeks prior to enrollment. 6.
