	<brief_summary>This proposed study seeks to examine whether adding an aerobic exercise prescription to a behavioral treatment program for chronic headaches will improve headache frequency and intensity, headache-related disability, and mood. It is hypothesized that participants who receive the exercise prescription at the start of treatment will show greater gains than those who receive the prescription halfway through treatment. It is also predicted that participants who begin the exercise component halfway through treatment will demonstrate greater improvement in the second half of treatment compared to the first half.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Aerobic Exercise Within a Behavioral Treatment Program for Chronic Headaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aerobic exercise has long been discussed as a potential treatment for chronic headaches, though research in this area has been somewhat limited. It is warranted to consider the effectiveness of aerobic exercise as part of a larger headache management intervention. Early research in this area suggests that including an exercise component in conjunction with other effective forms of headache management, such as progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback, and stress management, is associated with improvement in number of days with a headache, headache pain intensity and mood. None of these studies have specifically analyzed the effectiveness of the aerobic exercise component, though Lemestra et al. (2002) noted that participants who continued with their exercise regimen had better overall outcomes three months after the intervention ended. Given the high rates of obesity and the fact that many people do not meet the minimum daily requirement for exercise, it is worthwhile to investigate the additive effect of exercise to behavioral headache interventions.</detailed_description>
