	<brief_summary>Study on glioma patients treated with brain surgery is focusing on the analysis of their transcriptome expression profile measured in two immune cell populations, CD4+ T cells and CD56+ NK cells. The results of analysis will be compared to the reference data of healthy population. Furthermore, the metabolomic and immunological status will also be monitored and compared to healthy group reference data, before and after the surgery*. With comparative crossomics analysis the investigators intend to possibly identify new diagnostic and prognostic biological markers for the relapse of the disease. The results are expected to convey a deeper insight into pathophysiology of the glioma as well as into the mechanisms of the current surgical therapy. * The healthy reference data have been published in collaborative efforts of BTC, UMC and NIB (Gruden et al. 2012).</brief_summary>
