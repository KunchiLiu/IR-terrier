	<brief_summary>In this study, 400 Hispanic women will be recruited and randomized to one of three interventions: 1. Control (no change); 2. A low-intensity information program, consisting of a video approach educating women on the importance of cervical cancer screening; 3. A higher intensity program consisting of the video plus a 'promotora' or lay-community health educator led intervention at the participant's home to encourage cervical cancer screening. The investigators will compare which intervention is most effective in encouraging Hispanic women to undergo cervical cancer screening (Pap test)</brief_summary>
