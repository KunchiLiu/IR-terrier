	<brief_summary>Background: A topic of interest in the etiology of child obesity is if and how parental feeding behaviors are associated with child food intake and weight status. Objectives: The objective was to explore if and how directive (overt) and non-directive (covert and food environmental structure) types of parental feeding control were associated with children's food intake and weight status. Design: This was a cross-sectional, exploratory study using structural equation modeling to determine directional associations between maternal feeding practices and their child's food intakes and weight status. Researchers collected data from 330 dyads of 3-5yr children and mothers participating in a federal preschool program for low-income families (Head Start) in Michigan. Mothers' feeding practices (directive and non-directive control), children's food intakes, height and weight of both mothers and children were measured. Structural equation models tested the relationships between maternal feeding practices, the child's food intake and weight status. Hypotheses: 1. Child weight is negatively associated with parents' directive feeding control practices. 2. Less directive control or greater non-directive control is associated with healthier food intakes in children.</brief_summary>
