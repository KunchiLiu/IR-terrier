	<brief_title>Autoantibodies Against Human Recombinant Erythropoietin in Myelodysplatic Syndrome Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MDS are a heterogeneous group of hematologic disorders broadly characterized by cytopenias associated with a dimorphic and usually cellular bone marrow, and by consequent ineffective blood cell production. 85% of patients have a severe anemia which is Associated with lowering quality of life and Often requires blood transfusions. Historically, only stem cell transplantation offers cure. however, multiple new drugs have been approved for treatment, such as to Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment for dealing with the anemia. rHuEPO treatment can improve hematocrit level in 25% of patient which leaves the rest with the need of other treatment solution. Studies have shown presents of anti- rHuEPO in blood serums which followed Treatment of other diseases. These findings can indicate the possibility of the presence of antibodies in MDS patients as well.</detailed_description>
