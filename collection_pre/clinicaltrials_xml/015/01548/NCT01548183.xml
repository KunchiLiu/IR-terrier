	<brief_summary>The US preventative services task force (USPSTF) recommends behavioral counseling in the primary care setting for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, however, screening and counseling rarely occur. Text messaging (TM) is increasingly being used as a tool to affect behavior change in patients, but its effect on patients that report at-risk sexual behavior in the emergency department (ED) is unknown. The investigators seek to assess the feasibility of ED-based screening of young adult females for at-risk sexual behavior and enrolling them in a 3 month trial using TM to deliver information and skill building to improve health behavior.</brief_summary>
