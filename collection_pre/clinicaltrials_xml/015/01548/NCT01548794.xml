	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is the investigation of whether adding lidocaine to hyperbaric bupivacaine could decrease the duration of bupivacaine spinal block and provide shorter recovery and discharge times than local infiltration anesthesia in outpatient herniorrhaphy procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recovery of Bupivacaine or Bupivacaine-Lidocaine Spinal Anesthesia and Infiltration Anesthesia in Herniorrhaphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive 93 patients undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy will be recruited with a prospective protocol.Spinal anesthesia will be commenced in Group BLS with 2 ml hyperbaric bupivacaine (10 mg) + 0.6 ml 1 % lidocaine (6 mg), in Group BS, hyperbaric bupivacaine (10 mg) + saline in the same volume and Group LIA will have anesthesia with bupivacaine and lidocaine for step by step local anesthetic infiltration. Sensorial block will be measured with pinprick test, motor block will be tested with Bromage scale. Heart rate, blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation will be measured every 5 minutes. Time of subarachnoid injection, onset of sensorial block (block at L1 dermatome), time to block T10 dermatome, maximum block level, time to maximum block and time to two segment regression, T10 regression , LI regression and S1 regression of the block will be recorded in group BLS and BS.The onset and resolution of the sensorial and motor block will be assessed by anesthetists blinded to group allocation. PACU stay and discharge times and VAS pain scores will be recorded in all patients. Patients also will be investigated for adverse events (hypotension, bradycardia, nausea,PDPH, TNS, urinary retention)and satisfaction regarding the anesthetic method.</detailed_description>
