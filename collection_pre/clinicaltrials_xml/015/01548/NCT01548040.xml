	<brief_summary>The study is a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial.Approximately 118 patients (males and females) who are at least 40 years of age, who are scheduled for total-knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery will be randomized into 1) a treatment group who receive Kneehab XP and a standard rehabilitation program and 2) a control group who receive only a sham device and a standard rehabilitation program. Patients are tracked for measures of function, pain, quality of life, physical performance and acceptable states status at 6 weeks and 1 week before surgery and 3, 6, 12, and 52 weeks following surgery. Hypothesis 1: The effect of 12-weeks of Kneehab XP (peri-operative NMES) combined with standard rehabilitation in patients undergoing TKA surgery will lead to increased quadriceps strength compared to a control group at the 6 week post-operative time point. Hypothesis 2: The effect of 12-weeks of Kneehab XP (peri-operative NMES) combined with standard rehabilitation in patients undergoing TKA surgery is better than the control group as measured by PASS at post-operative week 6. The investigators hypothesize that a significantly larger proportion of patients will indicate a positive PASS in the Kneehab XP group compared to the control group. Hypothesis 2:The investigators hypothesize that the mean change scores for pain, physical and functional performance measures will be significantly better for the Kneehab XP group at post operative week 6. Additionally, the investigators report the baseline corrected scores for these outcomes, as well as the primary and secondary outcomes, at all the other follow up time points.</brief_summary>
