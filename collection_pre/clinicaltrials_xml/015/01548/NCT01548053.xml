	<brief_summary>Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related forms of dementia currently affect over 400,000 individuals in Canada and the numbers of community dwelling older adults with AD is rapidly growing. AD is associated with over $15 billion annually in care costs. Most individuals with AD are under the care of primary care providers (PCPs) including family physicians and primary care nurses. The evaluation and management of AD is challenging for PCPs and the quality of care provided to older adults with AD by PCP could be improved which would optimize outcomes for this vulnerable population. Provision of quality care to older adults with AD involves implementation of best practices as outlined in guidelines such as the Canadian Consensus Conference Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia. Utilizing a group of dementia researchers, PCPs, other knowledge users, and individuals affected by AD, this project will develop practical, clinically relevant resources for primary care physicians and nurses to aid in the evaluation of older adults with AD. A knowledge tool, the Primary Care - Dementia Assessment and Treatment Algorithm (DATA Tool) will be introduced into several primary care settings in Ontario using educational sessions with PCP with additional support from internet resource and a dementia care manager. The quality of dementia care provided to older adults newly diagnosed with AD will be assessed in the three years preceding the intervention compared to the year following the implementation. This project will also describe the process of knowledge exchange with PCPs, including potential barriers and facilitators of knowledge uptake and examine if the care provided during the intervention was patient-centred through interviews with patients and caregivers. Research Objectives: 1. Develop knowledge tools to facilitate assessment and treatment of AD by PCPs based on best evidence; 2. Transfer these knowledge tools into a variety of primary care settings in Ontario; and, 3. Evaluate the effects of this intervention on dementia quality of care, PCP application of knowledge, and the patient-centeredness of care.</brief_summary>
