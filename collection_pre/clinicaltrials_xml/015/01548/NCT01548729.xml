	<brief_summary>Patients with end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) and severe CF-related diabetes (CFRD) may benefit from combined lung-pancreatic islet transplantation. A recent case series showed that combined bilateral lung and pancreatic islet transplantation is a viable therapeutic option for patients with end-stage CF and CFRD. The use of different organs from a single donor may lead to reduced immunogenicity. As the prevalence of CFRD has increased dramatically with the improved life expectancy of patients with CF, islet transplantation should be considered at the end-stage CF. By restoring metabolic control, the investigators hypothesize that islet transplantation may improve the management of CF patients undergoing lung transplant and decrease the complication rate in the early postoperative period.</brief_summary>
