	<brief_title>A Multiple Ascending Dose Study of BCI-838 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability following oral administration of multiple doses of BCI-838 in healthy male and female subjects. The pharmacokinetic profile of multiple oral doses of BCI-838 in healthy male and female subjects will also be assessed. In addition, the pharmacodynamic effects of BCI-838 on the central nervous system using quantitative electroencephalogram analysis will be studied.</detailed_description>
