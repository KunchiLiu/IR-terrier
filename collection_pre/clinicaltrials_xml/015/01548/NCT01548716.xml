	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in non-itching hemodialysis (HD) patients will be higher than those in HD patients with itching 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels will be measured in non-itching hemodialysis patients and compared to levels previously measured in a previous study of 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels of patients complaining of itching.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of 25-hydroxy Vitamin d Levels in Non-itching Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>25-hydroxy vitamin D levels from non-itching HD patients in this study will be compared to 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels from our ongoing study in HD patients with itching. The primary endpoints for both studies are continuous variables. Student's t test will be used to test for statistical significance. Multiple regression analysis will be used for controlling covariates and testing the interaction among covariates.</detailed_description>
