	<brief_title>CGM Evaluation of Glucose Excursions in Basal Insulin Treated T2DM at Fasting Glucose Target</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many clinical trials, basal insulin is titrated to only a fasting glucose goal. The usual final dose is &gt;0.4U/kg. In carefully CGM monitored/titrated studies in both basal insulin alone or in pump-treated T2DM, we have found the basal insulin dose to be &lt;0.3U/kg. This suggests that if guided by a single daily fasting glucose, titration may result in an excessive basal dose. This study will examine that issue.</detailed_description>
