	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of trebananib and temsirolimus when given together in treating patients with solid tumors that are metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Trebananib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving trebananib with temsirolimus may be an effective treatment for solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trebananib And Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile of AMG 386 (trebananib) in combination with temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of both drugs when administered in combination, with the goal of identifying potential predictive and PD markers that need further exploration and validation in future trials. II. To explore preliminary anti-tumor activity of both drugs when administered at the RP2D to patients with advanced endometrial cancer, renal cell carcinoma, or carcinoid tumor. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trebananib. Patients receive trebananib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DOSE ESCALATION COHORTS: Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective DOSE EXPANSION COHORTS: Patients must have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed uterine cancer, renal cell cancer or carcinoid tumor that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam DOSE ESCALATION COHORTS: No limitation on prior therapy; however, there must be at least a 4 week interval between initiation of study treatment and any prior radiotherapy or systemic therapy, 6 weeks if the last regimen included carmustine (BCNU) or mitomycin C; exceptions may be made however, for low dose, nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy for symptomatic palliation; please contact the study coordinator at the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) Phase I Consortium Central Office or the principal investigator if any questions arise about interpretation of this criterion EXPANSION COHORTS: Uterine cancer: Patients diagnosed with uterine cancer will be eligible provided they have received at least one prior line of chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease unless the investigator feels that cytotoxic chemotherapy is contraindicated; prior hormonal treatment will be allowed; prior antiangiogenic agents and prior treatment with agents targeting phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K) protein kinase B (AkT) mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway are not allowed Renal cell cancer: Patients diagnosed with renal cell cancer (RCC) will be required to have received at least one prior line anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/ receptor (R) treatment (i.e. bevacizumab, sunitinib, and/or sorafenib); prior treatment with agents targeting PI3KAktmTOR pathway is not allowed Carcinoid tumor: Patients diagnosed with carcinoid tumor must have demonstrated radiographic evidence of disease progression within six months prior to enrollment; prior and/or concurrent longacting somatostatin analogue therapy is allowed; if patient is continued on a longacting somatostatin analogue, a stable dose for &gt;= 2 months prior to study entry is required with documentation of progressive disease on current dose; prior radiolabeled octreotide therapy is allowed; prior regional treatments for liver metastasis are permitted including: Selective internal radiation therapy (i.e. brachytherapy, radiolabeled microsphere embolization, etc) Hepatic artery chemoembolization Hepatic artery embolization Hepatic artery infusional chemotherapy Radiofrequency ablation Patients must be &gt; 12 weeks from regional treatments and show progressive disease in the liver after regional therapy or must have measurable disease outside the liver; patients may have received one prior line of antiVEGF/R treatment (e.g. bevacizumab, sunitinib, and/or sorafenib);
