	<brief_summary>Service members and veterans often experience symptoms of psychological trauma following combat deployments. While efforts are being made in the military and at the Veteran's Affairs to meet the large number of soldiers and veterans experiencing symptoms of psychological trauma, there remains a need to evaluate new treatments, particularly those that are designed to be brief in length. A new therapy, known as Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART), is a type of psychological therapy that is designed for rapid resolution of symptoms of psychological trauma. This approach uses a combination of talking and sets of eye movements guided by the therapist. During therapy, this interactive personal guidance is thought to be helpful in resolving problems (such as bad memories). The purpose of this study is to: 1. Evaluate how effective ART is in treating symptoms of psychological trauma among non-active duty veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Iraq and in Afghanistan or other combat conflicts. 2. Learn if there is improvement in symptoms of psychological trauma (such as bad memories, anxiety, depression, and guilt) after receiving Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART).</brief_summary>
