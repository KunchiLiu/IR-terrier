	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to describe and compare plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibody concentrations among three distinct groups: (1) patients suffering from bullous pemphigoide; (2) patients suffering from other dermatological auto-immune diseases; (3) an elderly control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of Proteasomes in a Dermatological Autoimmune Disease: Bullous Pemphigoid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: To compare the following parameters between the 3 groups: - plasmatic proteasome concentrations - plasmatic proteasome proteolytic activity To explore the potential relationships between: - plasmatic proteasome concentrations - plasmatic proteasome proteolytic activity - plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibody concentrations - measures of disease severity for dermatological auto-immune diseases To characterize plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibodies in patients suffering from bullous pemphigoide and other dermatological auto-immune diseases (other bullous auto immune diseases: pemphigus, cutaneous lupus, ...). To characterize the expression and the activity of proteasomes in skin samples, in plasma and in circulating mononuclear cells in patients with bullous pemphigoide.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must have given his/her informed and signed consent The patient must be insured or beneficiary of a health insurance plan The patient is not taking systemic treatment The patient has not been treated with topical steroids for more than 15 days. For the bullous pemphigoid group: clinical signs: erythematousbased lesions, especially on flexion areas of the arms and legs, not afflicting mucous membranes, and without atrophic scaring histology: without epidermal acantholysis For the pemphigus group: patient with pemphigus For the lupus group: systemic lupus patients: presence of the 4 diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (amended 1997) or characteristics of subacute cutaneous lupus: clinical, histological and immunological (antiSSa) or clinical and histological characteristics of chronic lupus For the control group: hospitalized patients with no history of autoimmune, inflammatory or evolving neoplastic disease The patient is participating in another study The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study The patient is under judicial protection, under tutorship or curatorship The patient refuses to sign the consent It is impossible to correctly inform the patient The patient is pregnant, parturient, or breastfeeding For patients with bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus or lupus: The patient is taking systemic treatment The patient has been taking topical steroids for more than 15 days. For the controls: autoimmune disease inflammatory disease evolving neoplastic disease surgery during the last 6 months</criteria>
