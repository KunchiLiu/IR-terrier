	<brief_summary>A proper digital nerve (PDN) defect causes partial or complete sensory loss of the finger pulp, which results in functional disability.The dorsal branch of the PDN can be transferred for reconstruction of such nerve defects.In this study, the investigators modified the Lesavoy et al' technique and evaluated the efficacy of dorsal sensory branch transfer for PDN defects. For comparison, the investigators collected a consecutive series of 32 patients with finger PDN defects treated using a traditional sural nerve graft from February 2005 to October 2008.</brief_summary>
