	<brief_summary>Study population: 1) mutation carriers without the hypertrophic phenotype (pre-clinical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)) and in 2) patients with clinically overt HCM (clinical HCM). Hypothesis: Cardiac troponin release after exercise can be demonstrated in both clinical and pre-clinical HCM patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with an echocardiographically proven hypertrophic cardiomyopathy according to the ESC guidelines or individuals with a HCM associated mutation without the clinical characteristics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (preclinical HCM patients); Age â‰¥ 18 years; Able to comply with the protocol; Written informed consent. Known significant epicardial coronary artery disease; Patients with LVH in the clinical setting of other disorders that explain the myocardial hypertrophy (amyloidosis, MELAS, AndersonFabry, WPW etc.); Heart failure NYHA class IIIIV; Patients with known hemodynamic instability or syncope during exercise due to left ventricular outflow gradient or occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia; History of PTSMA (percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation) or Morrow myectomy; Patients not able to complete a bicycle test; Any contraindication to MR imaging (MR imaging is not obligatory for assessment of the primary objective, therefore relative exclusion criterion); Recent (within 30 days) admittance to the hospital for any cardiac reason (myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, etc.); Severe renal insufficiency (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min); Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose a significant hazard to the subject if he or she participates in the present study.</criteria>
