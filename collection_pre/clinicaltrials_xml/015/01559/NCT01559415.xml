	<brief_summary>Almost half of the Dutch population is currently characterized by overweight and obesity. Losing weight is not the problem in obesity treatment, it is the seemingly obligatory weight regain after weight loss: the yoyo-effect. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the association between the weight-loss-induced cellular stress response and the rate of weight regain. The secondary objective is to investigate the differences in cellular stress response and weight regain after rapid and slow weight loss. To investigate this, subjects will receive meal replacements replacing either all or part of the daily meals during the intervention period. THe first group will consume 500 kcal/d diet for 5 weeks while the second group consumes a 1250 kcal/d diet for 3 months, both followed by 1 week normalization and a 2 week strict weight maintenance diet. During the 9-month follow-up period subjects will receive dietary advice according to the Dutch recommendations for healthy eating. The association between the amount of weight regain after the weight loss period and changes in adipokines, parameters of adipocyte metabolism, in vivo adipose tissue metabolism, adipocyte extracellular matrix gene expression profiles, adipocyte stress protein expression and gene polymorphisms in selected genes.</brief_summary>
