	<brief_title>Peri-operative Prediction of Prolonged Stay in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for Adult Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is commonly associated with a systemic inflammatory response that exacerbates peri-operative life-threatening complications and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. These features can prolong the stay in the CICU. Many peri-operative clinical risk factors contribute to those adverse outcomes resulting in prolonged CICU stay. If the investigators can create a model to identify the effects of these intra-operative clinical risk factors to prolonged CICU stay</detailed_description>
