	<brief_title>Incontinence &amp; Intimate Partners: Assessing the Contribution of Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The importance of this study is to characterize, using validated, quantifiable methods the quality of the relationship in couples affected by UUI and to identify the role that treatment plays in improving this relationship. Our central hypothesis is that UUI has a negative impact upon the emotional and physical well-being of a relationship and that effective treatment will result in improvement in areas of the relationship that have been detrimentally affected by UUI. Understanding of UUI in the context of a couple, particularly from the perspective of the male partner, will improve our ability to holistically treat UUI, thus improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.</detailed_description>
