	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether the Air Barrier System (ABS) reduces airborne colony-forming units (e.g. bacteria) present at surgery sites during posterior spinal procedures</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Air Barrier System Device to Reduce Contamination in Posterior Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ABS is a device that uses localized clean air flow to shield a surgery site from ambient airborne contamination. This study examines the hypothesis that the ABS can reduce the presence of airborne colony-forming units at the surgery site during posterior spinal procedures.</detailed_description>
