	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the UpholdTM LITE mesh over a 12 month follow up period, using a composite outcome including a good anatomical correction for both anterior and apical compartments (stage 0 or 1), no prolapse (bulge) symptoms (answer "no" at question 3 of the PFDI-20) and no reintervention for recurrent prolapse of the anterior or apical compartment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the following: - Change from baseline of POP-Q scoring at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post procedure, including evolution of treated or non-treated posterior compartments. - The proportion of patients with anatomical prolapse (C/D), but who are asymptomatic. - Change from baseline of mean quality-of-life scores. - Evaluation of mesh properties from procedure date through study period. - Peri-operative and post-treatment pain score assessment comparing the various anesthesia regimes used (Visual Analog Scale). - Assessment of patient subjective outcomes for overall treatment effects and satisfaction. - Objective evaluation of mesh shrinkage by standardized ultrasound measurements.</detailed_description>
