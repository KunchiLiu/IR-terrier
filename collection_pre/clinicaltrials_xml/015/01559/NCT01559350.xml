	<brief_summary>The ideal grafts for the right coronary artery system in coronary artery bypass surgery remain controversial. The objective of this study is to compare the long-term patency of a right gastroepiploic artery and a saphenous vein graft used for revascularization of the right coronary artery system in off pump coronary artery bypass surgery and to analyze the long-term clinical outcomes. Total 224 patients will be enrolled according to the randomization protocol. Check list 1. Laboratories 2. Quantitative coronary analysis (preoperative) 3. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event 4. coronary CT (coronary angiography if needed) at discharge, 1, 5, 10 years postoperatively 5. Echocardiogram 5. Cardiac enzyme</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Graft Patency Analysis of the Right Coronary Artery System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ideal bypass conduit for the right coronary artery remains a subject of intense controversy. A variety of grafts and configurations are used: the right gastroepiploic artery,the right internal thoracic artery in situ or in a Y-graft configuration,the free radial artery implanted into the aorta or the left internal thoracic artery, and the saphenous vein graft. The influence of the type of graft to the right coronary artery system on clinical results remains poorly documented, and the complementary conduit of choice to this system has yet to be determined. No superior long-term patency rate for any of these grafts to the RCA has been clearly established. We have used a saphenous vein and a right gastroepiploic artery for the right coronary artery system.</detailed_description>
