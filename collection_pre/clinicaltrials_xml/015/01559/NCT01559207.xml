	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate, for 15 healthy volunteers and for 15 patients with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), the monthly variation (over 6 months) of plasma nucleosome and free DNA concentrations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: A. To describe, for 15 healthy volunteers with no history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), plasma nucleosome and DNA concentrations. B. To describe, for 100 patients with a history of VTE currently consulting for chronic disease or thrombophilia work-up, plasma nucleosome and DNA concentrations. C. To compare plasma nucleosome and DNA concentrations between healthy volunteers and VTE patients D. To describe, for 100 patients with a history of VTE currently consulting for chronic disease or thrombophilia work-up, the relationships between classification of VTE and plasma nucleosome concentrations: - anatomical classification of VTE: (i)superficial, deep ((ii)distal or (iii)proximal), or (iv)pulmonary embolism - circumstantial classification of VTE: (i) triggered, no chronic risk factor; (ii) untriggered, with chronic risk factor; (iii)triggered, with chronic risk factor; (iv) untriggered, no chronic risk factor (idiopathic) E. To describe, for 100 patients with a history of VTE, the variation in plasma nucleosome concentrations 6 months after the first evaluation - according to the above anatomical classification - according to the above circumstantial classification - according to intercurrent events and treatments F. To compare the plasma concentrations of nucleosomes and free DNA G. To evaluate the relationship between plasma nucleosome and free DNA concentrations and: - circulating leukocyte populations: total leukocyte count, absolute number of neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes - markers of coagulation activation: d-dimers, circulating fibrin monomers - platelet count - patients on antivitamin K: INR, patients receiving heparin: antiXa activity H.
