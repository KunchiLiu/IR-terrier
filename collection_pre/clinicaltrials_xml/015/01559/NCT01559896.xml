	<brief_summary>The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is rapidly growing. Patients with T2DM are at increased risk of developing long term micro- and macrovascular complications. Subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) show increased blood glucose levels after an oral glucose load. These subjects have a markedly increased risk of later T2DM development. T2DM development can be prevented or delayed by lifestyle modifications. To support lifestyle changes and reduce the risk of T2DM development, foods containing functional ingredients are being developed. An interesting functional ingredient is protein hydrolysate. An egg protein hydrolysate has been experimentally shown to improve endothelial function, to inhibit plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and to reduce blood pressure in rats. Egg protein hydrolysate could thus be a interesting ingredient to treat the cardiovascular dysfunction associated with T2DM. In the present study, the effects of egg protein hydrolysate will be evaluated in subjects with overweight or moderate obesity and IGT or T2DM.</brief_summary>
