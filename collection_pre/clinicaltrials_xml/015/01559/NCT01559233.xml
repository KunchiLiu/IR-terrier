	<brief_summary>Patient demand for non-surgical, non-invasive, and no-downtime wrinkle and rhytides treatment procedures has grown dramatically over the past decade as new treatments and technologies have been introduced. This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Invasix FPlus System, an innovative noninvasive system intended for wrinkles and rhytides treatment. Subjects were treated for face wrinkles and rhytides reduction and followed for 3 months after last treatment. In order to evaluate treatment efficacy, pre and post treatment photos were introduced to three uninvolved physicians for blinded evaluation.</brief_summary>
