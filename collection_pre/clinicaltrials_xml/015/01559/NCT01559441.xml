	<brief_summary>Increased postprandial lipemia may increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases. An important mechanistic link between lipemia following a high-fat meal and adverse cardiovascular events is lipid-mediated endothelial activation. Therefore, it is important to identify nutrients that can neutralize this acute vascular disturbance. The investigators hypothesize that beetroot juice, a food rich in inorganic nitrate, could improve vascular activity during the postprandial phase.</brief_summary>
