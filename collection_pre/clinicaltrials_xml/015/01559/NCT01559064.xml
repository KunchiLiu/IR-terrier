	<mesh_term>Hyaluronic Acid</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Desire and willingness for correction of asymmetry or enhancement of his/her midface area. Be willing to undergo treatment for volume loss in the face area Females and males ≥30 years of age Be in good health as of the opinion of the Investigator Sign the Informed Consent Form prior to any studyrelated procedures being performed Have established a realistic treatment goal that the Investigator agrees is achievable i.e., have realistic expectations of aesthetic results Have extensive tissue damage that could affect the aesthetic outcome Have a known allergy to any component of VOLUMA® with lidocaine injections Have an abscess or infection at the time of treatment that in the opinion of the Investigator does not make the subject eligible for the procedure. Have undergone cosmetic facial [e.g., facelift, or other surgeries, which may alter the appearance of the midface region (laser, photomodulation intense pulsed light, radio frequency, dermabrasion, moderate or greater depth chemical peel, or other ablative procedures), tissue augmentation with dermal fillers or fat injections, or mesotherapy] anywhere in the midface region, or Botox® Cosmetic injections in the lower face (below the orbital rim), within the 6 months prior to entry in the study or be planning to undergo any of these procedures at any time during the study. NOTE: Prior treatment with hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers and/or collagen is allowed, provided the treatment was administered more than 6 months prior to study entry Have ever received semipermanent fillers or permanent facial implants, e.g., calcium hydroxyapatite, Lpolylactic acid, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), silicone, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) anywhere in the lips, or be planning to be implanted with any of these products at any time during the study Have a history of anaphylaxis, multiple severe allergies, atopy, allergy to lidocaine (or any amidebased anesthetics), HA products, or Streptococcal protein, or be planning to undergo a desensitization therapy during the term of the study Suffer from an uncontrolled personality disorder (e.g., body dysmorphia, depression) Have a history of or currently suffer from an autoimmune disease (e.g., Rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease) Have a history of streptococcal disease (e.g., strep throat or rheumatic fever with or without heart complications) Have a history of skin cancer Suffer from Porphyria Have epilepsy which is not controlled by antiepilepsy therapy Current cutaneous inflammatory and/or infectious processes (e.g., acne, herpes, etc.) Have a history of treatment with interferon therapy (e.g., warfarin) or have taken nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen) or other substances known to increase coagulation time (e.g., herbal supplements with garlic or ginko biloba) within 10 days of undergoing study device injection. NOTE: Study device injection may be delayed as necessary to accommodate this 10day washout period Be on a concurrent regimen of high doses of lidocaine (more than 400 mg) which may cause acute toxic reactions Be on a concurrent regimen of other local anesthetics structurally related to amidetype local anesthetics Have impaired cardiac conduction, severly impaired hepatic function, or severe renal dysfunction Have a condition or be in a situation that, in the Investigator's opinion, may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study</criteria>
