	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the intake of Vitamin D has a positive effect on walking ability of patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease. Skeletal muscle fibers change morphology in peripheral artery occlusive disease. In patients with Vitamin D-deficiency there are also changes of skeletal muscle fibers. The investigators have the hypothesis that patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease with subsequent changes of muscle fibers morphology of calf muscles might take profit of the administration of Vitamin D in combination with training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D and Walking Ability in Patients With Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background On the one hand, patients suffering from peripheral artery occlusive disease may have a significant decrease in their walking ability. When there is insufficient supply of oxygen to the muscles, especially the calf muscles, structural changes of skeletal muscle fibers appear. On the other hand, these patients might also have an insufficient supply with Vitamin D as it is often the case in the general population. A deficiency of Vitamin D also causes structural changes in the skeletal muscles and causes muscle weakness. Hypothesis Vitamin D - intake can improve the walking ability of patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease and eventually Vitamin D - deficiency. Aim of the study To evaluate the influence of Vitamin D - intake on walking ability of patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease, which would be a simple, safe and non-invasive measure with a positive effect on quality of life and indirectly on cardiovascular health in general (better mobility). Primary endpoint: Measurement of walking ability with treadmill test at the beginning and after a 3 month-treatment with Vitamin D, in combination with a home-based training. Secondary endpoints: - Measurement of calf muscle perfusion as an indirect parameter for walking ability, measurement at the beginning, after three months and after a 6 month follow up. - Quality of life questionnaires (SF 36 and walking impairment questionnaire), visual analogue scale. Study design: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated pilot study with a study duration of 3 months and a 3 month - follow up. Study course: 6 study visits are planned. - Visit 0: screening visit, lab (Calcium, Vitamin D3), questionnaires - Visit 1: treadmill test, measurement of calf muscle perfusion, intake of first monthly dose of Cholecalciferol 45'000 units (or placebo) - Visit 2 (after 1 month): vital parameters, second dose of 45'000 units of Cholecalciferol (or placebo) - Visit 3 (after 2 months): vital parameters, third dose of 45'000 units of Cholecalciferol (or placebo) - Visit 4 (after 3 months): treadmill test, measurement of calf muscle perfusion , lab (Calcium, Vitamin D3), questionnaires - Visit 5 (after 6 months): treadmill test, measurement of calf muscle perfusion , lab (Calcium, Vitamin D3), questionnaires</detailed_description>
