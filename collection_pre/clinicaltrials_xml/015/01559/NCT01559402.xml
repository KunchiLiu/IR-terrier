	<brief_summary>The study investigates if applying a special ventilatory strategy during anesthesia for laparoscopic gastric by pass, produces less atelectasis and better oxygenation in spite of using 100 % oxygen during pre oxygenation and induction of anesthesia. The study investigates oxygenation with blood gas samples but also with a new method that might give more information without the use of blood gas samples. Primary: Oxygenation in patients with morbid obesity improves if preoxygenation, induction and maintenance of anesthesia is performed with either a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), respectively, of 10 cm H2O, in comparison to a technique without CPAP but with a PEEP of 10 cm H2O. Secondary: The improved oxygenation during anesthesia can be prolonged inte the postoperative period if emergence from anesthesia is performed without high levels of oxygen.</brief_summary>
