	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to demonstrate whether, along with dietary recommendations, Armolipid Plus ® can improve the profile of patients with elevated plasma LDL-C acting as a change of lifestyle therapy (TLC) according to the definition of Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Effects of Bioactive Compounds in Lipid Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently reported that the combination of extract of red yeast rice policosanol composed, berberine, folic acid and coenzyme Q10 (Armolipid Plus ®, Rottapharm) produced a significant improvement in lipid profile in patients with moderately elevated cholesterol levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) plasma. Taking into account the potential effect of Armolipid Plus ® on the lipid profile, it is important to investigate the effectiveness in the field of cardiovascular prevention to define its position in prevention programs.</detailed_description>
