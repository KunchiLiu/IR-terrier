	<brief_summary>Rationale: Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (del19 or L858R) show an impressive progression-free survival between 9 and 14 months when treated with erlotinib. However, the presence of EGFR mutations can only imperfectly predict outcome. The investigators hypothesize that progression-free survival could be influenced both by the pretreatment EGFR T790M mutation and by components of DNA repair pathways. The investigators propose a model of treatment whereby patients with EGFR mutations (single or with T790M) can attain a benefit with longer overall PFS when treated with erlotinib plus bevacizumab. When the patients are grouped by BRCA1 mRNA levels and T790M the hypothesis is that the combination of erlotinib plus bevacizumab can improve the PFS in all subgroups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives: 1. To determine long-term outcome of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations with or without T790M mutation at diagnosis and treated with the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab. Primary endpoint: progression-free survival 2. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination 3. To evaluate the correlation of BRCA1 mRNA and AEG-1 mRNA expression and T790M with progression-free survival 4. To monitor EGFR mutations (including T790M) in serum and plasma longitudinally 5. To evaluate molecular biomarkers related to EGFR TKI and bevacizumab Design: This is a multinational, multi-center phase II trial of erlotinib plus bevacizumab in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations confirmed by central re-assessment. Patients will be stratified into two subgroups, with and without EGFR T790M mutation. The stratification will be done after the inclusion of patients. Sample size: 102 patients</detailed_description>
