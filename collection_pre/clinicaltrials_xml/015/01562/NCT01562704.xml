	<brief_summary>Paracetamol is one of the most widely used analgesic in the world, indicated for the symptomatic treatment of fever and pain. The objective of this study is to evaluate the mechanism of action of paracetamol (versus placebo) in the brain with new assessment tools (functional MRI and test inducing pain by thermal stimulation.</brief_summary>
