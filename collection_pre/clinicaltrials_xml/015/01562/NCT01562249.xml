	<brief_title>Rehabilitative Management of Mastication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Orthognathic surgery can produce complications during the postoperative period - i.e. situations of acute pain and inflammation - as a consequence of fractures and incisions in the mucosa. The inadequate management of soft tissue and prolonged surgical time could be the causes of acute facial oedema, hematoma and ecchymosis in the face and neck, as well as functional disorders involving swallowing and breathing, which can affect patients' integrity. Despite the fact that decreased muscular extensibility and strength, increased muscular fatigability, hipomobility, and alteration of the biomechanical efficiency and length of the masticatory muscles are documented clinical consequences, no systematic method of obviating such problems through muscular rehabilitation has yet been published</detailed_description>
