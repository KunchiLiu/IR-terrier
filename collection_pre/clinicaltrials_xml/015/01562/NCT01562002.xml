	<mesh_term>Syndrome</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or Female older than 18 years. Signed Informed consent Negative pregnancy test at inclusion for any potential childbearing female. Compromise of contraceptive method during all trial for any potential childbearing female. Diagnosis of Ocular Surface Failure due to Limbus Insufficiency Syndrome, based in any of the published characteristics as corneal surface neovascularization, loss of corneal transparency, epithelial irregularities, history of punctate keratitis, erosions or repetitive ulcers and presence of symptoms and confirmed by the presence of epithelial phenotype cells assessed with conjunctival impression cytology. Availability for all the scheduled visits during the study Uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g. hypertension or diabetes) or any disease that under medical decision might put the patient at risk during the surgery or followup examinations or may cause any hazard in data analysis. Active ocular infection in any eye. If the infection can be cured, inclusion can be considered after 30 days of inactive infection since its end. Alterations in lid statics / dynamics or any other pathology (e.g. severe dry eye syndrome) except the one that originated the Limbus Insufficience that under medical opinion might alter the results. Any of these must be corrected 3 months prior to patient inclusion, before reconsidering rescreening. Limbus insufficiency syndrome which has not been previously treated with all medical (not surgical) procedures available. No availability for all scheduled visits during the study. Any other circumstance under investigatorÂ´s opinion that prevents patient inclusion even though normal inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.</criteria>
