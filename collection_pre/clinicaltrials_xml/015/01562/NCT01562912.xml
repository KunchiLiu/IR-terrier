	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting the Canadian population. AF is associated with increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and even mortality1. AF can also cause debilitating symptoms and adversely affect a patient's quality of life and functional status. These are amongst several reasons why a strategy of sinus rhythm may be pursued over a strategy of allowing AF to persist2-6. Percutaneous catheter ablation has emerged as an effective alternative to antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) for maintaining sinus rhythm7. The cornerstone of AF ablation procedures today is electrical disconnection or "isolation" of the pulmonary vein (PV) antra from the rest of the left atrium (LA)8-13. In experienced hands, the success rate of PV isolation off AAD is about 80-90% in patients with paroxysmal AF, but repeat procedures are required in up to 40% of patients14-18. Thus, after one ablation, the success rate may only be 50-70% off drugs. Current standard ablation procedures for PV antral isolation employ mapping systems with which reconstructions of the LA and PV anatomy can be created. Visualization may be supplemented by integration of CT or MRI images and/or intracardiac echocardiography. Robotic navigation systems have also been employed to assist in ablation. The result is that ablation technology has become very complex and costly. Furthermore, all of these technologies are based on a single point unipolar radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter where lesions are created point-by-point around the PVs to eventually obtain electrical isolation. This results in a lengthy procedure, often more than 4 hours, which requires a high degree of operator skill. Creation of contiguous, transmural lesions is also challenging with standard single-point RF. Recently, a novel multipolar catheter ablation system has been evaluated for achieving PV isolation (PVAC catheter, Ablation Frontiers, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Based on an over-the-wire circular mapping and ablation design, the catheter can be advanced into the PV antrum, and multiple lesions around the circumference of the catheter can be delivered simultaneously using duty-cycled unipolar and bipolar RF energy. In early reports, the system can achieve complete PV isolation with reduced fluoroscopy and procedural times and uses lower powers to achieve more reliable lesion sets19-21. Long-term efficacy also seems comparable to standard RF ablation22,23. This novel technology has the potential to broaden the application of AF ablation, by making the procedures less time-consuming and less complex without compromising on procedural efficacy. However, published data on outcomes related to use of PVAC technology are limited to studies with relatively small sample sizes ranging from 12 to 102 patients20-25. Data has been restricted to experiences from a small number of European centers performing moderate numbers of PVAC procedures and there is no prospective, multicenter data. The investigators therefore know little about the efficiency of PVAC procedures, which in turn, may allow for an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of using this technology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency Study Evaluating the Use of the PVAC Catheter Technology for Performing Ablation in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open label, prospective, cohort study. Patients undergoing ablation with PVAC technology in up to 15 centers across Canada will be enrolled, ablated, and followed for one year post-ablation. Both primary and secondary objectives of the study will be determined from this cohort of patients. Comparisons to the traditional ablation methods will be made by collecting data from a prospective group of control subjects who are undergoing AF ablation with traditional ablation technology at the same centers by the same operators. Control patients will be enrolled in a 1:2 ratio compared to the PVAC cohort. While the final ratio of control to PVAC patients must be 1:2 by study end for each operator, the ratio may vary while the study is conducted to allow some flexibility in patient recruitment. However, the absolute difference between [# of PVAC patients] and 2x[# control patients] should not exceed 5 at any given time for any operator in any study center</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients aged 18 years or greater. Patients undergoing firsttime catheter ablation for AF. Patients with paroxysmal AF. Paroxysmal AF will be defined as selfterminating episodes less than 7 days duration. Patients should have had at least 3 episodes of AF in a one year period. Patients with symptomatic AF that is refractory to at least one antiarrhythmic medication. "Symptomatic" patients are those who have been aware of their AF anytime within the last 5 years prior to enrollment. Symptoms may include, but are not restricted to, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, or any combination of the above. At least one episode of AF must have been documented by ECG, Holter, loop recorder, telemetry, or transtelephonic monitoring within 24 months of enrollment in the study. Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the clinical study. Patients with persistent AF (defined as an episode of AF lasting &gt;7 days). Patients with AF felt to be secondary to an obvious reversible cause. Patients with contraindications to systemic anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin or a direct thrombin inhibitor. Patients who have previously undergone AF ablation. Patients with left atrial size &gt;/= 55 mm (2D echocardiography, parasternal long axis view). Patients who are or may potentially be pregnant.</criteria>
