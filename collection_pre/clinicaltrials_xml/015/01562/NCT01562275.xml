	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral dosing of GDC-0973 and GDC-0068 administered in combination in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Cohorts of patients will receive multiple ascending doses of GDC-0973 and GDC-0068. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
