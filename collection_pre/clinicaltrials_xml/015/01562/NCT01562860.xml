	<brief_summary>The investigators are comparing two standard of care procedures which can be performed at the same time, or sequentially. The hypothesis being tested is whether simultaneous release of both the carpal Tunnel and the Pronator Teres results in a better outcome in terms of symptom relief and recurrence than Carpal Tunnel Release alone when signs and symptoms of both carpal tunnel and pronator Teres syndromes are present.</brief_summary>
