	<brief_summary>Application of isolation (=contact precautions) in hospitalized patients is recommended when patient is colonized (or infected) by micro-organism known for its outbreak capacity or high pathogenicity. It allows the reinforcement of universal precautions (=standard precautions) in order to control patient-to-patient micro-organisms transmission. Recently, the efficacy of this measure is questioned and its impact on patient care seems deleterious. In a particular context of Infectious Disease Unit, where standard precautions are handled (favorable architecture and appropriate practice for hand hygiene), assessment of contact precautions to reduce the incidence of acquired bacteria during hospitalization would be of interest. The investigators design a non-inferiority comparative study to measure the colonization pressure in patients hospitalized in two different parts of the department: one unit only with standard precautions applied (intervention) and one unit with contact precautions (control) as current routine care.</brief_summary>
