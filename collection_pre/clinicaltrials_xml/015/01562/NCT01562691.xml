	<brief_title>Effect of Airway Integrated Nasal Packing With Different Material</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasal packing with integrated airway had been claimed to improve body oxygenation following septal surgery. This randomized control study examined the effect of airway integrated with nasal packing, in terms of its improvement on oxygen saturation. Sixty patients with septal deviation and hypertrophic turbinate were randomized into three groups. Group 1 patients were packed with only nasopore@ after surgery. Nasopore@ with integrated airway was used for group 2 patients; and Vaseline gauze integrated with airway for group 3 patients. Hemodynamic parameters were sequentially checked. Nasal pain sensation was recorded using visual analog scale.</detailed_description>
