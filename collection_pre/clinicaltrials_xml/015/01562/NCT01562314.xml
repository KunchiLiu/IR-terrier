	<brief_summary>Ulcerative Colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) effecting large amounts of the population. The most common treatment for this condition is 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), however patients failing to respond to this and incurring a flare up are often escalated to steroidal treatments. This study is being conducted by GW Pharma Ltd as a pilot study in order to determine the efficacy and safety of GWP42003 (0mg - 250mg twice daily), compared with placebo, by the percentage of participants achieving remission quantified as a Mayo score of 2 or less (with no subscore &gt; 1) after 10 weeks treatment. This is the first study to determine whether the study medication has a positive benefit for subjects on their ulcerative colitis symptom control, as well as effects on inflammatory marker cytokines (plasma tumour necrosis factor [TNF]α, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6), C reactive protein [CRP], faecal inflammatory marker (calprotectin), stool frequency (NRS), rectal bleeding (NRS), pain (NRS). In addition, various IBD questionnaires are being implemented in the study to observe further benefits on the study medication, compared with placebo. This study will be a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pilot study. There will be two parallel groups of participants (0mg-250mg GWP42003 and placebo, twice daily), with a treatment duration of 10 weeks as well as a 7 day baseline period and one week follow-up. The two treatment groups of 0mg-250mg GWP42003 and placebo will be randomised equally into a 1:1 ratio, with 31 participants in the active IMP group and 31 participants allocated placebo treatment. In order to be eligible for enrollment in this study, subjects will need to be aged 18 years and above (18-65 for Czech Republic) and be clinically diagnosed with with mild or moderate ulcerative colitis and on a fixed dose of 5-ASA treatment (0 mg dose of 5-ASA is acceptable) and have been on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to screening. Eligible subjects will enter the study at a screening visit (Visit 1) and commence a baseline period. Each subject will have a Mayo (including endoscopy) assessment conducted to confirm eligibility. If eligible, the subject will be randomised into the 10-week treatment phase. There are a total of 6 visits in the study.</brief_summary>
