	<brief_summary>The aims of the trial are to assess the safety and the efficacy of SPM 962 following once-a-daily transdermal administration within a range of 2.25 to 6.75 mg/day in Japanese patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) in a multi-center, open-label trial. The maximum treatment period is 53 weeks. The trial is an extension trial from the precedent 6-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative trial(243-07-003). The trial is also for an exploratory investigation of incidence of augmentation, the most problematic complications in dopaminergic treatment.</brief_summary>
