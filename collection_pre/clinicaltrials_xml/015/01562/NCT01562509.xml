	<brief_summary>The main objective of the proposed study is to assess the effectiveness, feasibility and costs of a tailored strategy (developed in accordance with the barriers found and current practice) to improve care for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), compared to a common strategy of 'audit &amp; feedback'.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEARL Study: Improvement of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a previous study among 22 Dutch hospitals many gaps in the care for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) were found, compared to best evidence as described in guidelines. In a problem analysis study, barriers and facilitators for good quality of NHL-care were assessed and a tailored implementation strategy was developed, based on these findings. The proposed study aims at the effectiveness, feasibility and costs of this tailored strategy to improve quality of care for patients with an NHL in a clustered randomized controlled trial in 19 Dutch hospitals. Multilevel regression analyses will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of both strategies. Exposure to and experiences with the strategy elements will be analysed descriptively. Regarding the costs, the two strategies are compared with a health care perspective. The input of resources will be assessed by collecting volumes of consumed resources and multiplying these by the price of each resource unit; the implementation process and consequently costs will be estimated by an Activity Based Costing (ABC) approach. The output will be determined by the level of adherence to the NHL quality indicators.</detailed_description>
