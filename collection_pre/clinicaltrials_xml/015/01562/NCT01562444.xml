	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity response in adults up to 10 years after one booster dose. Data collected from this study will allow for greater information to prescribers who administer TBE vaccine, so that they can appropriately time the administration of booster vaccinations to individuals who received different vaccination schedules and who live in tick borne encephalitis endemic regions.</brief_summary>
