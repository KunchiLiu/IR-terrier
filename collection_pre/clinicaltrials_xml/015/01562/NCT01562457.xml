	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia and Europe. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the intra-subject variability of thromboelastographic parameters (TEG速 and ROTEM速) following two administrations of activated recombinant human factor VII in haemophilia patients in a non bleeding state. The TEG速 parameters are: R time (Reaction Time), K time (K Time (arbitrary measurement)), a (a angle), MA (Maximum Amplitude) and LY30 (Lysis 30 min after MA) while the ROTEM速 parameters are: CT (Clotting Time), CFT (Clot Formation Time), a (a angle), MCF (Maximum Clot Firmness) and LI60 (Lysis index 60 min after CT).</brief_summary>
