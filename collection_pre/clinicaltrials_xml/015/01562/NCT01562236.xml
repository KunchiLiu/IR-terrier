	<brief_summary>Background and objectives: Male sex is a risk factor for poor neurodevelopmental outcome following preterm birth. The investigators aimed to investigate gender-related differences in amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and to correlate these findings with neurodevelopmental outcome. Methods: Preterm infants born &lt;30 weeks' gestational age between 2000 and 2002 were prospectively included. aEEGs obtained within the first two weeks of life were evaluated and classified according to background activity, sleep-wake cycling (SWC) and seizure activity. Outcome was assessed at three years.</brief_summary>
