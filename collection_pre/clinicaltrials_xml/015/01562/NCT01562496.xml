	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to determine the neuroprotective qualities of long-term, in home, exercise therapy program in human PD patients. It is hypothesized that an exercise intervention might delay the onset of levo-dopa therapy (i.e. evidence for neuroprotection). The first part involves a pilot-study in which the feasibility of the intervention and outcome measures will be tested.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The ParkCycle Study: Aerobic Exercise in PD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroprotective therapy (i.e. therapy that slows the disease process) is an unmet medical need in Parkinson's disease (PD). Animal studies have shown that 'intensive' exercise improves motor function and may have neuroprotective properties. The promising animal results have not been translated to patients with PD so far. This is a two-cluster randomised control trial in which twenty patients (10 at each site) will undergo a 6-month exercise intervention on a stationary virtual reality bike and twenty patients (10 at each site)will serve as controls.</detailed_description>
