	<brief_summary>People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often have affected balance capacity and an increased risk for falls. A risk factor for falls are activities requiring dual attention. Another factor leading to reduced balance capacity is trunk stability, and decreased trunk stability has been seen in people with MS compared to healthy controls. Earlier studies using core stability exercises have shown positive effects on balance, compared to no training. In Sweden, physical therapy for people with MS has often included group training. However, evidence for this intervention is scarce. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate balance training in group. The balance training includes core stability exercises and dual attention activities. A multi-centre study is planned with a waiting-list design. Participants are randomised to either exercise group with early start or with late start. The group balance training includes training 60 minutes 2 times per week for 7 weeks.</brief_summary>
