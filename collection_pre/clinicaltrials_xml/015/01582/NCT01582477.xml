	<brief_title>TAP-patients With Robotic Assisted Lap Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assess the safety and efficacy of EXPAREL when administered via infiltration into the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) to provide prolonged postsurgical analgesia in men undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. The primary endpoint is the duration of abdominal analgesia from the infiltration into the TAP as measured by the time to the subject's first postsurgical opioid administration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>male subjects, aged 1875. American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status 13. Undergoing robotassisted laparoscopic prostatectomy performed by a single surgeon (Ingolf Tuerk, MD). Subjects must be physically and mentally able to participate in the study and complete all study assessments. Subjects must be able to give fully informed consent to participate in this study after demonstrating a good understanding of the risks and benefits of the TAP infiltration. Demonstrated hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to amidetype local anesthetics. Inability to tolerate oxycodone with acetaminophen (e.g. Percocet). Any subject whose anatomy or surgical procedure in the opinion of the Investigator might preclude the potential successful performance of a TAP. Any subject who in the opinion of the Investigator might be harmed or be a poor candidate for participation in the study. Subjects who have received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug administration or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during their participation in this study.</criteria>
