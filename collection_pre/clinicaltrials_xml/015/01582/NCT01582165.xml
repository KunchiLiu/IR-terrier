	<brief_summary>Female patients presenting with persistent chest pain despite no obstructive coronary artery disease have impaired prognosis. Stress tests are often positive or inconclusive. As much as 20% of women with chest pain and minimal angiographic CAD have evidence of myocardial ischemia, suggesting impaired coronary microcirculation. The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) is a method for indirectly investigating microvascular function in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. 66 female patients, age 30-70 years, with chest pain and "normal" or near normal coronary angiograms will be included. After coronary physiologic evaluation, patients will be randomized in a double blind study to rosuvastatin 20 mg/day or matching placebo tablets for altogether 6 months. The investigators hypothesize that: 1. A substantial number of women with chest pain and normal or minimal pathology on angiograms have microvascular dysfunction defined by a raised IMR. 2. Statins, based on its pleiotropic action will improve endothelial function and thereby IMR.</brief_summary>
