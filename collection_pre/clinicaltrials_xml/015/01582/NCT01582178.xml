	<brief_summary>Water immersion insertion has been documented to decrease procedure-related discomfort during colonoscopy. There was used warm water infusion for colonoscope insertion in most of the water immersion colonoscopy trials. The investigators have been using room temperature water (20-24°C) for water immersion and the investigators did not notice any drawback of it. In our opinion, it is simpler and cheaper option for water immersion colonoscopy and proof of its efficacy and safety could support the use of water immersion technique in routine practice. The primary endpoint is cecal intubation time and the investigators suppose that the use of warm water infusion does not shorten it significantly. Patient comfort during colonoscope insertion, water consumption, length of the scope while reaching the cecum, need for external compression, need for positioning of the patient and endoscopist´s difficulty with colonoscopy will be also assessed.</brief_summary>
