	<brief_summary>Neuropathic pain is due to a lesion or disease affecting the nervous system. Antidepressants (ADs) are recommended as the first line treatment. In a murine model, the investigators evidenced that antidepressants antiallodynic action is mediated through β2-adrenergic receptor stimulation and that β-mimetics display the same effect. These data support the idea that β-mimetics could offer a therapeutic alternative to ADs for neuropathic pain treatment. This study will aim at assessing the effects of terbutaline on neuropathic pain symptoms.</brief_summary>
