	<brief_summary>Chronic dialysis patients with end stage renal disease have an increased mortality rate as compared to the age matched healthy population. It is known that chronic inflammation contributes to the high incidence of cardiovascular events in chronic dialysis patients. Dialyzers made by membranes with increased pore size (high cut-off Dialyzer HCO1100) may be beneficial in the elimination of inflammatory mediators and may improve the inflammatory status. Hypothesis: In this study it will be investigated whether the treatment with HCO1100 will improve the inflammatory status of chronic dialysis patients.</brief_summary>
