	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a highly prevalent condition that is frequently encountered in the health care setting. It affects roughly 40% of Americans monthly and 10% weekly. Of those with GERD, there exists a cohort that experience nausea with or without vomiting that is unresponsive to PPI's and anti-emetics. For these patients, treatment options are limited and these symptoms may substantially alter their quality of life. New and novel therapies emerging include neuromodulation devices that may affect the central pathways leading to these symptoms. Of these, the Reletex band has been tested and proven efficacious in the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy, chemotherapy, and surgery, in addition to standard anti-nausea medications. The investigators propose that through a similar mechanism, this device as an adjunct to PPI's and anti-emetics will reduce GERD-associated the nausea with or without vomiting, and by so doing, improve the quality of lives in this patient population.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Nausea</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Any patient over the age of 18 with clinically diagnosed GERD as evidenced by the GerdQ assessment tool and/or ambulatory pH/ pH impedance monitoring with a component of nausea with or without vomiting. Continued symptoms despite a stable dose of FDA approved daily PPI therapy in addition to or without supportive antiemetics. We will include patients with twice a day PPI dosing, as this is a standard treatment for PPI nonresponders. Previous gastric emptying study performed as part of the standard care workup of nausea and vomiting. Patients will be recruited regardless of the results and this information will only be used as a potential predictor for symptom response. Currently participating in a concurrent clinical trial or completed another trial within past 8 weeks. Prior gastrointestinal surgery of the esophagus and stomach. Severe esophagitis (Los Angeles esophagitis Grade C and above), Barrett's metaplasia or eosinophilic esophagitis, achalasia or spastic motor disorder Unstable medical illness with ongoing diagnostic workup and treatment. Patients with wellcontrolled hypertension, diabetes and a remote history of ischemic heart disease that is deemed stable, as judged by the physicianinvestigator can be included. Current drug or alcohol abuse or dependency. Current neurologic or cognitive illness or impairment which would make the patient an unsuitable candidate for hypnosis. This will be determined by the investigators before randomization using the Mini Mental Status Exam in patients with suspected impairment. Severe mental illness, e.g., uncontrolled major depression with suicidal ideation, active psychosis, diagnosis of schizophreniaspectrum disorder. Those with nickel, gold, or other metal allergies. Those with other neuromodulators or implanted electrical devices such as cardiac pacemakers, AICD's, neurostimulators or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices (TENS units). Females who are or might become pregnant during the study.</criteria>
