	<criteria>Have had type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 1 year Have been receiving basal insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH], detemir, or glargine) and a stable dose of 0 to 3 oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAMs) used as specified in the local prescribing information for at least 90 days prior to screening. At least 1 of the OAMs must be dosed at, or above, half the maximum daily dose allowed by local regulations or at the maximally tolerated dose Have a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than or equal to 9.0% at screening Have a body mass index (BMI) less than or equal to 45.0 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2) Women of childbearing potential are not breastfeeding, have a negative pregnancy test at screening and randomization, do not plan to become pregnant during the study, have practiced reliable birth control for at least 6 weeks prior to screening and will continue to do so during the study and until 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug Have routinely used insulin glargine twice daily in the 90 days prior to the study or have used routine, mealtime insulin therapy (outside of pregnancy) anytime in the past 6 months, except for shortterm treatment up to a maximum of 4 continuous weeks Have used rosiglitazone, pramlintide, glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonist concurrently or within 90 days prior to screening For participants on OAMs: have any restrictions for cardiac, renal, and hepatic diseases in the local product regulations Are taking, or have taken within the 90 days preceding screening, prescription or overthecounter medications to promote weight loss Have had any episodes of severe hypoglycemia within 6 months prior to screening Have had 1 or more episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar state/coma in the 6 months prior to screening Have cardiac disease with functional status that is New York Heart Association Class III or IV Have a history of renal transplantation, or are currently receiving renal dialysis or have serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (177 micromoles/liter [mmol/L]) Have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease (excluding nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), acute or chronic hepatitis, non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or elevated liver enzyme measurements Have had a blood transfusion or severe blood loss within 3 months prior to screening or have known hemoglobinopathy, hemolytic anemia, or sickle cell anemia, or any other traits of hemoglobin abnormalities known to interfere with the measurement of HbA1c Have active or untreated cancer, have been in remission from clinically significant cancer(other than basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer) for less than 5 years, or are at increased risk for developing cancer or a recurrence of cancer in the opinion of the investigator Are receiving chronic (lasting longer than 14 consecutive days) systemic glucocorticoid therapy (excluding topical, intranasal, intraocular, and inhaled preparations) or have received such therapy within the 8 weeks immediately preceding screening Have fasting triglycerides greater than 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) at screening Have an irregular sleep/wake cycle (for example, participants who sleep during the day and work during the night) in the investigator's opinion Lipidlowering medication: Are using or have used any of the following: niacin preparations as a lipidlowering medication and/or bile acid sequestrants within 90 days prior to screening or lipidlowering medication at a dose that has not been stable for at least 90 days prior to screening</criteria>
