	<detailed_description>BRF116056 is the first clinical experience with GSK2118436, a BRAF inhibitor, in Japan. This study will be designed to assess safety, tolerability, single and repeat dose PK profile and preliminary efficacy of GSK2118436 in Japanese subjects with BRAF V600 mutation positive solid tumors using continuous daily dosing schedule. Dose escalation of GSK2118436 will be performed according to a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design. GSK2118436 is given twice a day. However, to characterize the PK of GSK2118436 and its metabolites after single-dose administration, GSK2118436 will NOT be administrated for a week after the first administration. GSK2118436 continuous dosing will start after the 168-hour PK sample is obtained. Subjects may receive study treatment until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event.</detailed_description>
