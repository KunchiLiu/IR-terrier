	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine if opioid dependent subjects who are already receiving Subutex and/or Suboxone can transfer to RBP-6300. Upon completing the study, subjects will continue their pre-study prescribed dosage of Subutex and/or Suboxone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transfer of Subjects From Subutex/Suboxone to RBP-6300</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the open-label Run-In Period (study days -7 to -1), participants receive Subutex®/Suboxone® at one of three dose levels, depending on the dose level for that subject on entry to the study: 8 mg/day, 16 mg/day, or 24 mg/day. During the 7-day, active drug-controlled, double-blind Transfer Period (study days 1-7), participants are randomized to either Subutex®/Suboxone® or RBP-6300 active drug at dosing levels equivalent to the level during the Run-In Period plus placebo matching the other drug. This is followed by a 3-day single-blind Subutex®/Suboxone® Transition Period in which participants receive the same dose given during the Run-In Period.</detailed_description>
