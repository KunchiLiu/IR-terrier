	<brief_summary>The goal of Part I of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of TPI 287 that can be given with bevacizumab to patients with glioblastoma. The goal of Part II is to learn if TPI 287 when given with bevacizumab can help to control glioblastoma better than when bevacizumab is given alone. The safety of the drug combination will also be studied. TPI 287 is similar to a type of chemotherapy drug called a taxane and is designed to block a protein (tubulin) that helps the cancer cells divide. By blocking the tubulin, the drug may be able to cause the cancer cells to shrink or stop growing. Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the growth of blood vessels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part I and Part II of the Study: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you joined this study. Up to 3 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled in Part I of the study. After that, up to 90 participants will be enrolled in Part II. If you are in Part I, you will be assigned to receive 1 of 4 dose levels of TPI 287 based on when you join this study. The first 3-6 participants will receive a starting dose level. The next 3-6 participants will receive a higher dose if no intolerable side effects were seen or a lower dose if intolerable side effects were seen. Your dose may be lowered if you have side effects. All participants will receive bevacizumab at the same dose level for the entire study. If you are in Part II, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. If you are one of the first 20 participants in Part II, you will be randomly assigned to a group. If you are enrolled after the first 20 participants, you will be more likely to be enrolled in the group that is showing better results. - If you are in Group 1, you will receive bevacizumab. - If you are in Group 2, you will receive bevacizumab and TPI 287. If the disease gets worse at any time during the treatment with bevacizumab alone, you may enroll in the Crossover Group to receive TPI 287 and bevacizumab. Other Drugs: If you are taking TPI 287, you will be given standard drugs such as Benadryl® (diphenhydramine) and cimetidine to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Study Drug Administration: There are 42 days in each study cycle. Part I: - On Days 1 and 22 of every cycle, you will receive TPI 287 by vein over 1 hour. - On Days 1, 15, and 29 of every cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over 30-90 minutes. Part II: If you are in Group 1: ° On Days 1,15, and 29 of every cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over 30-90 minutes. If you are in Group 2 or the Crossover Group: - On Days 1 and 22 of every cycle, you will receive TPI 287 by vein over 1 hour. - On Days 1, 15, and 29 of every cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over 30-90 minutes. Study Visits for Part I, Group 2, or Crossover Group of Part II: Every time you receive the study drug(s), your vital signs will be recorded before and at the end of the infusion. On Days 1, 15, 22, and 29 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1- 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. On Days 1, 15, and 29 of Cycle 1, urine will be collected for kidney function tests. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond: - Your medical history and performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have had any side effects. - You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your weight. - You will have a neurological exam. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. - Urine will be collected for kidney function tests. - You will have an MRI scan of the brain to check the status of the disease. On Days 15, 22, and 29 of Cycles 2 and beyond, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Study Visits for Group 1 of Part II: Every time you receive the study drug(s), your vital signs will be recorded before and after the infusion. On Days 1, 15, and 29 of Cycle 1: - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Urine will be collected for kidney function tests. On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and beyond: - Your medical history and performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have had any side effects. - You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your weight. - You will have a neurological exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. - Urine will be collected for kidney function tests. - You will have an MRI scan of the brain to check the status of the disease. On Day 15 and 29 of Cycles 2 and beyond, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed if the doctor thinks they are needed for your safety. The study doctor will tell you more about any extra tests. Length of Treatment: You may continue taking the study drug(s) for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If you enroll in the Crossover Group, you may continue taking the study drugs for up to 6 additional cycles in the Crossover Group. You may no longer be able to receive the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment and follow-up visits. End-of-Treatment Visit: Within 28 days after you stop the study drugs: - Your medical history and performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have had any side effects. - You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - You will have a neurological exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. - Urine will be collected for kidney function tests. - You may have an MRI scan of the brain to check the status of the disease. Long-Term Follow-Up: Every 3 months after the end-of-treatment visit for up to 1 year, you will be called and asked how you are feeling. This call will take about 5-10 minutes. This is an investigational study. TPI 287 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of brain tumors, including glioblastoma. The combination of TPI 287 and bevacizumab in glioblastoma is investigational. Up to 108 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

Patients will be eligible if the original histology was lowgrade glioma or anaplastic glioma (WHO II or III) and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made. Only patients with histologically proven or imaging proven recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be eligible for this protocol. 2. Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by MRI scan and should have failed radiation and temozolomide therapy. The scan done prior to study entry documenting progression will be reviewed by the treating physician to document changes in tumor dimension to confirm recurrence.

For this study, patients may have had up to 2 prior relapses provided the functional status and other eligibility criteria for enrollment are met. 4. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating their awareness of the investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of this hospital. 5. The baseline onstudy MRI should be performed within 14 days (+/ 3 working days) prior to registration and on a steroid dosage that has been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and the initiation of therapy (or at that time), a new baseline MRI is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI, must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement. 6. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: a) At least 4 weeks have elapsed from the date of surgery and the patients have recovered from the effects of surgery. b) Evaluable or measurable disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility into the study. c) To best assess the extent of residual measurable disease postoperatively, a MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate postoperative period. 7. Patients must be 18 years old or older. 8. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) equal or greater than 60. 9. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy to &lt; grade 2 toxicity per CTC version 4 (except deep vein thrombosis) prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1: a) at least 12 weeks from completion of radiation therapy except if there is unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence (such as histological confirmation or advanced imaging data such as positron emission computed tomography (PET) scan in which case at least 4 weeks from completion of radiation therapy will suffice (Note: for patients who have undergone surgery to confirm recurrence after radiation therapy, guidelines in 5.2.6a should be followed). b) 4 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy. c) 4 weeks from prior experimental drug. d) 2 weeks from vincristine. 10. 9) (continued) e) 6 weeks from nitrosoureas. f) 3 weeks from procarbazine administration. g) 1 week for noncytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, cisretinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). h) Patients who receive anticancer agents for nontherapeutic purposes unrelated to this study (such as presurgically for obtaining pharmacology data for the agent) will be eligible to enter the study provided they have recovered from the toxic effects of the agent if any. i) Any questions related to the definition of noncytotoxic agents should be directed to the Study Chair. 11. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC&gt; 1,500/mm3 and platelet count of &gt; 100,000/mm3), adequate liver function (SGPT &lt; 3 times upper limit normal and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2 times upper limit normal, total bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dl), and adequate renal function (BUN and creatinine &lt;1.5 times institutional normal) prior to starting therapy. 12.

Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant (as evidenced by a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry), must not be breastfeeding and must practice adequate contraception for the duration of the study, and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication. An adequate method of contraception is one highly effective method or more than one additional methods. Highly effective methods include intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants), tubal ligation and partner's vasectomy. Additional effective methods include latex condom, diaphragm and cervical cap. 13. Patient must be able to tolerate the procedures required in this study including periodic blood sampling, study related assessments, and management at the treating institution for the duration of the study. 14. Exploratory, CrossOver Trial Arm: Patients with evidence of clinical or radiographic progression on the bevacizumab alone arm are eligible for crossover into the exploratory arm of the trial if KPS is 50 or greater and all other criteria for initial enrollment in the trial are still met at time of progression. Patients will be excluded if the investigators feel the patient will not tolerate TPI 287 or if an alternative treatment approach is deemed necessary by the treating physician. 1. Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures. 2. Prior treatment with bevacizumab or TPI 287. 3.
