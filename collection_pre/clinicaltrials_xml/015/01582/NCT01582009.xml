	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Panobinostat and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving panobinostat together with everolimus and to see how well they work in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell cancer that does not respond to treatment with sunitinib malate or sorafenib tosylate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panobinostat and Everolimus in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Renal Cell Cancer That Does Not Respond to Treatment With Sunitinib Malate or Sorafenib Tosylate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability and determine the recommended dosing for the combination of LBH589 and Everolimus in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. (Phase I) II. To assess the preliminary evidence of tumor response in patients treated with LBH589 and Everolimus. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the effect of LBH589 and Everolimus on the progression-free survival event rate. (Phase II) IV. To determine the clinical response rate of LBH589 and Everolimus in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicity of the combination of LBH589 and Everolimus in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. (Phase II) II. To evaluate the effect of LBH589 and Everolimus on time-to-tumor-progression (TTP), disease-free survival and overall survival. (Phase II) III. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of LBH589 and Everolimus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) and tumor that are accessible before and after treatment, if available. (Phase II) IV. To evaluate the modulation of tumor metabolism and blood in patients treated with LBH589 and Everolimus by FDG and 015 water PET/CT scan. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of panobinostat and everolimus, followed by a phase II study. Patients receive oral panobinostat once daily on days 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, and 12 and oral everolimus once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
