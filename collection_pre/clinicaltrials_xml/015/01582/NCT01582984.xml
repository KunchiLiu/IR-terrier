	<brief_summary>A structured consent process, in combination with one or a number of the aforementioned modalities (nursing education, handout, video, etc), may reasonably be expected to improve surgical informed consent. The investigators hypothesized that overall patient knowledge/retention would be influenced by the type of consent process and that more intensive training and review would result in better patient retention and recall. The investigators further hypothesized that the knowledge retention would decline following the consent process and surgery, but in a stratified manner based on the nature of preoperative teaching.</brief_summary>
