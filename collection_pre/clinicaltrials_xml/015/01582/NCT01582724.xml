	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Additional Self-care Acupressure for Women With Menstrual Pain Compared to Usual Care Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Menstrual pain is a common problem in young women and one of the the main reasons of short term absence from school or work. There is some evidence that acupuncture and acupressure might be successful in treating of menstrual pain. Compared with acupuncture, acupressure offers the possibility for women with menstrual pain to do self-care treatment at home. However, studies have been small and self-care acupressure had been only investigated in one study from Taiwan.</detailed_description>
