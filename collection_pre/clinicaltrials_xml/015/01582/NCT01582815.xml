	<brief_title>A Study of JNJ-40411813 as Supplementary Treatment to an Antidepressant in Adults With Depression and Anxiety Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), placebo-controlled study in adult patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxiety symptoms of relevant severity. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase of up to 2 weeks, an 8-week double-blind treatment phase, and a 2-week post-treatment (follow up) phase. Patients will continue to take the same daily dose of their antidepressant (as directed by the investigator) at the same time of day, from screening through the end of the study, including the post-treatment phase. The total study duration for each patient will be approximately 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
