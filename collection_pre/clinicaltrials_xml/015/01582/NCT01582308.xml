	<brief_summary>A five-period crossover study to assess and compare the trough dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibition at 24-hours following the final morning dose for sitagliptin, saxagliptin and vildagliptin after 5 days of once daily dosing and vildagliptin after 5 days of twice daily dosing in participants with T2DM. The primary hypothesis is that following multiple daily dose administration to achieve steady-state drug concentrations, 100-mg sitagliptin will demonstrate greater DPP-4 inhibition at 24-hours after the final dose compared to 5-mg saxagliptin and 50-mg vildagliptin (once daily administration) in participants with T2DM. Each participant will receive all 5 treatments in randomized order. There will be a washout interval of at least 10 days between the last dose of study drug in one period and the first dose of study drug in the following period.</brief_summary>
