	<brief_summary>This is a trial of AGS-003, which is being studied as a possible treatment for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is an overall survival (OS) benefit between subjects treated with AGS-003 in combination with standard treatment versus subjects treated with standard treatment alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Trial of Autologous Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy Plus Standard Treatment of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the combination of an autologous ribonucleic acid (RNA) electroporated dendritic cell (DC) based immunotherapy, AGS-003, plus standard treatment (initiating with sunitinib). The primary objective in this study is to determine the median OS achieved by this combination compared to the OS resulting from use of active control (standard treatment), in a population of adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with nephrectomy indicated, and with remaining metastatic disease.</detailed_description>
