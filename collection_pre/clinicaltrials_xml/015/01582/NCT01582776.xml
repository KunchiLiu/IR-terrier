	<brief_summary>This study is to determine first the appropriate dose of lenalidomide to administer in combination with fixed doses of obinutuzumab in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma patients. In a second step, this study aims to determine the efficacy of this combination in 3 separate populations: relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma: cohort 1), relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (cohort 2) and previously untreated follicular lymphoma (cohorts 3 and 4).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of OBINUTUZUMAB Combined to LENALIDOMIDE for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Follicular and Aggressive B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open label, multicenter study with two phases: The Phase IB part of the study is a dose escalation study of lenalidomide (Revlimid) administered orally during on 3 weeks of every 28-day cycle, in combination with fixed doses of obinutuzumab (GA101) in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma patients. The Phase II part of the study is an efficacy study of the association of the recommended dose of lenalidomide associated with GA101 in 2 separate populations of patients: relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma: cohort 1), relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (cohort 2) and previously untreated follicular lymphoma (cohorts 3 and 4). First, all patients will receive a combination of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide for a total of 6 cycles. Patients who achieve at least a partial response after 6 cycles will receive a maintenance treatment with obinutuzumab for 2 years and Lenalidomide for 1 year as tolerated, or until disease progression.</detailed_description>
