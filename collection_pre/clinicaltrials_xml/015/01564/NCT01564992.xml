	<brief_summary>This observational study aims at identifying gene modifiers of Parkinson Disease (PD) and of treatment response and adverse events of antiparkinsonian drugs. Six hundred PD patients will be followed annually for up to 5 years. A biological collection will be associated with a full clinical assessment of motor and non motor symptoms, medical and treatment history, environmental factors. The association between candidate gene polymorphisms and disease or treatment complications will be analyzed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title : Drug interaction with genes in Parkinson Disease Objective: To identify genes associated to disease and treatment complication and response. Number of subjects: 500 Study duration : 6 years Design: Prospective cohort with biological collection Primary objective: Identification of genes which polymorphism or haplotype is associated with a complication of Parkinson disease, directly or with the interaction of treatment. Secondary objectives: - Prevalence and incidence of disease or treatment complications - Clinical risk factor for disease or treatment complications - Biomarkers of disease progression, disease or treatment complications</detailed_description>
