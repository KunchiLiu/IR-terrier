	<brief_summary>Background: The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study is to determine the most effective supplemental analgesic, paracetamol or lornoxicam for postoperative pain relief after lower abdominal surgery. Methods: Sixty patients scheduled for lower abdominal surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive either isotonic saline (Control group), intravenous paracetamol 1 g every 6 h (Paracetamol group) or lornoxicam 16 mg then 8 mg after 12 h (Lornoxicam group). Additionally pain was treated postoperatively using morphine patient-controlled analgesia. Postoperative pain scores measured by the verbal pain score (VPS), morphine consumption and the incidence of side effects were measured at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively.</brief_summary>
