	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of MultiPoint Pacing (MPP) on cardiac hemodynamics assessed by pressure-volume loop during MPP at implant. NYHA functional class assessment and echocardiographic measurements are performed at 3 months and 12 months post-implant to characterize long-term effect of MPP.</brief_summary>
