	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of epicardial and endocardial pacing at each side of the left ventricular (LV) segments on cardiac hemodynamics in patients with impaired LV function undergoing epicardial ablation and mapping procedure. Hemodynamic function will be assessed during a pacing protocol with a pressure catheter inserted in the LV.</brief_summary>
