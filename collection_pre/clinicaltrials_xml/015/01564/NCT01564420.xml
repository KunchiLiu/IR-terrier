	<brief_summary>The currently available data are insufficient to develop a model that achieves optimum morphine dose individualization at the postoperative period of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Therefore, the objective of the study was to apply a PK/PD model that could justify morphine consumption, drug plasma concentration and pain intensity during the postoperative period after CABG and evaluate the post operative pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The protocol was a prospective, open-label study, approved by the institutional ethical committee of the hospital where the study was performed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive general anesthesia plus intrathecal morphine at a dosage of 400 mcg (morphine group) or general anesthesia alone (control group) according to a simple computer-generated list.</detailed_description>
