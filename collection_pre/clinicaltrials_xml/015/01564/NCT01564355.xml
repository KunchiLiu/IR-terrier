	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition of the nose and sinuses. It affects about 5 to 10% of Canadians. Patients suffer from congestion in the nose and sinuses, nasal discharge, pressure in the face, and a reduced sense of smell. This affects people's enjoyment of life. Medical management uses sprays or pills to treat these symptoms but for some patients sinus surgery is needed. This type of surgery is called endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). There is no single correct approach to take care of patients after sinus surgery. Most experts would use a nasal spray and a short-course of oral steroid pills to reduce sinus swelling and minimize complications related to scarring. "Steroid-eluting nasal spacers" are devices placed inside the sinus during surgery and slowly release topical steroids into the sinuses better than steroid sprays. These "spacers" have been shown to improve results following sinus surgery. When using these special "spacers", there may no longer be a need for oral steroid pills following surgery. This would help to avoid potential side effects associated with these medications. The purpose of this study is to find out whether taking oral (systemic) steroid pills following sinus surgery is necessary to improve surgical results, now that steroid-eluting nasal spacers are commonly used during surgery.</brief_summary>
