	<brief_summary>This is a three armed prospective randomized trial that will compare two different surgical techniques for reconstruction of the abdominal wall diastasis with a conservative treatment procedure. The study hypothesis: Which surgical approach provides the safest and best long term results for patients with abdominal wall diastasis either the insertion of net alternative with a double row suture or exercise alone?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Two Different Surgical Methods for Treatment for Abdominal Wall Diastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The conservative control group will receive a special training program for abdominal muscle training for 3 months,and all groups wearing girdle for 3 months. All patients examined with a CT scan before randomization and then a Biodex measurement of abdominal muscle strength. All patients must also complete the SF-36 (scientifically tested instruments to measure self-reported physical and mental health) and VHPQ (ventral hernia Pain Questionnaire). Two-thirds of patients receive surgery and followed up with a 3 month and 1-year control.At 1 year of control, all go through a CT scan and a Biodex measurement of muscle strength. The control group followed up after one and half months and 3 months. In the surgery group, patients may not know what reconstruction they received before the final assessment after 1 year.</detailed_description>
