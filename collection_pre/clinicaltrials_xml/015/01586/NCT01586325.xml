	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (how a drug is absorbed and distributed in the body), and intrinsic antiviral activity of JNJ-47910382 after 5 consecutive days of administration in chronic, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-genotype-1-infected patients at different doses and dose regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antiviral Activity of JNJ-47910382 at Different Doses and Dose Regimens in Asian Genotype-1, Chronic, HCV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug), randomized (patients are assigned by chance to treatment groups) placebo-controlled study. A placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect. The study population will consist of Asian treatment-naive genotype-1, chronic HCV-infected patients. The trial will involve a screening period at a maximum of 6 weeks before baseline, a 9-day treatment period (with 5 days of actual medication intake) and a 4-week follow-up period. Patients will be divided into 3 panels of 8 patients (Panel 1) or 5 patients (Panels 2 and 3). Treatment will be initiated in each panel of patients sequentially. In each panel, patients will receive JNJ-47910382 or placebo during 5 consecutive days. JNJ-47910382, or placebo, will be administered once daily. Treatments will be taken by mouth and with standardized meals in all dosing regimens. Patient safety will be monitored.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented chronic HCV infection (diagnosis of hepatitis C &gt;= 6 months before the screening period) HCV geno and subtype of 1a or 1b (Panel 1) or 1b (Panels 2 and 3) Patient has never received pegylated interferon, ribavirin, or any other approved or investigational antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infection Patient with HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) level of &gt;100,000 IU/mL at screening (as assessed by standard quantitative in vitro nucleic acid amplification assay) A Body Mass Index (BMI, weight in kg divided by the square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 32.0 kg/m2, extremes included A body weight above 50 kg Normal 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening Evidence of or documented liver cirrhosis Evidence of decompensated liver disease Evidence of any other cause of significant liver disease in addition to hepatitis C History or evidence of current use of alcohol, barbiturate, amphetamine, recreational or narcotic drug use, which in the Investigator's opinion would compromise patient's safety and/or compliance with the study procedures A positive urine drug (with exclusion of methadone or equivalent) test at study screening Patient with protocoldefined laboratory abnormalities at screening Patient coinfected with HIV1 or HIV2, or hepatitis A or B virus infection, or active tuberculosis at study screening Patient infected/coinfected with nongenotype 1 HCV at study screening Patient with any cardiac disease at screening, or any active clinically significant disease (eg, cardiac dysfunction, cardio(myo)pathy, cardiac insufficiency), or medical history or physical examination findings during screening that, in the Investigator's opinion, would compromise the outcome of the trial Patient having uncontrolled/unstable disease such as diabetes, epilepsy, a manifest psychiatric disease, or thyroid disease or disorders Patient with nonstable methadone (or equivalent drug) use</criteria>
