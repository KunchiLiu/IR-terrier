	<brief_summary>Rituximab is the first drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis. Because it is a relatively new medication, the long-term safety and efficacy of this drug is not yet clear. This study proposes to follow patients who were enrolled in the RAVE study to determine if treatment with rituximab influences long-term outcomes.</brief_summary>
