	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) A1 subscore (walking pain) at 26 weeks compared to the Baseline score - To evaluate the safety using the incidence, severity, seriousness, relatedness, and frequency of all treatment emergent Adverse Events (AEs) Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the change in WOMAC A1 subscore (walking pain) between baseline and weeks 8, and 12 - To evaluate the change in WOMAC A, B and C score between baseline and weeks 8, 12 and 26 - To evaluate the change in Patient Global Assessment (PTGA) score between baseline and weeks 8, 12 and 26 - To evaluate the change in Clinical Observer Global Assessment (COGA) score between baseline and weeks 8, 12 and 26 - To evaluate the change in concomitant Osteoarthritis (OA) therapy over 26 weeks and between baseline and weeks 1, 2, 8, 12 and 26</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : 1. The participants had a diagnosis of OA of the Target Knee confirmed by recent XRay (mild to moderate joint space narrowing and/or osteophytes predominant in the tibiofemoral compartment) 2. WOMAC A1 baseline 100 mm Visual Analog Score (VAS) between 4080 mm (moderate or severe walking pain) in the Target knee 3. Participants with bilateral disease included in the study with the below strict conditions: Only one knee included in the efficacy assessment and considered the Target Knee (The worst knee by the WOMAC A1 pain scale should be selected). The selected knee must meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria The nontarget knee might also be treated with Synvisc® and did not need to meet the KellgrenLawrence (KL) grade knee specific inclusion criteria described above. The other criteria applied, and included in safety assessment 4. Premenopausal female participants had a negative urine pregnancy test and continue to use a medically acceptable form of contraception for the duration of the study. Otherwise, females had been surgically sterile, or postmenopausal (as documented in medical history) for at least 1 year Exclusion criteria: 1. Significant (requiring surgical correction) valgus or varus deformity of the knee, ligamentous laxity, or meniscal instability 2. Concomitant inflammatory or any other disease/condition which might affect joints (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic bone disease, psoriasis, gout, pseudogout, chondrocalcinosis etc) 3. History of sepsis in any joint or any clinical concern for a subacute infectious process in the target joint 4. History of surgery in the target knee (if done &lt; 6 months) 5. Planned surgery on any lower extremity joint 6. Presence of clinically significant venous or lymphatic stasis in the leg(s) 7. Clinically apparent tense effusion or inflammation at the target knee 8. Skin disease or infection in the area of the injection site 9. Any musculoskeletal condition that would impede measurement of efficacy at the target knee 10. Pregnant or lactating women 11. Hypersensitivities to avian proteins and/or any components of hyaluronanbased injection 12. Treatment with any Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or derivatives in the previous 6 months. 13. Treatment with IntraArticular (IA) steroid in the previous 3 months 14. Any contraindication to IA injection e.g., anticoagulant therapy or clinical concern for potential coagulopathy (e.g. liver disease) 15. Any significant medical condition (e.g., significant psychiatric or neurological disorders, active alcohol/drug abuse, etc), any medical condition that is unstable/poorly controlled or other factor (e.g., planned relocation) that the Investigator felt would interfere with study evaluations and study participation The above information was not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
