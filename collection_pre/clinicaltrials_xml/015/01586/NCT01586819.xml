	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find out if the use of botulinum toxin prior to a medium strength combination chemical peel (Jessner's peel followed by 35% Trichloroacetic acid peel) will improve the appearance of crow's feet wrinkles when compared to a chemical peel alone. Botulinum toxin type A is a purified substance, derived from a bacteria that block muscular nerve signals. Jessner's Peel, a combination of resorcinol (14g), salicylic acid (14g), and lactic acid (85%) in ethanol (95%), is a superficial chemical peel. These two products/procedures have been FDA approved to improve the appearance of facial wrinkles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Wrinkling in the skin is caused by habitual facial expressions, aging, sun damage, smoking, poor hydration, and various other factors. There are two major types of wrinklesâ€”dynamic and static. Dynamic wrinkles, which are due to excessive muscle activity, usually of the face, tend to disappear when you relax your facial muscles. The most common of these dynamic wrinkles are frown lines, forehead wrinkles, and eye wrinkles (or crow's feet). However, if the excessive muscle activity is carried on for too long, these do not disappear completely on relaxation, and are thus called static wrinkles. Static wrinkles are formed either by chronic excessive muscle activity or are due to the effects of age and gravity, with a loss of subcutaneous fat. Examples of static wrinkles are the nasolabial folds, which are the deep grooves running from the sides of the nose to the corners of the mouth.</detailed_description>
