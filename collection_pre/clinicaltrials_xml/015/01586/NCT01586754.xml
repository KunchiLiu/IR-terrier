	<brief_summary>Microalbuminuria and homocysteine levels are shown to be markers for endothelial dysfunction and subclinical organ damage and predictors of cardiovascular risk in several epidemiologic and randomized clinical trials. Carotis intima-media thickness is also found to be elevated in early stages of atherosclerosis. Recent studies have shown correlations between homocysteine, microalbumin levels and carotis intima-media thickness in type 2 diabetics but no data exists for obese or overweight patients who also have metabolic syndrome, in terms of markers of subclinical organ damage. Since obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and since it is known that patients with metabolic syndrome are at higher risk of cardiovascular events, the investigators wanted to examine whether there is an association between homocysteine, microalbumin levels and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with or without metabolic syndrome, who are either overweight or obese.</brief_summary>
