	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Voclosporin and Tacrolimus in Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a phase III, randomized, multicentre, open-label, concentration-controlled study in subjects undergoing a first or second renal transplant, with induction immunosuppression with an IL-2 receptor antibody (basiliximab), mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. The primary endpoint to assess non-inferiority will be efficacy failure at the end of Month 12 after randomization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females aged 1865 years inclusive at the time of screening. Recipients of a first or second deceased donor or living donor renal transplant. Subjects presently receiving immunosuppression for a previously failed transplant. Females who are pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study, or 3 months after last dose of study medication. Sexuallyactive women of childbearing potential (including those who are &lt; 1 year postmenopausal) and sexuallyactive men who are not practicing a highly effective method of birth control. Subjects receiving a HLA identical living related transplant. Subjects wth a positive Tcell lymphocytotoxic cross match, or positive flow T and B cell cross match. Subjects undergoing primary transplant with a current PRA (or CPRA) ≥ 25%. Subjects who experienced graft loss within 1 year of transplant. Subjects receiving a kidney from a ABO incompatible donor. Subjects receiving a kidney from a deceased donor positive for HIV, HBV, HCV or tuberculosis. Subjects receiving a a kidney from a nonheart beating donor. Subjects receiving paired (en bloc or paired) kidney transplants. Transplantation of multiple grafts (e.g. kidney and pancreas). Subjects receiving a kidney with a cold ischemia time &gt; 30 hours. Subjects receiving any transplanted organ other than a kidney. Recipients of a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Any systemic infections requiring continued therapy at the time of entry into this study. (Prophylaxis against CMV and/or PCP infection will be permitted). Subjects with positive results of the following serological tests: HIV I Ab, hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), antihepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and the antihepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab). Negative results for these serological tests must be documented within 12 months prior to randomization. Subjects with active tuberculosis (Tb) requiring treatment within the last 3 years. Subjects with a known positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test are not eligible unless they have completed treatment for latent Tb and have a negative chest Xray at time of enrollment. PPD testing must have been done within the last 12 months, and a positive result is defined as ≥ 10 mm induration, a Heaf score of &gt;1 in nonBacille CalmetteGuérin (BCG) immunized subjects, or &gt;2 in BCG immunized subjects. Subjects with a current malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years or a history of lymphoma at any time. Subjects can be enrolled with a history of squamous or basal cell carcinoma that has been surgically excised or removed with curettage and electrodessication.</criteria>
