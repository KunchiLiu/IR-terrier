	<brief_summary>Post-operative pain following total knee replacement can be disabling and sometimes lead to the need for prolonged hospital stay. Therefore development of improved post-operative modalities for total knee replacement surgery pain control is important. High-resolution ultrasound (US) allows accurate visualization of nerves and surrounding structures and can lead to higher success rates of nerve block. The investigators aim at comparing the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided nerve block catheter compared with epidural analgesia for patients with knee OA who underwent unilateral total knee replacement.</brief_summary>
