	<criteria>1. Patients ≥ 18 years of age who meet the diagnosis of EER seizure, and previously they have been treated according to the clinical protocol at our center status (Diazepam 10mg Clonazepam 1mg and Phenytoin or iv at a dose of 20mg/kg in case persistence of the clinic): Present seizures for at least 30 minutes without regaining awareness among them. 2. Patients ≥ 18 years of age who meet the diagnosis of nonconvulsive EER, and previously they have been treated according to the clinical protocol at our center status (Diazepam 10mg Clonazepam 1mg and Phenytoin or iv at a dose of 20mg/kg in case persistence of the clinic): After submitting an EER seizures that yield clinically performed an EEG that shows SE electricity. Evidence of a nonconvulsive SE to perform an EEG of a patient admitted for any cause, either by filing seizures, altered mental status, or any other cause, and to persist after the treatment administered previously discussed. 3. Patients in whom it has obtained the written informed consent by the representative and/or patient, as the case 1. Patients with severe cerebral anoxia, when the first EEG evidences a pattern of flaresuppression. 2. Patients who registers PLEDs (periodic epileptic lateralaized Discharges) without clinical seizure activity association to register or without electrical crises. 3. Patients &lt; 18 years of age. 4. Patients in whom there is diagnostic doubt (eg nonconvulsive status among and encephalopathy). 5. Pregnant or breastfeeding. 6. Patients with allergy to phenytoin, hydantoin or hypersensitivity to sodium valproate 7. Patients with porphyria 8. Patients with severe liver disease or dysfunction. 9. Patients with heart block or second and third grade sinus bradycardia.</criteria>
