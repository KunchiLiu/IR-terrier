	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in treating younger patients with lung metastases. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To demonstrate the feasibility of delivering cardiac-sparing IMRT in a multi-institutional setting with central quality control for children and young adults with metastatic tumors in the lungs. II. To prospectively determine the dosimetric advantages of whole lung IMRT treatment over standard whole lung irradiation by comparing treatment plans and different organ dose-volume histograms such as lungs, heart, thyroid gland, liver etc. in all patients enrolled in this study. III. To determine the short-term efficacy (lung-metastases free survival) and acute tolerance of whole lung IMRT at a minimum period of six months after IMRT. OUTLINE: Patients undergo cardiac-sparing whole lung IMRT. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1-5 years.</detailed_description>
