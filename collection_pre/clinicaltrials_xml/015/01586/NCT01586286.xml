	<brief_title>A Study Examining the Use of Vaginal Nifedipine With Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy for Levator Myalgia and Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given the paucity of information and the magnitude of debilitation that can be associated with chronic pain syndromes, the potential to ameliorate pain and successfully treat these symptoms is an area that merits further exploration. In this study, we hypothesize that the addition of vaginal nifedipine to a physical therapy protocol will result in greater treatment success than treatment with physical therapy alone. The objective is to perform a randomized controlled trial among female participants with a diagnosis of pelvic floor hypertonus with associated pain, dysfunctional voiding, dyspareunia, and/or obstructed defecation. Group 1 will serve as the control and will undergo pelvic floor physical therapy and placebo (lanolin and mineral oil base). Group 2 will also undergo pelvic floor physical therapy, but will receive compounded vaginal nifedipine. Specific aims include: 1. Comparison of subjective outcome measures, specifically quality of life metrics scales: Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, and validated 11-point pain scale. 2. Comparison of objective outcome measures, specifically a validated digital assessment of pelvic floor strength: the Oxford scale. Group 1 will serve as the control and will undergo pelvic floor physical therapy and placebo (lanolin base). Group 2 will also undergo pelvic floor physical therapy, but will receive compounded vaginal nifedipine. We will collect data on these patients to determine if the treatment of vaginal nifedipine with physical therapy provides a more successful treatment for this pelvic floor dysfunction.</detailed_description>
