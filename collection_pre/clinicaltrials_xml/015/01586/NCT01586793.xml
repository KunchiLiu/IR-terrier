	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized, single-blind trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of high frequency or low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with resistant bipolar depression. Patients will be assigned to receive either high or low frequency rTMS for 20 consecutive workdays (4 weeks). 10 Hz (high) frequency rTMS and 1 Hz (low) frequency rTMS will be given over the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively. Patients will be assessed with several psychometric instruments at baseline, and at weeks 5 and 9.</brief_summary>
