	<brief_summary>Primary objective: The comparative efficacy of levocetirizine 5 mg once daily with that of fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily against histamine induced wheal, flare and itch responses measured at 0 (baseline), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours. Secondary objectives: 1. The areas under the curves (0 , 12 hours, 12 - 24 hours and 0 - 24 hours) for inhibition of histamine induced wheal, flare and itch responses for levocetirizine 5 mg once daily and fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily. 2. The number of individuals with peak responses in each 10 percentile (Because of the variable absorption of fexofenadine, it is predicted that fexofenadine will have a variable response between individuals). 3. The mean plasma levels of levocetirizine and fexofenadine at 0 (baseline), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eighteen (18) healthy male volunteers, including at least 6 persons of Japanese origin, will be recruited for this study None of the subjects will have taken oral antihistamines, antidepressants, antipsychotics or corticosteroids or applied topical antihistamines, corticosteroids or mast cell stabilizers to the skin for 2 weeks prior to testing. No subject shall perform physical exercise for 4 hours prior to the skin prick testing. Especially, Bronchial asthma, anaphylactic reactions in the history, use of betablockers, skin diseases in the test field are exclusion criteria.</criteria>
