	<brief_title>Rotator Cuff Reconstruction With Xenologous Dermis-patch Augmentation and ACP® - Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The shoulder joint, specially the rotator cuff, is one of the most complicated joints of the human body. If the tendon has to be fixed at the bone during surgery, the weak point in obtaining a successful surgery is the fixation of the tendon at the bone insertion site. Tendon belongs to the bradytrophic tissue conditional on the reduced blood flow, deep mitosis rate and lowered healing potential. The patients in this study have 60 years or more. The tissue of these patients isn't as good as in young patients. The patch will be used to improve the strength of the tendon at the insertion site and the ingrowth process of the new tissue at this area. Additionally the investigators can boost the healing process with a selective use of PRP (PRP = platelet rich plasma). In this process, the healing site is delivered with an elevated concentration of thrombocytes and also growth factors which are constituent parts of them.</detailed_description>
