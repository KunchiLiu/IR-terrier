	<brief_title>Cell Phone Messaging to Improve Communication of Critical Laboratory Results to Patients in Rural Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among the challenges that complicate optimal health care delivery in rural settings is lack of communication between care providers and patients. Communication of abnormal laboratory results represents a particular challenge. Laboratory and other test results are often not reported until repeat visits weeks to months later. In the case of treatment failure, severe treatment complications, or evidence of opportunistic infection, such reporting delays likely result in adverse outcomes and potentially compromise future treatment options. The investigators propose to evaluate a novel strategy of communication using SMS text messaging to facilitate patient return to an HIV clinic in Uganda after critical laboratory results. The investigators will consent and enroll participants at the time of laboratory testing for CD4 count, viral loads, acid fast bacteria smears of sputum, among others. Those with abnormal results will be randomized to various messaging formats and receive text messages requesting a prompt return to clinic. For outcomes, the investigators will measure successful receipt and comprehension of messages, as well as proportion returning within 14 days of the abnormal laboratory test.</detailed_description>
