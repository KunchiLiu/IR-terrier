	<brief_title>ED90 Determination of Carbetocin for the Prevention of Uterine Atony in Women Undergoing an Elective Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postpartum hemorrhage is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Carbetocin have been shown effective in the prevention of uterine atony, which is the leading cause of postpartum hemorrhage. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada recommends a single 100 mcg dose of carbetocin after elective cesarean delivery to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. However, there is no clear data in the literature regarding the lowest effective dose of carbetocin that should be administered. The use of the minimum effective dose of carbetocin may reduce its side effects, including hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and flushing. In this trial, healthy term pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia will be recruited. The effective dose of carbetocin that will prevent postpartum uterine atony in 90% of the women (ED90) will be determined using a biased coin design up-down sequential allocation method. The determination of the carbetocin ED90 will help the anesthesiologist regarding the optimal dose of carbetocin to administer after elective cesarean delivery to prevent uterine atony.</detailed_description>
