	<brief_summary>Myorelaxation is generally used as a part of general anesthesia for interventional rigid bronchoscopy. Succinylcholine is most often used because its short duration of action but rocuronium can be used since sugammadex permits a rapid and complete reversal of the neuromuscular block. The aim of ths study is to compare both agents.</brief_summary>
