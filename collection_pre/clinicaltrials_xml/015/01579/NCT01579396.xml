	<brief_summary>A high cut off dialyzer (septeX) is tested in patients after cardio-thoracic surgery with incidence of "systemic inflammatory response syndrome" (SIRS) and associated increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). Hypothesis: The high cut off dialyzer (septeX) can increase the postoperative IL-6/Il-10 ratio.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Cut Off Dialysis in Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Patients After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery associated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) plays an important pathophysiological role in the development of AKI in patients after cardiothoracic surgery. Previous studies have shown that the elimination of inflammatory mediators can be either achieved by Continuous Venous Venous Hemodialysis(CVVHD) or Continuous Venous Venous Hemofiltration (CVVH) by using a high-cutoff (HCO) membrane with a cut-off 45kD. Data from patients treated with HCO-CVVHD during septic shock show a reduction in systemic cytokines and improved hemodynamics. No data about the effects of early HCO-CVVH in cardiac surgery patients with a high risk of Cardiac Surgery associated AKI and consequently a high rate of postoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT) are available. It is of note that patients with Euroscore &gt; 6 are on high risk to develop SIRS associated AKI. No pharmacological anti-inflammatory approach has convincingly shown to prevent renal dysfunction in these patients.</detailed_description>
