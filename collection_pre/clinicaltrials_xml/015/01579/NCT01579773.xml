	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn if women gain weight using progestin-only methods of contraception and if so, how much. The investigators will look at users of two progestin-only methods: the levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine contraceptive (LNG-IUC) and the etonorgestrel (ENG) subdermal implant, and compare these users' weight change to that of users of a non-hormonal method, the copper intrauterine device. The primary hypothesis is that ENG implant and LNG-IUC users' weight and body composition will increase more than the copper-IUD users. The investigators will collect body composition data using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and collect information about diet and activity using validated questionnaires.</brief_summary>
