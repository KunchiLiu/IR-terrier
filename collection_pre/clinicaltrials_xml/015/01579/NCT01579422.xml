	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this proposal is to develop, refine, manualize and assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief, narrowly-focused social cognitive intervention for individuals with psychosis. The intervention will focus on helping individuals interpret social situations, specifically the intentions and feelings of others. Study methods include preliminary treatment and manual development based on series of uncontrolled cases, manual refinement, and a small feasibility/efficacy trial of the newly developed intervention.</brief_summary>
