	<brief_title>Partnering With Autistic Adults to Improve Healthcare</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate patient-centered care tools for autistic adults and their primary care providers (PCPs). One tool will allow autistic adults and/or their supporters to provide individualized information to PCPs about how being on the spectrum affects their healthcare and possible strategies to facilitate quality care. Another tool will capitalize on the power of patient narrative to educate PCPs about autism. These tools and other resources will be housed on an interactive website for autistic adults, supporters, and PCPs. The research team will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using the new web-based patient-centered care tools with autistic adults and their primary care providers. This study will provide data for a future trial testing the effectiveness of these tools in improving the health of autistic adults by increasing patient-centered care and patient activation.</detailed_description>
