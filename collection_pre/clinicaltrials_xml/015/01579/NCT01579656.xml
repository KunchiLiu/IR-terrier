	<brief_summary>Consumption of whole grains has been heavily endorsed by both government and major health agencies, as evidenced in Health Canada's Food Guide, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Pyramid, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation's healthy eating guide. Whole grains have been championed for their proposed cardioprotective and weight control effects as suggested by epidemiological studies. The health benefits of whole grain products may be attributable to their nutrient composition, which contains dietary fibre, protein and several essential nutrients. There has also been a concurrent increase in seed consumption. Seeds have a similar and potentially superior nutritional composition to whole grains and they are rich in mammalian lignans and polyunsaturated fats, especially the highly valued omega-3 fatty acids. Preliminary studies on seeds have shown that they impart health benefits similar to those imparted by whole grains. Consumer choices regarding seed consumption may be based on their potential health benefits. Furthermore, they may also be affected by subjective sensory factors, such as appearance, taste and pre-conceived perceptions. Therefore, this study will compare the health properties of four seeds and their effects on appetite and sensory parameters in healthy individuals. These four seeds will be that of flax, poppy and sesame, due to their popularity and consumption as well as Salba, which has also recently received much attention for its associated health benefits.</brief_summary>
