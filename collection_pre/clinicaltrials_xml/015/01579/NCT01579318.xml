	<brief_summary>A single arm, open label, multi-center, phase 2 study to assess the safety and anti-tumor activity of intratumoral IL-12 plasmid (i.e., pIL-12) electroporation in subjects with stage IB to IIIB mycosis fungoides. All subjects may receive up to six cycles of treatment consisting of two treatment days, Days 1 and 8, in a 28-day cycle. Patients will receive intra-tumoral injection of pIL-12 at a concentration of 0.5mg/ml and a fixed volume of 0.25 mL per each 1.0 cm diameter of target region, followed immediately by electrical discharge around the tumor site resulting in electroporation of plasmid DNA into tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, open label, multi-center phase 2 study to assess the safety and anti-tumor activity of intratumoral pIL-12 electroporation in subjects with stage IB to IIIB mycosis fungoides. All subjects may receive up to six cycles of treatment consisting of two treatment days, Days 1 and 8, in a 28-day cycle. Patients will receive intratumoral injection of pIL-12 at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and a fixed volume of 0.25 mL per each 1.0 cm diameter of target region, followed immediately by electrical discharge around the tumor site resulting in electroporation of plasmid DNA into tumor cells. Up to a maximum of 8 fixed volume injections followed by electroporation may be administered on each day of treatment and the total number is dependent upon the size of each individual lesion, or affected areas in erythrodermic patients. Prior to the first cycle of treatment, the investigator will select at least one lesion, or affected area in erythrodermic patients, to be left untreated for the duration of the study to allow for clinical observation of an untreated site. Subjects will be followed for safety and clinical evaluation every 4 weeks. Quality of Life will be assessed using the Skindex29, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) and Visual Analog Scale for Pruritus (VAS-P) instruments. Survival follow up will occur at 3-month intervals over 2 years following end of study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Biopsy confirmed mycosis fungoides of stage IB IIIB; 2. Subjects must have failed or have been intolerant to at least one standard of care therapy; 3. Subjects must have a minimum of one lesion, or affected area in erythrodermic patients (T4/stage III), that meets all following criteria: Accessible for pIL12 electroporation; Adequate size such that 6mm biopsy can be collected prior to treatment; 4. Subjects must have one additional lesion, or affected area in erythrodermic patients, that remains untreated for the duration of the study; 5. Age ≥ 18 years old; 6. Subjects must have ECOG performance status 02; 7. Required wash out period of 4 weeks from last dose for the following prior therapies: Topical therapy; Radiotherapy (including photo therapy); Multiagent chemotherapy; Systemic biological therapy; HDAC inhibitors; Interferon alpha and other investigational therapies; 8. For women of childbearing potential, negative pregnancy serum test within 14 days to the first study drug administration, and use of birth control from 30 days prior to the first day study drug administration and 30 days following last day study drug administration; 9. Male subjects must be surgically sterile, or must agree to use contraception during the study and at least 30 days following the last day of study drug administration. 10. Life expectancy of at least 6 months; 11. The patient must have adequate renal and hepatic function as assessed by standard laboratory criteria within 4 weeks prior to enrollment: Creatinine &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal; Serum bilirubin within institutional normal limits; AST and ALT &lt; 1.5x ULN; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/mm; Platelet count &gt; 100,000 /mm; 12. Able to give informed consent and able to follow guidelines given in the study. Exclusion Criteria 1. Prior therapy with IL12 or prior gene therapy; 2. Prior treatment with Campath (alemtuzumab) within 1 year of enrollment; 3. Concurrent immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy for duration of subject participation on study; 4. Concurrent steroid therapy; 5. Concurrent anticoagulant therapy (ASA≤ 325mg/day allowed); 6. Evidence of significant active infection (e.g., pneumonia, cellulitis, wound abscess, etc.) at time of study enrollment; 7. Patients with current evidence of large cell transformation (LCT) with aggressive disease at study entry (patients with a history of LCT are eligible if pathologic evidence at study entry indicates there is no presence of LCT); 8. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HTL V 1/2 infection, hepatitis B or hepatitis C (active, prior treatment, or both); 9. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been diseasefree for 2 years; 10. Significant cardiovascular disease (i.e. NYHA class 3 congestive heart failure; myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; unstable angina; coronary angioplasty with the past 6 months; uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias); 11. Any other medical history, including laboratory results, deemed by the investigator to be likely to interfere with subject's participation in the study, or to interfere with the interpretation of the results; 12. Subjects with electronic pacemakers or defibrillators are excluded from this study as the effect of electroporation on these devices is unknown; 13. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from the study as effects on the fetus are unknown and there may be a risk of increased fetal wastage.</criteria>
