	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that certain mutations in the individual cancer genomes will predict response to Everolimus therapy. To identify possible genetic mutations that affect tumor response to Everolimus the investigators will obtain sequence analysis of tumors from all patients that will be treated with Everolimus in this study. Moreover, the investigators performed a systematic review of the currently available data to identify mutations that could be predictive for increased mTOR activity in cancer cells. These mutations have been described to lead to mTOR activation but their predictive value for response to Everolimus therapy remains unclear. The investigators will use the data generated in the investigators own prospective treatment study and the data from literature to select patients for entry into a second part of this trial. In this part the investigators want to test the hypothesis that selecting patients based on their specific genetic mutations increases the likelihood of response.</brief_summary>
