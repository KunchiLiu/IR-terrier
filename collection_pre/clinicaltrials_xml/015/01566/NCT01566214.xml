	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to survey patients to learn about their beliefs and behaviors related to the management of heart disease and to discuss options for making healthy lifestyle changes. From the information the investigators get from patients, the investigators hope to develop better methods for taking care of patients who have heart disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vet-Harts Pilot Intervention for Veterans With Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a significant health threat among veterans. Compared to their civilian counterparts, veterans experience greater disability, reinfarction, and mortality following myocardial infarction (MI) and other acute coronary syndromes (ACS). High rates of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac risk behaviors (e.g., smoking) and low socioeconomic status (SES) further increase veterans' CHD-related morbidity and mortality. The proposed pilot project will establish the feasibility of a telehealth nursing intervention for veterans with CHD who are recovering from MI/ACS. The Veterans Heart Attack Representations Telehealth (Vet-HART) intervention is designed to promote adaptive conceptual change in veterans' beliefs (common sense models or representations) about CHD etiology and self-management and facilitate health behavior changes (e.g., smoking cessation, medication adherence, diet management, and increased physical activity). The long-term goal of this research program is to improve veterans' quality of life (QoL) and reduce their CHD-related morbidity/mortality. The proposed project is the requisite next step in attaining that goal.</detailed_description>
