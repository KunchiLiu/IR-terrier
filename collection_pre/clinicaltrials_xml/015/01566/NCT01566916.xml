	<brief_summary>This prospective, randomized study will study the 2 year survivorship and short term outcomes of a currently-used femoral stem: the Bone Preservation Tri-Lock femoral stem using two surgical approaches. The surgical approaches being studied are direct anterior and anterolateral. Implant survivorship, radiographic positioning, and functional outcomes will be compared. Subjects will be randomized to surgical approach and followed for a period of two years.</brief_summary>
