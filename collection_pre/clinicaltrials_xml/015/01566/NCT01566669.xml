	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Parecoxib on Morphine Patient-controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA) After Gynecologic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researches have showed that the use of epidural and spinal block resulted in significant reduction in morbidity and mortality after surgery. Moreover, appropriate pain management results in better outcomes. Opioids therapy is recommended as the first choice medication for the management of postoperative pain but is associated with a number of undesirable adverse effects. A multimodal therapy for providing postoperative analgesia has advantages over the use of opioids alone. The use of NSAIDs and opioids together often improves analgesia and reduces the need for opioids in the postoperative period. Often, the combination of COX-2 inhibitors with epidural analgesia is preferred. With epidural analgesia, addition of COX-2 inhibitors may improve the analgesia and decrease the undesirable side effects.</detailed_description>
