	<brief_summary>The normal values of a Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance (MII)-pH study can vary between ages, gender, race and different values of body mass index (BMI). This fact can cause new modifications in the normal values such as making new scales for different age groups or BMI groups. Our aim is to find the normal esophageal MII-pH parameter ranges in volunteers who never experienced reflux related symptoms and are in between the same ranges of age and BMI of our gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patient population.</brief_summary>
