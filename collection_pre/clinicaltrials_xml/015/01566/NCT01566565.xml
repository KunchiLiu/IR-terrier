	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, three period, two sequence, open-label, randomized, crossover study, with the primary objective of testing the safety and tolerability of combined oral doses of theophylline and bambuterol in healthy human subjects. The secondary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetic profiles of theophylline and bambuterol when administered alone or in combination. It is hypothesized that the combination of these drugs is generally safe, and that no drug interaction can be observed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, three period, two sequence, single-center, open-label, randomized, crossover study design. Periods I and II consist of the oral administration of either a single dose of theophylline or bambuterol alone, followed by a 7 day wash out interval. Subsequently, Period III consists of the simultaneous administration of both drugs. All subjects are to be confined to the Oslo University Hospital Research Unit throughout all treatment periods [Study Day 1, 7 and 14]. A sufficient number of healthy adult subjects will be consented in order to enroll 20 and complete 16 subjects who complete all three periods. Replacement of subjects is permitted, if necessary. Qualified subjects will be randomized into one of two sequences consisting of three Periods as indicated below: -------------Period 1-----Period 2-----Period 3 Sequence A: Treatment 1 Treatment 2 Treatment 3 Sequence B: Treatment 2 Treatment 1 Treatment 3 TREATMENTS: Treatment 1: Theophylline 300 mg. Treatment 2: Bambuterol 20 mg. Treatment 3: Theophylline 300 mg plus Bambuterol 20 mg. After completion of each treatment period, the subjects will proceed to the next period provided no Stopping Rules criteria have been met</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Subjects must give written informed consent to participation in the study prior to screening. Consent will be documented by the subject's dated signature 2. Subjects must be healthy nonsmoking adult male and female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 40 years, with a BMI of 1830 kg/m2 and weighing at least 68 kg. Subjects health status will be determined by the medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed at screening. 3. Subjects must be willing to fast a minimum of 8 hours prior to screening. 4. Subjects must be willing to abstain from alcohol and xanthinecontaining food and beverages (in example coffee, tea, and colas) from 48 hours before the time of admission to the clinical research inpatient unit and until last PK sample of drug given on day 1, 7 and 14 is drawn after 24 hours. 5. Subjects must be willing to remain in the clinical research unit continuously for the inpatient portion of the study from admission to discharge. 6. Women who are of nonchildbearing potential, must be: 1. Surgically sterile (removal of both ovaries and/ or uterus at least 12 months prior to dosing) 2. Naturally postmenopausal (spontaneous cessation of menses) for at least 24 consecutive months prior to dosing on Day 1, with an FSH level at screening of ≥ 40 mIU/mL. 7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours of receiving study drug and must agree to avoid pregnancy during study and for one month after the last dose of study drug. 8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to avoid pregnancy during study and for three months after the last dose of study drug. 9. Subjects must agree not to donate blood, plasma, platelets, or any other blood components during the study and for 4 weeks after the last dose. 10. Male subjects must agree not to donate sperm during the study and for 12 weeks after the last dose. Exclusion criteria Individuals meeting ANY ONE of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 1.
