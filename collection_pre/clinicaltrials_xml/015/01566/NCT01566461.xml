	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon (DCB) in comparison to any standard balloon for treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the superficial femoral artery and proximal popliteal artery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IN.PACT SFA Trial enrolled in 2 phases: IN.PACT SFA I and IN.PACT SFA II. The 150-patient IN.PACT SFA I phase is intended to support the second phase IN.PACT SFA II IDE trial with congruent design and protocol. Aggregate data from the two phases is intended to provide statistical power for the 12-month primary safety and effectiveness endpoints.</detailed_description>
