Subject is judged by the Investigator to be suitable for participation in a 12week clinical trial involving openlabel lurasidone treatment and is able to comply with the protocol in the opinion of the Investigator. Subject is considered by the investigator to be at imminent risk of suicide or injury to self, others, or property. Subject answers "yes" to "Suicidal Ideation" item 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) on the CSSRS at the extension baseline visit (Study Visit Number 42 in study D1050238). Subjects who answer "yes" to this question must be referred by the Investigator for appropriate followup evaluation and treatment. Subject tests positive for drugs of abuse or is suspected of current alcohol abuse at the extension baseline visit (Study Visit Number 42 in study D1050238). In the event a subject tests positive for cannabinoids, the Investigator will evaluate the subject's ability to abstain from cannabis during the study.</criteria>
