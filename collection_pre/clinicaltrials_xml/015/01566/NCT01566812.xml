	<brief_title>Effect of Breastfeeding Optimization on Early Vascular Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast feeding is suggested to give many benefits for babies and there are some initial prove that it might affect their future health, including the development of cardiovascular diseases. In Indonesia, breast feeding rates are very low, while there is a strong upsurge of cardiovascular disease. In this study, we propose to randomly allocate pregnant Indonesian women who plan to give breast feeding for no more than two months, to either care as usual or to a breast feeding empowerment program lasting to 6 months post partum. At the age of one year, all randomized offspring will undergo non-invasive echographic aortic vascular measurements and cardiovascular risk profiling. Measurements for assessing children's general health status will also be performed, including growth monitoring, repeated lung function test, and microbiomic sampling.</detailed_description>
