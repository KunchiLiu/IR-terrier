	<brief_summary>Currently no consensus exists on the optimal way to manage asymptomatic patients with celiac disease (CD) and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). The impact of dietary treatment as it pertains to clinically relevant outcomes such as metabolic control, bone mineralization and wellbeing will be evaluated in this study. A randomized controlled study longitudinally evaluating HbA1c and glycemic excursions using continuous glucose monitoring will rigorously determine the impact of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on blood glucose variability in patients with T1D.</brief_summary>
