	<brief_summary>If the treatment combining Motivation Enhancement, Reduction Counseling, Nicotine Replacement Therapy and Transtheoretical tailored interventions produces an increasing treatment trajectory, it will produce unprecedented impacts with unmotivated smokers specifically and population cessation generally. These recruitment and intervention strategies require limited resources from health care providers and could be readily disseminable to other health care systems for application with populations of smokers, especially unmotivated smokers who have been understudied and underserved.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Population Cessation Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal addresses major gaps in research for nicotine addiction treatments for entire populations of smokers and for the 80% who are not motivated to quit. Nicotine addiction is just like other drug addictions in terms of breaking the addiction cycle. Researchers and providers differ on whether treatment emphasis should be on clinician-based counseling, biologically-based medications, computer-based tailored communications or a combination of these. There is a lack of comparative research on population treatments to compare effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and enhancement of quality of life. Such comparative research would provide health care systems and providers with evidence on how to best serve entire populations of smokers, especially unmotivated smokers who are seriously underserved. This research will compare the four most highly recommended treatments: 1. Motivation Enhancement Therapy (MET) plus NRT; 2.Tailored communications based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), and 3. The combination of these treatments.</detailed_description>
