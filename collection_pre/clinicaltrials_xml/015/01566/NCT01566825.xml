	<detailed_description>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is considered critical to the consolidation of procedural memory - the memory of skills and habits. Many antidepressants strongly suppress REM sleep, however, and procedural memory consolidation has been shown to be impaired in depressed patients on antidepressant therapy. As a result, it is important to determine whether antidepressive therapy can lead to amnestic impairment. We thus investigate the effects of the anticholinergic antidepressant amitriptyline on sleep-dependent memory consolidation in 32 healthy men in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel-group study.</detailed_description>
