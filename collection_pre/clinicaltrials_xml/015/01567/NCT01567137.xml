	<brief_summary>Objective: To determine the accuracy of multi-functional magnetic resonance (MR) in detecting, localising and characterising satellite lesions in relation to an index breast tumour in order to improve definition of clinical target volume after local excision. Hypothesis: Pre-operative multi-functional MR has high sensitivity and specificity for localising unsuspected multifocal and multicentric lesions in women diagnosed with early breast cancer.</brief_summary>
