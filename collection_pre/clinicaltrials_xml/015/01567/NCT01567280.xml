	<brief_summary>The study design consists of a cross-sectional survey on the clinical characteristics of patients with asthma and their level of asthma control and current quality of life, and on a prospective evaluation of the rate of switch from the uncontrolled/poorly controlled condition to the status of controlled asthma. Asthma control will be based on the Asthma Control Questionnaire scoring system, that has been fully validated for use in both clinical practice and clinical trials and has strong discriminative properties which means that it can detect small differences between patients with different levels of asthma control and it is very sensitive to within-patient change in asthma control over time. Quality of life as a reflection of the control of the disease, will also be evaluated by means of the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scoring system.</brief_summary>
