	<brief_summary>Recovery of neurological deficits after stroke results from a reorganization of cortical activities, possibly through brain plasticity. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS-MagproR30) produces changes in cortical excitability, generates phenomena of neuroplasticity. Its use to improve function after stroke, particularly of the upper limb, was validated. The investigators propose to evaluate in a prospective pilot against placebo, the benefit of rTMS at low frequency (1Hz) on the unaffected hemisphere in the short and medium term, especially on walking function and spasticity in patients with sequelae of cerebral infarction in the MCA territory with gait disturbance and motor weakness of the upper limb.</brief_summary>
