	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of alisertib when given together with vorinostat in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or peripheral T-cell lymphoma that has come back. Alisertib and vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib in Combination With Vorinostat in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Recurrent Hodgkin Lymphoma, B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237 (alisertib) when given in combination with vorinostat and to select a dose and schedule for further testing (recommended Phase 2 dose: RP2D) in patients with lymphoid malignancies. II. To describe the toxicities of MLN8237 when given in combination with vorinostat on a 21-day schedule. III. To determine any clinical responses with MLN8237 in combination with vorinostat. IV. To compare the plasma pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 when given alone and in combination with vorinostat. V. To perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to determine aurora kinase A (AURKA) expression in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from the most recent available tumor specimens of patients. VI. To perform correlative studies for apoptosis and proliferation on bone marrow and lymph node specimens, where available, obtained from patients in the expanded cohort at RP2D. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib. Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 or days 1-3 and 8-10, and vorinostat PO BID on days 1-14 or days 1-5 and 8-12. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed lymphoid malignancy (like Hodgkin lymphoma or one of the mature B or Tcell nonHodgkin lymphomas as classified by World Health Organization [WHO]) for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective Patients must have measurable disease in two dimensions and &gt;= 2 cm is acceptable (or 1.5 cm if 0.5 slices are used, as in spiral computed tomography [CT] scans); lesions that are considered intrinsically nonmeasurable include the following: Bone lesions Leptomeningeal disease Ascites Pleural/pericardial effusion Inflammatory breast disease Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis Abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques Cystic lesions Lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area Patients must have had at least 1 prior systemic chemotherapy (not just steroids or local radiation); last chemotherapy or radiation must be at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment on this study; patients who decline other potentially curative therapy may be eligible; prior radiation therapy must not have been to more than 25% of the bone marrow;
