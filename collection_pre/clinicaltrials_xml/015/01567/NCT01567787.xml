	<brief_title>Proton Radiation Therapy for Spinal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proton therapy may provide the benefits of local control or palliation, while reducing the risk associated with photon radiation, by delivering therapeutic doses to a well-defined target area with significant reduction in the integral dose. A dosimetry comparison of protons and photons at the University of Florida Proton Therapy Institute confirmed the feasibility of proton irradiation of these tumors with less exposure of normal tissue to radiation than expected with photon techniques. This reduced radiation exposure to uninvolved normal tissues is expected to decrease the risk of radiation-induced second malignancies and neoplasms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>MPNSTs that are biopsypositive and resected, subtotally resected or unresectable. Symptomatic (pain, numbness, or weakness) NF1 neurofibromas that are biopsypositive and unresectable or subtotally resected. Symptomatic NF1 neurofibromas that are unbiopsied and PETnegative, if the patient refuses biopsy/surgery or is medically inoperable. Asymptomatic NF1 neurofibromas with radiologic progression after surgery. PETpositive, unbiopsied lesions in NF1 patients who refuse biopsy/surgery or are medically inoperable. Spinal instability. Metal stabilization hardware within the target area. Previously irradiated at this disease site. Spinal cord compression with complete loss of function.</criteria>
