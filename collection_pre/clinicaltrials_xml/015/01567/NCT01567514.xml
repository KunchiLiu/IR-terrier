	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of glass-ionomer cement (GIC) lining on risk of pulpal complications in deep occlusal cavities with resin-based restorations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Pulpal Complications in Posterior Resin Composite Restorations Without Glass-ionomer Cement Lining</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty three patients aged 18-30 years who had one or two deep occlusal carious lesions (â‰¥ 3 mm in depth) in molars were recruited. Dental caries was removed and the prepared cavity was restored with resin composite using one of two restorative procedures: (1) without GIC lining; (2) with (resin-modified) GIC lining. Restored teeth were evaluated for any pulpal complications (subjective symptoms, objective signs or loss of tooth vitality) at one month (baseline), one year and two years after restoration.</detailed_description>
