	<brief_summary>This was a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, two treatment arms, vehicle (cream base) -controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with moderate to severe eczema (defined by investigators global assessment (IGA) score greater than or equal to 3). Subjects were screened within 3 days prior to randomization. At the screen visit, subjects gave informed consent and were then assessed for health status and eligibility for inclusion in the study. At the baseline visit, subject eligibility was assessed for randomization (Day 0). Eligible subjects were randomised to Clobetasone Butyrate 0.05% Cream group or vehicle (cream base) group at the rate of 1:1. During the treatment phase, subjects returned to the sites in day 7 post-baseline visit for assessment of their disease status and eligibility to continue on the study. During the final visit, 14 days after the baseline, subjects returned to the study sites for assessment of their disease status before completing the study. In addition, the safety and tolerability of Clobetasone Butyrate 0.05% cream were also assessed through the whole trial.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with a diagnosis of eczema, fulfil the 3 follow items: 1) Erythema, papilla/water blister, Lichenification, skin damage with infiltration, 2) unknown reason, recurrent attacks; 3) itching in diseased skin Subjects must have body surface area (BSA) disease involvement of less than or equal to 10% as assessed by palm method Subject must present with moderate and above eczema as defined by a score greater than or equal to 3 using the investigators global assessment (IGA) of eczema severity. The subject presents with any systemic disorder or active skin disease (e.g. psoriasis) that would in any way confound interpretation of the study results or subjects who present with scars, moles, tattoos, body piercings, sunburn in the test area which could interfere with the assessment of lesions at screening. The subject has eczema restricted to the face, the feet or the hands only. The subject is indicated any antiinfectives drug for a current complication of overt bacterial, fungal and viral infection History of recent (&lt;1 month) active or presence of current superficial skin infections of viral aetiology such as herpes simplex, or varicella. The subject has been exposed to below therapy within the set timeframe: Topical agents administered in the diseased skin, including emollient 1 week; Systemic administration of antihistamine agents 2 week; Systemic administration of corticosteroid 4 week; Systemic administration of immunosuppressive drugs 4 week; UV therapy 4 week Foreseeable intensive ultraviolet (UV) exposure during the study (solar or artificial). Subjects must not be exposed to intense direct sunlight for long periods, and must not use skin tanning devices (e.g. sunbed) for the duration of the study. History of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, liver, neurological, renal or haematological abnormalities. History of allergy to components of test medications to be used in the study. History of anaphylaxis (a sudden, potentially lifethreatening systemic allergic reaction) to food, medications, insect venom, or latex.</criteria>
