	<brief_summary>This study follows the results of the COMPALICLAMP study (NCT00951392) where the investigators showed a differential expression of sirtuins protein isoforms, Sirt6, in muscle depending on the quality of aging. The investigators seek to confirm this difference in expression level of circulating leukocytes on a larger sample.</brief_summary>
