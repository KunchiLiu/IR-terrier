	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to compare the classical procedure with intrahepatic Glisson's approach for laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy. The validity, feasibility and limitations were assessed objectively through our clinical prospective study. The investigators expect laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy with intrahepatic Glisson's approach is safe, effective and feasible.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: China is the high incidence area of liver disease, some of which need to be treated by surgical liver resection. The development of minimal invasive techniques opened up a new situation for hepatectomy. Intrahepatic Glisson's approach and the classical procedure are the two major operation procedures used in laparoscopic hepatectomy. The intrahepatic Glisson's approach has the advantages of less intraoperative bleeding and shorter operation time in our experience and as previous studies. The investigators expect further comparison of the safety and efficacy through this prospective controlled study by using two kinds of operation procedures. Intervention: Classical procedure versus intrahepatic Glisson's approach: a prospective randomized study. Eighty patients with liver disease need undergo hepatectomy were selected and divided into intrahepatic Glisson's group and classical procedure group randomly, each group contains 40 cases. Total laparoscopic hepatectomy were performed, with the intrahepatic Glisson's approach or classical procedure respectively. Results: 1. Clinical data include: operation time, intraoperative blood loss, volume of blood transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function,long-term curative effect were collected and analysed. 2. Statistical method: groups t-test univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis were used.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with liver malignant or benign disease distributed in a segment, lobe or half liver, malignant tumor ≤5 cm, without rupture, bleeding, and liver metastases, benign tumor ≤15cm. 2. Liver function &gt; Childpugh level B, no severe biliary cirrhosis, ICG ≤ 15%, the residual liver volume and standard liver volume ratio ≥ 40%. The conditions of open hepatectomy were achieved 3. Age: Between 18 to 70 years 4. Patients with regional stones distributed in a segment, lobe or half liver, combined or not combined with extrahepatic biliary calculi, hepatic parenchymal atrophy or fibrosis in the lesion region 5. Patients with good general condition, the conditions of open Anatomical Hepatectomy were achieved 6. Other organ lesions and previous biliary tract operation is not the absolute exclusion criteria 7. Written informed consent 1. Patients with bad general condition or important organ lesions, liver resection could not be tolerated 2. Age:Younger than 18 or more than 70 years old 3. Malignant tumor recurrence within one month postoperation 4. Combined with severe liver atrophy hypertrophy syndrome, hepatic portal transposition or hilar biliary fibrosis / stenosis 5. Complicated case need to get emergency operation 6. Contraindication of laparoscopy: Combined with complicated acute cholangitis, repeated biliary tract operation, heavy intraabdominal adhesion, Trocar can not be placed in. Artificial pneumoperitoneum could not be tolerated</criteria>
