	<brief_title>Study of DC Vaccination Against Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment (surgery +radiation +chemotherapy), median survival for patients with newly diagnosed brain glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is about one year, for recurrent GBM is about 4 months. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a novel treatment strategy for glioma with improving patient survival. Usually, processed tumor antigens from the patient's own tumor or a peptide vaccine is capable of producing an anti-glioma response. Our previous experiment revealed that the CD133+ tumor stem-like cells associated antigens could elicit highly intensive immune response against human malignant glioma , and in phase I study, we have confirmed that DC vaccine loaded with glioma stem-like cells associated antigens against malignant glioma in recurrent patients was of safety . Autologous DCs will be obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each patient. Stem-like cells associated antigens (SAA) will be prepared with glioma stem-like cells that are harvested from patients with GBM and primary cultured and sorted flowcytometrically and then irradiated. Approximately 4 weeks will be required for vaccine production and the first vaccine administration. Each patient will receive an injection of DCs at his/her assigned dose once every week during the first 6 week. The dose of DCs is defined as 8~10×10^6. Clinical trials that utilize DCs for immunotherapy have demonstrated significant survival benefit for patients who exhibit robust immune responses against tumor cells. Unfortunately, at the present time the majority of clinical trials were in phase I that illustrated the safety. The efficacy of DCs against glioblastoma is still lack of sufficient randomized phase II study. According to our previous phase I study, here we designed this clinical trial in a triple-blind randomized manner to validate the efficacy of DCs vaccination. Recently , in order to re-estimate sample size and examine the efficacy of the DC vaccine . the interim analysis was performed by an independent data monitoring committee , this analysis contained: 11 cases in the placebo group and 11 cases in the control group. According to interim results : 86% of patients had achieved its primary endpoint events with minimal adverse events. However , our preliminary data is too unreliable to conclude anything further about the effency of DC vaccine: some variability need to be included in the analysis and balanced between two groups , such as the immune response, residual tumor volume, the molecular subtype of GBM . Accordingly , we made some modifications to the original plan, and are currently recruiting new participants.</detailed_description>
