	<brief_summary>This study, will take a subject's "T cells" and "teach" them to be able to recognize and attack the ovarian cancer cells. This is done by putting in a gene or genetic material that will change how a subject's T cells work and hopefully get them to attack and kill ovarian cancer cells. These new T cells are called "engineered T cells" because the new gene is causing them to become directed toward the ovarian cancer cells rather than their usual targets. These are also called "gene-modified T cells". For subjects who have the HLA A2 tissue-type marker, the T cells would be engineered to recognize a substance called "NY-ESO-1". After putting this new gene in T cells (a procedure called "gene therapy") the investigators will grow the cells in the laboratory and give these cells back to subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Antigen TCR-redirected T Cells for Ovarian Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label clinical trial. Patients with the HLA-A201, HLA-A205, and/or HLA-A206 allele and whose tumor expresses the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen will be eligible to receive NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. The trial is conducted entirely with outpatient procedures; however, patients may be hospitalized for the cytoreductive chemotherapy at the discretion of the investigator. Upon enrollment, patients will undergo leukapheresis for T cell collection, and their cells will be genetically engineered and expanded ex vivo. Seven days prior to receiving T-cells patients will undergo a cyclophosphamide conditioning regimen to potentiate the immunotherapy. The cell product will be infused as a single infusion (Day 0, typically Monday) to mitigate risks associated with unanticipated infusion reactions. Patients will be followed daily for the first week, weekly until 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks and then at 6 months and every 3 months until disease progression. Patients will undergo disease monitoring by MRI/CT scan (as appropriate for disease) at baseline, day 28, 8 weeks and 12 weeks, and months 6, and every 3 months until progression. Tumor biopsies will be taken at baseline, Week 8, and upon progression. In patients who have progressive disease following initial infusion but whose tumors continue to express NY-ESO-1, these patients may be eligible for a second infusion with redirected T cells. At disease progression, the interventional portion of the protocol ends and long term follow-up (LTFU) begins, in accordance with FDA regulations. LTFU occurs semiannually for up to 5 years post infusion and then annually thereafter for up to 15 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have a diagnosis of recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma with refractory or platinum resistant disease and/or have received ≥ 2 lines of chemotherapy Age ≥ 18 years of age No significant immunodeficiency Have been informed of other treatment options Must be HLA A*0201, HLAA*0205, and/or HLAA*0206 positive by high resolution testing. Patient's tumor must be positive by histological assay for NYESO1ᶜ²⁵⁹T, according to the screening algorithm as described in Section 3.3.1. Positive expression is defined as ≥ 50% of cells that are 2+ and/or 3+ by immunohistochemistry ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy of &gt; 4 months Prior therapies: 1. prior immunotherapy, or prior investigational agents should be washed out 4 weeks before apheresis and must be completed 4 weeks prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy. 2. monoclonal antibody therapy must be completed at least 6 weeks prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy 3. All previous cytotoxic chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, immune therapy should be washed out 3 weeks before apheresis and must be completed at least 3 weeks prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy. 4. Systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy should be washed out 2 weeks before apheresis and must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy 5. Biologic or other approved molecular targeted small molecule inhibitors should be washed out 1 week before apheresis and must be completed at least 1 week prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy. 6. Any grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity of previous therapy must have resolved to grade 2 or less prior to apheresis and any grade 3 or 4 toxicity must have resolved to grade 2 or less prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy. Must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Must have adequate venous access for apheresis. Women of childbearing potential are requested to use acceptable methods of birth control for the duration of the study and until persistence of the study drug is no longer detected in the patient. This may be a period of several years. Methods for acceptable birth control include: condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, and hormonal contraception. It is recommended that a combination of two methods be used. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Patient must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure. Currently receiving any other investigational agents Patients with active brain metastases. Patients with prior history of brain metastasis who have undergone local therapy (i.e. metastatectomy and/or radiation) and show no evidence of local recurrence or progression over the past 6 months are eligible History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cyclophosphamide or other agents used in the study Prior malignancy (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) within 18 months of study entry NOTE: Patients must be in complete remission from prior malignancy in order to be eligible to enter the study. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Use of chronic corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, or immunomodulating agents (e.g. interleukin2, interferonalpha or gamma, granulocyte colony stimulating factors, etc.) within 30 days prior to study entry. NOTE: Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not exclusionary. If subjects are prescribed a brief course of oral corticosteroids, the use should be limited to less than 7 days. Use of steroids before apheresis and immune assessment blood draws should be discouraged as it will affect white blood cell function. Active infection with HIV, HBV or HCV Receipt of an experimental vaccine within 2 months or in the opinion of the Investigator is responding to an experimental vaccine given within 6 months, or has received any previous gene therapy using an integrating vector History of severe autoimmune disease requiring steroids or other immunosuppressive treatments Lack of availability of a patient for immunological and clinical followup assessment Evidence or history of significant cardiac disease</criteria>
