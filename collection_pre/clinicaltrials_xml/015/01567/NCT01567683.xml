Negative urine pregnancy test (in female subjects with childbearing potential) 1. Pregnant or breastfeeding women 2.

Clinical history suggestive of intolerance, allergies or idiosyncrasies to one of the IMPs or to the ingredients of the products (butyl lactate, isopropyl myristate, propylene glycol, butylated hydroxy anisole) and suspected cross allergies 4. Known skin allergies 5. Known infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatitis) at the discretion of the investigator 6. Insulin dependent diabetes 7.

Within 1 week prior to Day 1 and during the whole study any systemic use of antihistamines 11. Within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 and during the entire study no change in any medication with common medical influence on skin perfusion (e.g. betablockers) 12. Within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 and during the entire trial any use of systemic medication likely to interfere with the trial purposes (e.g. immunemodulating therapy, corticosteroids, cytotoxics or immunosuppressants) 13. Within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and during the entire trial: any dermatological medication (drug or medical device) on treatment areas or SLS test field (exceptions: symptomatic treatment of discontinued areas with topical treatments as decided by the investigator) 14. Use of cosmetic product (e.g. creams, moisturizers) in the treatment areas (i.e. inner forearms) or the SLS test field within 5 days prior to Day 1 and throughout the treatment phase (Day 1 to Day 22) 15. Intensive UVlight exposure (e.g. solarium visits) within 4 weeks before Day 1 as well as during the study 16. Moles, tattoos, pigmentation or scars in the application areas (arms) that would influence the visual scoring 17.
