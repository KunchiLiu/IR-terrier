	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of two different exercise programs for the reduction of pain and disability in a specific subgroup of NSLBP patients and aims to investigate the additive effect of hip stabilization exercises. The investigators hypothesize that the combined local (segmental) stabilizer and hip stabilizer program (T2) will be more effective in reducing pain and disability in NSLBP patients compared to the local (segmental) stabilizer program (T1).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objective of this study is to measure the changes in lumbopelvic and hip mechanics for both treatment groups following completion of the exercise programs. We hypothesize that there will be differences observed between groups following the 6wk rehabilitation programs, and that only the group completing the combined local (segmental) stabilizer and hip stabilizer strengthening program (T2) will demonstrate significant differences in mechanics compared to baseline testing.</detailed_description>
