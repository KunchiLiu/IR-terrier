	<brief_summary>It is believed, that Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drug (NSAID) drugs slows bone healing, but the knowledge is based only on animal studies, and the results are automatically raised for the people. Many patients with bone fracture must therefore avoid the formerly so popular and good painkillers, although no clinical trial evidence is, that this medicine is really harmful for patients with fractures. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether these drugs slows bone healing, and what the relationship is between various bone studies - DEXA scanning, biochemical bone marker tests, radiographic controls and tissue examination of newly formed bone under a microscope. How sensitive and specific, each of the above study methods? If they are just as sensitive, the cheapest of them recommended as a routine investigation on suspicion of bone effects. Furthermore, to compare the benefit (pain-relieving effect, influence on rehabilitation) of these drugs and their possible harmful side effects (affected and delayed bone healing). The expectation is that the study may contribute to increased knowledge about NSAIDs effect do pain management, rehabilitation and the entire treatment process significantly easier and safer, so that patients recover faster and return to usual activities.</brief_summary>
