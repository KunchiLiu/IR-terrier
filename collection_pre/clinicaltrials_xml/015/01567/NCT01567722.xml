	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and studying tissue samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies collecting tissue samples from patients with HIV-related malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collecting and Studying Tissue Samples From Patients With HIV-Associated Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To obtain high-quality, clinically annotated tissue from patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 malignancy. - To study clinical, genetic, and immunologic parameters that have prognostic significance and/or are involved in the initiation and progression of HIV-1 malignancies, including complete genomic sequence determination of HIV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, lung cancer, anal cancer, and cervical cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo tumor, lymph node, bone marrow, or skin biopsy, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells collection. Samples are submitted to the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) Biorepository and transferred to the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR). Samples are then analyzed by the Genome Science Center of British Columbia (GSC-BC) and the HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP) for full genomic sequencing analysis that may include, but are not limited to, array-based gene expression profiling, comparative genome hybridization, and single nucleotide polymorphism studies by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular studies. Patients' clinical data, demographics, and treatment given are also collected prospectively in order to record treatment outcome and toxicity. Patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years for data-reporting purposes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Participants must have a diagnosis of a malignancy or clinical findings suggestive of a possible HIVassociated malignancy of one of three types: Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma Nonsmall cell lung malignancy Cervical cancer The presence of any of the following conditions will exclude a participant from study enrollment: Absence of sufficient diagnostic tumorbiopsy tissue material to meet the protocol requirements for baseline specimen submission (minimum specimen size of 10 x 10 x 2 mm); repeat tumor biopsy will not be performed solely to meet the protocol specimencollection requirements Participants whose biopsies, for the purpose of this protocol, show a diagnosis of anal intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Prior treatment for the study malignancy (including neoadjuvants), since treatment can affect the mutational spectra of tumors HIV infection based on serologic documentation of HIV infection at any time prior to study entry, as evidenced by positive enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), positive western blot, or any other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved (licensed) HIV test; alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician has documented that the patient has HIV based on prior ELISA and western blot, or other approved diagnostic tests PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Participants must be willing and able to sign an IRBapproved informed consent document PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics</criteria>
