	<brief_title>A Phase I/II, Open-label Study of Ofatumumab Added to Chlorambucil in Previously Untreated Japanese Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label study to evaluate tolerability, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil in Japanese patients with previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Ofatumumab will be infused intravenously at Day 1 (300 mg) and Day 8 (1000 mg) in the first 28-day cycle, followed by infusions of 1000 mg at the first day of each 28-day cycle. Chlorambucil will be given 10 mg/m2 at Day 1-7 in each 28-day cycle. The primary objectives are to evaluate tolerability and overall response rate (ORR) of ofatumumab with chlorambucil for previously untreated (frontline) CLL. Secondary objectives include to evaluate complete remission (CR) rate, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to response, duration of response, time to next therapy, incidence and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events, incidences of grade 3 and 4 infections and myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), and pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab and chlorambucil.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of CLL defined by : Circulating B lymphocytes ≥5,000 /μL AND Flow cytometry confirmation of immunophenotype with CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23 prior to Visit 2. Considered inappropriate for fludarabinebased therapy Active disease and indication for treatment based on modified NCIWG guidelines defined by presenting at least any one of the following conditions : Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by development or worsening of anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Massive (i.e. at least 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly. Massive nodes (i.e. at least 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy. Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than 50% over a two month period or an lymphocyte doubling time of less than 6 months. A minimum of any one of the following diseaserelated symptoms must be present : a) Unintentional Weight loss ≥ 10% within the previous six months ; b) Fevers &gt;38.0 degree C for ≥ 2 weeks without evidence of infection ; or c) Night sweats for more than 1 month without evidence of infection. Not been previously treated for CLL (prior autoimmune hemolytic anemia treatment permitted). ECOG Performance Status of 02. Life expectancy of at least 6 months, in the opinion of the investigator. Age ≥ 20 years. Signed written informed consent prior to performing any studyspecific procedures. Patients possible to stay at the trial site for at least two days (the day of the first infusion and a subsequent day). Prior immuno or chemotherapy for CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with any agent except corticosteroids used to treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Previous autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Active autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) requiring corticosteroid therapy &gt; 100 mg/day equivalent to hydrocortisone, or chemotherapy. Known transformation of CLL (e.g. Richter). Known CNS involvement of CLL. Chronic or current active infectious disease requiring systemic antibiotics, antifungal, or antiviral treatment such as, but not limited to, chronic renal infection, chronic chest infection with bronchiectasis, tuberculosis and active Hepatitis C. Other past or current malignancy. Subjects who have been free of malignancy for at least 5 years, or have a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer, or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible. Clinically significant cardiac disease including unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening (Visit 1), congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia requiring therapy, with the exception of extra systoles or minor conduction abnormalities. History of significant cerebrovascular disease or event with significant symptoms or sequelae*. Glucocorticoid use, unless given in doses ≤ 100 mg/day hydrocortisone (or equivalent dose of other glucocorticoid) for &lt;7 days for exacerbations other than CLL (e.g. asthma). Known HIV positive. Positive serology for Hepatitis B (HB) defined as a positive test for HBsAg. In addition, if negative for HBsAg but HBcAb and/or HBsAb positive, an HBV DNA test will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded. Screening laboratory values : Creatinine &gt; 2.0 times upper normal limit (unless normal creatinine clearance). Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 times upper normal limit (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome). Alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt; 3.0 times upper normal limit. Previous treatment or known or suspected hypersensitivity to ofatumumab that in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor is a contraindication to their participation in the present study. Treatment with any known nonmarketed drug substance or experimental therapy within 5 terminal half lives or 4 weeks prior to Visit 1, whichever is longer, treatment with any antiCD20 monoclonal antibody within 3 months of Visit 1, or participation in any other interventional clinical study. Note: Participation in any other interventional clinical study after disease progression during post PDfollowup is permitted. Known or suspected inability to comply with study protocol. Lactating women, women with a positive pregnancy test at Visit 1 or women (of childbearing potential) as well as men with partners of childbearing potential, who are not willing to use adequate contraception from study start through one year following last treatment dose. Adequate contraception is defined as oral hormonal birth control, intrauterine device, male partner sterilization (if male partner is sole partner for that subject) and the double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).</criteria>
