	<brief_summary>An exploratory First Time in Human (FTIH) study investigating the pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of GSK2434735 administered as a single low dose in healthy male subjects</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Dose Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study of GSK2434735 in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interleukin-13 (IL-13) and IL-4 are mediators in the pathogenesis of established asthmatic disease. GSK2434735 is a bispecific antibody to IL-13 and IL-4. The purpose of this open label, sequential cohort, exploratory First Time in Human (FTIH) study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of GSK2434735 after a single low intravenous or subcutaneous dose in healthy male volunteers, and to assess if the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters can be scaled from monkey to man. In addition, the safety and tolerability will be monitored and the study will assess if antibodies are generated to GSK2434735.</detailed_description>
