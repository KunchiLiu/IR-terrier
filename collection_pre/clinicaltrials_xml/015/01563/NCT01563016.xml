	<brief_summary>The research aims to investigate the relationship between self-control ability and blood glucose level in schizophrenic patients. The main purpose of the present study is to explore whether the close relationship of blood glucose and self-regulatory strength observed in healthy individuals, is applicable to schizophrenic patients. More specifically, the current study aims - to investigate whether the exertion of self-control reduces blood glucose, - to examine whether low level of blood glucose deteriorates subsequent self-control performances - to examine whether restoring the glucose level eliminates these impairments, in schizophrenic patients.</brief_summary>
