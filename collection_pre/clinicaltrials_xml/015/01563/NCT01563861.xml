	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies genes in samples from patients with limited and advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9704-S0014-S0313A Studying Genes in Samples From Patients With Limited or Advanced Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the proportion of the cell of origin subtypes (germinal center B-cell-like [GCB] vs non-GCB) and expression levels of prognostic genes previously identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in patient biopsy samples from SWOG trials of limited- and advanced-stage DLBCL, and to assess the association between the results and progression-free survival (PFS). - To assess the association between these marker results and overall survival (OS). OUTLINE: Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue are analyzed for gene expression profile by quantitative nuclease protection assay (qNPA) and immunohistochemical analyses. Results are then compared with each patient's progression-free survival and overall survival.</detailed_description>
