	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, 3-arm, phase II study with a single-stage design in each arm. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and safety of Everolimus or Pasireotide LAR alone or in combination in adult patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) neuroendocrine carcinoma (typical and atypical) of the lung and thymus. It is expected that a total of 120 patients with 40 patients in each arm will be enrolled into this study. Patients with disease control (SD or better) in the combination arm or monotherapy with pasireotide LAR and everolimus and who are not experiencing unacceptable toxicity are permitted to continue treatment after the 12 month treatment period in the extension phase of the study. Primary Endpoint is defined as the proportion of patients who are progression-free at 9 months according to RECIST V 1.1</brief_summary>
