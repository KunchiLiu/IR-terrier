	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of multiple, ascending doses of ABT-267 (also known as ombitasvir) administered as two-day monotherapy followed by ABT-267 in combination therapy with other direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) ABT-450 with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) plus ribavirin (RBV) in patients with chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis.</brief_summary>

Females who are or plan to become pregnant or breastfeeding or males whose partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Recent history of drug or alcohol abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol. Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen or antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. Any current or past clinical evidence of cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, esophageal varices), or a liver biopsy or FibroTest/aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) or FibroScan® showing cirrhosis or extensive bridging fibrosis.</criteria>
