	<brief_summary>By using a Rapid Cardiac Evaluation (RACE) pathway in the Emergency Department (ED), the investigators can effectively reduce ED wait times and ED length of stay by decreasing overall hospital admissions and telemetry admissions. In addition, the investigators hypothesize a decrease in mortality of those patients admitted for cardiac evaluation by increasing the patient to health care provider ratio.</brief_summary>
