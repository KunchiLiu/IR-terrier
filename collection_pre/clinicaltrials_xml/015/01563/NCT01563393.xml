	<brief_summary>Children hospitalized due to an acute disease may suffer from acute malnutrition or chronic malnutrition caused by chronic diseases. According to various studies, about 10-20% of those admitted to hospitals in different countries suffer from malnutrition or are at risk of malnutrition. Several pediatric nutritional screening tools were recently published. However, there is no conventional pediatric nutritional screening tool and the effect of the recently published tools on further nutritional risk and the behavior of the attending staff are unclear. Study objectives: to test the validity and reliability of the STAMP nutritional screening tool (Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics) among children hospitalized in a pediatric medical center and to examine the effect of the STAMP tool use on the attitude of the medical staff to the patient nutritional status. An additional objective is to compare the skill of a nurse versus a dietician in performing the evaluation according to STAMP. Methods: for the validation, 50 children between 1 and 17 years of age from internal medicine and surgical departments will undergo a complete evaluation by an investigating dietician and assessment by the STAMP tool in order to determine the extent of the nutritional risk on a numerical scale. All the children will undergo STAMP evaluation by a nurse and another investigating dietician as well. In order to examine the effect of the tool on the medical staff awareness, 300 files of hospitalized children will be tested: 150 files at the beginning of the study and prior to using the tool and 150 after 6 months at the same ages and in the same departments. The effect of using the STAMP questionnaire will be examined according to the results of data collection from the beginning of the study and after 6 months. Questionnaire use, recording of appropriate diagnoses, collection of blood tests demonstrating the nutritional status, weight, height and waist circumference measurements will be obtained from the patients' medical files.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>patients hospitalized during the study, patients hospitalized for more than 24 hours. The children will be enrolled from 3 internal medicine and surgical departments, children's parents will give their consent and will be able to understand and sign the consent forms children &lt; 1 year of age, children &gt; 17 years of age, children hospitalized for less than 24 hours, children in the intensive care unit or following hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Statistical analysis for STAMP validation will be performed using Kappa (K) test. Chi square test will be used in order to calculate the effect of STAMP use</criteria>
