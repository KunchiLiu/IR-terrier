	<brief_summary>Adequate bowel preparation is of critical importance for colonoscopy. Particularly among hospitalized patients, inadequate bowel preparation for colonoscopy may arise due to patient intolerance to prescribed laxative regimen, elderly population, and co-existing conditions that impair the ability to ingest a large-volume laxative regimen. Improvements in bowel preparation for colonoscopy in hospitalized patients would likely improve patient care and reduce hospital costs. The purpose of this study is to determine if administering a portion of the bowel purgative via EGD could improve colonoscopy preparation in hospitalized patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EGD-assisted Bowel Preparation for Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized controlled trial in hospitalized patients, patients in whom colonoscopy was anticipated the day following EGD were consented and randomized to either standard prep by mouth (split-dose PEG) or intervention group (instillation of the first 2 liters of Nulytely solution through the channel of the endoscope into the duodenal bulb, then continue standard prep). Data is collected on quality of prep and patient satisfaction in both groups.</detailed_description>
