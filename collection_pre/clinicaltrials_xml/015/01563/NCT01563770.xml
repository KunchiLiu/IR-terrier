	<brief_summary>Rationale: Extracts of the plant Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) have been used as traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, such as angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. Several preclinical studies point towards promising effects of Danshen on risk factors of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Objective: Our primary objective is to determine the effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza extract (Danshen) on hyperlipidemia. Secondary objective is to investigate the effect of Danshen on hypertension. Further objectives are to determine its effect on endothelial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, hemostasis and hemorheology, and on insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
