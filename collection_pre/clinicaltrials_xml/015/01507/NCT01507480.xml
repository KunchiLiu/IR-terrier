	<brief_summary>Antiangiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab, are a new treatment strategy in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). Its systemic administration in patients with HHT improves liver damage-related symptoms and epistaxis (cases reported and on-going study-ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier #NCT00843440-). To limit the systemic adverse effects of bevacizumab and to ease administration, a local administration seems suitable. A clinical case recently showed the benefits of bevacizumab nasal spray in these patients. Its results were confirmed in a characterization study on bevacizumab transport through porcine nasal mucosa (in press). It seems necessary to assess the tolerance and efficacy of bevacizumab nasal spray in humans for the treatment of epistaxis in HHT with a prospective phase 1 study. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the tolerance of increasing doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in patients with HHT-related epistaxis. This phase-1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monocentric study is to be carried out sequentially (dose escalation) on 5 groups of 8 patients. Each group is made up of 6 verum and 2 placebos.</brief_summary>
