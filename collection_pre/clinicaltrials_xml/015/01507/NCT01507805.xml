	<brief_title>Electroacupuncture Preconditioning on Geriatric Noncardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: With the development of surgical techniques, more and more people with coronary heart disease underwent non-cardiac surgery, which include abdominal, urologic, orthopedic surgeries. Due to the vulnerable heart function, geriatric patients suffer high incidence of cardiovascular events during the peri-operative period. Some studies found that EA preconditioning have a protective effect for the patients underwent Cardiac surgery. But non one addresses the effects of EA preconditioning on the outcomes of the patients with coronary heart disease who undergo non-cardiac surgery. DESIGNING: The patients with coronary heart disease who will receive abdominal surgery will be randomly assigned into EA preconditioning group and control group. The patients in EA preconditioning group was treated at bilateral Neiguan (PC 6)，Lieque (LU 7) and Yunmen (LU 2) with electrical stimulation (5—30 Hz，2．34—6．24 mA，30 min) for 5 consecutive days before surgery．Before operation and before surgery, after surgery, 24h, 72h post surgery, all patients will be subjected to test the serum level of c-reactive protein and Troponin I. The EEG and heart ultrasonic exam will be used to evaluate the condition and function of heart before and after surgery.</detailed_description>
