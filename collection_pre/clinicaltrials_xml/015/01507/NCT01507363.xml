	<brief_title>Analgesic Effect of Gabapentin in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain is a major problem after TKA. Studies indicate that Gabapentin may reduce acute postoperative pain. However, the optimal dose is unknown and there is constant controversy on analgesic versus side-effects. The investigators therefore investigate the effect of Gabapentin as a perioperative analgesic in a dose-related manner and with a sample-size allowing evaluation of side-effects.</detailed_description>
