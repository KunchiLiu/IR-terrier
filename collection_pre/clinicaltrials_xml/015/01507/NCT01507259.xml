	<brief_summary>The popularity of chocolate can largely be attributed to its mood elevating properties, research shows that it contains antioxidants that also provide physical health benefits. Dark chocolate, in particular, contains high levels of an antioxidant called epicatechin, which is known to cause changes in blood vessels by relaxing them and increasing blood flow. Little is know about the immediate effects of chocolate consumption, or the differences between milk and dark chocolate with regards to these effects. The project will investigate the effect of a single bar of dark or milk chocolate upon blood flow to the brain, using simple ultrasound tests.</brief_summary>
