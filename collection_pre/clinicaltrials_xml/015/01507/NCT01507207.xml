	<brief_summary>Type I laryngeal cleft evaluation and treatment in the pediatric population is an emerging science. The largest published series of pediatric patients with type I laryngeal clefts shows conflicting evidence in terms of outcomes, resolution of dysphagia and method of treatment. A comparison of quality of life outcomes before and after injection laryngoplasty has not been carried out. The investigators hypothesize that injection laryngoplasty significantly improves symptoms and quality of life related to dysphagia in a pediatric population with laryngeal clefts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pediatric Dysphagia Outcomes After Injection Laryngoplasty for Type I Laryngeal Cleft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dysphagia with aspiration is a common disorder in the pediatric population. Aspiration with feeds is diagnosed on modified barium swallow studies and patients are referred to the pediatric otolaryngologist to assess the airway for a possible laryngeal cleft. Type I laryngeal cleft can lead to dysphagia and aspiration in young children. However, diagnosis of type I laryngeal cleft can be difficult and subjective at microlaryngoscopy in the operating room. Type I laryngeal cleft evaluation and treatment in the pediatric population is an emerging science. The largest published series of pediatric patients with type I laryngeal clefts shows conflicting evidence in terms of outcomes, resolution of dysphagia and method of treatment. It is generally recommended to do an injection laryngoplasty at the time of airway evaluation as a diagnostic and therapeutic measure. Improvement in symptoms supports the diagnosis and can serve as either definitive treatment with repeated injections or as a preemptive treatment in preparation for surgical repair. A comparison of quality of life outcomes before and after injection laryngoplasty has not been carried out. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine if injection laryngoplasty improves symptoms and quality of life related to dysphagia in a pediatric population with laryngeal clefts.</detailed_description>
