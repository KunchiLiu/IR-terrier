	<brief_summary>This randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of RO5137382 (GC33) in previously treated patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients will be stratified according to the level of GPC-3 expression in tumors and randomized to receive either RO5137382 (1600 mg intravenously) or placebo on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and every 2 weeks thereafter. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
