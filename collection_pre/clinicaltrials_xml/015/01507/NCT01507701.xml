	<brief_summary>The aim of this pilot study for the NorCAPITAL trial is to investigate the feasibility and safety of the drug clonidine in adolescent chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Specifically, the investigators wanted to assess appropriate dosage in relation to a) plasma concentration levels of clonidine, b) orthostatic cardiovascular responses (the pulse and blood pressure responses when rising up), and c) reports of possible adverse effects. A possible beneficial effect of clonidine in adolescent CFS will be investigated in NorCAPITAL, which is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial.</brief_summary>
