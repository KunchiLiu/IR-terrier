	<brief_summary>Ceftazidime is a broad spectrum cephalosporin with high activity against a variety of Gram-negative pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An open-label study of intravenous ceftazidime pharmacokinetics will be performed in patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis at Northwestern Memorial Hospital to determine the clearance of ceftazidime in high flux hemodialysis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible patients are male or female adults ≥18 years of age with an expected hospital stay of at least 48 hours, who have endstage renal disease and been receiving intermittent hemodialysis for at least 90 days. Eligible patients will additionally have either central or peripheral intravenous access, and will already be prescribed ceftazidime per their primary providers. Written informed consent in a form approved by Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Northwestern University Institutional Review Board, and Midwestern University Institutional Review Board will be completed by the patient prior to enrollment.
