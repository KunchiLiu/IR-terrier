	<brief_summary>Childhood bipolar disorder- not otherwise specified (BP-NOS) was originally considered to be a milder version of bipolar disorder (BD). Research now indicates that BP-NOS is a highly impairing condition. No pharmacologic treatment guidelines exist for BP-NOS. Available evidence-based pharmacotherapy guidelines are for BP1; efficacious medications are, unfortunately, associated with significant risk for adverse events (Kowatch et al, 2005; 2009). Previous research on diet and nutrition suggests that omega-3 (Ω3) fatty acids have a beneficial effect on mood, which might provide either a primary or adjunctive treatment with a more favorable risk:benefit ratio for children suffering from BP-NOS than currently available pharmacologic interventions. Psychoeducational psychotherapy (PEP) also has shown promise in treating bipolar spectrum disorders in children aged 8-12 (Fristad, 2006; Fristad, Verducci, Walters, &amp; Young, 2009); its efficacy in treating BP-NOS specifically has not been determined. The current study compares Ω3, PEP, and their combination to a placebo supplement and active monitoring (AM) in a 12-week trial of 60 children with BP-NOS (15 each with Ω3, Ω3 plus PEP, PEP, and placebo, all with active monitoring). Primary goals are to determine: 1) feasibility of a) recruiting 60 participants in 2 years; b) participant retention over a 12-week trial; and 2) placebo-controlled effect sizes for Ω3, PEP, and combination treatment on manic and depressive symptoms. Secondary goals are to explore response curves over time, mediators and moderators, treatment response across a broad array of outcome variables, adherence to treatment, impact on physiologic parameters often worsened by mood stabilizing medications, and experience of side-effects in participants receiving Ω3 and/or PEP. Comparisons of results to a parallel study of children with depression with identical design will maximize knowledge gained. This pilot study of Ω3, PEP, and combined treatment will provide evidence about whether a larger trial is feasible and justified.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 and Therapy Study for Childhood Bipolar Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research indicates BP-NOS is a highly impairing condition comparable to the other bipolar spectrum disorders. Considerable gains have been made recently in understanding BP-NOS, in large part by research utilizing clear operational definitions for BP-NOS. However, clinical trials have focused on youth with Bipolar Disorder- Type I (BP1). No clinical guidelines exist for the treatment of BP-NOS. No pharmacologic treatment guidelines exist for BP-NOS. Available evidence-based pharmacotherapy guidelines are for BP1 and are associated with significant risk for adverse events. Additionally, while anti-manic agents have been identified, no study has demonstrated an effective anti-depressant agent for youth with bipolar depression. A review of weight gain and metabolic side effects of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications in 19 studies of pediatric bipolar patients found significant and clinically relevant weight increases in 18 trials. Clinical trials of depression and bipolar disorders in children and adolescents show approximately 20%-25% of participants dropped out of short-term psychotropic medication treatment trials. Additionally, a recent study of an anticonvulsant mood stabilizer in children failed to show any superiority to placebo. Previous research on diet and nutrition suggests that omega-3 (Ω3) fatty acids have a beneficial effect on mood with little evidence of negative side-effects or deleterious drug interactions, suggesting Ω3 might function as either a primary or adjunctive treatment with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio for children suffering from BP than currently available pharmacologic interventions.Psychoeducational psychotherapy (PEP) also has shown promise in treating bipolar spectrum disorders in children aged 8-12 its efficacy in treating BP-NOS specifically has not been determined. The current study compares Ω3, PEP, and their combination to a placebo supplement, all with active monitoring (AM) in a 12-week trial of 60 children with BP-NOS (15 each with Ω3, Ω3 plus PEP, PEP, and placebo.
