	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate simple tests of physical function in hospitalised patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to assess whether they can predict future hospital readmission. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a simple test of standing balance, usual walking speed (4-metre gait speed) and ability to stand from a chair, which reflects global physical functioning and frailty. We hypothesise that the SPPB or 4-metre gait speed can predict future hospital readmissions.</brief_summary>
