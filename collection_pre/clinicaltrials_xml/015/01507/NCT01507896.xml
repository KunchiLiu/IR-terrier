	<criteria>Main Participant and/or legal representative has/have voluntarily provided signed informed consent. Participant has severe (FIX level &lt; 1%) or moderately severe (FIX level 12%) hemophilia B (based on the one stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay), as tested at screening at the central laboratory. Participant requires surgery Participant has previously been treated with plasmaderived and/or recombinant FIX concentrate(s) for a minimum of 150 exposure days Participant has no evidence of a history of FIX inhibitors Participant is immunocompetent as evidenced by a CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3. Participant is human immunodeficiency (HIV) negative or is HIV+ with a viral load &lt; 200 particles/μL ~ &lt; 400,000 copies/mL. Main Participant has a history of FIX inhibitors with a titer ≥ 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU) (as determined by the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay or the assay employed in the respective local laboratory) at any time prior to screening. Participant has a detectable FIX inhibitor at screening, with a titer ≥0.6 Bethesda Units (BU) as determined by the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay in the central laboratory. Participant has a history of allergic reaction or evidence of an ongoing or recent thrombotic disease, fibrinolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Known hypersensitivity to hamster proteins or recombinant furin. Evidence of an ongoing or recent thrombotic disease, fibrinolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Abnormal renal function Severe chronic liver disease Active hepatic disease with ALT or AST levels &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal. Diagnosis of an iherited or acquired hemostatic defect other than hemophilia B. Platelet count &lt; 100,000/mL.</criteria>
