	<brief_summary>The objectives of the study are: 1. To determine the prevalence of externalized conductors at enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads 2. To determine the prevalence of other visual lead anomalies (fracture, subclavian crush, kink, broken filars on a shocking coil and other irregularities) by each subcategory at enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads 3. To determine the prevalence of electrical dysfunction at enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads 4. To determine the incidence of externalized conductors after enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads 5. To determine the incidence of other visual lead anomalies by each subcategory after enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads 6. To determine the incidence of electrical dysfunction after enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads. 7. To evaluate the 30-day adverse event rate associated with lead revision procedures (include lead extractions or abandonments with or without lead replacement) in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex®, and Durata® families of leads 8. To determine the prevalence of "other insulation anomalies" in "returned leads" for Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex®, and Durata® families of leads. "Other insulation anomalies" include any of the following: - Internal abrasion short under RV shock coil - Internal abrasion short under SVC shock coil - Exposed conductors defined as a breach of the outer insulation - Breach of the internal silicone lumen tubing, but the conductor cable is contained within the lead body diameter.</brief_summary>
