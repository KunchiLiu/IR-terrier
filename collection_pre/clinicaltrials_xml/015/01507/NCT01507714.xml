	<detailed_description>Urinary stress incontinence is defined as leakage of urine during stress (cough, lough, sneezing, coitus, heavy lifting, physical activity). Urinary stress incontinence is a health problem with social, economic and psychological consequences. The appearance of Urinary stress incontinence post vaginal wall prolapse repair is a known phenomena. Part of the cases relate to pre-surgical occult Urinary stress incontinence which has been asymptomatic, and part of the cases relate to de-novo urinary stress incontinence post surgery. Latest studies have demonstrated 11-22% rate of post surgical urinary stress incontinence. The CARE study has examined the efficacy of preventive BURCH RETROPUBIC URETHROPEXY among women who underwent abdominal sacrocolpopexy. According to this study, the BURCH procedure reduced the rate of post surgery urinary stress incontinence. The authors recommend to offer those women the preventive surgery. Those results cannot be relied on when considering vaginal wall repair by the vaginal approach. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of transobturator tension free vaginal tape (TVT-O) among women who intend to undergo vaginal wall repair by a vaginal approach.</detailed_description>
