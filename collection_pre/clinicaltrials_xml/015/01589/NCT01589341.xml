	<brief_summary>This research studies chromosomes in samples from younger patients with neuroblastoma. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Chromosomes in Samples From Younger Patients With Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the impact on overall survival of patients with non-MYCN neuroblastoma below 18 months of age as compared to neuroblastoma patients above 18 months of age. OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for segmental chromosome aberrations by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique. The following genomic regions are being studied: 1p, 1q, 3p, 4p, 7q, 9p, 11q, and 17q, as are the copy numbers of MYCN, NAG, DDX1, and ALK genes.</detailed_description>
