	<brief_summary>The postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the major complication of the delivery. In clinical practice, if after giving birth, the placenta is not expelled naturally, an active management should be triggered. Escalating therapy after obstetric maneuvers (placenta, uterus, examination of the birth canal), begins with uterotonic treatments for invasive treatments lead to embolization, vessel ligation and hysterectomy. However, the morbidity of these techniques and the desire to preserve fertility required to devise new therapeutic solutions, which have recently led to the development of an innovative medical device intrauterine hemostasis. The postpartum haemorrhage are mainly the result of weak and bleeding from the surface corresponds to the placental insertion, which is no longer localized. With the innovative medical device, our main hypothesis is that the uterine walls will append to the walls of the cup after depressurization of the latter. The actuation of the suction cup will lead to aspiration of all sides of the uterus (it is mostly the anterior and posterior that are important). The suction cup is flexible to adapt to the size of the uterus in order to be placed and removed easily from the uterine cavity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proof of Concept Study of a Sucker Hemostatic Intra Uterine in Postpartum Hemorrhage After Abruptio Placenta Assisted</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, as a first pass in Human, innovative medical device not CE marked, we did not aim to show control of the bleeding stops in the case of PPH but to prove, in a clinical situation with no foreseeable risk to the volunteers included (volunteers who have given birth without placental abruption after 30 minutes despite the directed delivery), proof of concept of using this system in these women that creates a vacuum in the Intra uterine Haemostatic vacuum and thus a joining of the walls of the uterus. This first step seems essential in order to effectively implement this medical device with serenity in emergency situations of PPH.</detailed_description>
