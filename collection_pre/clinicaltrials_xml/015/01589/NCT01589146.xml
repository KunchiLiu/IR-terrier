	<brief_summary>Overall, only limited evidence exists regarding the clinical benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis after laparoscopic surgery for cancer. Four studies reported on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after laparoscopic surgery for cancer. These studies differ concerning study design, site of cancer, regimens for antithrombotic prophylaxis and reported incidence of VTE. The aim of this multicenter, randomized study is to assess the clinical benefit of extended (4 weeks) compared to short (one week) heparin prophylaxis after laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
