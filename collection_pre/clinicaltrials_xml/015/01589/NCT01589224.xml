	<brief_summary>Coronary MDCT (multi-detector computed tomography) has been useful screening imaging modality for the coronary artery disease. Recently, novel adipokines and hepatokines as well as various inflammatory markers have been known as direct regulators of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the investigators examine the correlation of various metabolic risk factors including adipokines and hepatokines with coronary atherosclerosis measured by coronary MDCT in apparently healthy people.</brief_summary>
