	<brief_summary>Considering the widespread use of sodium fluoride (NaF) and monofluorophosphate (MFP) based toothpastes, the present study aim to evaluate F availability in saliva after use of the top-selling Brazilian toothpastes. In a blind, crossover clinical trial study, volunteers will brush their teeth with one of the following toothpastes: 1) non-fluoride toothpaste (negative control group); 2) NaF/silica based toothpaste 3)MFP/calcium carbonate based toothpaste. After brushing, a rinse with purified water will be performed. Unstimulated saliva will be collected before and up to 60 min after brushing. Ionic fluoride and total soluble fluoride (corresponding to the sum of fluoride as ion and as MFP) will be determined after acid treatment of salivary samples to hydrolyze MFP. Fluoride will be determined using an ion selective electrode.</brief_summary>
