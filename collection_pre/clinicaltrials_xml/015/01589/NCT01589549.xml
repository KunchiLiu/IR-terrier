	<brief_summary>A randomised study of corticosteroid therapy with or without mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for newly diagnosed acute graft versus host disease after bone marrow transplantation or donor lymphocyte therapy. It is hypothesised that mesenchymal stromal cell therapy will be superior</brief_summary>
