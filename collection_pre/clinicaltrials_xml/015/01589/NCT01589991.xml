	<brief_summary>Fluoride toothpaste has been associated not only with declining dental caries prevalence but also with an increase in dental fluorosis. In the balance of benefits/risks of fluoride toothpaste use, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the availability of fluoride concentration in the mouth (biofilm fuild), as an indicator of fluoride benefits (anticaries effect), and the fluoride concentration in urine, as an indicator of fluoride absorption from ingested toothpastes (with potential to cause dental fluorosis), in a sample of young Brazilian children using toothpaste formulations representative of those available and most used by this age-group.</brief_summary>
