	<brief_summary>Sox2 has been studied in several types of human solid tumors. The investigators found that Sox2 had higher expression level in colorectal cancer and metastatic tissues than normal tissues. So the investigators assumed that whether Sox2 plays an important role in the progression and migration of colon cancer.</brief_summary>
