	<brief_title>Inflammation and the Heart</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1: We want to study people with RA to see if we can detect very early changes in their heart muscle and compare these results to people who do not have RA. Aim 2: We want to study people with RA, who have at least 4 swollen joints, before and 6 months after starting a disease modifying therapy to see if there are any changes in the heart muscle on treatment.</detailed_description>
