	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about asthma in people who are not well-controlled with current asthma medication (refractory asthma). The investigators will compare data from refractory asthmatic patients here at National Jewish Health to mild asthmatics subjects and to people without asthma. Study experiments involve looking at samples from all 3 groups and comparing them at a molecular level. These laboratory experiments may help identify subtypes of refractory asthmatics that require different treatments.</brief_summary>
