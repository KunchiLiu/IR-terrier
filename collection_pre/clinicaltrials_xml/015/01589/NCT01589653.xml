	<criteria>Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a minimum of 12 months prior to screening Currently treated with a NPH insulin for at least 3 months prior to screening Stable treatment (no change in dose or regimen) with a total daily dose of at least 1500 mg metformin or maximum tolerated dose (minimum 1000 mg) ± additional OAD treatment. The metformin treatment must have been stable for at least 2 months prior to screening HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.0% (both inclusive). (One retest within one week of screening visit is allowed. The last sample will be conclusive.) Body Mass Index (BMI) below or equal to 40.0 kg/m^2 Able and willing to eat at least 2 main meals each day during the trial Able and willing to adhere to the protocol including compliance with performance of self measured plasma glucose (SMPG), injection regimen and titrating themselves according to the protocol Experience in performing selfmeasured plasma glucose (SMPG) Treatment with any thiazolidinedione (TZD) and Glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) receptor agonists or pramlintide within the last 3 months prior to screening Impaired hepatic function defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) above or equal to 2.5 times upper referenced limit. (One retest within one week of screening visit is allowed. The last sample will be conclusive.) Impaired kidney function with serum creatinine above or equal to 133 µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) for males and above or equal to 124 µmol/L (1.4 mg/dL) for females. (One retest within one week of screening visit is allowed. The last sample will be conclusive.) Cardiac problems or uncontrolled treated/untreated severe hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure above or equal to 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure above or equal to 100 mmHg) Previous use of premixed insulin products (premixed insulin analogues or premixed human preparations) Recurrent severe hypoglycaemia (more than 1 severe hypoglycaemic episode, during the last 12 months) or hypoglycaemic unawareness as judged by the Investigator or hospitalisation for diabetic ketoacidosis during the previous 6 months Known proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring treatment</criteria>
