	<brief_title>Extension to a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Study of LCQ908 in Subjects With Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was an 52 weeks open label extension starting at the lowest treatment dose used in CLCQ908B2302/NCT01514461 (i.e., 10 mg) with optional up-titrations, to evaluate the overall long-term safety and tolerability of LCQ908 in patients with Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome, who either discontinued from the CLCQ908B2302/NCT01514461 study (due to tolerability issues) or completed the CLCQ908B2302/NCT01514461 study after 52 weeks. In addition, patients who had previously completed study CLCQ908A2212/NCT01146522 were eligible to participate. Following Protocol amendment 2, the original 52 week duration of this study (CLCQ908B2305) became Part A of LCQ908B2305 and a 78 week extension became Part B. However, following Protocol amendment 3, Part B was ended at the same time as the last patient of Part A completed 52 weeks. The reason for termination of Part B was the findings from the December 2014 interim analysis which suggested that the size of benefit that was anticipated from continued participation of patients in the 18 month extension trial (Part B) no longer supported trial extension beyond Part A.</detailed_description>
