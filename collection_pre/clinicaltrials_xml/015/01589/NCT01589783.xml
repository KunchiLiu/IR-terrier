	<brief_summary>Vitamin D insufficiency is common globally. Pregnant women, who need an increased supply of this vitamin for the proper development of the fetus, are a significant risk group. The purpose of this study is to examine which factors - education, knowledge from non-professional sources, recommendations from medical staff - influence the use of vitamin D among pregnant women in light of the lack of a clear health policy, and to help formulating guidelines for a new health policy with specific recommendations for vitamin D dosage in pregnancy.</brief_summary>
