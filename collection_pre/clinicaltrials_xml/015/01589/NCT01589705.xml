	<brief_summary>There are substantial data demonstrating increased endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the association between serum uric acid level and endothelial dysfunction has not been elucidated yet in these patients. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to examine the relationship between the uric acid level and the ED in normotensive ADPKD patients with preserved renal function.</brief_summary>
