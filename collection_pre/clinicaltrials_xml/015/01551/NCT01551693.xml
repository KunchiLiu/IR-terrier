	<brief_summary>STA9090 is a drug which inactivates or blocks the work of a protein called Heat Shock Protein 90 or HSP90. HSP90 is a protein that helps some molecules inside your cells to have the right shape. By stopping HSP90's activity, those molecules never get to have the right structure of be functional and they are destroyed. The investigators believe that if they stop the activity of HSP90, the rapidly dividing cells that are in your tumor(s) may slow down. In this research study the investigators are looking to see how well STA9090 works in stopping the spread of your melanoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STA-9090 will be given intravenously over 1 hour. Treatment will be given in cycles which last 28 days (4 weeks). Study drug will be given once a week for the first 3 weeks (days 1, 8 and 15) and not during the last week. Subjects will receive a clinical exam, ECG (before and after study drug) and blood tests on days when they receive the study drug. In Cycle 1, subjects will have a biopsy and blood samples taken on Day 2. 20 to 30 days after the last study treatment, subjects will have a clinical exam, ECG, blood tests, pregnancy test (if applicable), tumor assessment by CT, urine sample and possible biopsy.</detailed_description>

This site must be different from the sites to be used for biopsy. No prior radiation therapy or directed ablation to the site of measureable disease Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures No chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to study entry No radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry Subject has recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier No tyrosine kinase inhibitor within 14 days prior to study entry No major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose of STA9090 No minor surgery within 7 days of first dose of STA9090 No history of or current coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery No current treatment with the following antiarrythmic drugs: flecainide, moricizine or propafenone No NYHA class II/III/IV congestive heart failure with a history of dyspnea, orthopnea, or edema that requires current treatment with angiotensin convering enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, betablockers, or diuretics No current or prior radiation to the left hemithorax No embolization procedure or ablation procedure to treat tumor within 4 weeks of first dose of STA 9090 Not receiving any other investigational agents No poor venous access for study drug administration unless subject can use silicone based catheters No history of brain metastases or of leptomeningeal involvement No history of severe allergic reactions or hypersensitivity reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to STA9090 (e.g. olyethylene glycol [PEG] 300 or Polysorbate 80) Baseline QTc ≤ 470 msec No previous history of QT prolongation while taking other medications Ventricular ejection fraction (EF) &gt; 55% No treatment with chronic immunosuppressants No melanoma of ocular primary No prior treatment with hsp90 inhibitor No uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, ventricular arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements No other medications, or severe acute/chronic medical of psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with the study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into the study No history of a different malignancy except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been diseasefree for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin No HIVpositive subject on combination antiretroviral therapy No more than 3 prior systemic therapies for unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma No concomitant use of medications associated with a high incidence of QT prolongation as outlined</criteria>
