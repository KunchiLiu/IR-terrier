	<brief_summary>Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma with radiotherapy or surgery. But if this cancer spreads, it is more difficult to treat. Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma that has spread with a chemotherapy called dacarbazine, but they are always looking to find new ways to treat uveal melanoma. This study aims to find out how well Sunitinib works to treat uveal melanoma and to see how long Sunitinib and Dacarbazine can help to prevent the cancer from getting worse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study of Sunitinib Versus Dacarbazine in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>124 eligible patients will be randomised to either Sunitinib or Dacarbazine treatment. Participants will then attend 3-weekly clinic visits and undergo 12-weekly tumour assessment (CT or MRI scan) until disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) has been identified. At progression, patients may crossover to the other study treatment and continue with 3-weekly clinic visits and 12-weekly imaging until second progression.</detailed_description>
