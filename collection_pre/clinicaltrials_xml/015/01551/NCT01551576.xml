	<brief_title>Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI) of the Prostate: A Clinical Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S): The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess PAI-performance in a clinical setting to understand limitations of our current PAI instrumentation and to help improve the next-generation design. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S): To do preliminary evaluations of oxygen saturation in lesions based on PAI-measurements in order to distinguish malignant from benign prostatic tissue as a basis for future studies.</detailed_description>
