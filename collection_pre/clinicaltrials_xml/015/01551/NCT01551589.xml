	<brief_title>Elective or Prophylactic Nodal Irradiation for Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal lymph node drainage area is rich, according to different sites, easy to metastasis to different regions. For patient underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy, how reasonable design the clinical target volume of lymph node drainage area has always been controversial, one is to irradiate positive lymph nodes only, the other is to irradiate the easier involved lymph node area according to different sites, in order to contrast advantages and disadvantages of the two kind of target area design，so the study was designed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 2. ECOG performance status 02 3. Weight is not less than 90% of it before treatment 4. Histologically proven primary thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma previously untreated stage IIII 5. Chest and abdominal contrast enhanced CT within 2 weeks prior to registration(PET/CT scan is selective) 6. WBC ≥ 4.0X109/L ,Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 2.0X109/L 7. Platelets ≥ 100X109/L 8. Hemoglobin ≥ 90g/L(without blood transfusion) 9. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal, Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal 10. Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal 11. Sign studyspecific informed consent prior to study entry 1. Multiple primary esophageal tumors 2. Prior invasive malignancy (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 2 years (For example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible). 3. Severe, active comorbidity, defined as follows: Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 3 months Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. 4. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception. 5. Prior systemic chemotherapy, prior radiation therapy or prior target drug therapy</criteria>
