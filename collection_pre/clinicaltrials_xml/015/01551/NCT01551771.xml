	<brief_summary>This study is the first administration of GW824575 in humans. This will be a single centre, masked, placebo-controlled study, to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GW824575, given as single and repeated oral doses to healthy male subjects. The study will be comprised of 4 parts and enroll approximately 40 subjects: Part A will consist of two cohorts of 8 healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of ascending single oral doses of GW824575. All available safety, tolerability, and PK data will be monitored prior to each dose escalation. In order to support the possible indication for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Part B will be one cohort of 12 subjects to examine the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of a repeated dose of GW824575 over 21 days in healthy male subjects who are greater than or equal to 50 years of age. The total daily dose in this cohort will not exceed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from Parts A and D. Subjects in this cohort will undergo ophthalmology assessments before receiving investigational product and after Day 7 of the 21-day in-patient treatment, after steady state has been reached. As part of protocol amendment 2, Part C (Cohort 4) is removed from the protocol. Part D, added under protocol amendment 2, will consist of one cohort of 12 healthy male subjects to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of ascending single doses of GW824575 as well as the effect of food on the PK of GW824575.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part A will consist of two cohorts of healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of ascending single oral doses of GW824575. The sponsor will review available safety, tolerability, and PK data and, where available, PD receptor occupancy (from the eosinophil shape change data) data before each dose escalation. Outcome measures in Part A will be assessed and presented through 48 hours post-dose for each of up to 4 single dose escalations per cohort. Part B will be one cohort to examine the safety, tolerability and PK of a repeated dose of GW824575 over 21 days in healthy male subjects who are greater than or equal to 50 years of age. Subjects in this cohort will undergo ophthalmic assessments before receiving investigational product and after Day 7 of the 21-day in-patient treatment, after steady state has been reached. The PD endpoints such as receptor occupancy will be assessed. The dosing regimen (once or twice daily) will be determined by PK data from Part A; however, regardless of dosing regimen, subjects will only receive a single dose in the morning on Days 1 and 21 of the treatment period. Outcome measures in Part B (Cohort 3) will be assessed and presented through 21 days repeat dosing until 48 hours post-dose last dose (i.e., on Day 23). If a safety signal is noted during, or after, the conduct of Cohort 3 of the study; the cohort may be halted or dose down-titrated, and an additional cohort, at a lower dose, may be instituted in Part B as Cohort 5. Dose selection for the additional cohort (Cohort 5) will be informed by the aggregate safety, PK, and PD data available at that time. Part D will consist of one cohort of healthy male subjects. The cohort will 1) explore the effect of a high fat meal on the PK of GW824575 during two treatment periods with approximately 48 hour washout between periods and 2) assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of ascending single oral doses of GW824575 administered in the fasting state or with a standard meal in up to 3 additional treatment periods with at least 6-day washout between periods. The sponsor will review available safety, tolerability, and PK data and, where available, PD RO (from the eosinophil shape change data) data before each dose escalation.</detailed_description>

Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. For subjects in Parts A or D Male subjects between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. For subjects in Part B Male subjects greater than or equal to 50 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent.. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 4 months postlast dose.
