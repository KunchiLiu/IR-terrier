	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To investigate the efficacy on skin manifestation of 16 weeks treatment of once daily regimen of hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQ) in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with active skin manifestation (CLASI [Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index] activity score is ≥4) concomitant treatment with or without corticosteroid. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the efficacy on skin manifestation and the safety of 16 weeks treatment of once daily regiment of HCQ versus placebo as the reference group in patients with CLE and SLE with active skin manifestation (CLASI activity score is ≥4) concomitant treatment with or without corticosteroid. - To investigate the safety of 16 weeks treatment of once daily regiment of HCQ in patients with CLE and SLE with active skin manifestation concomitant treatment with or without corticosteroid. - To investigate the safety and efficacy of 52 weeks long-term treatment of once daily regimen of HCQ in patients with CLE and SLE - To investigate the influence of the dose reduction of corticosteroid on CLE and SLE patients treated with HCQ concomitant with corticosteroid - To investigate efficacy of once daily regimen of HCQ on systemic symptoms, musculoskeletal symptoms and immunological parameters in SLE patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients diagnosed as cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) Exclusion criteria: Patients receiving corticosteroid more than 15mg/day of the equivalent dose of prednisolone. Patients whose CLASI activity scores were less than 4 point at the initiation of Screening (Visit 1) and Day1 (Visit 2) (evaluated by a dermatology specialist). Patients whose fluctuations of CLASI activity scores were ≥20% between Visit 1 and Visit 2 (evaluated by a dermatology specialist).
