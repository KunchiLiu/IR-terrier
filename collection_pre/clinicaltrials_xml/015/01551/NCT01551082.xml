	<detailed_description>Medical chart database to identify patients ,of one thoracic surgeon over the last seven years, who underwent thoracic resection and were discharged home with an air leak and chest tube to portable drainage device was completed. Once all patients were identified, all possible vulnerable patients were discarded.
