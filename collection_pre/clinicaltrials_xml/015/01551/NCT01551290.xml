	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of Infliximab in Chinese Patients With Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), placebo controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study), double blind (neither investigator nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), 2-arm (2 groups), parallel group (a clinical study comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different treatments) study with infliximab in patients with active ulcerative colitis. The study consists of screening period (4 weeks prior to baseline [patient's medical status before any treatment or research is done] at Week 0), treatment period (Week 0 to Week 22) and follow up period (Week 26). Participants completing treatment till Week 22 and benefit from continued treatment (in the opinion of the investigator) may enter a study extension period from Week 30 until Week 58. Hundred participants will be randomized to 2 groups: Group 1 (50 participants receiving placebo) and Group 2 (50 participants receiving infliximab). Effectiveness and safety (physical examination, and a review of AEs, vital signs, laboratory analyses, and concomitant medications) will be evaluated at Week 8 and Week 26 and at Week 58 (for participants who enter extension phase). The maximum duration for participants in the main study is 26 weeks. The maximum duration for participants including study extension is 58 weeks. One of the specialized procedures used to calculate efficacy will be Mayo score which is calculated using the subscore (recorded in Mayo Diary Card by each participant) of the following 4 variables (1) stool frequency (scores ranging from 0 [normal number stools for this patient] to 3 [5 or more stools more than normal]), (2) rectal bleeding (scores ranging from 0 [no blood seen] to 3 [blood alone passed]), (3) endoscopic findings (scores ranging from 0 [normal or inactive disease] to 3 [severe disease ie, spontaneous bleeding and ulceration]), and (4) the physician's global assessment (scores ranging from 0 [normal] to 3 [severe disease]).</detailed_description>
