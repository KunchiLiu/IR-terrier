	<brief_summary>Objectives: To evaluate the effects of the technique of Breath Stacking (BS) in the distribution of ventilation in the chest in women with morbid obesity. Methods: Randomized clinical trial, blinded, and controlled with 32 women (BMI ≥ 40kg/m2), separated into two groups: control (GC) with n = 16 and 41.94 ± 9.38 years and group Breath Stacking (GBS) , n = 16 and 40.38 ± 10.16 years. Optoelectronic plethysmography (POE) was used to assess lung ventilation. For the BS technique was used to mask the expiratory branch occluded and Wright spirometer. GBS held three techniques with an interval of three minutes. The GC used the same circuit without the occlusion of the expiratory branch. Results: GBS was found to be higher in the contribution of tidal volume (VT) into the chest circumference (p = 0.04) and decrease in abdominal compartment (p = 0.03), whereas the CG showed no difference in distribution. Spirometric variables: FEV1 (%), FVC (%), FEV1/FVC (%), VC and CI showed no difference before and after the technical BS and GBS in the GC. Conclusions: The technique BS altered the distribution pattern of regional ventilation, resulting in greater contribution in lung volume in the lower rib cage, corresponding to activity of the diaphragm, with redistribution of volume between compartments.</brief_summary>
