	<brief_summary>Recent pre-clinical and clinical data have indicated that BSI-201 does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. Based on the results from in vitro and in vivo studies, this trial aims to evaluate the combination of BSI-201 concomitantly with radiotherapy in patients who present with multiple non operable brain metastases. As radiotherapy is a local treatment targeting only the tumor, and because the molecule BSI-201 has shown no major toxicity against tissues without DNA alterations, the proposed combination is expected to provide tumor-selective therapy and leading to a clinical benefit improvement. Primary objective is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and evaluate acute toxicity (CTC-AE v4.0 grading scale) of concurrent administration of whole brain radiotherapy (WBR) and a small molecule BSI-201 in non operable brain metastases.</brief_summary>
