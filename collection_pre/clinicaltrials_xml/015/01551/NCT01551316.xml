	<brief_summary>In MediciNova's clinical development plan for MN-221, it was recognized that treatment of COPD exacerbations may necessitate more than one single i.v. infusion and that patients in this population may have more co-morbidities (and concomitant medications) than has been generally studied so far. Thus, the primary objective of this clinical study is to determine the repeated administration safety and tolerability of intravenous (i.v.) MN-221 compared to placebo with repeated administration over several days in moderate to severe COPD patients who may also have co-morbidities and concomitant medications (CM) common in this population. Secondary outcomes include pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy (FEV1). This Phase 1b trial follows naturally upon a Phase 1b COPD trial completed last year (MN-221-CL-010) and is additionally well-supported by relevant animal safety data and human clinical trial information.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female 4075 years of age, inclusive; History of physiciandiagnosed (e.g., by clinical history, &gt;15pack year history of smoking, physical examination, and spirometry) COPD treated for ≥ 3 months prior to Visit 1 PreScreening; FEV1 ≥ 30% and &lt; 80% predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.7 at Visit 1 PreScreening and Visit 2 Screening; Negative urine pregnancy test for all females unless the subject is postmenopausal (≥ 24 months of spontaneous amenorrhea) or surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy or bilateral tubal ligation); Negative urine drug screen for cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), methamphetamine; Negative alcohol breath test; Electrocardiogram (ECG) without serious abnormality and with QTcB and QTcF &lt; 460 milliseconds (msec); Ability to washout of concomitant LABA and Theophylline, if ongoing, for 78 days (i.e., Visit 2 Screening through 5Day Treatment Period). Legally effective written informed consent obtained prior to starting any study procedures. Subject willing and able to comply with the protocol and procedures, as judged by Investigator.
