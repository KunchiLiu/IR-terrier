	<brief_summary>Evaluation of the decrease of the secretion of saliva in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by a local ultrasound-guided bilateral injection of botulinum toxin type A in parotids and submandibular glands. The investigators want to demonstrate 1 month after the injection, by a multicenter French randomized double blind study, an improvement of at least 25 % of the functional embarrassment due to saliva, estimated with a visual analogue scale, a decrease of the quantity of saliva and a decrease of the embarrassment for the main caregiver.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient will benefit from an ultrasound guided injection of botulinum toxin A (BotoxÂ®) or placebo (NaCl 0.9 %) and will be followed up in consultation at 4, 12, 16 (if reinjection) and 24 weeks. He will be contacted by telephone in 2 and in 8 weeks (percentage of decrease of functional embarrassment, percentage of decrease of salivary secretion rate). He can be able to benefit in the open label phase of a botulinum toxin type A injection at the 12-week follow up if he estimates that first injection was not effective or if the efficiency of the first injection began to become blurred. After the 6 months of the study, the patient will benefit again from the usual follow-up as advised by the French consensus conference in November, 2005.</detailed_description>
