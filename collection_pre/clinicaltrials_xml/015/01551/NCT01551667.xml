	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to detect differences in anti-S. aureus antibody assays (IgM, IgA, IgG and its subclasses) between (1) a group of patients with bacteremia due to a chronic wound (cases) and (2) a group of patients with localized chronic wound infections (control).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response of Patients With Chronic, Staphylococcus Aureus-infected Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives include: - To propose a diagnostic marker of bacteraemia based on the detection of anti-S. aureus by xMAP technology - To evaluate the kinetics of the humoral immune response to S. aureus in patients with bacteraemia - To evaluate the virulence of S. aureus isolated from chronic, infected wounds - To enrich the NÃ®mes University Hospital biobank - To evaluate the prevalence of different antibodies within each group</detailed_description>
