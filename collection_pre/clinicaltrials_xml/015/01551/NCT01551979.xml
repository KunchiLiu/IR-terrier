	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to look at the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a therapeutic intervention for patients with schizophrenia. The primary outcome is improvement in negative symptoms related to schizophrenia. The investigators are focusing on negative symptoms given their greater resistance to pharmacological and other established therapies. If the investigators trial were to show beneficial effects, its clinical significance would be great.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Efficacy of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study builds on the results of a previous phase 1, single-site study in which we demonstrated the safety of image-guided theta burst stimulation (TBS) form of rTMS over the cerebellar vermis (Demirtas-Tatlidede et al., 2010) in eigh patients with schizophrenia. The primary goal of the present study is to assess efficacy of iTBS to the cerebellar vermis on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A second, added goal is to investigate the mechanisms of the expected clinical improvement. Schizophrenia is a leading cause of mental disability and current treatments still remain only partially successful for many patients. Our underlying hypothesis is that modulation of the cerebellar vermis may enhance activity of the neural systems that sub-serve cognition and emotion, reestablish the disturbed cerebellar regulation in schizophrenic patients, and produce clinical improvement.</detailed_description>

All female participants of child bearing age are required to have a pregnancy test. Any metal in the brain, skull, or elsewhere unless approved by the responsible MD Any medical devices (ie. cardiac pacemaker, deep brain stimulator, medication infusion pump, cochlear implant, vagal nerve stimulator) unless otherwise approved by the responsible MD Substance abuse (alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, MDMA [methylenedioxymethamphetamine], ecstasy, PCP [phencyclidine], Angle dust) or dependence within the past six months No medication is an absolute exclusion from TMS. Medications will be reviewed by the responsible MD and a decision about inclusion will be made based on the following: the patient's past medical history, drug dose, history of recent medication changes or duration of treatment, and combination with other CNS (central nervous system) active drugs (the published TMS guidelines review of medications to be considered with TMS)</criteria>
