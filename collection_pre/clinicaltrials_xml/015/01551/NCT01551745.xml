	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II study of Vigil™ autologous tumor cell vaccine integrated with bevacizumab. All patients will have had Vigil™ prepared and stored from initial primary surgical debulking. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive Vigil™ 1.0 x 10e7 cells/intradermal injection once every 4 weeks and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</brief_summary>
