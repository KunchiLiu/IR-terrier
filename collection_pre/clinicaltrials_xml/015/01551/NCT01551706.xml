	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Evaluate the Effect of ENI Patented Whole Grape Extract on Antioxidant Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the effect of ENI Patented Whole Grape Extract versus placebo on antioxidant status. The primary objective is to determine antioxidant status by measuring total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in blood and 8-OHdG and 8-isoprostane in first morning void urine samples prior to and after six weeks of supplementation with ENI Patented Whole Grape Extract. Secondary objectives will include the assessment of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and safety evaluations: 1. oxLDL 2. Safety laboratory tests: CBC, electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, eGFR, AST, ALT, GGT,bilirubin 3. Vital signs: heart rate and blood pressure 4. Adverse events</detailed_description>

Subjects who are smokers agree to report smoking habits at each visit and do not plan on changing their smoking habits during the study. 5. Has given voluntary, written, informed consent to participate in the study 1. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the trial 2. Subject has any clinically significant medical conditions including cardiovascular disease,hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90mmHg), diabetes, liver or kidney disease 3. Use of medication for the treatment of hypertension 4. Use of medication for vasodilation, including nitric oxide releasing patches 5. Use of medication for erectile dysfunction 6. Use of medication (prescribed or over the counter) for weight loss 7. Use of statins, fibrates, niacin, or any other medication for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia 8. Use of anticoagulants 9. Use of illicit drugs or history of drug or alcohol abuse with the past 5 years (currently having more than 2 standard alcoholic drinks per day) 10. Use of natural health products (NHPs)/dietary supplements that are known to have significant antioxidant activity within 2 weeks prior to baseline and during the course of the study including but not limited to vitamins A, C, and E, selenium and zinc. 11. Participation in a clinical research trial within 30 days prior to baseline 12. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results at screening including AST, ALT and/or bilirubin &gt; 2 x the ULN Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x the ULN or eGFR &lt; 60 hemoglobin &lt; 140 g/L for males and &lt; 123 g/L for females 13. Allergy or sensitivity to test product ingredients 14. Individuals who are cognitively impaired and/or who are unable to give informed consent 15. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion may adversely affect the subject's ability to complete the study or its measures or which may pose significant risk to the subject</criteria>
