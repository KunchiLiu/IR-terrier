	<brief_title>Parent-targeted Mobile Phone Based Intervention to Increase Physical Activity in Children (P-Mobile)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most children engage in insufficient amounts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. These low levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are associated with adverse health consequences including increased risk for obesity, and cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors. Therefore, there is a need for studies that can increase physical activity levels in children. Mobile phones are a way to deliver behavioral interventions. Mobile phones are portable, allow for real-time data collection, and can potentially reach large numbers of people. Text messages can also be utilized to promote behavior change. Few mobile phone based interventions have specifically targeted child physical activity. The aims of this pilot study were to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a physical activity promotion program targeting 6-10 year old children that is delivered to parents through mobile phones.</detailed_description>
