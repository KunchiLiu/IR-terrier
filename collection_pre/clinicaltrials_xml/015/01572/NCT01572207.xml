	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether tailored print material can promote physical activity and exercise, and subsequently improve quality of life and fitness levels among people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Research suggests that routine physical activity is beneficial in people with mild to moderate MS. However, people with MS may face many barriers for engaging in regular physical activity. Prescribing a home exercise program and receiving tailored motivational print material may help people engage in physical activity. Thus, the investigators hope to figure out whether tailored print material can be used as strategy to promote physical activity and improve physical function in people with MS.</brief_summary>
