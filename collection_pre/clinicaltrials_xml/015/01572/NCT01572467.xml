	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial is studying genes in tumor samples from younger patients with ovarian or testicular sex cord stromal tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Genes in Samples From Younger Patients With Ovarian or Testicular Sex Cord Stromal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To assess the role of DICER1 mutations and miRNA pathways in the etiology and progression of ovarian or testicular sex cord stromal tumors. OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for D1CER1 mutation and mRNA expression by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and laser micro dissector. Results are then correlated with medical data, including age at diagnosis, diagnosis, pathology report, presenting symptoms, family history, treatment, outcome, and length of follow-up, when available.</detailed_description>
