	<brief_summary>Background - Symptomatic undifferentiated hypotension represents a negative prognostic factor and the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality. - Misdiagnosis may lead to delayed or incorrect treatment of some life-threatening conditions. Aim - The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a new bedside ultrasound method that consists in the focused imaging of the thorax, abdomen and leg veins, in emergency. Methods - Hypotensive (&lt;100 mm/Hg) patients presenting to our emergency department, complaining of at least one of the neurologic, respiratory and cutaneous signs and symptoms of inadequate tissue perfusion, are prospectively studied by ultrasound-focused assessment of the heart, lungs, inferior vena cava, peritoneum, aorta and leg deep veins. - On the basis of physical examination and ultrasound results, the operator declares the diagnostic hypothesis without influencing the attending physician and the following diagnostic procedure (which includes ultrasound, when needed). - The diagnostic hypothesis is compared with the final diagnosis, obtained after the hospital route and discussed by a panel of three blinded experts (one radiologist, one cardiologist and one emergency physician). - The statistical agreement is calculated by the k of Cohen with p-value, confidence intervals and raw agreement (Ra).</brief_summary>
