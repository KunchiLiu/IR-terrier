	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of an investigational drug, called Bendavia, on reducing the area of heart muscle affected by a myocardial infarction (heart attack) in participants who have undergone successful coronary intervention (heart treatment) and stenting. Participation in the study is due to last for approximately 7 months. It is planned that up to 300 participants will take part in the study from centers in the United States and around the world.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 and &lt;85 years The patient presents with firsttime acute, anterior wall STEMI scheduled to undergo primary PCI and stenting. The patient has symptoms of cardiac ischemia of ≥10 minutes. The patient must demonstrate an anterior wall STEMI with &gt;0.1 mV STsegment elevation in at least two contiguous precordial leads (i.e., V1V4) or presumed new left bundle branch block. The time from onset of symptoms of cardiac ischemia to the anticipated time of initial PCI balloon inflation does not exceed four (4) hours and it is anticipated that the doortoballoon time will be &lt;2 hours. For female patients of childbearing potential, an adequate form of contraception must be adhered to prior to entry into the study and for a further 3 months after the followup visit. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to entry into the study. Female patients not of childbearing potential (i.e. female patients who are postmenopausal since last regular menses, or have been surgically sterilized at least 1 year prior to screening visit) are eligible to enter the study. For male patients with female partners of childbearing potential, an adequate form of contraception must be adhered to prior to entry into the study and for a further 3 months after the poststudy medical. Written informed consent obtained that strictly adheres to the written guidelines from the local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Ethical Committee (EC). Exclusion Criteria Cardiogenic shock or maximal systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt;80 mm Hg after fluid and/or vasopressor resuscitation on at least two consecutive readings. Ongoing vasopressor support. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as a systolic BP &gt;180 mm Hg or a diastolic BP &gt;110 mm Hg on at least two consecutive readings. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmia requiring prolonged (&gt;5 minutes) chest compressions/ cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Prior myocardial infarction (MI). Implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) or permanent pacemaker (PPM) unless known to be MRI safe. The presence of an MRIcompatible pacemaker or other MRIcompatible hardware will not be a contraindication to participation in this trial. Known left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30% prior to the qualifying infarct. History of clinically significant hepatic disturbance or chronic renal impairment at the time of admission. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the last 30 days. Any known disorder that is associated with immunologic dysfunction (e.g., cancer, lymphoma, a positive serologic test for the human immunodeficiency virus, or hepatitis) more recently than 6 months before presentation or the administration of immunosuppressive drugs within 10 days of the STEMI at doses expected to be associated with immunosuppression including high dose steroids (&gt;2.5 mg/d hydrocortisone or equal potency of synthetic steroids), TNFα blockers or methotrexate/azathioprine. Any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, would prevent adherence to the requirements of the protocol including language barrier or current alcohol or drug abuse. Contraindications (including claustrophobia) to cardiac MRI at study entry. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within the 30 days prior to enrollment into the EMBRACESTEMI Trial or anticipated within the next 4 days. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding during the study or intend to within 30 days of receiving study drug.</criteria>
