	<brief_summary>Iron overload is a severe complication of multiple blood transfusions. As the body has no physiologic mechanism for clearing iron, repeated transfusions cause iron accumulation in organs and lead to iron toxicity. Accurate assessment of iron overload is paramount to quantify excessive iron accumulation and to monitor response to iron chelation therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been used to noninvasively measure hepatic iron concentration (HIC). Although MRI-based measurements of transverse relaxation rates (R2 and R2*) accurately predict biopsy-proven HICs below 15 mg Fe/g, previous studies have shown that their precision is limited for HICs above 15 mg Fe/g and inaccurate above 25 mg Fe/g. Current R2* gradient-echo (GRE) MR techniques fail occasionally for very high iron overloads (HIC ~ 15-25 mg Fe/g) and always for massive iron overloads (HIC &gt; 25 mg Fe/g) because R2* is so high that the MR signal decays before it can be measured accurately. Overall accrual: 235 (200 patients, 35 healthy volunteers) Purpose: To determine if a new MRI (UTE) can measure the amount of iron in the liver of people with large amounts of iron and compare the results with the same patient's liver bx. Estimated patient accrual is 200. It is estimated that 41 of these patients will have clinical indication for liver biopsy. Volunteer purpose: To test the UTE MRI to ensure it runs correctly before testing in patients, collect data of normal values of iron in the liver in people without iron overload using the UTE MRI and to compare the current MRI (GRE) with the UTE. The UTE MRI will give an accurate value of liver iron in patients with large iron deposits in the liver, therefore providing an accurate means to diagnose, monitor, and provide treatments for participants. This new technology will impact the care of many different populations with iron overload, such as patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Estimated accrual for healthy volunteers is 35.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The MIDAS study is a prospective and non-therapeutic study that will test a new MRI technique for the assessment of iron overload in the liver: the newly developed ultra short echo time (UTE), R2*-UTE. The R2*-UTE technique, developed by St. Jude investigators from the Department of Radiological Sciences, will be first tested in healthy volunteers for feasibility and implementation of the technique. The technique will then be tested in research participants, who will have both the R2*-GRE and the R2*-UTE techniques performed, in addition to a liver biopsy for liver iron quantitation if clinically indicated. Quantitation of liver tissue iron will be done at Mayo Clinic Laboratory in Rochester, Minnesota. Healthy volunteers will not have a liver biopsy performed but only the two types of R2*-MRI techniques will be performed and compared. Primary Objective: - To test the association of hepatic iron content (HIC) measured with the newly developed 1.5T R2*-UTE technique and HIC quantified by liver biopsy in subjects with iron overload. Secondary Objectives: - To explore the relationship between 1.5T R2*-UTE and 1.5T R2*-GRE measurements in healthy volunteers and in subjects with iron overload. - To explore the relationship between 1.5T R2*-UTE measurements with iron studies (serum iron and transferrin saturation) in subjects with iron overload.</detailed_description>
