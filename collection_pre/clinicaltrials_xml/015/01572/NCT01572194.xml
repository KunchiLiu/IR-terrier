	<brief_summary>Chronic renal failure is a serious complication of lung transplantation especially in patients with cystic fibrosis. Their medical history prior to the Lung Transplantation has already exposed to kidney damage. Post-lung transplantation, these patients are subjected to renal toxicity anticalcineurins they receive large doses. The measurement of renal function of patients by formula to estimate GFR in routine use is unreliable and other markers seem indispensable. The purpose of this study is to evaluate two markers, PIIINP (Procollagen III aminoterminal peptide N), whose urinary levels was correlated to the intensity of fibrosis in different types of kidney disease.</brief_summary>
