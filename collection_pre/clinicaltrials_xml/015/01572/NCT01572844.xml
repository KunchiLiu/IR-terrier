	<brief_summary>Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory muscle disorder that is often associated with many skin findings. One of the skin findings seen in up to 50% of individuals with juvenile dermatomyositis, an early onset form of this condition, and up to 20-30% of adult dermatomyositis patients who have not responded to treatment, is calcinosis, or deposits of calcium within the skin and muscle tissue. In addition to being cosmetically unappealing, involvement of deeper tissues with calcinosis may lead to contractures, or shortening of muscles, which may have a significant impact on functioning and quality of life. Unfortunately, there is no known effective treatment of dermatomyositis associated calcinosis. However, recent reports have shown that a medication called sodium thiosulfate has been effective in treating individuals with calciphylaxis, a condition where calcium is deposited within blood vessels, and with tumoral calcinosis, a genetic form of calcification, when receiving this medication by vein. In addition, recent advances in laser technology have led to the development of methods that may allow topical medications to penetrate deeper layers of the skin. The investigators have designed a pilot study to evaluate the use of topical sodium thiosulfate solution in treating superficial calcinosis in individuals with juvenile and adult dermatomyositis. The investigators will use laser to assist in the delivery of this medication to areas of calcinosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Sodium Thiosulfate and Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser in Treating Dermatomyositis Associated Calcinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five individuals who meet the eligibility criteria will take part in this study. They will have a variety of assessments performed throughout the treatment period in order to evaluate both dermatomyositis and calcinosis severity and their potential response to fractional carbon dioxide and sodium thiosulfate treatment. A medical history will be taken and baseline assessments will be performed during the screening period. Serum creatinine kinase levels will be determined on this visit and repeated at the end of the study (week 20); these levels will be one measure of monitoring disease activity during the study. One calcinosis lesion will be treated, assessed, and followed. If a second calcinosis lesion is present, it will act as a control (not treated). Two weeks prior to the first treatment session, an optional (not required) skin biopsy of the target (treated) calcinosis lesion will be offered to the the first 3 patients â‰¥ 18 years of age to determine optimal fractional carbon dioxide laser settings that will be used for treatment. Area and durometer (a device that measures hardness) measurements and photographs of the calcinosis lesions will be performed at weeks 0,4,8,12,16,and 20. One x-ray of the control and one x-ray of the target calcinosis lesion will also be performed during the screening period and at week 20. Assessment of muscle strength, physical functioning, endurance, and range of motion, as well as myositis activity outside of the muscles will be performed during the screening period and at weeks 8 and 20. Myositis damage assessment will be performed at the screening period and at week 20. Questionnaires to assess physical functioning pertaining to activities of daily living and quality of life, as well as the quality of life related to skin disease and the calcinosis lesions will be completed during the screening period and at weeks 8 and 20. Treatment of the target calcinosis lesion with fractional carbon dioxide laser and topical sodium thiosulfate will occur on weeks 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,and 18. Each patient will receive a total of 8-10 treatments over a 6 month period. Assessments for any side effects from the treatment will be performed prior to each treatment session on weeks 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, and 20.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals of both sexes and of all ethnicities who wish to participate in the study and who have signed a written informed consent form to participate. Subjects must be between the ages of 1865 years. Subjects must have a diagnosis of adult or juvenile dermatomyositis. All patient must be on stable therapy for their condition. Overall disease activity must be considered mild or in remission. Patients must have a history of failing at least one therapy for calcinosis associated with dermatomyositis. Patients must have at least one localized area of superficial calcinosis with easily identifiable landmarks. Whenever possible, subjects will have a second localized area of superficial calcinosis that can serve as a control lesion for repeated assessment. The calcinosis lesion being treated and the control calcinosis lesion must be stable (not increasing in size) based on the patient's history. Patients must be able to attend all treatment sessions and assessment visits at our Washington, District of Columbia clinic over the 20 week period. Unstable dermatomyositis, or moderate or severely active juvenile dermatomyositis. Serum creatine kinase greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal. Inability to make study visits or anticipated poor compliance. Active infections, including a history of recurrent superinfection or cellulitis at the sites of calcinosis (&gt; 1 prior episode). Pregnant females or nursing mothers. Life threatening illness that would interfere with the patient's ability to complete the study. Known or suspected history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 6 months. Participation in another clinical experimental therapeutic study within 30 days of screening visit. History of severe illness or any other condition that would make the patient unsuitable for the study. History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, cancerassociated myositis, or an underlying malignancy.</criteria>
