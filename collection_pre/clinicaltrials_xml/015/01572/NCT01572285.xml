	<brief_title>Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injection to Treat Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder pain is the most common complication in hemiplegia after Stroke (CVA). Almost three quarters of all patients with hemiplegia will suffer from shoulder pain in the first twelve months after stroke. Because of the lack of effective treatment today, the optimal management of hemiplegic shoulder pain is prevention. Although widely studied, all clinical trials for shoulder pain in stroke fail to show efficacy. TF was never investigated to treat Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain (HSP). The investigators hypothesize that injecting the epidural space at the C6 level via transforaminal would desensitize both central medullary components of pain as peripheral sensitized structures such as the suprascapular nerve of the affected shoulder. To test this hypothesis, the investigators developed a treatment protocol consisting of two C6 transforaminal epidural steroid injection with dexamethasone (TF with 0.5mL of lidocaine 1% and 1.5mL of Dexamethasone 10mg/ml). This procedure was compared to a sham intervention.</detailed_description>
