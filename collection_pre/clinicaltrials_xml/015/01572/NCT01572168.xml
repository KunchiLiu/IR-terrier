	<brief_summary>Cancer-related fatigue occurs in both adult and pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation. Recently, methods to measure fatigue have improved - however, no non-medication interventions have been studied. Ameliorating fatigue may result in an improved quality of life for patients. Acupuncture is a safe and well-tolerated procedure and has been used for many indications in pediatric patients. Adult studies have suggested improvement in cancer-related fatigue after acupuncture in adults. In this trial, we propose using acupuncture for the treatment in cancer-related fatigue in children and adolescents with central nervous system tumors.</brief_summary>

Patients who recently completed therapy (within 60 days of enrollment) will also be eligible. Patients must have a minimum baseline fatigue score of 15 on the pedsFACITF scale (Range 044). This is not a standard assessment for required clinical care and will only be administered by a research assistant to any patient after consent has been obtained. The assessment will be done during a routine clinic visit. For patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy with a history of myelosuppression or radiation, a hemoglobin concentration of &gt;8 g/dL measured within 10 days of enrollment and a platelet count of &gt; 30,000 within 5 days of enrollment is required.
