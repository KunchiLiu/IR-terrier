	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To investigate the effects of two single subcutaneous lixisenatide doses (5 and 10 µg) as compared to placebo in reducing postprandial glucose (PPG) in type 2 diabetic paediatric population (10-17 years old) and adults as controls Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate in both paediatric and adult populations: - the blood levels of lixisenatide (pharmacokinetic) parameters in plasma after single subcutaneous ascending doses - the maximum post-prandial glucose excursion, and on the changes in insulin, C-peptide and glucagon plasma concentrations following a standardized breakfast - safety and tolerability.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration of the study for each patient is planned between 4 and 7 weeks including a screening period (25 to 30 days), 3 treatment periods 1-7 days apart, each period lasting only one day (Day 1) and an end-of-study visit between 1 to 7 days after the last dose administration.</detailed_description>
