	<brief_summary>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCD) is the first cause of morbidity and mortality in insulin resistant states. The typical dyslipidemia that is associated with insulin resistance, which includes a postprandial increase of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) with excess of intestinal triglyceride-rich-lipoprotein-apoB-48 (TRL-apoB-48), is felt to play an important role in the accelerated ASCD. Recently, intestinal TRL-apoB-48 overproduction appeared as a newly recognized component of insulin resistance. There is only a limited amount of information in the literature regarding the factors and the mechanisms modulating the metabolism of intestinal TRL-apoB-48 in the setting of insulin resistance</brief_summary>
