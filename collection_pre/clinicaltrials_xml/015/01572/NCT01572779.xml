	<brief_summary>A postural bio-feedback device worn by subjects for 4-10 hours a day for 6 days spread across 6 weeks for the sub acute low back pain group and for 8 days spread across 10 weeks for the chronic group. The device records movement and muscle activity data relating to the lower back. Bio-feedback is delivered to the subject as an audible tone, visual cue or vibration and aims to prompt the subject to alter their posture or position in line with recommendations given by the treating practitioner. Four small sensors are adhered to the lower back and send data wirelessly to a data logger carried in the pocket by the subject (the size of a small mobile phone).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject provides informed consent 2. Age between 18 and 65 years of age 3. At least moderate intensity low back pain (LBP) and/or back related leg pain, as defined by a QVAS score &gt; 3 (Carragee, Spine 2000). 4. Initial QVAS score of &gt; 3 out of 10 5. Subjects must be assessed by the practitioner as Sub Acute (3 to 12 weeks post onset of low back pain (LBP) or Chronic (&gt; 12 weeks post onset of low back pain (LBP). 1. Lower back surgery within previous twelve (12) months. 2. Females who are pregnant. 3. Subjects with a severe hearing impairment. 4. Evidence of non mechanical contributing cause for lower back pain e.g. neoplasm, infection, fracture, inflammatory disorder. 5. Preceding chronic neurological changes (Sub Acute group only). 6. Implanted medical device (spinal cord stimulator, intrathecal pump or peripheral nerve stimulator) 7. Nerve block, spinal injection or anesthetic procedure for the treatment of lower back pain within 12 months of the study. 8. Significant medical abnormalities or conditions that in the opinion of the Practitioner would interfere either with the ability to complete the study or the evaluation of the investigational device's safety and efficacy. 9. Recent history of a significant medicalsurgical intervention that in the judgment of the Practitioner would interfere either with the ability to complete the study or the evaluation of the investigative device's safety and efficacy. 10. Known allergic skin reaction to tapes and plasters. 11. Subject who is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study.</criteria>
