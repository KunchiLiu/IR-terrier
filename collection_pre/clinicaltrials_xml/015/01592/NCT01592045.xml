	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and safety of chimeric (ch) 14.18 manufactured by two independent drug makers (United Therapeutics [UTC] or the National Cancer Institute [NCI]).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ch14.18 Pharmacokinetic Study in High-risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, two-sequence, cross-over study for eligible subjects with high-risk neuroblastoma to assess the comparability of ch14.18 manufactured with UTC drug product and ch14.18 manufactured with NCI drug product. Subjects will be randomly allocated to receive ch14.18 manufactured by UTC or NCI during Courses 1 and 2 followed by ch14.18 manufactured by other manufacturer (UTC or NCI) during Courses 3, 4, and 5.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of highrisk neuroblastoma 8 years of age or younger at diagnosis of highrisk neuroblastoma Patients must have completed therapy including intensive induction followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and radiotherapy * Radiotherapy may be waived for patients who either have small adrenal masses which are completely resected up front, or who never have an identifiable primary tumor Must meet the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) for CR, VGPR, or PR for primary site, soft tissue metastases, and bone metastases AND must also meet the protocol specified criteria for bone marrow response as follows: * No more than 10% tumor (of total nucleated cellular content) seen on any specimen from a bilateral bone marrow aspirate/biopsy Patient who have no tumor seen on the prior bone marrow, and then have â‰¤ 10% tumor on any of the bilateral marrow aspirate/biopsy specimens done at preASCT and/or preenrollment evaluation will also be eligible No more than 12 months from starting the first induction chemotherapy after diagnosis to the date of ASCT * For patients who became highrisk neuroblastoma after initial nonhigh risk disease, the 12 months period should start from the date of induction therapy for highrisk neuroblastoma to the date of ASCT No progressive disease at time of registration except for protocolspecified bone marrow response Adequate hematological, renal, hepatic, pulmonary and cardiac function CNS toxicity &lt; Grade 2 Prior antiGD2 antibody therapy Prior vaccine therapy for neuroblastoma Concurrent anticancer or immunosuppressive therapy</criteria>
