	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, multi-center, clinical study of XF-73 to evaluate the local (nasal) safety and tolerability of a modified, thinner lower viscosity formulation of intranasal XF-73 in healthy male and female subjects. In addition, the potential for systemic absorption of XF-73 in the modified, thinner lower viscosity and the previously investigated thicker, higher viscosity formulations and their decolonization efficacy in comparison to placebo will be evaluated. Both parts of the study will be double-blinded and Part 2 will also be placebo-controlled. Primary objective is to establish the safety and tolerability of two concentrations of a modified thinner, lower viscosity nasal formulation of XF-73 and to compare them to a previously investigated, thicker, higher viscosity formulation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Safety and Local Tolerability of Intranasal Gel Formulations of XF-73</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, multi-center, clinical study of XF-73 to evaluate the local (nasal) safety and tolerability of a modified, thinner, lower viscosity formulation of intranasal XF-73 in healthy male and female subjects. In addition, the potential for systemic absorption of XF-73 in the modified, thinner, lower viscosity and the previously investigated thicker, higher viscosity formulations and their decolonization efficacy in comparison to placebo will be evaluated. Both parts of the study will be double-blinded, and Part 2 will also be placebo-controlled. Study subjects will be healthy volunteers, male or female, aged 18 - 45 years. The study will be conducted in two distinct parts. In Part 1 of the study 8 healthy male and female subjects, aged 18 to 45 years, will be in two groups of four per formulation will have a study duration of up to 36 days. All subjects will receive intranasal applications of 5,15-bis-[4-(3-Trimethylammonio-propyloxy)-phenyl]-porphyrin dichloride (XF-73). In Part 2 only, subjects will also need to be confirmed as persistent nasal SA carriers (n = 48). (Persistent SA carriage is defined by 3 separate, SA positive cultures from nasal swabs: the first taken at Pre-Screening no more than 12 weeks (84 days). Administration will last five days, being three times a day on Day 1, then twice a day thereafter. Primary objective is to establish the safety and tolerability of two concentrations of a modified thinner, lower viscosity nasal formulation of XF-73 and to compare them to a previously investigated, thicker, higher viscosity formulation. Secondary objectives are to establish whether there is any potential systemic exposure following administration of the two nasal formulations of XF-73 and to evaluate the anti-staphylococcal efficacy of two concentrations of a lower and one of a thicker, higher viscosity nasal formulation of XF-73.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Normal, healthy male or female subjects aged between 18 and 45 years inclusive. 2. For Part 2 only: Normal healthy subjects confirmed to be persistent SA carriers (NOTE: Persistent SA carriage is defined by 3 separate, SA (Staphylococcus aureus) positive cultures from nasal swabs: the first taken at PreScreening no more than 12 weeks (84 days) prior to first dosing, a confirmatory swab taken at Screening at least 7 days after PreScreening and a final confirmation swab taken on Admission, a day before dosing and at least 7 days after screening. Subjects may be dosed with only two positive swabs while awaiting the result of the third swab obtained on Admission, but dosing will be discontinued in subjects whose Admission swab is found to be negative for SA. 3. Subject must be healthy, in the opinion of the Investigator, as determined by medical history (MH), physical examination (PE), normal nasal examination, and vital signs (VS). 4. Subject's 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) must be normal or abnormal not clinically significant as reported by the overreading cardiologist. 5. Subject's clinical laboratory results at Screening must be within the reference range or expanded range.Subjects may undergo a repeat screening test of outofrange analytes at the discretion of the investigator to confirm a plausible alternative explanation that will be indicated in the source documentation. 6. Any subject having laboratory values outside of the reference range or expanded range at Day 1 but were within the reference or expended range at screening may be enrolled on study. Abnormal urine dipstick values for blood/hemoglobin, nitrite, and leukocyte esterase will not be exclusionary if a microscopic examination of the urine on the same sample or the most recent sample obtained prior to dosing is within the reference or expanded range. Laboratory values outside the reference or expanded range will be assigned to toxicity grade. 7. Subjects who are able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study. 8. Subject agrees to comply with all study requirements. 9. All female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum and urine pregnancy test at Screening and Admission respectively. 10. Subjects who have a body mass index (BMI) &gt;/= 18.5 kg/m^2 and &lt;/= 35 kg/m^2. 11. Subject agrees not to participate in another clinical trial at any time during the study period. 1. Female subjects who are pregnant or who are lactating. 2. Heterosexually active females of childbearing potential, defined as being physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they agree to use two of the following acceptable methods of contraception throughout their participation in the study and for at least 12 weeks after the final dose: (a) established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraception, (b) intrauterine Device (IUD or Coil), (c) a female barrier method (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) and/or (d) condom plus spermicidal cream/gel. Women who are not sexually active (abstinent) but become active must use two of the listed contraceptive methods. 3. Heterosexually active males unless they agree to use two concomitant acceptable methods of contraception throughout their participation in the study and for at least 12 weeks after receiving their final dose of study medication (examples include: vasectomy combined with latex condom with spermicide, latex condom with spermicide combined with a female partner who practices an acceptable method of contraception as indicated above); Men who are not sexually active (abstinent) but become active must use two of the listed contraceptive methods. Subjects who currently have or have had any acute illness within the past two weeks. 4. Subjects who currently have or have had within the past two weeks a poorly controlled chronic illness(anemia, thrombocytopenia, or coagulation disorders), cancer, infection, or any other clinically significant disorder. 5. Subjects who currently have or have had an autoimmune disease. 6. Subjects who have had within the past two weeks a symptomatic upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, influenza or condition involving increase in nasal secretion such as seasonal or chronic, allergic rhinitis. Additionally, any subject with history of atopy/allergies within the past 30 days will be excluded. 7. Subjects who have had been diagnosed with a concussion within the past two years. 8.
