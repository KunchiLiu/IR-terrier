	<brief_title>A Phase 1, Open-label Study to Investigate the Pharmacokinetics of Tralokinumab (CAT-354) in Adolescents With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interleukin-13 (IL‐13) is a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes inflammation, airways hyper‐responsiveness (directly and through recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells), mucus hypersecretion, airway remodeling via fibrosis, increased immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis and mast cell activation.Tralokinumab (CAT‐354) is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) anti‐IL‐13 monoclonal antibody that has been shown to potently and specifically neutralize IL‐13 in preclinical models.This study will evaluate the PK profile of a single dose of tralokinumab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 300 mg in adolescent subjects with asthma to be compared with the PK data from completed studies in adults.</detailed_description>
