	<brief_summary>The investigators previous studies of aerobic exercise in women with fibromyalgia (FM) have shown that exercise improves body functions and/or symptom severity in most patients, but not in all. About a third of patients with FM have been shown to have low levels of IGF-1. The purpose of this project is to study individual and biological factors that interact with outcomes of short-term (acute) exercise in FM. Method. A controlled prospective exercise study. Thirty women with FM and 30 healthy age-matched women, aged 20-50 years, will be recruited to the study. Two 15-minute ergometer bicycle exercise tests will be conducted in feasting patients, separated by one month. The first exercise test is at a low and the second at a high intensity. Measurements comprise blood test, pain rating and pain threshold, conducted before and after the test. The levels of IGF-1, IL-6 and IL-8 will be measured, and the changes in them will be related to health status and pain.</brief_summary>
