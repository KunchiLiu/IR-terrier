	<brief_summary>This is a trial of household pairs of a Chinese smoker and nonsmoker randomized either to a smoke-free educational intervention or self-help control group. The smokefree educational intervention includes group education about smokefree environments and smoking cessation, follow-up phone calls, and tobacco exposure lab reports. The control group is referred to usual care with local in-language smoking cessation classes or quitline, and is otherwise assessment only. The investigators hypothesize that pairs in the intervention group will have higher rates of tobacco cessation and elimination of smoke exposure, compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
