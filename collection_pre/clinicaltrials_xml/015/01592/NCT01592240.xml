Subject's fasting LDLcholesterol must greater than or equal to 80 mg/dL (2.31 mmol/L at the initial screening visit, and the value at the second visit within 7 days of randomization must be not lower than 20% of this initial value to meet eligibility criterion for this trial. Participation in other studies within 3 months before the current study begins and/or during study participation. Severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; males and females of childbearing potential not using highly effective contraception or not agreeing to continue highly effective contraception for at least 63 days after last dose of investigational product.
