	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test how breakfast affects brain function, memory and learning in healthy children. Hypotheses: Based on the results of our initial study and the relevant literature, it is hypothesized that arousal, attention, and performance will be: 1. Greater in those who eat breakfast relative to those who do not; 2. Greater in lean than in overweight children receiving the higher protein breakfast; 3. Greater in fasting lean than fasting overweight children; and 4. Improved following a morning snack in all study groups. 5. Poorer in children with higher stress-related measures (e.g., higher cortisol levels). 6. Heart rate will be lower in fasting relative to fed participants, and across groups will be higher in overweight children.</brief_summary>
