	<brief_title>Somatic Stem Cells in Leiomyomas?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The organ of interest in our study is the myometrium, a muscle layer of the uterus located between the perimetry and the endometrium. The investigators try to identify, locate and characterize the myometrial stem cell population in the uterine fibroids by isolation of "Side Population" by flow cytometry. Once the investigators achieve the purposes to set out, the investigators would try to maintain "in vitro" stem cell population isolated from myometrial fibroids, for further endocrine characterization. Finally, the investigators would try to induce the formation of fibroids in murine models as a first step to demonstrate that the origin of these formations is due to the abnormal proliferation of myometrial adult stem cells. The results of this study will allow the identification of the cell population in the fibroids. The investigators also can being able to compare with the myometrium in order to establish a relationship that helps us to understand more about the pathophysiology of this disease, using these stem cells as targets therapy in the treatment of this myometrium condition.</detailed_description>
