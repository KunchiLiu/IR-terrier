	<brief_summary>The role of hyperlipidemia and lipid lowering therapy (LLT) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) pathophysiology and its impact on disease progression and survival is unclear. The investigators analyzed the correlation between lipid levels with disease progression and survival in ALS patients and the association of LLT with these outcomes.</brief_summary>
