	<brief_title>Safety Study of Memantine in Pediatric Patients With Autism, Asperger's Disorder or Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical study was a 48-week, multicenter, multinational, open-label extension study in pediatric outpatients with autism, Asperger's Disorder, or PDD-NOS conducted at 106 study centers. Patients were eligible for this long-term extension study if they had: - completed the open-label Study MEM MD 67,or - completed the open-label Study MEM-MD-91, or - completed the double-blind Study MEM-MD-68, or - discontinued study MEM-MD-68 by meeting requirements for loss of therapeutic response The weight-based dose limits in this study were as follows: Group A: â‰¥ 60 kg; maximum 15 mg/day Group B: 40-59 kg; maximum 9 mg/day Group C: 20-39 kg; maximum 6 mg/day Group D: &lt; 20 kg; maximum 3 mg/day The decision to close the study early was based on data from 2 double-blind placebo-controlled studies (MEM-MD-57A and MEM-MD-68) that failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between memantine and placebo in the primary efficacy parameter based on Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total raw score.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who completed Study MEMMD67, MEMMD68, MEMMD91, or discontinued Study MEMMD68 due to meeting the criterion for loss of therapeutic response.

Any abnormal findings must be deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator and documented as such. Have a family that is sufficiently organized and stable to guarantee adequate safety monitoring and continuous attendance to clinic visits for the duration of the study Patients who discontinued a preceding memantine study due to an adverse event possibly related to study drug Patients with a concurrent medical condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study, confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger the patient's well being Significant risk of suicidality based on the Investigator's judgment, Aberrant Behavior Checklistirritability subscale (ABCI), or if appropriate, as indicated by a response of "yes" to questions 4 or 5 in the suicidal ideation section of the Children's ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) or any suicidal behavior</criteria>
