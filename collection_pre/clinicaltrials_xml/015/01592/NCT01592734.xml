	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of PEG-only Laxative for Fecal Impaction and Chronic Constipation in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constipation is a very common complaint in childhood. Inadequate daily fiber intake, insufficient fluid intake, and withholding behavior are considered as factors leading to constipation. Painful defecation is considered a common trigger to faecal retention wich leads to reabsorption of fluids and increase in the size and consistency of stools. It is often necessary to use laxative therapy to achieve comfortable defecation. PEG-based laxatives are considered today the gold standard for treatment of constipation in children. PEG formulations differ for composition in inactive ingredients which may have an impact on acceptance, compliance and adherence to treatment.</detailed_description>
