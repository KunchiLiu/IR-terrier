	<brief_title>IgG-mediated Food Test for Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study looked at foods that stimulated IgG food antibody production, which may play a role in certain conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, type I diabetes, and migraine headaches. Using a proprietary blood test, the Immuno Bloodprint, to determine which foods stimulate IgG food antibodies in each person, this study detailed a personalized list of reactive foods that stimulated such antibodies for each participant. The participant was then advised to eliminate as much as possible the reactive foods for 90 days.</detailed_description>
