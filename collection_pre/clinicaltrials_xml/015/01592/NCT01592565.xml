	<brief_summary>This study is being done to demonstrate a powerful new method for detecting heart disease that combines the proven prognostic capability of exercise stress testing with the superior image quality of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR). The investigators hope to demonstrate that exercise CMR has equivalent or superior diagnostic accuracy compared to exercise stress SPECT for detecting obstructive artery disease.</brief_summary>
