	<brief_summary>The effects of high serum glucose on bone could be direct or could be indirect through its effects on the microvasculature. Previous studies by Rendell et al and Brugler et al have found significant differences in skin blood flow between diabetics and control. The investigators are proposing that blood flow measurements of the skin may be correlated with bone remodeling rates in iliac bone biopsies.</brief_summary>
