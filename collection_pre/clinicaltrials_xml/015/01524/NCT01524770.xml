	<brief_summary>The study involves 2 injections of 1.5 milligrams (mg) dulaglutide, 1 given by a pre-filled manual syringe, the other given by an auto-injector. Injections will be separated by a minimum 28-day washout period. The study will evaluate if the levels of drug in the blood are similar when given by each method. Participation in the study is likely to take approximately 7 weeks, not including screening.</brief_summary>

Such participants will not be required to use contraception but must test negative for pregnancy at the time of enrollment Postmenopausal is defined as at least 1 year post cessation of menses (without an alternative medical cause) or spontaneous amenorrhea for 6 to 12 months, with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) â‰¥40 milliinternational units per milliliters (mIU/mL) Female participants who have undergone sterilization by tubal ligation agree to use a condom in conjunction with spermicidal gel, foam, cream, film or suppository from the time of screening until 3 months after the last dose of investigational product. Such participants must also test negative for pregnancy at the time of enrollment Have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 32.0 kilograms per meters squared (kg/m^2), inclusive, at screening Have clinical laboratory test results within the normal reference range for the population or investigator site, or results with acceptable deviations that are judged to be not clinically significant by the investigator Have venous access sufficient to allow for blood sampling as per the protocol Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study and are willing to follow study procedures and are willing to follow study restrictions Have given written informed consent approved by Lilly and the ethical review board (ERB) governing the site Are currently enrolled in or have completed or discontinued within the last 30 days from a clinical trial involving an investigational product, or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study Have known allergies to Glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP1) related compounds including dulaglutide, or any components of the formulation Are persons who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating dulaglutide in the 3 months prior to screening or have received glucagonlike peptides or incretin mimetics in the 3 months prior to screening Have an abnormality in the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study Have an abnormal blood pressure (after at least 5 minutes sitting) that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study Have a history or presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, endocrine, hematological, or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs; of constituting a risk when taking the study medication; or of interfering with the interpretation of data Have a history or presence of pancreatitis (history of chronic pancreatitis or idiopathic acute pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal disorder, for example relevant esophageal reflux or gall bladder disease, or any gastrointestinal disease which impacts gastric emptying (such as, gastric bypass surgery, pyloric stenosis, with the exception of appendectomy) or could be aggravated by GLP1 analogs. Participants with dyslipidemia, and participants who had cholecystolithiasis (removal of gall stones) and/or cholecystectomy (removal of gall bladder) in the past, with no further sequelae, may be included in the study at the discretion of the screening physician Show evidence of significant active neuropsychiatric disease Have family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or a genetic condition that predisposes to MTC Regularly use known drugs of abuse and/or show positive findings on urinary drug screening Show evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and/or positive human HIV antibodies Show evidence of hepatitis C and/or positive hepatitis C antibody Show evidence of hepatitis B and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen Are women with a positive pregnancy test or women who are lactating Have used or intend to use overthecounter medication other than acetaminophen within 7 days prior to dosing or prescription medication (with the exception of vitamin/mineral supplements and/or hormone replacement therapy [HRT]) within 14 days prior to dosing Have donated blood of more than 500 milliliters (mL) within the last month Have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week (males up to age 65) and 14 units per week (males over 65 and females), or are unwilling to adhere to the alcohol restrictions (1 unit = 12 ounces [oz] or 360 mL of beer; 5 oz or 150 mL of wine; 1.5 oz or 45 mL of distilled spirits) Smoke more than 10 cigarettes (or equivalent in nicotine) per day, and are unwilling to refrain from smoking on the day of dulaglutide administration or are unable to abide by clinical research unit (CRU) restrictions In the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, are unsuitable for inclusion in the study</criteria>
