	<brief_title>A Dose-Escalation Study in Participants With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will consist of the following parts: 1. Dose Escalation - Cohorts of at least 3 participants will be treated with increasing doses of LY2475655 until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) criteria are met in 1 of the 6 dose levels, or the 6th cohort is completed without meeting maximum tolerated dose criteria. 2. Dose Confirmation - Up to 10 more participants will be enrolled to the MTD dose level, or if it was not possible to define the MTD during dose escalation, all clinical and bioanalytical data will be reviewed to select the recommended Phase 2 dose and an up to 10 additional participants will be enrolled to this dose level.</detailed_description>
