	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomised, open-label phase IIb clinical trial assessing the effect of pegylated interferon alfa-2a(Pegasys®) 180 μg once weekly for 48 weeks added to an ongoing nucleos(t)ide based treatment in patients with chronic HBeAg-negative hepatitis B The primary objective of the trial is to investigate whether the add-on of pegylated interferon alfa-2a to a continued treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues increases the percentage of patients who have significant decrease (≥ 1log10) of HBs antigen after 48 weeks. 170 Patients with chronic hepatitis B, HBe antigen negative, already being treated with an oral antiviral regimen and having a nondetectable viral load for at least 12 months are included.</brief_summary>
