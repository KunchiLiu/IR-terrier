	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed, well differentiated (G1 or G2), advanced (unresectable or metastatic), neuroendocrine tumor of GI or lung origin No history of and no active symptoms related to carcinoid syndrome In addition to treatmentnaive patients, patients previously treated with SSA, Interferon (IFN), one prior line of chemotherapy, and/or PRRT are allowed into the study. Pretreated patients must have progressed on or after the last treatment Radiological documented disease progression within 6 months prior to randomization Measurable disease WHO performance status ≤1 Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, highgrade neuroendocrine carcinoma, adenocarcinoid, pancreatic islet cell carcinoma, insulinoma, glucagonoma, gastrinoma, goblet cell carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and small cell carcinoma Patients with pancreatic NET or NET of origins other than GI or Lung Patients with history of or active symptoms of carcinoid syndrome (e.g. flushing, diarrhea) Patients with more than one line of prior chemotherapy Prior targeted therapy Hepatic locoregional therapy within the last 6 months Prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus, deforolimus) Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycin analogs (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus) Known impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral everolimus Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as defined by HbA1c &gt;8% despite adequate therapy Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions such as: unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction ≤6 months prior to randomization, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia active or uncontrolled severe infection liver disease such as cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and chronic hepatitis (i.e. quantifiable HBVDNA and/or positive HbsAg, quantifiable HCVRNA) Chronic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents Known history of HIV seropositivity Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
