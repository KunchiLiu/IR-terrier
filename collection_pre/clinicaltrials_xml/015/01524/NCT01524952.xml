	<brief_summary>Objective: It is unclear whether prolonged electrical muscle stimulation can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and reduce body fat in obese subjects. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of prolonged combined thermal and electrical muscle stimulation (cTEMS) on peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) and body composition. We will also investigate the biochemical effects and the resultant lipolysis-related gene expression changes in adipocytes. Methods:Eleven obese (BMI≥30) individuals will receive cTEMS in three 60-minute sessions per week for 8 weeks. Activity levels and dietary habits will be kept unchanged and controlled with an accelerometer and nutritional questionnaire. Before and after the stimulation period, functional capacity are assessed by VO2 peak, and body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance analyses. Lipolytic activity will be determined in abdominal adipose tissue by 24 hours of microdialysis on a sedentary day, and adipose tissue biopsies will be taken for the gene expression analysis.</brief_summary>
