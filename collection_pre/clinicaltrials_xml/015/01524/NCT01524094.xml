	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if there is a difference in survival between two different treatment strategies for colorectal peritoneal surface disease. The control arm administered the currently considered standard treatment which is palliative systemic chemotherapy. The experimental arm received the combination treatment cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The investigators hypothesis is that the combination treatment will improve the overall survival.</brief_summary>
