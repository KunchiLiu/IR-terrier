	<brief_summary>This Post Marketing Surveillance study will be performed as an open-label, prospective, non-interventional, uncontrolled study in Human immunodeficit Virus-1 (HIV-1) infected patients. Data will only be documented in patients for whom a pharmacotherapy with nevirapine extended release is initiated. Both anti-retroviral therapy (ART) na√Øve patients and pre-treated patients switching from nevirapine immediate release or other anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will be included in the study. The decision to initiate treatment with nevirapine extended release is independent of this study and is based entirely on individual patient need and the judgement of the treating physician. The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy and treatment adherence of nevirapine extended release in HIV-1 infected patients in routine clinical practice. It is planned to document five visits for each patient over a twenty four week observational period.</brief_summary>
