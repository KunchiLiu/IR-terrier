	<brief_summary>Hip fractures are one of the most frequent operated fractures procedures in orthopedics, with a world wide annual incidence of approximately 1.7 million. These fractures are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. As populations age and life expectancy increases worldwide, the incidence of these fractures is likely to raise, expected to triple in the next 50 years. The use of fluoroscopy and resultant exposure to radiation, is an integral part of surgical procedures aiming to reduce and fixate the fractured femur. The risk of contracting cancer is significantly higher for an orthopedic surgeon as Hip surgery is a major slice of the total radiation dose. Optimal positioning and control of the imaging intensifier device may result in significant reduction of radiation dose and time and in substantial shortening of the procedure. The investigators hypothesis is that this technique would substantially shorten procedure time and reduce unnecessary radiation exposure for both the patient and the medical staff. Furthermore, by using this technique the investigators can eliminate the need for fluoroscopy technician during the surgery, as there is no need to alternate fluoroscopy views.</brief_summary>
