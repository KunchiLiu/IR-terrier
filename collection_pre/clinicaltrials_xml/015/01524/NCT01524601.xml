	<brief_summary>Renal transplant recipients need life long immunosuppression and one of the new drugs is everolimus. Everolimus is a potent immunosuppressive drug and one of the main side-effects are increased blood cholesterol levels. Many renal transplant recipients are treated with a cholesterol lowering agent, mainly fluvastatin. Rosuvastatin is a new cholesterol lowering drug on the market with a potential higher cholesterol lowering potency. In the present study the investigators will examine the hypothesis that rosuvastatin reduce cholesterol levels more than fluvastatin in renal transplant patients.</brief_summary>
