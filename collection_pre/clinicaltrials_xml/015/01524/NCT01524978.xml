	<brief_summary>This open-label, multi-center study will assess the efficacy and safety of Zelboraf (vemurafenib) in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancers (solid tumors and multiple myeloma, except melanoma and papillary thyroid cancer) and for whom Zelboraf is deemed the best treatment option in the opinion of the investigator. Patients will receive twice daily oral doses of 960 mg Zelboraf until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The safety and efficacy of Zelboraf in combination with cetuximab in a subset of patients with colorectal cancer will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
