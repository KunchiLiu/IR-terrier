	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the incidence of atopic asthma after three years old may be suppressed in the children who were born as preterm infants and prophylactically treated with palivizumab for respiratory syncytial (RS) virus infections during the infancy. The secondary objective is to determine whether the incidence of recurrent wheezing after three years old may be suppressed in the children who were born as preterm infants and prophylactically treated with palivizumab for RS virus infections during the infancy.</brief_summary>
