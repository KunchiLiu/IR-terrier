	<brief_title>Everolimus Post Pazopanib Treatment in Metastatic or Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A non-randomised, open label, single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 1st-line pazopanib followed by 2nd-line everolimus in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Subjects will receive initial therapy with pazopanib, followed, on progression, by 2nd-line therapy with everolimus. Study treatment, sequential treatment with pazopanib followed by everolimus, will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Written informed consent 2. Diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with clearcell component histology. 3. Locally advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma 4. Measurable lesion (RECIST 1.1) on physical exam or as CT/MRI 5. No prior systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic RCC 6. Karnofsky performance scale &gt;=70 7. Age &gt;=18 years 8. A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: nonchildbearing/agrees to use adequate contraception 9. A male with female partner of childbearing potential must have vasectomy/agree to use effective contraception from two weeks prior to administration of the 1st dose of study treatment for a period of time after the last dose of study treatment 10. Adequate organ function 11. Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and must not have clinically significant GIT abnormalities that may alter absorption Additional criterion for inclusion in the everolimus treatment: 12. The date of disease progression must be within six months of stopping pazopanib or during treatment with pazopanib 13. Measurable lesion at Everolimus C1D1 Scan (everolimus baseline) as per the RECIST 1.1 criteria 14. Patients with radiotherapy prior to Everolimus treatment period will be eligible only if all below requirements are fulfilled: The last radiotherapy fraction is delivered &gt; 4 weeks prior to first dose of everolimus The radiotherapy is not considered to be a second line treatment The previously irradiated lesion(s) are not considered as target lesion(s) for everolimus RECIST 1.1 assessment The radiotherapy field is not sufficiently close to the target lesion(s) so as to interfere with everolimus RECIST 1.1 assessments There is no ongoing toxicity that is &gt; Grade 1 and/or that is progressing in severity 16.Patients with central nervous system (CNS) progression or metastases during Pazopanib treatment period, will be eligible only if all below requirements are fulfilled: Are asymptomatic and neurologically stable shown by no requirement for steroids (to control CNS symptoms) or enzymeinducing anticonvulsants within 4 weeks prior to start of everolimus If the lesion was previously been treated locally (by surgery ± radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or gamma knife) the last local treatment should be at least &gt; 4 weeks prior to start of everolimus Lesions that have been previously irradiated or in an area subjected to other loco‐regional therapy are not considered as target lesion(s) for everolimus RECIST 1.1 assessment Have no presence of any nonhealing wound 1. Pregnant/lactating 2. History of another malignancy (unless have been diseasefree for 3 years) 3. History or clinical evidence of Central nervous system metastases (unless have previouslytreated CNS metastases and who meet both of the following criteria: a) are asymptomatic and b) have no requirement for steroids or enzymeinducing anticonvulsants in prior 6 month time interval. 4. Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities including, but not limited to: malabsorption syndrome, major resection of the stomach or small bowel that could affect the absorption of study drug, active peptic ulcer disease, known intraluminal metastatic lesion/s with suspected bleeding, Inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, or other gastrointestinal conditions with increased risk of perforation, history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra abdominal abscess 5. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class C) 6. Any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric, or other conditions that could interfere with patient's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study. 7. Subjects receiving chronic treatment with corticosteroids/other immunosuppressive agents 8. Subjects with a known history of HIV seropositivity 9. Subjects with active bleeding, bleeding diathesis or on oral antivitamin K medication (except low dose coumadin) 10. Presence of any severe or uncontrolled medical conditions/infection. 11. Currently receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy 12. Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 milliseconds 13. History of any one or more of the following cardiovascular conditions within the past 12 months: cardiac angioplasty or stenting, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, Class III or IV congestive heart failure, as defined by the New York Heart Association 14. Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure of &gt;=140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of &gt;=90mmHg). 15. History of cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months (unless recent DVT have been treated with therapeutic anticoagulating agents for at least 6 weeks) 16. Major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug and/or presence of any nonhealing wound, fracture, or ulcer. 17. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding susceptibility. 18. Known endobronchial lesion and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels that increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrage 19. Recent haemoptysis in excess of 2.5ml within eight weeks of first dose of study drug. 20. Use of an investigational agent, including an investigational anticancer agent, within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study drug. 21. Any ongoing toxicity from prior anticancer therapy that is &gt;Grade 1 and/or that is progressing in severity, except alopecia. 22. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to pazopanib or everolimus, to other rapamycin derivatives or to any other excipients. Additional criterion for exclusion in the everolimus treatment: 23. The subject is felt by the investigator to be unsuitable (on the basis of health, compliance, or for any other reason) for inclusion in the study. 24. Presence of any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions</criteria>
