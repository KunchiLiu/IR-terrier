	<brief_title>Understanding the Physiological Implications of Scanning Kelvin Probe Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Scanning Kelvin Probe measures the electrical potential of material surfaces without actually touching it. Although this technology has been applied to non-living materials (e.g. metal and semiconductors) before, it has not been effectively applied to biological materials, much less to live human skin . This project aims to evaluate the use of Scanning Kelvin Probe to live human skin by investigating the effects of skin thickness, skin moisture, and sweat glands on Kelvin Probe measurements of electrical potential. Testing will be performed on the arms and hands of twenty four healthy individuals under different study conditions.</detailed_description>
