	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) for Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients with concurrent depression or anxiety symptoms. All treatment in this project is given as an adjunct to Standard Medical Treatment (SMT). ICBT will be compared to an Internet-based active control treatment (ICONTROL) and to SMT alone. It is hypothesized that both active treatments will be superior to SMT, and that ICBT will be superior to ICONTROL, in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.</brief_summary>
