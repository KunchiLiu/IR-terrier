	<brief_title>Observational Study of B-Cell Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL) Associated With Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main objectives are: - Description of the clinical and histological characteristics, treatment and evolution of these NHL. - Study their physiopathology by immunological, virologic and molecular studies. The study included prospective or retrospective patients with B- Cell Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) associated with chronic hepatitis C. The patients are diagnosed or in remission of lymphoma, in relapse or failure of treatments. The enrolment period is 6 years and the total study lasts 8 years. - "Prospective patients" are followed every 6 months during one year, and all the years during 2 or 5 years. - "Retropective patients" are followed all the years during 2 or 5 years. At each follow-up, a blood sample of 50ml is withdrawn allowing ancillary studies. The enrollment is estimated at 140 patients.</detailed_description>
