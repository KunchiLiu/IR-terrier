	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determinate whether inspiratory muscle training (IMT) associated with a conventional respiratory rehabilitation program is more effective than a conventional respiratory rehabilitation program alone,on Dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects with a normal maximum inspiratory pressure (IP &gt; 60 cmH2O).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Inspiratory Muscle Training on Dyspnea in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dyspnea is the main complaint of patients with COPD. Dyspnea is explained largely by the distension, objectified by measuring inspiratory capacity (IC), which places the diaphragm at a disadvantage to be effective, which raises the sensation of dyspnea. Currently, inspiratory muscles training is recommended by the French-language Society of Pneumology, in case of an objective reduction of the strength of these muscles (corresponding to maximum inspiratory pressure &lt;60 cm H20).</detailed_description>
