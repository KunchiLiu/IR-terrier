	<brief_summary>The Evia HF-T and the Entovis HF-T are triple-chamber pacemakers for cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT-P). The objective of this study is to prove the safety and efficacy of these pacemakers. In particular, the left ventricular (LV) capture control feature is evaluated, which automatically measures the LV pacing threshold and subsequently adjusts the pacing output.</brief_summary>
