	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a common comorbidity of Parkinson's disease (PD). The background incidence rate of CV events in a levodopa-treated PD population was assessed to better understand these comorbidities in the PD population. One objective of the study is to identify a population of prevalent PD patients with incident levodopa use within the years 2004-2010 on the Integrated Health Care Information Services (IHCIS) database. The second objective is to report the incidence of CV events overall and during intervals 0-6, 6-12 and 12-18 months after first prescription of levodopa among all new levodopa users.</brief_summary>
