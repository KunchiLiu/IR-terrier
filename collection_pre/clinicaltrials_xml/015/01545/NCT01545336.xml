	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this clinical trial is to study the safety and efficacy of anastrozole in adults diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The study will evaluate how well the drug is tolerated. The study will also evaluate if anastrozole effects estradiol (E2) hormone levels, a sex hormone, and improves the function of the lower right chamber of the heart (right ventricle).</brief_summary>
