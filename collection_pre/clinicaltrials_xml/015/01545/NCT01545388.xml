	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of the addition of metformin once daily (q.d.) or twice daily (b.i.d.) to sitagliptin monotherapy in Japanese participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have inadequate glycemic control with diet/exercise therapy and sitagliptin monotherapy. The primary hypotheses are that the addition of metformin 250 mg b.i.d. or metformin 500 mg q.d. is superior to the addition of placebo on the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 24 weeks and that the addition of metformin 500 mg q.d. is non-inferior to the addition of metformin 250 mg b.i.d. on the change from baseline in HbA1c at 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
