	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess in adult patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of SAR156597 administered subcutaneously (SC) once weekly over a 6-week period. Secondary Objectives: To assess in adult patients with IPF: - The pharmacodynamic effects of SAR156597, as measured on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), pulse oximetry and patient reported outcome and peripheral blood biomarkers. - The trough plasma concentrations of SAR156597 - The potential immunogenicity of SAR156597.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days, treatment period of up to 6 weeks and a post-treatment follow-up period of up to 12 weeks. Total study duration is up to 22 weeks.</detailed_description>
