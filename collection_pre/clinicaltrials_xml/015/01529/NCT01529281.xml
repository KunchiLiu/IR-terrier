	<brief_summary>It is well documented that exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) decreases muscle function and causes severe soreness and discomfort. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation has been shown to increase protein synthesis and decrease muscle protein breakdown, however, the effects of BCAAs on recovery from EIMD are unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of a BCAA supplement on markers of muscle damage.</brief_summary>
