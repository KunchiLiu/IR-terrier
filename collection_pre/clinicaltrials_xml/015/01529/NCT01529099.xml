	<criteria>Male or female subjects, aged at least 21 years. Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in this clinical investigation and from whom consent has been obtained. Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, are able to understand this clinical investigation, cooperate with the investigational procedures and are willing to return to the hospital for all the required postoperative followups. Subject has noninflammatory degenerative joint disease (NIDJD), including: osteoarthritis, posttraumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis and chondrocalcinosis. Subject has a functional stable knee. Subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, is suitable for either a single or bicompartmental knee replacement. Subject meets the following selected radiographic parameters: Xray evaluation confirms the presence of NIDJD Disease location: 1 to 2 compartments, maximum. Disease can be present in the patellofemoral compartment, the medial tibiofemoral compartment, lateral tibiofemoral compartments alone or in any two compartments. Disease severity: Kellgren and Lawrence44 Grade II or greater for all compartments replaced. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, have an existing condition that would compromise their participation and followup in this clinical investigation. Women who are pregnant. Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that could affect followup care or treatment outcomes. Subjects who have participated in a clinical investigation with an investigational product in the last 3 months. Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims. Multiple joint involvement that will compromise rehabilitation (for example: advanced hip, ankle or spine disease). Known to be a prisoner, mentally incompetent, an alcohol / drug abuser, involved in medicallegal case or worker's compensation Previous knee arthroplasty (any type) in any one of the three compartments of the knee. Requires more than a lateral soft tissue release or an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Uncorrectable anatomical tibiofemoral angle. Bone deficiency requiring structural bone grafts to support the implants. Previous patellectomy. For Subjects indicated for a patellofemoral arthroplasty, Subject has uncorrected patella baja (CatonDeschamps ratio less than or equal to 0.6). Tricompartmental disease process (patellafemoral, medial tibiofemoral and lateral tibiofemoral). Active bacterial infection that may spread to other areas of the body (e.g., osteomyelitis, pyogenic infection of knee joint, urinary tract infection, etc.). Significant neurological or musculoskeletal deformity or a disease that may affect gait or weight bearing, (e.g., muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, amputation). Known allergy to implant materials.</criteria>
