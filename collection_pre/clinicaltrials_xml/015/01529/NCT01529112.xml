	<brief_title>A Study Comparing the Combination of the Best Supportive Care Plus E7080 Versus Best Supportive Care Alone, in Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer or Lung Cancer That Has Spread, Who Have Been Previously Treated, Unsuccessfully, With at Least 2 Different Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized Phase II study will consist of a 2-arm design, comparing E7080 + BSC (Arm 1) with placebo + BSC (Arm 2). Participants will be randomized in the ratio of 2:1 to receive either E7080 or placebo in a blinded manner.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Age greater than or equal to 18 years; 2. Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsquamous NSCLC with locally advanced or metastatic disease based on Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, Seventh Edition, who had failed at least two lines of systemic anticancer therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC (did not include adjuvant chemotherapy). In countries where erlotinib was approved and marketed for the treatment of NSCLC, participants must have received erlotinib treatment (or gefitinib for participants outside of the US) for their NSCLC if they had known EGFRactivating mutations. Participants of unknown EGFR status who had not received prior erlotinib (or gefitinib) should have been tested for EGFRactivating mutations prior to study entry. In countries where crizotinib was approved and marketed, participants must have received crizotinib treatment for NSCLC that was ALKpositive. Participants with ALK positive NCSLC or participants with KRAS mutations were not required to have prior treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib 3. Participants must have at least 1 site of measurable disease by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v.1.1); 4. ECOG PS of 0 to 2; 5. Participants must have adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula; 6. Blood pressure must be wellcontrolled (less than or equal to140/90 mm Hg at Screening) with or without antihypertensive medication. Participants must have no history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy; 7. Participants must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 109/L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 109/L; 8. Participants must have adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the ULN, and alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 x ULN (in the case of liver metastases, less than or equal to 5 x ULN). 9. Participants must have adequate coagulation system function as defined by prothrombin time/International normalized ratio (INR) less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN. 10. Male or female participants of childproducing potential must agree to use double barrier contraception, oral contraceptives, or avoidance of pregnancy measures during the study and for 90 days after the last day of treatment; 11. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test; 12. Females may not be breastfeeding; 13. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria 1. Prior therapy with E7080 or other small molecule vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors; 2. Presence of brain metastases, unless the participant has received adequate treatment at least 4 weeks prior to randomization, and is stable, asymptomatic, and off steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization; 3. Meningeal carcinomatosis; 4. Received chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or immunotherapy within the 21 days prior to commencing study treatment or have not recovered from all treatmentrelated toxicities to Grade less than or equal to 2, except for alopecia; 5. Received treatment with another investigational agent within the 30 days prior to commencing study treatment or participants who have not recovered from side effects of an investigational drug to Grade less than or equal to 2, except for alopecia; 6. Participants with proteinuria greater than 1+ on urine dipstick testing will undergo 24hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with 24hour urine protein greater than or equal to 1 g/24 hours will be ineligible; 7. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, bone fracture, or have undergone a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within the 28 days prior to commencing study treatment. 8. Major surgery scheduled during the projected course of the study; 9. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy; 10. Active hemoptysis (defined as bright red blood of a half teaspoon or more) within the 30 days prior to study entry; 11. Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, significant bowel resection, or any other medical condition that would preclude adequate absorption or result in the inability to take oral medication; 12. Other malignancy within 3 years of randomization, with the exception of adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or nonmelanoma skin cancer, with no subsequent evidence of recurrence and/or malignancies diagnosed at a stage where definitive therapy results in near certain cures. 13. Significant cardiovascular impairment (history of congestive heart failure New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class greater than II, unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, or serious cardiac arrhythmia); 14. Any history of cerebral vascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), or Grade greater than or equal to 2 peripheral vascular disease unless they have had no evidence of active disease for at least 6 months prior to randomization; 15. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within the 6 months prior to enrollment; 16. Participants with organ allografts requiring immunosuppression; 17. Known positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C positive; 18. Hypersensitivity to E7080 or any of the excipients; 19. Any history of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the participant's ability to safely complete the study.</criteria>
