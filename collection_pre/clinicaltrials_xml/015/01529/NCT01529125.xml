	<brief_summary>It is unclear whether children with HIV and severe acute malnutrition can be started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) safely while they are still malnourished and the manner in which this therapy should start. This study will examine the safety, efficacy, and metabolism of children started on HAART while still severely malnourished.</brief_summary>
