	<brief_summary>This is a open controlled trial in which 48 HIV-1 patients successfully treated with EFV/FTC/TDF will be randomized to one of 4 groups in equal proportion between arms (1:1). The four arms are as follows: Arm I: EFV / FTC / TDF (n = 12) Arm II: EFV / FTC / TDF + LST (n = 12) Arm III: FTC / TDF + MK-0518 (n = 12) Arm IV: FTC / TDF + LST + MK-0518 (n = 12) The allocation will take place in two phases: Phase I: 24 patients 1:1 receiving EFV/FTC/TDF vs. EFV/FTC/TDF + Losartan If losartan arm shows benefits we will proceed to the second phase: Phase II: 24 patients 1:1 to receive FTC/TDF+ MK-0518 versus FTC/TDF + MK-0518 + losartan. Patients will be followed up during 12 months to determinate the proportion of patients with decreased collagen deposition in TL equal to or greater than 50%.</brief_summary>
