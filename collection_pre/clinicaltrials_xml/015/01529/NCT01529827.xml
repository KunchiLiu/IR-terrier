	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well giving fludarabine phosphate, melphalan, and low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) works in treating patients with hematologic malignancies. Giving chemotherapy drugs such as fludarabine phosphate and melphalan, and low-dose TBI before a donor PBSCT helps stop the growth of cancer and abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from the donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cell from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and methotrexate after transplant may stop this from happening</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine Phosphate, Melphalan, and Low-Dose Total-Body Irradiation Followed by Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the transplant related mortality (TRM) of this reduced-intensity transplantation (RIT) combination, fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), melphalan, and TBI in a patient population usually not eligible for a full a myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate clinical response, progression free survival (PFS) at one year, engraftment rate, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) incidence with the proposed RIT regimen across a variety of hematological conditions. II. Correlative studies will include chimerism analysis by molecular analysis and evaluation of immune reconstitution by cytomegalovirus (CMV) dextramer analysis using flow cytometry. OUTLINE: PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -5 to -2 and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -2. Patients undergo low-dose TBI twice daily (BID) on day -1. TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0. GvHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) BID on days -1 to 100 with taper over 4-6 months, MMF PO or IV every 6-8 hours on days -1 to 60, and methotrexate IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 6. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

unrelated donors a single antigen mismatch at HLA A, B, or C, +/ additional single allele level mismatch at A, B, V or DRB1 Minimum goal for peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) dose is 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg of recipient weight; minimum goal for the marrow dose is 1 x 10^8 nucleated cells/kg of recipient weight No serious uncontrolled psychiatric illness No concomitant active malignancy that would be expected to require chemotherapy within 3 years of transplant (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) Nonpregnant and nonnursing woman; (women or men with reproductive potential should agree to use an effective means of birth control) Patients who have failed a prior autologous or allogeneic transplant are eligible; however, at least 90 days must have elapsed between the start of this reduced intensity conditioning regimen and the last transplant if patient had a prior autologous or myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) At least 2 weeks since prior chemotherapy, radiation treatment and/or surgery Informed consent DONOR: Compatibility at the four most informative HLA loci: A, B, C and DRB1 are important for reducing the risk of GVHD and successful transplant outcomes; the A, B, C and DRB1 loci comprise 8 possible alleles (a haplotype being inherited from each parent); one additional locus, HLADQ, is also typed to ascertain haplotypes and assist in the search for a compatible donor; however mismatching at DQ has not been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes; high resolution molecular typing (at the allele level) is now the standard of care for unrelated donor searches and allows greater refinement of the search strategy DONOR: Matched related donor: a single antigen mismatch at A, B, or the DR transplant from a family member is associated with a higher risk of GVHD but similar overall survival when compared to full identity at these 3 regions; related donor/recipient pairs must be matched at 5 of 6 HLA antigens (A, B, DRB1) DONOR: Unrelated Donor: When evaluating patients for unrelated donor transplant, the higher degree of matching, the lower risk of GvHD; the A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 loci, comprising 10 possible antigen (with alleles), will be typed for all unrelated transplants; given the higher risk of TRM in mismatched transplants, RIT is often the best way to mitigate the risk; data from the National Marrow Donor Program makes it possible to estimate the risk of donorrecipient HLA mismatch at the allele or antigen level; the higher risk from HLAmismatching must be balanced against the clinical urgency and the patient's risk by the transplant team; at this time, antigen level mismatches at DQB1 do not affect outcomes and will not be used for matching purposes for donor selection; thus, the matching required will be at the HLA A, B, C and DRB1 (8 loci); for this protocol, a single antigen mismatch at the HLA A, B, C, with or without additional single allele level mismatch may participate in this protocol for voluntary unrelated donors (blood or marrow) DONOR: Donor must be healthy and have nonreactive test results for all infectious disease assays as required by state and federal regulations; donors who screen seropositive for hepatitis an/or syphilis must be cleared by infectious disease consultation DONOR: Donor must have no uncontrolled cardiopulmonary, renal, endocrine, hepatic or psychiatric disease to render donation unsafe DONOR: The donor (or parent in minor) must give informed consent for peripheral blood stem cell collection or bone marrow collection DONOR: Syngeneic donors are not eligible DONOR: Donors who have poor peripheral venous access, may require central venous line placement for stem cell apheresis Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) disease (for hematologic malignancies) Karnofsky (adult) or Lansky (for =&lt;
