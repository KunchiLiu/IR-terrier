	<brief_title>Long Term Efficiency of the Hair2Go Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Hair2Go device is intended for short-term and long-term removal of unwanted hair adjunctive to shaving. The device uses a technology called El≈çs, which is a combination of electrical field at radio frequencies (RF) and intense optical energy, that are simultaneously applied to the tissue and were found to have synergistic effects. Thus, lower levels of both energies are used to facilitate the treatment for individuals of all skin types and hair colors. This study is a multicenter study. Subjects that completed the basic treatments of previous Hair2Go studies (OHR-2, OHR-3, or OHR-5-Face) will be offered the option to enroll in this study that will not include treatments. The individual data collected in the OHR-2 (and its extensions, i.e. OHR2-P and OHR2-1Y), OHR-3, and OHR-5-Face studies will be used for the analysis together with data gathered in this study. Photographs of the previously treated areas will be taken 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the last basic treatment if they were not already taken as part of the OHR-2, one of its extensions (i.e. OHR2-P and OHR2-1Y), or OHR-5-Face.</detailed_description>
