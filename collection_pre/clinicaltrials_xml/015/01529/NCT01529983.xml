	<brief_title>Fractional Laser vs. Ultrasound for Periorbital Wrinkles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized comparison study comparing the efficacy of micro-focused ultrasound versus fractionated carbon dioxide laser for treatment of periorbital wrinkles. Subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. The treated sites are both lower eyelids and lateral orbits. Each side will be randomized to receive 1550nm-fractionated laser treatment on one side and the contralateral side will receive micro-focused ultrasound treatment every 6-8 weeks for a total of 2 treatments.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Age 3560 years old male and female subjects with moderate lower eyelid rhytids and crowsfeet 2. Subjects with Fitzpatrick skin type IIII. 3. Subjects who are willing, have the ability to understand and provide informed consent, and are able to communicate with the investigator. 1. Subjects who have received injectable softtissue augmentation materials to the face, or facial ablative resurfacing, within the past 6 months. 2. Subjects who were received injectable botulinum toxin to the face, or any nonablative laser treatment to the face, within the past 3 months. 3. Subjects who have local infections, open facial wounds, or other significant local skin disease that would interfere with periorbital treatment with energy devices. 4. Subjects who are allergic to lidocaine or prilocaine. 5. Subjects who have a history of abnormal scarring in the treatment area. 6. Subject who have ectropion or or other eyelid disfigurement. 7.
