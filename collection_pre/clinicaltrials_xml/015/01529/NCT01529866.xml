	<brief_summary>Integration success rates measured by lack of implant mobility and crestal bone regression measurement will be higher for the experimental implant design than for the control implants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Integration Success of an Implant System With a Novel Abutment Attachment Design in Immediate Loading Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study patients are randomized to receive either the experimental implant system or the control Nanotite Certain Tapered (standard abutment connection) and assessed for integration success measured by cumulative success rate in cases that are loaded immediately</detailed_description>
