	<brief_summary>Integration success rates and the preservation of crestal bone will be higher for the experimental device than for the control implants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of the Effect of an Implant System With a Novel Abutment Attachment Design on Crestal Bone Preservation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study patients are randomized to receive either the experimental implant system or the control Nanotite Certain Tapered (standard abutment connection) and assessed for integration success measured by lack of implant mobility and lack of bone loss obtained at various study time points</detailed_description>
