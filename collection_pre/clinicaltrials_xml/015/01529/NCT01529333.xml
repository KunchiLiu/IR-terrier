	<brief_title>Middle-Ear Implant With MET V Transducer (Aka MET V System)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MET V System is an investigational, fully-implantable middle ear hearing prosthesis. A mixed hearing loss has both a sensorineural component and a conductive component that results when sound being delivered to an impaired cochlea is attenuated by a disordered outer or middle ear.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult men or women, 18 years of age or older Moderate to severe mixed hearing loss, as a result of a combination of sensorineural hearing loss and chronic ear disease, prior failed tympanoplasties, severe otosclerosis, radical mastoidectomy, or congenital abnormality as evidenced by the following in the ear to be implanted: Bone conduction thresholds are measurable at 0.5,1,2,3 and 4 kHz Bone conduction thresholds are 20 dB or poorer at greater than 2 kHz Air conduction thresholds are 35 dB or poorer at 0.5,1,2,3 and 4 kHz Airbone gap in ear to be implanted is greater than 15 dB at three or more frequencies from 0.5 4 kHz Word recognition appropriate for sensorineural component of loss Nonfluctuating and stable hearing status a. as defined as by no significant change or progression in the bone conduction thresholds &gt;15dB at two consecutive octaves for at least 12 months. English Speaking (fluent) Realistic expectations for the device Willingness to sign the informed consent and participate in the study Vestibular disorder, including Meniere's Syndrome Recurring otitis media over the past year (&gt;2/year) Nonorganic hearing loss Retrocochlear hearing loss Central auditory nervous system disorder Medical contraindications to surgery or use of the device Women who are pregnant or at risk of becoming pregnant Developmentally delayed or manifesting organic brain dysfunction Persons with physical or geographic limitations that may render them incapable of completing scheduled study visits</criteria>
