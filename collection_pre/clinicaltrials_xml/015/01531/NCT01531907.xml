	<brief_summary>This study has been designed to study differences bone turnover in relation to glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) following feeding in lean and obese premenopausal women. Given the preliminary evidence that GLP-2 may act directly on osteoclasts, the investigators plan to determine whether GLP2 receptors are expressed in osteoclasts and the effect of GLP-2 on bone resorption. Hypotheses: 1. Acute responses of GLP-2 and bone resorption markers following feeding are affected by body fat mass. 2. Serum levels of GLP-2 are lower in obese pre-menopausal women and are associated with a reduction in trabecular and/or cortical bone mass 3. GLP-2 has direct actions on osteoclast resorption via a functional receptor</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study objectives: 1. To determine if differences in baseline serum levels of GLP-2 are related to differences in bone microarchitecture, structure and strength at the distal tibia and distal radius between obese and lean premenopausal females. 2. To determine whether obesity in premenopausal females influences levels of circulating GLP-2 following a standardised glucose meal with a resultant change in markers of bone formation and resorption 3. To test whether GLP-2 directly affects osteoclast function via an identifiable receptor</detailed_description>
