	<brief_summary>- Open-label, single-arm, phase II study of bevacizumab (AvastinTM) in combination with alternating Xeliri and Xelox as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. - Primary objective: PFS, To assess overall resectability in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, postoperative morbidity and outcomes after resection. - Secondary objectives: To assess response rates according to RECIST criteria, failure free survival (TTF) and overall survival (OS), Quality of life according to 15D questionnaire, To radiologically assess tumour density and morphology, and assess alternative radiologic response evaluation in comparison with RECIST response criteria, Biomarker evaluation to measure plasma biomarkers, tumour blocks and DNA polymorphisms that may predict drug effects, safety, resectability and clinical behaviour of the tumour</brief_summary>

Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test done prior to the administration of bevacizumab. Patient and their partner should have adequate contraception up to at least 6 months after last treatment completion or the last drug dose, whatever happens first 8. Signed written informed consent according to ICH/GCP and the local regulations (approved by the Independent Ethics Committee [IEC]) will be obtained prior to any study specific screening procedures 9. Patient must be able to comply with the protocol 1. Prior treatment with firstline chemotherapy for metastatic CRC 2. Adjuvant treatment within 6 months 3. Major surgical procedure (placing of central venous access device and liver biopsy etc are considered minor procedure), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 0 (Patients must have recovered from any major surgery) 4. Near future planned radiotherapy for underlying disease (prior completed radiotherapy treatment allowed) 5. Clinical or radiological evidence of CNS metastases 6. Past or current history within the last 2 years of malignancies except for the indication under this study and curatively treated basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or insitu carcinoma of the cervix 7. Serious nonhealing wound or ulcer 8. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy 9. Uncontrolled hypertension 10.

Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to enrolment 12. Evidence of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the treatment or patient at high risk from treatment complications 13. Chronic daily intake of aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or clopidogren (&gt; 75 mg/day) 14. Pregnancy (positive serum pregnancy test) and lactation 15. Any other serious or uncontrolled illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes it undesirable for the patient to enter the trial</criteria>
