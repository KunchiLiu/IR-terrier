	<brief_summary>Honey available in New Zealand can contain the toxins tutin and hyenanchin. Tutin is produced by several plants native to New Zealand. Bees collect honeydew contaminated with tutin and hyenanchin for honey production. Honey contaminated with high levels of tutin has caused cases of poisoning in New Zealand since the 1800s, with the most recent outbreak in 2008. The study aims to find out how tutin and hyenanchin are absorbed and processed by the body. This information will help the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) give guidance on acceptable levels of tutin and hyenanchin in honey. About 6 healthy men will each take a single dose of honey containing known concentrations of tutin and hyenanchin. This dose level is similar to what someone who eats a lot of honey would consume, if the honey contained the maximum level of tutin allowed under the Food Standards Code. Blood tests to measure tutin and hyenanchin levels will be taken at certain times after dosing, and any side effects will be recorded.</brief_summary>
