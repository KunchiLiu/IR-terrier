	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Oxaliplatin Plus S-1 for Treatment of Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There was no evidence of standard chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) in China. Fluoropyrimidines and cisplatin have been widely used in a variety of combinations in the treatment of AGC. Capecitabine/cisplatin combination therapy showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 41- 55%, a median time to progression/progression free survival (TTP/PFS) of 5.6-6.3 months, and a median overall survival (OS) of 10.1-10.5 months. Though no studies have compared two oral fluoropyrimidines in combination with oxaliplatin, both S-1 and capecitabine appear to be comparable in terms of efficacy and safety. The investigators conducted a phase II trial of oxaliplatin combined with S-1 in the treatment of first-line AGC.</detailed_description>
