	<brief_title>A Research Study to Evaluate the Effects of Repeated Intravitreal Injections on Bacteria Around the Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether conjunctival bacterial flora are altered and/or demonstrate increasing antibiotic resistance after serial intravitreal injections when a prophylactic topical antibiotic is used pre- and post-injection compared to when they are not used.</detailed_description>
