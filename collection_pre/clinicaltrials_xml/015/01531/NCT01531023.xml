	<brief_summary>The prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria found in urine sample cultures has been increasing over the past decades. The study hypothesis is to assess the clinical and microbiological outcome of pivmecillinam treatment of ESBL producing E. coli and K. Pneumoni, as well as to observe the clinical and microbiological outcome of the same group of bacteria treated with other antiinfectious agents. Samples are gathered in primary care setting.</brief_summary>
