	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of CVD 1208S, a Live, Attenuated Oral Vaccine to Prevent Shigella Infection Using cGMP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two purposes for conducting this Vaccine Study to evaluate an experimental vaccine called CVD 1208S (Center for Vaccine Development 1208S): 1) to learn whether CVD 1208S causes side effects, and 2) to learn whether the CVD 1208S gives people immunity to Shigella.</detailed_description>
