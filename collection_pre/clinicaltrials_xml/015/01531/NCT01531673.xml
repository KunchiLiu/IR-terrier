	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of VX-661 alone and when coadministered with ivacaftor in subjects with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of VX-661 Alone and in Combination With Ivacaftor in Subjects Homozygous or Heterozygous to the F508del-Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator(CFTR) Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, study of VX 661 monotherapy, and VX 661/ivacaftor co-therapy in subjects with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation. This study will be separated into seven groups: Group 1-7, respectively. Approximately 180 subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 4:1; active drug to matching placebo in each group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female with confirmed diagnosis of CF Must have the F508delCFTR gene mutation in both alleles (Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Group 7 subjects must have the F508delCFTR mutation on 1 allele, and gating mutation G551D on the second allele and have been on their physician prescribed 150 mg KalydecoTM q12h (commercially available ivacaftor) for at least 28 days at the Screening Visit. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second(FEV1) 40% to 90% (inclusive) of predicted normal for age, gender, and height (Knudson standards) at screening Weight &gt;40 kg and BMI &gt;18.5 Subjects of childbearing potential and who are sexually active must meet the contraception requirements. History of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject.

History of solid organ or hematological transplantation Participation in a clinical study involving administration of either an investigational or a marketed drug within 30 days or 5 terminal halflives (whichever is longer) before screening History of alcohol, medication, or illicit drug abuse within 1 year prior to screening Pregnant, breastfeeding, or not willing to follow contraception requirements</criteria>
