	<brief_summary>Data indicate that neurological prognostication is difficult after cardiac arrest if mild therapeutic hypothermia is part of the post resuscitation care. Cerebral oxygenation detected by near-infrared spectroscopy, could be a new, non-invasive index marker for outcome assessment after cardiac arrest. The investigators hypothesize that cardiac arrest survivors with a continuously low cerebral oxygenation index have a poor prognosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The measurement of cerebral oxygen saturation by a non-invasive near-infrared monitor, INVOSÂ® (In-Vivo Optical Spectroscopy; Covidien) can detect changes in oxygen levels reflecting regional blood oxygen saturation of the brain tissue beneath the sensor. If this monitoring can add further information towards reliable prognostication after cardiac arrest is unknown so far.</detailed_description>
