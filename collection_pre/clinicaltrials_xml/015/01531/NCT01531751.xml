	<brief_title>High Cut-off Hemodialysis in Patients With Advanced Cardiac AL Amyloidosis and End Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single-center phase II open label trial. Subjects with advanced cardiac AL amyloidosis and end-stage renal disease will undergo HCO-HD while receiving chemotherapy for their plasma cell dyscrasia according to the current standards of care. After giving written informed consent, the patients will be evaluated for eligibility. Briefly, the subjects with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of AL amyloidosis who are cardiac stage 3 based on NT-proBNP (&gt; 332 ng/L) and cTnI (&gt; 100 ng/L) and whose estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is &lt; 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 will be eligible for the study. Patients with non-AL (e.g. familial and senile) amyloidosis will be excluded, as well as subjects who have less than 100 mg/L circulating amyloidogenic FLC. Sixteen patients will be enrolled. The study includes 3 periods: screening, treatment followed by the end-of-treatment evaluation and follow-up. During dialysis the patients will undergo the first cycle of chemotherapy according to the current standard of care for subjects with advanced cardiac AL amyloidosis. Measurements of FLC and cardiac biomarkers will be done before and after each dialysis session. High cutoff HD will be continued during the first chemotherapy cycle. After the first cycle the end-of-treatment evaluation will take place. Follow-up evaluations will be performed after the end of each subsequent chemotherapy cycle and every 2 months after chemotherapy discontinuation for 1 year or until disease progression occurs.</detailed_description>
