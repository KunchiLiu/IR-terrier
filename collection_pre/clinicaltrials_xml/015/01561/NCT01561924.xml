	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of this trial is to evaluate the basal and spiked TEG® (Thromboelastography) or ROTEM® (Thromboelastometry) profiles of frequently bleeding haemophilia subjects with inhibitors in a non-bleeding state.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction of the Efficacy of Activated Recombinant Human Factor VII in Adult Congenital Haemophilia A or B Patients With Inhibitors by Use of Thromboelastography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TEG parameters are: R time (Reaction Time), K time (K Time (arbitrary measurement)), a (a angle), MA (Maximum Amplitude) and LY30 (Lysis 30 min after MA) while the ROTEM parameters are: CT (Clotting Time), CFT (Clot Formation Time), a (a angle), MCF (Maximum Clot Firmness) and LI60 (Lysis index 60 min after CT)</detailed_description>
