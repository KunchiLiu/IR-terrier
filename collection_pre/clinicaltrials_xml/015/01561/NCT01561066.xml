	<brief_summary>Adjuvant use of fibrin glue in the fistula tract may promote healing in low-output enterocutaneous fistulas. However, there are only few studies that report autologous glue application in a larger patient group or clinical-controlled studies in this setting. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous platelet-rich fibrin glue (PRFG) in the treatment of low-output digestive fistulas and compare them with conservative management without the use of adjuvant application of FG into the fistulous tract.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Fibrin Glues for Fistulas Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sudden appearance of intestinal contents draining from an abdominal incision is an emotionally devastating experience for both patients and surgeons. An enterocutaneous fistulas (ECF) is an abnormal communication between the bowel lumen and skin, often associated with fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, malnutrition, and sepsis. It is reported that spontaneous fistula closure rates vary from 15% to 71% after conservative treatment with wound care, control of infection, and nutritional support. Sufficient time should be allotted for the ECF to heal with conservative treatment, which also results in long-term discomfort. Adjuvant use of fibrin glue (FG) in the fistula tract may promote healing in low-output ECF. Containing high concentrations of human fibrinogen and thrombin, FG have been used extensively in many surgical fields as a biological adhesive system for tissue adhesion or hemostasis. Different types of FG are now employed: commercially produced and homemade autologous adhesives. Currently available FDA-approved commercial products such as Tisseel, Artiss (Baxter, Westlake Village, CA, USA), and Evicel (Johnson &amp; Johnson, Somerville, NJ, USA) are widely used in clinical applications. Risks of infection transmission, allergic reactions, and also the high cost, however, still make autologous FG attractive. Additionally, in comparison with other adhesives, autologous compounds have several advantages in terms of biocompatibility and biodegradation. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous platelet-rich fibrin glue (PRFG) in the treatment of low-output digestive fistulas and compare them with conservative management without the use of adjuvant application of FG into the fistulous tract.</detailed_description>
