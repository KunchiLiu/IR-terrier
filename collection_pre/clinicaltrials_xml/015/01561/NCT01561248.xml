	<brief_summary>The investigators examined the outcome of patients with severe Enterohaemorrhagic E. Coli (EHEC) O104:H4 infection suffering from bloody diarrhoea that were at risk to develop hemolytic uremic syndrome and underwent repetitive whole bowl lavage during hospitalization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Repetitive Intestinal Lavage in Patients With EHEC Associated Hemorrhagic Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the 2011 German EHEC O104:H4 outbreak, centered in the area of Hamburg, 33 patients with EHEC associated hemorrhagic colitis were admitted to the first Department of Medicine of the Hamburg University medical centre. The first 12 patients were treated symptomatically and received intravenous rehydration up to three liters daily. Prompted by a good clinical response after whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol-solution (PEG)in patient 13 all subsequent admitted patients (n=21) were treated with PEG-solution ( 2 liters on admission followed by one liter per day during the clinical course). During the hospital course blood work was obtained every day and patients were examined for clinical symptoms. Thrombocytopenia below 100.000/microliter was defined as a threshold for initiating therapeutic plasmapheresis to prevent the onset of hemolytic syndrome on an early stage.</detailed_description>
