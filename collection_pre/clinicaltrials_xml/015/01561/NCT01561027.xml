Capable of giving written informed consent. Approved concomitant medications must have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to day 1. Average baseline daily pain score for neuropathic pain due to LSR on the 11point numerical rating scale of 4 or greater. Subjects who are unable to reliably delineate or assess their own pain by anatomical location/distribution. Subjects with lumbar canal stenosis in which the pain in the lower limbs occur solely on walking and not at rest. Subjects with causes for their neuropathic pain other than LSR. Subjects who have received nerve blocks and/or steroid injections for neuropathic pain within 4 weeks prior to day 1. Subjects who are indicated for surgical treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathy. A positive prestudy drug screen. A positive history of HIV. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. History of any liver disease within the last 6 months, with the exception of known Gilbert's disease. History of excessive regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study. Subjects with a history or risk of seizures or a history of epilepsy, head injury or related neurological disorders Subjects with a history of uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension, with systolic BP frequently exceeding 160mmHg and/or diastolic BP frequently exceeding 100mmHg, or subjects who have BP greater than or equal to 160mmHg systolic and/or greater than or equal to 100mmHg diastolic at screening after repeated measurements History or presence of significant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or renal disease or other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs. Subjects with conditions known to affect cardiac conduction or a personal or familial history of Brugada syndrome Pregnant females or lactating females. History or presence of any clinically significant abnormality in vital signs / ECG / laboratory tests or have any medical or psychiatric condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator may interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts or clinical evidence of recent major depression. Subjects who are unable to maintain their same medications for the treatment of neuropathic pain at a stable dose during the study. Unable to refrain from excessive use of sedatives. Unable to comply with the prohibited concomitant medication restrictions as detailed in the protocol. This includes but is not limited to sodium channel blockers or drugs that adversely interact with a monoamine oxidaseB inhibitor: MAOI's, antidepressants, opioids and sympathomimetic agents. Unable to stop and remain abstained from nonpharmacological treatments for their neuropathic pain during the study. History of hypersensitivity to CNV1014802. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer) prior to the start of this study. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.</criteria>
