	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine if by providing a collaborative, integrated pathway-based healthcare compared to the usual healthcare, whether or not this would be superior in reducing the length of hospital stay across five high frequency /high risk medical diagnoses: Acute Venous Thromboembolism, Acute Kidney Injury, Community Acquired Pneumonia, Adult Left Ventricular Heart Failure, and Asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collaborative Healthcare Professionals Approach in Monitoring of Patient Centered Outcomes Through Pathways</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. To date, there is a scarcity of randomized controlled trials looking at pathway-based, patient-centered healthcare versus usual care in several high-risk or high volume diagnoses that account for the vast majority of hospitalizations in medical settings. In this study, the pathway care intervention is a collaborative effort that involves healthcare professionals from multiple departments, including pharmacists, health educators, nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and quality management. For patients allocated to the usual care, these healthcare professionals will deliver standardized care when consulted. For pathway care patients, this collaborative healthcare will be default.</detailed_description>
