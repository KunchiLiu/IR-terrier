	<brief_title>Nasogastric/Orogastric Tube Placement Verification Study Using RightSpot pH Indicator to Verify Gastric Acidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: To assess the level of accuracy of the RightSpot pH Indicator in determining correct placement of NG/OG tubes as compared to the gold standard of CXR in Emergency Department &amp; ICU patients. Hypothesis 1: In greater than 90% of the cases, RightSpot pH Indicator will be successful in confirming the placement of NG/OG tubes by demonstrating a pH of 4.5 or less in patients with CXR proven tube placement. Hypothesis 2: The time to confirmation of NG/OG tube placement will be significantly less using the RightSpot pH Indicator than using CXR. The time will be calculated by the start time consisting of the time that the NG/OG tube was placed until the end time, which will be when the device pH Indicator testing is performed. The time to confirmation using the gold standard of a CXR will begin when the NG/OG tube is placed and end when the CXR is available on PACS (picture archiving and communication system). Secondary objective: To determine via subgroup analysis whether gross blood in the stomach, presence of acid-reducing medications, or trauma affects the accuracy of NG/OG placement determination by the RightSpot pH Indicator.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 years and older Patient or proxy willing to provide informed consent Patients who require placement of a nasogastric/orogastric tube, in the ED or ICU, as standard of care, AND a member of the study staff is available and present for NG/OG tube placement. It is anticipated that the patient will remain in the ED/ICU in order to obtain RightSpot pH Indicator reading and verifying CXR Patients less than 18 years of age Patient or proxy unwilling or unable to provide informed consent Patient with known or suspected pregnancy</criteria>
