	<brief_title>A Long-Term Study of JNS007ER in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 48-week, multicenter, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-controlled, arbitrary-dose study. The patients included in this study are those who participated in the preceding double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives) comparative trial (study JNS007ER-JPN-S31) of JNS007ER and completed the study, or those who remained in the study up to the evaluation at 2 weeks and discontinued the study after that for insufficient treatment efficacy. The study will assess the safety of JNS007ER in the clinical recommended dose range in a long term treatment. The dosage will be started at 6 mg/day, and it can be increased or decreased 3 mg at a time depending on the patient's symptom within the range of 3 mg/day to 12 mg/day. For dose adjustments, the investigator will evaluate the psychiatric symptoms before defining the dose change. Detailed Description: Extended description of the protocol, including more technical information (as compared to the Brief Summary) if desired. Do not include the entire protocol; do not duplicate information recorded in other data elements, such as eligibility criteria or outcome measures.</detailed_description>
