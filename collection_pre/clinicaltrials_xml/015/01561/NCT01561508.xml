	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. This condition is very prevalent, affecting up to 1:400/500 persons worldwide. Type 1 diabetes, previously known as juvenile diabetes, usually strikes in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, but lasts for a lifetime. To date, there have been no treatments that can arrest or reverse the ongoing beta cell destruction. The patients affected by this disease require multiple daily insulin injections to manage their blood sugars and usually have trouble regulating their blood sugars. Moreover, they are at risk for heart disease, kidney failure, eye problems, and other complications from this life-long condition. The investigators plan to utilize gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in children with newly diagnosed T1DM. This neurotransmitter is made in the brain from the amino acid glutamate with the aid of vitamin B6. There have been some recent studies in diabetic mice utilizing GABA to reverse inflammation on the pancreas and improve hyperglycemia. GABA studied in healthy human subjects demonstrated that large oral doses of GABA increased insulin secretion from the pancreas. The investigators propose that GABA given to children with new onset T1DM will be able to increase insulin production, suppress glucagon release, and decrease the inflammation surrounding the pancreas. The investigators hope this will at least prolong the beta cell life after diagnosis, if not lead to a cure for type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
