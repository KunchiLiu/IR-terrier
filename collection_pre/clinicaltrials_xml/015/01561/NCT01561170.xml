	<brief_summary>Chronically venous ulcer in lower extremities is a permanent and disabling disease. Venous insufficience is the main cause of chronic ulcer. There is a high prevalence and frequency of the disease, primarily among elderly people. Recently, electromagnetic field therapy has been tested on various diseases in musculoskeletal system with a beneficial effect. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using electromagnetic field therapy to treat chronically venous ulcer. The hypothesis of the investigators is that the electronic magnetic field therapy improves the healing process and reduces pain for patients suffering from chronically venous ulcer. The investigators assume that the bioactivity is affected by a cellular response which affects the DNA synthesis, transcription og protein synthesis.</brief_summary>
