	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators aimed at verifying whether consumption of a sheep cheese, naturally enriched in ALA, CLA and VA, would modify the plasma lipid and endocannabinoid profiles in mild hypercholesterolemic subjects. This study was a 3-week, randomized, double blind, controlled, cross over clinical trial, conducted at the State Hospital Brotzu in Cagliari, Italy. The subjects were randomly assigned to eat 90g/d of the control or enriched cheese for 3 weeks, with a cross over after 3 weeks of washout.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Adult volunteers with diagnosed mild hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol 220290 mg/dL) Pregnant (or those planning to become pregnant during the study period) and lactating women Also individuals with a selfreported history of diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, gallbladder or biliary disease in the past 12 months, and lactose intolerance before the screening visit. Those with a history of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) in the 2 years before screening, or of any major trauma or surgical event within 3 months before screening. Volunteers with the following characteristics were also excluded: total cholesterol ≥300 mg/dL, serum triglycerides ≥250 mg/dL or ≤ 200 mg/dL, *HDL ≥70mg/dL, BMI ≥ 30 uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg) at screening. Use of lipidaltering medications or supplements, and of anticoagulants, during the 2 weeks before screening and throughout the study was prohibited. Furthermore, we selected subjects with an Apo E aplotype 3/3, the most common in Sardinia, in order to avoid any variability in cholesterolemia due to a different dietary response.</criteria>
