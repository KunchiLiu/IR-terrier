	<brief_summary>The purpose this study is to assess whether a tirofiban regimen of a high-dose bolus plus a shortened infusion duration compared to label-dosing eptifibatide in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with a non-inferior composite rate of death, PCI-related myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel revascularization or in-hospital major bleeding within 48 hours following PCI or hospital discharge, whichever comes first.</brief_summary>
