	<brief_summary>Congestive heart failure (CHF) affects nearly 5 million Americans and claims more than 300,000 lives annually. A primary pathophysiologic mechanism in this deadly syndrome is an abnormally enhanced sympathetic nervous system that results in profound peripheral vasoconstriction, attenuated cardiovascular reflexes, higher susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The reduction in mortality and morbidity in CHF by pharmacologic neurohumoral antagonists such as beta-receptor inhibitor and angiotensin II-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has taught us that regulation of the impaired neurohumoral axis is important for improving clinical outcome. In addition, an emerging nonpharmacologic approach, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), has shown promise for improving symptoms and quality of life in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV and intraventricular conduction delay. However, despite significant advances in CHF treatment in the past two decades, a gap remains between clinical outcome and the mechanisms of the protective effects of these modern therapies. CHF is associated with increased concentrations of circulating norepinephrine (NE), down-regulation of adrenergic nerve terminals, and abnormal NE reuptake. The suppression of cardiac sympathetic nerve endings could be reversed by CRT, a novel anti-heart failure therapy, by rebalance cardiac sympathetic activity, and improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Resynchronization and Iodine Meta-Iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Specific Aim #1 of this study is to assess, with 123iodine metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG imaging), whether CRT rebalances and improves the integrity and function of sympathetic nerve terminals in the failing myocardium. The study will test the hypothesis that resynchronization of biventricular contractility attenuates excessive sympathetic drive, and improves autonomic function and cardiac performance. The Specific Aim #2 of this study is to determine the relationship between 123I-MIBG labeling of sympathetic activity and physiological measures of cardiopulmonary and autonomic function. This aim is to test the hypothesis that impaired cardiac sympathetic activity, determined by 123I-MIBG imaging will be associated with poorer submaximal exercise gas exchange (higher ventilation - CO2 slopes, low end tidal CO2, reduced oxygen pulse and a more rapid frequency response) as well as reduced heart rate power spectral frequencies, a blunted response to positional changes and a delayed heart rate recovery.</detailed_description>
