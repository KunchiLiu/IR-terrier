	<brief_title>Telehealth Monitoring in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The current management of patients with COPD includes well established interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation and inhaled therapies which have demonstrated variable impact on reducing rates of exacerbation and improving health related quality of life. Telehealth is a home monitoring system used to record clinical observations and carry out question and answer sessions. It has been proposed that Telehealth medicine may offer an alternative strategy to the overall management of these patients.</detailed_description>
