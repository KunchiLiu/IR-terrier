	<brief_summary>The main objective of this randomized multicenter clinical trial is to test the hypothesis that further reduction of VT to 4mL/kg may enhance lung protection in patients with ARDS as compared to the conventional "ARDS-Net" ventilation. Control of PaCO2 in the ~4 ml/kg arm would be accomplished by LFPPV- ECCO2-R.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flow-flow ECCO2-R and 4 ml/kg Tidal Volume vs. 6 ml/kg Tidal Volume to Enhance Protection From VILI in Acute Lung Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will test the hypothesis that a VT of 4 ml/kg PBW combined with low flow CO2 removal improves outcome in patients with severe ARDS (PFs ≤ 200 and PEEP ≥ 10) compared to ventilation with a VT of 6 ml/kg PBW. The study will accrue a maximum of 230 patients over approximately 12-18 months. PRIMARY END-POINT: Number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) during the 28 days immediately after randomization SECONDARY END-POINTS: 28 and 90-day all-cause mortality; number of ICU-free days during the 28 days immediately after randomization; cumulative incidence of: first episode of refractory hypoxemia (during 28 days after randomization), use of rescue therapies, first day that meet criteria for weaning, SOFA-free and severe adverse events. Patients in CONTROL will be treated according to a modified, simplified version of The ARDS-Network lung protective lower tidal volume. Patients in TREATMENT group will be treated according to the ARDS-Net protocol modified (VT reduced by 1 ml/kg PBW at intervals ≤ 2 hours until VT = 4ml/kg PBW and the use of low-flow CO2 removal with a Plateau Pressure Goal: ≤ 25 cm H2O).</detailed_description>
