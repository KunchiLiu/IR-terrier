	<brief_summary>Primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been a very successful surgical intervention in the geriatric population. Numerous studies have reported good mid and long term results of THA in patients over the age of 60 years. With the reported high success rate of this surgical intervention, the THA surgery is being performed in younger patients who have significant joint disease. A clinical trial, using a randomized blinded design, was undertaken to compare the functional outcome of 1) alumina heads/alumina liners, and 2) alumina head/Crossfire polyethylene liners in patients 60 years of age or younger with non-inflammatory arthritis of the hip. Subjects were assessed preoperatively and at one and five years postoperatively. Ten-year follow-up is currently underway. The primary outcome measure is the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index. Secondary measures were the RAND-12, as well as measurement of complication and revision rates. The patient's demand on the implant as calculated by the patient's age, weight, health status and activity level was also measured.</brief_summary>
