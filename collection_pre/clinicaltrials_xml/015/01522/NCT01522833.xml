	<brief_summary>With roughly 80% of cancer patients receiving their oncology care in the community setting, the investigators are proposing to sample from a community-based center to evaluate the percentage of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-wild type patients that gain benefit from erlotinib and assess the clinical characteristics that are associated with erlotinib-responders. Additionally, biopsy specimens from enrolled patient cases that are EGFR-wt will be evaluated via exploratory genetic analysis for correlated markers.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have had NSCLC. Patients must have received erlotinib (singleagent) for six months or longer for NSCLC in the second/third line setting or as maintenance therapy. Patients must have tissue available for EGFRmutation status testing (if not previously performed) or EGFRmutation status test results available. Patients must have tissue available for exploratory genetic analysis. Patients must have all clinical information, treatment response data and outcomes data available for review. Patients must be deceased.</criteria>
