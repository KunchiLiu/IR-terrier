	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of the anti-hepcidin Spiegelmer NOX-H94 on iron homeostasis during systemic inflammation induced by endotoxin. In the human endotoxemia model, intravenously administered lipopolysaccharide elicits an inflammatory response with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-alfa, with subsequent induction of hepcidin. As a consequence of hepcidin induction, serum iron concentrations decrease. This study in healthy subjects investigates the capacity of NOX-H94 to inactivate hepcidin and to prevent serum iron decrease in a pathophysiological model prior to studying the efficacy of NOX-H94 in patients with anemia of chronic disease.</brief_summary>
