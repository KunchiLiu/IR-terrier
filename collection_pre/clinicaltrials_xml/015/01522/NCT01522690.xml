	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to obtain normative accelerometry data during the six minute walk test and a 30 second walk test on healthy subjects in order to determine the accelerometric variables that are the most relevant to describe gait disorders in patient populations. Secondary objectives of this study are to investigate the impact of walking speed and muscle strength on the accelerometric parameters, to assess the reproducibility of the method and to compare accelerometric data obtained with two different devices.</brief_summary>
