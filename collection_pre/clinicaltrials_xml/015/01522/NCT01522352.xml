	<brief_title>Comparison Between Three Types of Stented Pericardial Aortic Valves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the French database Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, 11,621 patients underwent aortic valve replacement in 2007. Over 77% of biologic prosthetic valves were used. Among these biologic valves, those in pericardium are mainly used in all French cardiac surgery centers. Since March 2010, a new pericardial aortic valve has obtained a CE mark, allowing cardiac surgery centers in Europe to implement it in humans. Hemodynamic performance of different biologic valves has never been measured. This study suggests for the first time a comparison of the hemodynamic performance of the two most implanted aortic bioprosthesis in France with the new aortic bioprosthesis available since September 2010 at the University Hospital of Clermont Ferrand.</detailed_description>
