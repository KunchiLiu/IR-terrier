	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best schedule of vaccine therapy with or without sirolimus in treating patients with cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1) expressing solid tumors. Biological therapies, such as sirolimus, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Infusing the vaccine directly into a lymph node may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy works better when given with or without sirolimus in treating solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With or Without Sirolimus in Treating Patients With NY-ESO-1 Expressing Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of DC205-NY-ESO-1 vaccine (DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401) with and without sirolimus. Toxicity as defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity: - Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ T-cells. - Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies. - Peripheral blood frequency of CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T-cells. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Explore time to disease progression. OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard collection of peripheral white blood cells via leukapheresis over 90-240 minutes for vaccine preparation. Patients are assigned sequentially to Cohorts 1a-1d. COHORT 1a: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 intranodally on days 1, 29, 57, and 113. COHORT 1b: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in Cohort 1a and sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-14, 29-42, and 57-70. COHORT 1c: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in Cohort 1a and sirolimus PO or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube on days 15-28, 43-56, and 71-84. COHORT 1d: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in Cohort 1a and sirolimus PO or PEG on days 1-84. COHORT 2: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in the Cohort (1a-1d) that is determined to be safe and produces optimal immunological effects and sirolimus PO on days 1-14 as in Cohort 1b dose. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.</detailed_description>
