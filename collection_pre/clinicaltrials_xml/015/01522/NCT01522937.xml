	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II trial to characterize the safety and efficacy of individualized stereotactic body radiation therapy (SRBT) for patients who have had previous liver treatment or who have primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Individualized Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Intrahepatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial endpoints are toxicity, survival and progression-free survival. DCE-MRI and plasma biomarkers will also be collected to explore their use as tools for treatment individualization in future trials. During the current trial, an indicator of liver function, indocyanine green (ICG), will be used to identify during treatment patients who are at excess risk for radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) so that their radiation dose may be reduced. The model used for individualization will be updated as trial data accrue, so this is an adaptive trial of an individualized therapy. The planned accrual is seventy (70) evaluable patients over three years.</detailed_description>
