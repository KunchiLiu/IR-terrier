	<brief_title>The Surgical Benefit and Pt.Tolerability Between Two Different Bowel Cleansing Regimens Performed Prior to Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery. Does One Bowel Cleansing Regimen Improve the Surgeons Visual Field Significantly Better Than the Other.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to receive a complete MBP or not prior to their surgical procedure. All patients will use 1 fleets enema the night before surgery and one the morning of surgery to ensure that the rectum is empty of all stool. This will be done since some surgeons use a rectal probe in the rectum to help with manipulation during the procedure. Stool in the rectal vault could contaminate the surgical field and lead to an infection. Patients will be randomized at their pre-op visit and provided instructions according to the group assignment. On the day of surgery patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire in the pre-op holding area to assess their overnight symptoms including insomnia, weakness, abdominal distention, nausea, thirst and overall tolerability of the Bowel Preparation assigned. Immediately after surgery, the primary surgeon will be asked to complete a visual analog score sheet evaluating the ease of the procedure with regard to retraction of the large and small bowel to help with visualization of the sacral promontory, retraction from posterior cul-de-sac, and maintaining adequate positioning after retraction. All surgeons (attendings, fellows, and residents) will be blinded re: the patients group assignment. Each primary surgeon will be asked to assign a final grade to the procedure as easy, medium, or difficult based on overall bowel retraction. At their 2 week follow up visit patients will be asked to report return of bowel function (first bowel movement or flatus) in # of days after surgery and incidents of stool leakage post op.</detailed_description>
