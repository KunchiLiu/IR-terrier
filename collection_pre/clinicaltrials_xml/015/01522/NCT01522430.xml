	<brief_summary>The DEPART study end points are to provide conclusive evidence, using a randomized, double blinded, sham procedure controlled study design, that radiofrequency renal denervation: 1. reduces daytime ambulatory blood pressure, 2. improves nocturnal dipping in blood pressure at the ambulatory blood pressure recording.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>They have a mandatory &gt; 3 antihypertensive medication therapy, including a thiazide or a loop diuretic (according to the patient's renal function, unless documented sideeffects) and at least one attempt to treat with spironolactone, given at usual recommended dose since at least 8 weeks, before inclusion, A mandatory check list of secondary cause of hypertension has been excluded They succeed the pill count test. They have a mandatory ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before inclusion with at least 70% of valid readings during daytime (08:00 am 08:00 pm, using a sampling frequency of 20 minutes, only devices validated according to http://www.dableducational.org are permitted), where daytime ambulatory blood pressure of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure exceeds 135 mmHg and/or 85 mmHg, respectively. Daytime ambulatory blood pressure of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure below 135 mmHg and/or 85 mmHg, respectively, is acceptable for inclusion in the study if the patient takes four or more antihypertensive medication (3). Patients with an eGFR &lt;30ml/min/mÂ² are excluded, patients with known renal atherosclerotic lesions, previous procedures in the renal arteries, known unsuitable anatomy for the procedure, previous nephrectomy, contrast agent allergy, hyperthyroidia.</criteria>
