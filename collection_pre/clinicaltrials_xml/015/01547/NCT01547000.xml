	<brief_title>Guanfacine in Children With Tic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Guanfacine is commonly used for the treatment of tics in children with Tourette Disorder, but neither the immediate release compound nor the new extended release formulation have been evaluated for tics as a primary outcome. This pilot study is not designed to demonstrate efficacy of extended release guanfacine in the treatment of tics in children with TD. Rather, the goal of this trial is to determine whether extended release guanfacine warrants further study in a large scale trial. Immediate-release guanfacine is frequently used in children with TD, but dosing, time to effect and adverse effects with the new extended release guanfacine are unknown. The use of placebo in this trial reduces bias in the measurement of outcomes because it ensures blindness in the parent and clinician ratings. This is a three-site, investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects who show a positive response to extended release guanfacine in the 8-week double-blind phase will continue on the the drug in an 8-week extension phase. Subjects who are randomly assigned to placebo and do not show improvement will be offered 8-weeks of open-label treatment with Intuniv.</detailed_description>
