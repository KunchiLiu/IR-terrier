	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To characterize the effects of 12 weeks treatment with study drug on albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria Secondary objectives: - To characterize the effect of study drug on glycosylated hemoglobin fraction (HbA1c) - To evaluate the effect of study drug on markers of glycemic disorders, systemic inflammation, renal and liver disease and cardiovascular function - To assess the safety and tolerability of study drug - To determine the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of study drug</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) definition 2. Age ≥ 18 3. HbA1c between 6.0% and 10.5%, inclusive 4. ACR &gt; 100 mg/g calculated 3 times in first morning void urine, at least 2 of the measurements &gt; 100 mg/g 5. Patients on stable (unchanged medication for at least 3 months) treatment to control hypertension, hyperglycemia and (if applicable) dyslipidemia 6. Stable treatment with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (reninangiotensin system [RAS] blockade) 7. Willing and able to understand and sign an approved Informed Consent form 8. Men must agree to follow accepted birth control methods during treatment and for 3 months after completion of treatment. Women must be of nonchildbearing potential. 1. Type 1 diabetes mellitus 2. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) ≤25 mL/min/1.73m2 (calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKDEPI] formula) 3. Recent cardiovascular events (3 months) 4. Uncontrolled hypertension (upper limits 180/110 mmHg) 5. Dialysis and/or acute kidney injury within 3 months before screening 6. Significant edema, infectious diseases, leg ulcers 7. Severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would interfere significantly with the assessments of safety and efficacy during this study 8. Treatment with any other investigational agent, or participation in another clinical study within 90 days prior to baseline visit 9. Patient with known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C 10. In the judgment of the clinical investigator, clinically significant abnormal laboratory values at the screening visit 11. Use of thiazolidinedione class drugs, immune suppressants, steroid therapy (except for topical use or inhalation), chronic use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX2) inhibitors, two or more diuretic drugs and/or aliskiren 12. In the judgment of the clinical investigator, patients who are likely to be noncompliant or uncooperative during the study. 13. Previous participation in this study.</criteria>
