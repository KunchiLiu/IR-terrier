	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain and chronic, with points called "hot spots", specific, sensitive and painful on palpation. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of swimming in reducing the generally pain and improve the quality of function, of life and exercise capacity in patients with fibromyalgia. Material and Methods: 82 patients will be screened, diagnosed with fibromyalgia, who can swim the front crawl. Will be selected at UNIFESP outpatient clinics and also through advertisement in a newspaper. One group held the swimming training and the other group (control) will walk training. The Participants perform exercises (swimming or running) three times a week for 50 minutes, for 12 weeks. The exercises will be held at the anaerobic threshold determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Measuring instrument: Questionnaires VAS (visual analogue scale) for pain, FIQ (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire) to assess the quality of life related to disease, and also the SF-36 (short form health survey), which assesses quality of life in general. Cardiopulmonary stress test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness to sit and stand up and test to assess functional capacity. All participants will conduct an initial evaluation, after 6 and 13 weeks of training.</detailed_description>
