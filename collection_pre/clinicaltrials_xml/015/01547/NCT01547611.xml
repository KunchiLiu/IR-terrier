	<brief_summary>Many patients with cervical disc disease have long-lasting and complex symptoms with chronic pain, low levels of physical and psychological function and sick-leave. Surgery on a few segmental levels might be expected to solve the disc-specific pain but not the non-specific neck pain and the patients'illness. As much as 2/3 of the patients have been reported to have remaining physical/ psychological disability long-term after surgery. A structured physiotherapy programme after surgery may improve patients'function and return to work. The main purpose of the study is to evaluate what a well structured rehabilitation program adds to the customary treatment after surgery for radiculopathy due to cervical disc disease in respect to function, disability, workability and cost effectiveness. The study is a prospective randomised controlled multi-centre study, with an independent and blinded investigator comparing two alternatives of rehabilitation. 200 patients in working age, with cervical disc disease with clinical findings and symptoms of cervical nerve root compression will be included after informed consent. After inclusion in the study patients will be randomised to one out of the two alternatives of physiotherapy, (A) customary treatment (information/ advice on the specialist clinic) or (A+B) active physiotherapy; standardised and structured program of neck specific exercises combined with a behavioural approach plus customary treatment. Patients will be evaluated both clinically and with questionnaires before surgery, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after surgery. Main outcome variable are neck specific disability. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated. The inclusion will preliminary be closed 2012. The study could contribute to a better clinical decision making, a better health care which will reduce physical, mental and social costs for the patients, and improve the rates of patients returning to and staying at work.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients will be included from four Neurosurgical clinics in the south of Sweden and the rehabilitation will be performed in primary care units in several counties. Patients in working age, with MRIverified cervical disc disease with clinical findings and symptoms of cervical nerve root compression and who have had surgery with anterior decompression and fusion or posterior surgery (foraminotomy/ laminectomy) will be included after informed consent. Patients with myelopathy or with a disease or trauma contraindicated to perform the treatment program or the measurements will be excluded and so also patients with lack of familiarity of the Swedish language or with known drug abuse.</criteria>
