	<brief_title>Classroom-based Distance Intervention for Teachers of Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>*Please note that the information below is taken verbatim from our project's research summary.* Treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most well-researched areas in childhood psychopathology. ADHD is a highly prevalent (5% of school-aged children) and chronic disorder (ADHD will persist into adulthood for ~70% of children diagnosed with this disorder). ADHD has a substantial impact on daily life including difficulties with behavioural, academic, social and emotional functioning (DuPaul &amp; Weyandt, 2006). Although medication is the most commonly used treatment, there are a number of important limitations including poor long-term effects, lack of effectiveness in improving academic skills, and lack of acceptability by parents and children (DuPaul, 2007). Therefore, a number of psychosocial interventions have been developed and empirically validated (parent training, social skills training, school-based interventions). School-based interventions have been shown to be effective; however, these are significantly underutilized and when implemented in an uncontrolled way, are often ineffective. This intervention program is comprised of evidence-based treatment strategies that are presented in a manner that will provide teachers with knowledge of the disorder and intervention strategies. The novel delivery of this program, through distance treatment modalities (e-mail and internet) will allow us to overcome many of the known barriers to treatment so that teachers will receive the necessary information in a timely and efficient manner. The specific research questions that will be addressed are: 1. Does the overall impairment of children with ADHD in the treatment group improve compared to those who are in the waitlist group? 2. Is the school-based intervention effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, improving behavioral functioning, and enhancing academic performance in the active treatment group compared to the waitlist group? 3. Do teachers in the treatment group develop more knowledge about ADHD and more positive and realistic attitudes about this disorder over the course of the intervention? 4. Is the intervention viewed as accessible to teachers and is there evidence of fidelity to the program? The investigators expect that the program will reduce overall impairment, improve ADHD symptoms, behavioural, and academic functioning in the children and will enhance knowledge and reduce misconceptions of ADHD in teachers. If successful, this program will be disseminated to school boards in Nova Scotia and across Canada, and as such would have the potential to have a significant positive effect on the health and well-being of many children, teachers and parents.</detailed_description>
