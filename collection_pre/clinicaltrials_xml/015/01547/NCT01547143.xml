	<brief_summary>The investigators would like to propose a pilot study evaluating the efficacy of etoposide combined with immunosuppressive agents for adult secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), in order to prove out whether the modification of previous HLH-94 or HLH-2004 protocol for childhood patients can improve the outcome and decrease the toxicities. The results of this pilot study will be a base of a more-improved phase-2 protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Etoposide-based Therapy and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of HLH in adult patients has not been determined yet. Actually, we adopted the treatment protocol HLH2004, which was developed for pediatric HLH patients. The HLH2004 protocol, which is a potent and successful treatment for HLH, has shown some limitations in the treatment of adult HLH. First, the dose of etoposide is somewhat high for adult patients to tolerate. Second, the high incidence of opportunistic infection such as fungal, bacterial, and viral has threatened the patients. Third, more aggressive and intensive approach to adopt allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation will be needed earlier in adult patients. Based on these rationales, we developed a modified protocol based on HLH2004 to pit the treatment of adult HLH patients.</detailed_description>
