	<detailed_description>76 children or adolescents aged 6-19 with NAFLD will be included in the study. Diagnosis of NAFLD is set by increased alanine transaminase and features of liver steatosis on ultrasound. Patients will be randomized to receive either fish oil (EPA/DHA, 400-1200mg) or placebo (sunflower oil) for 6 months. All children will be advised to reduce weight (dietetic intervention + increased physical activity). Laboratory tests, liver ultrasound, anthropometric analysis will be performed at the start, after 3 months and 6 months.</detailed_description>
