	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the performance, safety, and ease of use (usability) between two closed suction systems, the AirWay Medix Closed Suction System and Kimberly KimVent while intubated with an endotracheal in hospitals and ICU. 26 adults with an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation will be randomized into 2 groups to receive one of the following closed suction systems endotracheal tubes: 1. AirWay Medix Closed Suction System 2. KimVent Turbo-Cleaning Closed Suction System Kimberly clarK The groups will be compared regarding the safety, performance and ease of use (usability).</brief_summary>
