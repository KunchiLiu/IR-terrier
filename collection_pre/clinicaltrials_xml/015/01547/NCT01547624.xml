	<brief_summary>Today there is evidence for that neck specific exercises reduce neck pain problems in patients with mechanical neck pain. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to optimize neck exercises and dosages in neck rehabilitation. More knowledge is needed to determine which and how muscles are activated in exercises thought to be neck-specific. There is neither enough knowledge of differences in neck muscle activation between patients with long standing neck problems after a whiplash trauma and healthy controls nor if the neck muscle function improved with specific neck exercises. One approach would be a real time study of deformation and deformation rate in different layers of neck muscles in patients with residual long-term neck pain and disability after a whiplash trauma. The purpose of the present study was to investigate deformation and deformation rate in different layers of dorsal and ventral neck muscles (including upper and middle part of trapezius muscle) during rest and during different exercises; arm flexion until 120 degrees, repeated arm flexion until 90 degrees, low loaded neck extension, low loaded neck muscle endurance test, shoulder elevation. Forty patients with long standing (more than 6 months but less than 3 years)patients and 40 controls matched for age and gender will be included for comparisons between patients and healthy in neck muscle activation. The investigators also include 60 patients with whiplash trauma, of those 30 patients will be randomized to A. neck specific exercises in a 3 months period and B. will 30 be on a waiting list for 3 months. Measurements are performed at baseline and at 3 months follow-up. Those patients who fulfilled the 3 months period of neck specific exercises will also be asked for a 6 months follow-up.</brief_summary>
