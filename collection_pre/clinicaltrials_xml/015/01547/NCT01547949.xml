	<brief_title>Efficacy of Tart Cherry Juice in Reducing Muscle Injury and Biomarkers of Muscle Damage Among Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents have been identified in tart cherries, and a study among healthy, non-exercising individuals demonstrated that tart cherries decreased post-exercise weakness and muscle pain. The purpose of this study is to assess the analgesic and myoprotective effects of tart cherry juice among healthy subjects in a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, crossover design trial. Fifteen healthy individuals will perform a bout of eccentric elbow flexion contractions (2 x 10 near maximum), and will then ingest 10 fl oz of a cherry juice or a placebo juice twice a day for four days, beginning immediately post exercise. Before and after exercise, and for three days following the eccentric exercise, blood will be drawn to measure serum biomarkers of muscle damage and muscle soreness will be recorded. The protocol will be repeated after a 9-10 day washout period with subjects consuming the alternative juice for the second trial. The opposite arm will perform the eccentric exercise for the second bout to avoid the repeated bout protective effect. The study's outcomes are 1) to assess changes in serum biomarkers of muscle damage, and 2) to assess changes in muscle soreness.</detailed_description>
