	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic disease, which is characterized by chronic inflammation in the synovial tissue. Rheumatoid arthritis will eventually result in the destruction of cartilage, bone and ligaments and joint deformity. The underlying hypothesis is that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSCs) has anti-inflammatory effects and thus potentially alleviates the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. The study is to explore the safety and efficacy of UC-MSCs transplantation in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</brief_summary>

Women of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method while on this trial. Women of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test performed within 72 hours prior to initiation of treatment. Any history of ongoing, significant or recurring infections. Any active inflammatory diseases other than RA. Significant cardiac or pulmonary disease. Endstage renal failure. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate due to the possibility of fetal harm or harm to nursing infants from this treatment regimen.</criteria>
