	<brief_summary>This Phase 4 pilot cross-sectional descriptive/exploratory study is to be conducted in clinical practice settings (including MS (Multiple sclerosis) specialty clinics, general neurology practices, or other academic or private practice settings) in the United States to assess the psychometric properties of the ARMS questionnaire in approximately 100 adult patients with MS who are experiencing a confirmed relapse, as identified by the investigator or designee at each site. Neither efficacy nor safety of treatment will be evaluated in this study. The ARMS questionnaire is a 2-part, 2-page survey, with each part comprising 7 questions on 1 page. Part 1 is designed to evaluate the patient's relapse symptoms and how the symptoms affect daily activities and overall function, as well as patient's response to past treatments for previous relapses, as a means of guiding treatment selection. Part 2 is designed to evaluate treatment response in terms of symptom relief and functioning, as well as treatment tolerability. Part 1 of the survey is to be completed when the patient presents with new relapse of MS. Part 2 of the survey is to be completed 1 month (± 1 week) after initiation of treatment for relapse of MS. Treatment for relapse will be at the sole discretion of the investigator.</brief_summary>
