	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate whether robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy give rise to the impairment of diaphragmatic function postoperatively, and whether combined general/epidural anesthesia could provide better postoperative diaphragmatic function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Combined General/Epidural Anesthesia Versus General Anesthesia on Diaphragmatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diaphragmatic dysfunction after abdominal surgery can result in extended hospital stay and increased medical costs, because it is related with atelectasis, lung collapse or pneumonia. The mechanism of diaphragm dysfunction is thought to be from not only direct injury to abdominal wall and viscera but inhibitory reflexes of phrenic activity. Thoracic or upper abdominal surgery is suggested as a risk factor of postoperative diaphragm dysfunction, and perioperative analgesic modality is also known to affect diaphragm movements. But there has been no trial to investigate the effect of laparoscopic pelvic surgery such as prostatectomy on diaphragm movement. Moreover, it is not clear if minimally invasive Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) has any influence on respiratory and diaphragm functions.</detailed_description>
