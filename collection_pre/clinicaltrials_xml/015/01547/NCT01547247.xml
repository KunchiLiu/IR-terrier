	<brief_summary>Water immersion insertion has been documented to decrease procedure-related discomfort during colonoscopy. Cap attached to the colonoscope tip may improve insertion and shorten cecal intubation time. The investigators would like to assess whether combination of cap-fitted colonoscopy and water immersion insertion is feasible and safe method of diagnostic colonoscopy. The primary endpoint is cecal intubation time and the investigators suppose that the use of cap is able to shorten it significantly. Patient comfort during colonoscope insertion, water consumption, length of the scope while reaching the cecum, need for external compression, need for positioning of the patient and endoscopistÂ´s difficulty with colonoscopy are assessed.</brief_summary>
