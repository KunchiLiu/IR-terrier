	<brief_summary>Background: - A mutation in a gene known as ISCU was found to be the cause of a rare myopathy that affects the muscles. Researchers collected clinical samples from people with this myopathy. More research is being done to develop a therapy for this disease. Researchers are asking for permission to study the samples already collected. Objectives: - To allow researchers to use clinical samples collected to study new treatments for ISCU myopathy. Eligibility: - People with ISCU myopathy who have provided clinical samples for study. Design: - Participants will allow researchers to study clinical samples already collected. Blood, urine, muscle, and cell samples may be used. Medical records and photographs may also be studied. - Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigations Into ISCU Myopathy or Iron Sulfur Scaffold U Protein Myopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2008, NIH investigators collaborated to find a mutation in the human gene, ISCU, which is the official human gene name for a gene involved in assembly of iron sulfur clusters, and is abbreviated from Iron Sulfur Cluster assembly protein, U, which was identified as the cause of a rare myopathy that affected about 25 patients in Sweden. This protocol is intended to allow for the collection and analysis of clinical specimens and medical information from several research subjects who previously participated in studies that led to identification of the disease gene.</detailed_description>
