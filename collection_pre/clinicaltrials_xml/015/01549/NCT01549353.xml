	<brief_summary>Gum chewing has been reported to stimulate bowel motility after open surgery, such as cesarean section and other abdominal surgeries. In general, after laparoscopic surgery problems with reduced bowel motility are not as common as after open surgery. In this study the investigators test the hypothesis that gum chewing is enhancing rapid return of bowel motility after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Further the investigators study patient satisfaction and potential side effects of postoperative gum chewing.</brief_summary>
