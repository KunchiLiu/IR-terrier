	<brief_title>Retrospective Analysis of the Safety and Efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine in Immune Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is usually used in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in order to treat mainly arthralgia or skin manifestations of this disease. A few studies have previously shown that HCQ could also be useful for treating autoimmune cytopenia and particularly autoimmune thrombopenia associated with SLE. In this retrospective study, the investigators have selected patients followed in our center and who have received HCQ either for an authentic SLE or because they had positive antinuclear antibodies (&gt; 1/160e on HEP2 cells) without a definite SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology. The main goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of HCQ in these two subgroups of patients.</detailed_description>
