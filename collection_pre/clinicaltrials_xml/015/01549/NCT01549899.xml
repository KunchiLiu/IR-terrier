	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to directly compare 6 sessions of in-person and Internet administered Cognitive-Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) to a Minimal Contact control (MC), within an active duty military population to determine the comparative benefits of these interventions on improvement in sleep as well as domains strongly related to insomnia such as depression, substance abuse, and PTSD symptoms. A total of 189 military personnel with chronic insomnia, aged 18-65, will be recruited and randomized to receive 6-sessions (over 6 weeks) of CBTi (n=77), ICBTi (n=35), or a MC control (n=77) condition. The investigators will compare these three groups on subjective and objective measures of sleep. The CBTi and MC control groups will be compared on other variables of interest (e.g., depression, substance abuse, and PTSD symptoms) and predictors of outcomes.</brief_summary>
