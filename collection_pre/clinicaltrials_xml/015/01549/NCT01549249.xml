	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Cone Outer Segment Tips Line After Epiretinal Membrane Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epiretinal membrane (ERM) may cause decreased central vision or metamorphopsia. Pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling has become the standard treatment for epiretinal membrane. However, visual recovery or symptomatic relief is not always satisfactory in all eyes despite successful membrane removal. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is a non-invasive imaging device for various vitreoretinal diseases. Cone outer segment tips (COST) line is a line observed between IS/OS line and RPE in SD-OCT. The investigators examined the correlation of visual acuity and the recovery of photoreceptor layer after ERM surgery, taking COST line into account as a new parameter</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who received epiretinal membrane surgery between June, 2008, and November, 2010, at Kyorin Eye Center. Only eyes with postoperative followup period more than 6 months were included. Eyes with secondary epiretinal membrane (previous history of uveitis, intraocular surgery, preoperatively noted retinal breaks, etc.) were excluded.</criteria>
