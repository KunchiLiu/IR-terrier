	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Endostar with Gemcitabine-Carboplatin are more effective than Gemcitabine-Carboplatin alone in the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),and about Endostar ,Compared with intravenous, Continued vein-pumping maby is a more effective way.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endostar Continued Pumping Into Vein Combining With Gemcitabine-Carboplatin to Treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endostar have anti-tumor activity by against vascular endothelial growth factor for initial treatment. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Endostar Continued vein-pumping Combining with Gemcitabine-Carboplatin (GC)chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC,and seeking for more effective injection. Methods: In this randomized, open label, 90 patients are planned to be enrolled at random into 3 arms(1:1:1): Experimental: Endostar -Continued Pumping into+Gemcitabine-Carboplatin(GC),Active Comparator: Endostar -injecting into +Gemcitabine-Carboplatin(GC),Active Comparator: Gemcitabine-Carboplatin(GC),</detailed_description>
