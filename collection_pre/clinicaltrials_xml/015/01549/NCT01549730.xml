	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look for low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in your cervix cancer using a special x-ray test called a positron emission tomography (PET)scan. Hypoxia may have an effect on how cervix cancer grows and responds to treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Doctors at Princess Margaret Hospital have measured hypoxia in over 300 patients. The use of PET scans to measure hypoxia may be better and simpler than the methods used previously.</brief_summary>
