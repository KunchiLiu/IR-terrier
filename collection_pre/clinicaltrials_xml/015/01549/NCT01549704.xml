	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Adductor-Canal-Blockade (ACB) is superior to placebo when it comes to analgetic efficacy in high pain responders after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). High pain responders are defined as patients reporting VAS &gt; 60 during knee flexion the 1. or 2. day after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Adductor-Canal-Blockade on High Pain Responders After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients will be included the 1. or 2. day after surgery. All TKA patients will be screened. Those reporting VAS &gt; 60 during active 45 degrees knee flexion will be asked to participate. Included patients will receive 2xACB (singleshot) first placebo (30ml saline) and then ropivacaine (30ml ropivacaine 7,5mg/ml) or the other way around (randomized). There will be 45 minutes between the two blockades. The blockades will be ultrasound guided.</detailed_description>
