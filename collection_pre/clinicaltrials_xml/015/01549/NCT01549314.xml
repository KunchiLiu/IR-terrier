	<brief_title>Cystic Fibrosis Related Bone Disease: the Role of CFTR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, has recently been FDA approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients with at least one G551D CFTR mutation. Given the possible role of CFTR in bone, we hypothesize that this medication may also improve bone health in CF patients. The purpose of this study is to test this hypothesis using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, a research tool that measures bone micro-architecture and volumetric bone density and has the ability to detect small changes in bone that might otherwise be missed with standard bone imaging techniques such as bone density testing.</detailed_description>
