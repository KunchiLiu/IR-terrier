	<brief_title>Effect of Febuxostat Compared to Placebo on Exercise Tolerance in Participants With Chronic Stable Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study. This study is comprised of a single-blind placebo run-in qualifying phase lasting approximately 3 weeks and a double-blind treatment phase lasting 12 weeks. A safety follow-up visit is scheduled for 2 weeks after last dose of study drug. All participants will undergo 3 visits during a 3 week, run-in phase (Days -21 to Day 1). During the run-in phase, all participants will receive single-blind placebo. Two exercise treadmill tests (ETTs) will be conducted using the modified Bruce Protocol at Day -14 and at Day -7. The results from the Day -7 ETT will be considered as Baseline. A total of approximately 100 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either febuxostat 80 mg once daily (QD) or placebo QD in a double-blind treatment for 12 weeks, and 5 more visits. All participants will complete the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and Euroqol 5 dimension (EQ-5D) quality-of-life measurements at Day 1, Week 6 and Week 12/Early Termination (ET) Visit. The investigator will also rate the overall severity of the participant's angina at each visit based on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Grading of Angina (CCSGA). This 12-week phase 2 proof-of-concept study was designed to assess the effect of febuxostat as an add-on to stable anti-anginal therapy on the total exercise time of participants with chronic stable angina and a serum urate ≥5 mg/dL. At this time, Takeda has decided to terminate the study for business reasons.</detailed_description>

The participant has an serum urate (sUA) ≥5.0 mg/dL. 4. The participant has a history of angina, defined as: 1. Minimum of 3month history of stable angina (at least 2 episodes of chest pain or anginal equivalent in the past 30 days); AND 2. Receiving at least one chronic antiischemic medication(s), including beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and long acting nitrates (doses must be stable for at least 30 days prior to Screening [Day 21]); AND 3. Coronary artery disease, as defined by: ≥50 % stenosis of ≥1 major coronary artery confirmed by angiography; OR Documented prior myocardial infarction (MI) by enzymes/electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; OR Documented myocardial imaging stress test; OR Prior history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) greater than 3 months prior to Screening Day 21. 5. The participant has estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &gt;30 mL/min by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) at the Screening visit Day 21. 6. The participant has a normal/controlled blood pressure at Day 1/Randomization, as defined by the mean of three sitting blood pressures not exceeding 140/90. 7. The participant is male or female and aged 18 to 85 years, inclusive. 8. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study. 9. Participant is on stable (30 days) medication doses prescribed for any underlying medical condition (ie; hypertension, angina) and will remain on stable doses throughout the study duration. 10. Participant is able to take, in an ongoing manner, nitroglycerine for anginal symptoms. 11. Symptomlimited exercise duration, during ETT at Day 14 and Day 7, on the modified Bruce Protocol. 12. Exercise duration for the two ETTs at Day 14 and Day 7 did not differ by more than 20% of the longer of the two times, and did not differ by more than 60 seconds. To be confirmed by the Core ECG Lab prior to the subject being randomized. 13. Definite ECG signs of ischemia during the ETT at both Day 14 and Day 7 (i.e., 1 additional mm of horizontal or downsloping STsegment depression beyond baseline and ≥1 mm below the isoelectric line) are present in at least one standard ECG lead during ETT. The Day 7 ≥1 mm STsegment depression must be verified by the Core ECG Lab prior to participant being randomized. 1.
