	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this research is to examine the result of rotator cuff repairs following acute shoulder dislocations and to investigate whether timing of surgery following acute shoulder dislocations affects patients perception of pain, function, and strength following surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Results of Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a higher risk of rotator cuff tears following dislocation when the individual is greater than 40 years old. Rotator cuff tears after dislocation of the shoulder are more of a challenge to repair particularly if there is a delay in diagnosis. Clinical experience would suggest that rotator cuff repair within the first month of injury allows for better results in acute rotator cuff tears without shoulder dislocation. There are no reported results for rotator cuff repairs following shoulder dislocation and timing of repair. If we find that early repair provides better results this will be important for Primary Care Providers and Emergency Department physicians to refer these patients early for evaluation and subsequently earlier treatment.</detailed_description>
