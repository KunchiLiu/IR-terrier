	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of panobinostat and carfilzomib have on the patient's cancer. It will determine the side effects of different dose levels of panobinostat and carfilzomib and determine the best dose and schedule of the two drugs to recommend for future studies. The study will assess the effects of the drug on multiple myeloma. In addition, tests to study the way the drugs work will also be done. The combination of the 2 drug classes have shown both pre-clinical (studies done in the lab) and clinical (studies done with people) effects against multiple myeloma. For this reason, these 2 drugs are being studied in combination to determine the side effects and anti-myeloma effects of the 2 drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Combination of Panobinostat &amp; Carfilzomib in Patients With Relapsed &amp;/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label, phase I study of panobinostat, carfilzomib in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Based on the preclinical data supporting the use of combined histone de-acetylase (HDAC) and proteasome inhibition, the incidence of single-agent panobinostat and carfilzomib anti-myeloma activity, and clinical data demonstrating safety and efficacy of panobinostat with a different proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib), this study will evaluate the combination of panobinostat and carfilzomib in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in a phase I trial.</detailed_description>

Patients must have relapsed/ refractory disease and be in need of therapy with evidence of measurable disease defined as at least one of the following: Serum M protein ≥ 0.5 g/dl (≥ 5g/l) Urine M protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: Involved FLC assay ≥ 10 mg/dl (≥100 mg/l) and an abnormal serum free light chain ratio (&lt; 0.26 or &gt; 1.65) Measurable plasmacytoma (Prior biopsy is acceptable) 4. Ability to provide written informed consent obtained prior to participation in the study and any related procedures being performed 5. Patients must meet the following laboratory criteria: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 10⁹/L (growth factors cannot be used within 3 days of screening) Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl (PRBC transfusions cannot be used within 3 days of screening) Platelets ≥ 75 x 10⁹/L (platelet transfusions cannot be used within 3 days of screening) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum potassium ≥ lower limit of normal (LLN) Total serum calcium [corrected for serum albumin] or ionized calcium ≥ LLN. (treatment of hypercalcemia is allowed and subjects may enroll if hypercalcemia returns to normal with standard treatment) Serum magnesium ≥ LLN Serum phosphorus ≥ LLN Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min (CockcroftGault calculation) Clinically euthyroid. Note: Patients are permitted to receive thyroid hormone supplements to treat underlying hypothyroidism 6. Baseline multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO) must demonstrate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ the lower limit of the institutional normal 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2 8. Must be willing and able to undergo bone marrow aspirates per protocol (with or without bone marrow biopsy per institutional guidelines). The bone marrow aspirate/biopsy must be adequate to allow for comparison for the onstudy efficacy assessments. 9. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) An FCBP is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. 1. Prior histone deacetylase (HDAC), dichloroacetate (DAC), or valproic acid for the treatment of cancer 2. Prior treatment with carfilzomib 3.

Patients who will need valproic acid for any medical condition during the study or within 5 days prior to first panobinostat treatment 5. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any one of the following: History or presence of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. (Patients with a history of atrial arrhythmia are eligible but should be discussed with the Principal Investigator prior to enrollment) History of congenital long QT syndrome Any history of ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes Bradycardia defined as heart rate (HR) &lt; 50 bpm. Patients with pacemakers are eligible if HR ≥ 50 bpm.
