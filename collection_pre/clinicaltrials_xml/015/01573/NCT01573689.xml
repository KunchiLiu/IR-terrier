	<brief_summary>The methodology of this clinical trial is based on the realisation of a group intervention with children who lost a parent. Interviews preintervention and postintervention with participants will be done as well. The purpose of this study is to answer the following question: "What are the benefits for children who are in the process of bereaving a parent to participate in a group work intervention based on the mutual aid model ?". The aim of the research is to explore the benefits for grieving children to participate in an group work intervention based on the mutual aid model. To do so, the research has three distinct objectives : 1) to develop and apply a program of group work interventions for grieving children based on the mutual aid model ; 2) to explore the extent to which participation in the group facilitates changes in the children's discourse about death and the loss of their parents, and 3) to examine, from the children's own perceptive, the possible impact that their participation in the group have on their experience of bereavement.</brief_summary>
