	<detailed_description>The EPIC ClearView is a galvanic skin response (GSR) measurement system that is intended to be used to determine autonomic response as psychological indicators by measuring the electrical resistance of the skin. The EPIC ClearView is a non-invasive digital bioelectrography instrument that is used to assess the electrophysiology of humans. The measurements are digital photographs taken in a brief exposure to an electric field. These measurements are quantified to produce a standardized Response Scale.</detailed_description>
