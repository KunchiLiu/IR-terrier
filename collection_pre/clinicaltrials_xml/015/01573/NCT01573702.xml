	<brief_summary>- Progression free survival after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in EGFR patients progressed after EGFR-TKI therapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery or Other Local Ablation Then Erlotinib in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives - To estimate progression free survival (PFS) after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR-TKI therapy Secondary Objectives - To evaluate local control of sites previously progressive on erlotinib following SRS followed by erlotinib - To estimate overall survival (OS) after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR-TKI therapy - To characterize the toxicity of SRS - To characterize the toxicity of erlotinib when preceded by SRS Exploratory Objectives - To explore if VeriStrat results following completion of SRS are associated with longer PFS or OS after re-initiation of erlotinib - To explore if VeriStat results following completion of SRS are associated with longer PFS or OS after re-initiation of erlotinib - To explore whether "poor" VeriStat signatures every turn to "good" signatures with the study therapy, and to explore PFS and OS of patients whose signature changes - To utilize the full NMR peaks from MALDI-TOF to generate hypotheses regarding alternative signatures for evaluation and novel biomarkers</detailed_description>
