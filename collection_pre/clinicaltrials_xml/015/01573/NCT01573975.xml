	<brief_title>Comparison Between Ten Days Sequential Treatment and Traditional Three Combined Treatment of Helicobacter Pylori</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Antimicrobial resistance has decreased eradication rates for Helicobacter pylori infection worldwide. Objective: To determine whether sequential treatment eradicates H. pylori infection better than standard triple-drug therapy for adults with dyspepsia or peptic ulcers in Taiwanese people. Design: Randomized, single-blind, prospective controlled trial. Setting: A large tertiary referral hospital in eastern Taiwan. Patients: 450 patients with dyspepsia or peptic ulcers and infected by H. pylori. Measurements: 13C-urea breath test, upper endoscopy, histologic evaluation, rapid urease test, bacterial culture, assessment of antibiotic resistance and CYP2C19 genotype of host. Intervention: 450 patients with H. pylori infection are randomly assigned to receive one of the following therapeutic schemes: group A (5RA5RCT): rabeprazole (20 mg bid) plus amoxicillin (1 g bid) for 5 days, followed by rabeprazole (20 mg bid) plus clarithromycin (500 mg bid) and tetracycline (1g bid) for a further 5 days; group B (5RA5RCM): rabeprazole (20 mg bid) plus amoxicillin (1 g bid) for 5 days, followed by rabeprazole (20 mg bid) plus clarithromycin (500 mg bid) and metronidazole (500mg bid) for a further 5 days; group C as control: rabeprazole (20 mg bid) plus amoxicillin (1 g bid) and clarithromycin (500 mg bid.) for 10 days.</detailed_description>
