	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators are interested in assessing the effects of the isocaloric increase of eating frequency on appetite and metabolism. How the consumption of an isocaloric breakfast in four intakes vs. one can modify satiety and appetite control in lean and obese subjects through : - the physiological consequences : difference in postprandial kinetics of glucose, non esterified fatty acid, triglyceride, the secretion of satiety gut hormone (insulin, ghrelin, leptin and cholescystokinine (CCK), peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), nutrients oxidative fate and plasmatic oxidative stress (Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathion, lipid hydroperoxides) - eating behavior during an ad libitum buffet test meal</brief_summary>
