	<brief_summary>The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the pulmonary hyperinflation and its immediate reversibility to a short acting beta2 agonist test in uncontrolled persistent asthmatic patients with dyspnea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence and Reversibility of Lung Hyperinflation in Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The other objectives are : - the evaluation of the hyperinflation defined by an increase of the residual volume (RV), - the observation of the relationship between the hyperinflation and the asthma characteristics, - the study of the improvement of the functional parameters after a reversibility test - the evaluation of the correlation between hyperinflation parameters evolution, chest tightness and dyspnea</detailed_description>
