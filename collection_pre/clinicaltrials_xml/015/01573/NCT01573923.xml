	<brief_summary>Liver cirrhosis and subsequent liver failure are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Alcohol abuse and viral hepatitis are the most common causes of cirrhosis. Novel therapies are necessary to prevent or block the process of the disease. In this current prospective cohort, the investigators plan to organize four hospitals to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous administration of umbilical mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis in next three years.</brief_summary>
