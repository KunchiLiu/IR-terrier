	<brief_title>Non Invasive and Non-Contact Dual-modal Imaging Of Tissue Oxygenation and Vascular Reactivity Dynamic Imaging Of Tissue Metabolism and Vascular Function.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hyperspectral imaging technique estimates cutaneous tissue oxygenation by illuminating tissue and detecting tissue reflectance at different wavelengths. One major advantage of hyperspectral imaging is non-invasive and non-contact detection of tissue functional properties. The dual-mode imaging system integrates hyperspectral and thermal imaging modalities for simultaneous assessment of cutaneous tissue oxygenation and vascular function. This clinical protocol is defined to validate the CWC system on healthy human subjects</detailed_description>
