	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether FAST (Fast muscle Activation and Stepping Training) exercises will improve walking balance in individuals after stroke to a greater extent than usual care. Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that improvements in walking balance will be larger following 12 sessions of FAST exercise retraining compared to usual care in persons in the sub-acute phase after stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fast Muscle Activation and Stepping Training (FAST) Post-stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is estimated that 75-80% of individuals who have had a stroke will survive the acute event and be left with residual disability. Regaining independence in standing and walking is of utmost importance for patients recovering from stroke. Walking balance requires muscles in the legs and trunk to contract quickly if people lose their balance. Physical therapy plays a key role in the rehabilitation of walking balance in individuals after stroke. Given that maintaining one's balance requires fast muscle activity, rehabilitation post-stroke should focus on speed of movement. Thus we are proposing to compare a program that emphasizes speed of movement, Fast muscle Activation and Stepping Training versus an active control (usual care).</detailed_description>
