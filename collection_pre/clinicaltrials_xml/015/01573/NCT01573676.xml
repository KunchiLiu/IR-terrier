	<brief_summary>Obesity is a very important risk-factor in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep breathing disorders in patients with extreme BMI. Candidates for bariatric surgery have a high OSA prevalence, ranging from 60-83%. The characteristics of patients with sleep apnea that were evaluated for bariatric surgery and had a full overnight polysomnography (PSG) screening for OSA were described and it was found that a very high prevalence (77.2%) for OSA in all subjects evaluated, regardless of pre-operative risk for OSA. A post-bariatric surgery PSG was not a part of this study. The investigators would like to demonstrate the impact of bariatric surgery on OSA as a function of time.</brief_summary>
