	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinopathies in reproductive-age women, and it affects 5-7% of this group. It is characterized by disturbed menstrual cycle, ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism. Over 40% of PCOS women might become the patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. It has been confirmed that insulin resistance (IR) is a common feature in PCOS and adipokines might play roles in the pathogenesis of IR and PCOS, because these adipokines have wide-ranging effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The present clinical trial intends to compare the effects of metformin and oral contraceptives on PCOS patients, focusing on the insulin sensitivity, ovulation, and menstrual cycle etc. The investigators also aim to study the effects of metformin on serum adipokine levels(such as pigment epithelium-derived factor, progranulin etc.)in PCOS patients.</brief_summary>
