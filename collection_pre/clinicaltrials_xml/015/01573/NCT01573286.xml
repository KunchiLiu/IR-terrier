	<brief_summary>This protocol outlines a randomized,open label trial examining the safety, pharmacology and efficacy of Glucagon like peptide 2 (GLP-2) in infants and children with intestinal failure. The investigators hypothesize that GLP-2 given subcutaneously in these patients will be well tolerated, and have similar metabolism to what has been shown in adults. The investigators also expect to show an improvement in the tolerance of enteral nutrition, and a decreased requirement for intravenous feeding.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Dosing Study of Glucagon-like Peptide 2 (GLP-2) in Infants and Children With Intestinal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GLP-2 (1-33) is a naturally occurring peptide which is important in controlling the function of the intestine. In previous studies our group has shown that serum levels of GLP-2 correlate with intestinal function in human neonates. Low levels of GLP-2 are predictive of intestinal malabsorption and the development of the so called "Short Bowel Syndrome". GLP-2 has been shown to be specifically trophic for the GI tract, especially for the small intestine. This proposal outlines a Phase 1 and 2 trial using subcutaneous administration, twice daily of GLP-2 in human infants and children with Intestinal Failure, typically from Short Bowel Syndrome, using varying doses, assigned in a prospective, randomized protocol, with open label monitoring. The investigational plan is to begin with the Phase 1 trial, administering GLP 2 at varying doses (infants assigned to doses of 5,10, or 20 μg/kg/day, children greater than 1 year dosed at 20 μg/kg/day, given via twice daily subcutaneous injection). Eligible subjects will be infants (less than 12 months corrected gestational age) with either major resection (remaining small intestine less than 40% of predicted length for gestational age), or demonstrated intestinal failure after intestinal resection/abdominal surgery/gastroschisis (Requirement for parenteral nutrition greater than 50% of total calories, more than 45 days after the last surgery). Infants will be allocated sequentially to a group (n = 6 per group) treated with GLP-2 at 5,10, or 20 μg/kg/day. Older children (greater than 1 year of age), requiring PN for &gt;30% calories&gt; one year post surgery will also be eligible; these patients will be dosed at 20 μg/kg/day (via twice daily subcutaneous injection) n= 7. Patients will be followed on the principle of intention to treat after initial randomization. The endpoints will be monitoring for safety, and recording of adverse events and a pharmacokinetic profile at 3 days. If the hormone is well tolerated these studies will be extended into a phase 2 study, for an additional 39 days; monitoring safety, patient tolerance of enteral nutrition, growth, citrulline levels, nutrient absorptive capacity, liver function and repeat pharmacokinetic studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Infants (&lt; 1 year corrected gestational age) Infants with congenital anomalies, or intestinal resection, leaving them with anatomic short bowel syndrome (total remaining small intestine less than 40 % of predicted for gestational age) will be eligible for treatment in the immediate postoperative period. Infants with intestinal resection or repaired gastroschisis who have demonstrated dependence on parenteral nutrition at 45 days post operation with the requirement for &gt;50% of calories by PN (independent of the length of remnant small intestine). Children (&gt; 1 year corrected gestational age) Children with a requirement for &gt;30% of calories by PN more than 1 year (365) days post surgery will be eligible. Significant extraintestinal disease (e.g., grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage, severe hypoxic encephalopathy); Significant cardiovascular, hemodynamic or respiratory instability, as noted by 1) the requirement for dopamine &gt; 4 mcg/kg/min, 2) high frequency ventilatory support, 3) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Hepatic disease defined as direct bilirubin &gt; 100 umol/L (5.2 mg/dL) Renal disease defined as BUN &gt; 80 or creatinine &gt; 90 μmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) Inborn errors of metabolism necessitating protein restriction or other special diet; Ongoing sepsis syndrome, as noted by refractory hypotension, thrombocytopenia, acidosis, and/or bacteremia. Primary motility defect such as intestinal pseudoobstruction. Absorptive defects (such as microvillus inclusion disease) Females who are postpubertal must agree to comply with measures to prevent pregnancy during the study phase. Coagulopathy which precludes the use of subcutaneous injections. Allergy to GLP2 or any of the constituent of the GLP2 IC115 preparation.</criteria>
