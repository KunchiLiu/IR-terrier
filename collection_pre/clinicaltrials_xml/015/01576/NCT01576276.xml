	<brief_summary>Healthy right-handed volunteers aged 21 to 50 needed for a research study of the effects of morphine and ketorolac on brain activity in response to pain stimuli as measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Study will be conducted on six separate days not requiring an overnight stay in the hospital.</brief_summary>
