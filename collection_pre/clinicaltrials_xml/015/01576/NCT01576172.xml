	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies abiraterone acetate and prednisone together with veliparib to see how well it works compared to abiraterone acetate and prednisone alone in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has spread from the primary site to other places in the body. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antiandrogen drugs, such as abiraterone acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving abiraterone acetate together with prednisone and veliparib may work better than abiraterone acetate and prednisone alone in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone With or Without Veliparib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the role of v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene (ETS) gene fusion as a predictive biomarker for response to hormone therapy (abiraterone [abiraterone acetate]) alone or hormone therapy plus poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) targeted therapy (ABT-888 [veliparib]) in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. II. To evaluate whether the addition of PARP-1 targeted therapy is superior to hormone therapy alone based on ETS gene fusion status. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines. II. Objective response rate. III. Progression-free survival. IV. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of abiraterone acetate with and without ABT-888. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the concordance in fusion status among prostate cancer samples from the primary site, biopsied metastasis, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). II. To assess if ETS fusion status in the CTCs, at baseline, 12 weeks, and disease progression (or when off study) is associated with response to therapy. III. To evaluate if the number of CTCs, as well as the expression levels of androgen receptor, RAD51 recombinase (RAD51), and gamma-H2A histone family, member X (H2aX) foci in the CTCs at baseline, at 12 weeks, and at disease progression in all patients is associated with response to therapy. IV. To determine the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss as a predictive biomarker of response to abiraterone, alone or in combination with ABT-888. V. To determine the role of PARP1 activity as a predictive biomarker of response to abiraterone, alone or in combination with ABT-888. VI. To perform next-generation sequencing for discovery of novel gene fusions in prostate cancers negative for ETS fusions. VII. To perform germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of genes involved in hormone synthesis, transport, binding, metabolism, and degradation for discovery of novel SNPs predictive of response to abiraterone, alone or in combination with ABT-888. VIII. To determine if ETS fusion ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels in blood are predictive of response to abiraterone, alone or in combination with ABT-888. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and prednisone PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-28. Patients also receive abiraterone acetate PO QD and prednisone PO BID on day 1 (day 8 of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of prostate cancer Have progressive metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer, on androgendeprivation therapy, based on at least one of the following criteria: PSA progression defined as 25% increase over baseline value with an increase in the absolute value of at least 2 ng/mL that is confirmed by another PSA level with a minimum of a 1week interval with a minimum PSA of 2 ng/mL Progression of bidimensionally measurable soft tissue (nodal metastasis) assessed within one month prior to registration by a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis Progression of bone disease (evaluable disease) (new bone lesion[s]) by bone scan Agree to undergo a biopsy of at least 1 metastatic site for genefusion status analysis; adequate archival metastatic tissue can be used if available in lieu of a biopsy; patients will only be eligible for protocol therapy if the biopsy has tumor and the tissue is evaluable for ETS fusion status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 Have testosterone &lt;
