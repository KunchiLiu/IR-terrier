	<criteria>Key Male and female subjects who are ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years old Subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at least one year prior to Screening and receiving a stable, therapeutic dose of metformin &gt; 1500 mg/day according to local prescribing information for at least 3 months prior to Screening or the highest tolerated dose &gt; 1000 mg/day documented in the subject's history HbA1c &gt; 7.0% and &lt; 10.5% at Screening Cpeptide &gt; 0.8 ng/mL at Screening Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 22 and &lt; 45 kg/m2 at Screening Body weight &lt; 150 kg at Screening Key Prior participation in any stem cell study Women who are pregnant, intending to become pregnant during the study period or currently lactating History of active substance abuse (including alcohol) within the past 2 years. Current alcohol abuse is defined as daily consumption of &gt;3 alcoholic beverage. Current cigarette smoking &gt; 10 cigarettes per day Severe hypoglycemia (defined as requiring third party assistance) or repeated and/or frequent hypoglycemia episodes (&gt; 2 episodes/week) within one month prior to Screening Patients receiving treatment for type 2 diabetes with diet and exercise alone, insulin therapy within 6 months of Screening except if used transiently for &lt; 7 days for intercurrent illness or any other antidiabetic medication except metformin within 3 months of Screening Any concurrent medical condition/disorder or clinically symptomatic cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (including pancreatitis), renal, hematological, pulmonary, acute or chronic infectious disease, active retinal disease, or other disorder which in the Investigator's opinion would interfere with the subject's ability to complete the trial, would require administration of treatment that could affect the interpretation of the safety and efficacy variables or would preclude safe involvement in the study.</criteria>
