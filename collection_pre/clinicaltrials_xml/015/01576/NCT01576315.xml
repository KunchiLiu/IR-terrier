	<brief_summary>Aspergillus infection is an infectious complication which frequently occurs in cystic fibrosis. The efficacy of azole therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis with persistent positive sputums for Aspergillus is still unknown. Furthermore, the efficacy of itraconazole and voriconazole in this indication has never been evaluated in a large prospective controlled clinical trial, even though many teams already use it. The ATCF study aims to assess in patients with cystic fibrosis with persistent Aspergillus positive cultures the efficacy of itraconazole and voriconazole on the negativisation of the sputum cultures for Aspergillus.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aspergillus infection is an infectious complication which frequently occurs in cystic fibrosis. The efficacy of azole therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis with persistent positive sputums for Aspergillus is still unknown. Furthermore, the efficacy of itraconazole and voriconazole in this indication has never been evaluated in a large prospective controlled clinical trial, even though many teams already use it. The ATCF study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled phase II trial, performed in patients with cystic fibrosis with persistent Aspergillus positive cultures. The primary outcome is to assess the efficacy of itraconazole and voriconazole on the course and outcome of the negativisation of the sputum cultures for Aspergillus on two consecutive cultures. Secondary objectives include the effects of azole therapy on quality of life, FEV1, co-prescription of antibiotic and steroids, plasma concentrations of antifungal agents, speed of negativisation of sputum culture for Aspergillus, outcome of other diagnostic criteria (Aspergillus detection by PCR, precipiting antibodies, total and specific IgE, eosinophilia), and the safety profiles of the two products. Mycological failures, and impact of anti-fungal treatments on lung and systemic inflammation will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
