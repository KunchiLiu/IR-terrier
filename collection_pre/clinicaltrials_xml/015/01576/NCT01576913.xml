	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: Music pacing improves the quality of exercise testing in children. Children tend to cycle in a non-constant pace during exercise testing, which might make the test less reliable. 20 boys will perform two exercise tests on a cycle ergometer. One test will be done with constant tempoed music, and the other without. Different parameters will be checked including pedaling cadence, aerobic fitness, level of work load obtained.</brief_summary>
