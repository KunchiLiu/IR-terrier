	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects (good and bad) of supplementation with Glutamine to that of a placebo (L-alanine), on your child and their Short Bowel Syndrome. Researchers are doing this study to see if the addition of Glutamine to oral/tube feeding (nutrition therapy) will work better by preventing bloodstream infections, improving growth, and/or changing the make-up of bacteria in your child's intestine. Glutamine is approved by the FDA for use in adults with Short Bowel Syndrome. In this study, the investigators will be assessing how well Glutamine affects Short Bowel Syndrome in children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enteral Glutamine in Reducing Bloodstream Infections in Short Bowel Syndrome Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled pilot study to investigate the efficacy of enteral glutamine (GLN) supplementation in 36 infants, â‰¤ 12 months of age with parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent short bowel syndrome (SBS) due to massive small bowel resection for NEC and/or atresia on improving weaning of PN and preventing infections. The investigators intend to evaluate the effect of enteral feeding and GLN supplementation on the gut bacteria. The investigators will also recruit 12 age-matched controls to evaluate the normal gut bacteria.</detailed_description>
