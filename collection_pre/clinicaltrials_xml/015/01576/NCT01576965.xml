	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn about bowel preparation (cleansing) before laparoscopic hysterectomy and/or sacrocolpopexy. We are most interested in the ability of the surgeon to view necessary anatomy for the surgery, which will be assessed by a questionnaire completed at the end of your operation by the surgeon. We hypothesize that bowel preparation before laparoscopic hysterectomy will result in improved ability of the surgeon to view necessary anatomy for the surgery.</brief_summary>
