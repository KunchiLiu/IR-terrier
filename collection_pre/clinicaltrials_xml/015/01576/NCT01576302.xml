	<brief_summary>Rumination is an upper gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by the frequent regurgitation of recently ingested food. Very little is understood about the nature and treatment of this disorder. The act of regurgitation in rumination involves the opening of the upper esophageal sphincter and the muscular contraction of the abdomins rectus. Behavioral treatment of these symptoms is the clinical intervention of choice; however, only uncontrolled case documentation exists to support its effectiveness. However, an effective behavioral mechanism may be relaxation of the muscles. From a behavioral standpoint, muscular relaxation is incompatible with the necessary muscular contraction for rumination. To date, single case documentation and few designed single case studies have examined the clinical effectiveness of behavioral interventions for GI rumination. In the current study, the investigators seek to examine the effectiveness of two behavioral relaxation interventions for GI rumination through a treatment as usual paradigm (proposed N = 20). Our primary goals are to examine the clinical effectiveness of these interventions in symptom reduction at 1- and 3-month follow-up.</brief_summary>
