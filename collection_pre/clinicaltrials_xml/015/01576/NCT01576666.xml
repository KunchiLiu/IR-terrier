	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dose of LDE225 and BKM120 that can be safely given together to patients and/or the dose that will be used in future studies. This study will also learn more about how the combination of these two investigational drugs may work for patients with certain cancers (specifically metastatic breast cancer, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic colorectal cancer and recurrent glioblastoma multiforme).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib, Dose Escalation Study of Oral LDE225 in Combination With BKM120 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine a combination maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of LDE225 and BKM120 when co-administered orally in patients with advanced solid tumors. Adult patients, aged &gt; 18 years with advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard therapy or for which no standard therapies exist will be eligible for this study. In the dose escalation part of the study, four groups of patients with the following tumor types will be enrolled: recurrent GBM, metastatic breast cancer, metastatic CRC and advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It is anticipated that approximately 45 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation part. Approximately 15 GBM patients (maximum of 2 patients per dose level) will be enrolled to previously well-tolerated doses during dose escalation if no slot is available in a cohort under active testing. In the dose expansion part of the study, five groups of patients (approximately 15 patients per group) with the following tumor types will be enrolled: recurrent GBM, triple negative metastatic breast cancer, hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+, and Her2-) metastatic breast cancer, gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer, and a combined maximum of 15 patients with metastatic CRC or advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The dose expansion will enroll approximately 75 patients. Accounting for patients who may withdraw or who may not meet the eligibility criteria, it is expected that this study will enroll approximately 120 patients. This is a multi-center, open-label, dose finding, phase Ib study to determine the MTD and/or RDE for the combination of LDE225 plus BKM120, followed by an expansion part to further assess safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination in patients with advanced solid tumors that are frequently associated with dysregulated Hh and/or PI3K pathways, specifically triple negative metastatic breast cancer, hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+, and Her2-) metastatic breast cancer, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic CRC, recurrent GBM and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer patients. Patients will be treated daily on 28-day cycles. Dose escalation will be dependent on the available toxicity information (including adverse events that are not DLTs), PK, PD, and efficacy information, as well as the recommendations from the Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM).</detailed_description>

Provision of an archival tumor sample to a Novartis designated laboratory for molecular profiling. The tumor material submitted for these analyses may have been obtained at any time during the course of the patient's disease. 4.

Negative serum pregnancy test; nonlactating or postmenopausal women. 1.Use of other investigational drugs within 30 days of enrollment or 5 halflives of enrollment, whichever is longer. 2.History of hypersensitivity to LDE225, BKM120 or to drugs of similar chemical classes. 3.Patient has received previous treatment with PI3K inhibitors and/or smoothened inhibitors. 4.Patients with recurrent GBM who have received radiotherapy within 3 months of initiating study treatment. 5.Patients with primary CNS tumor (except recurrent GBM), uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastasis. However, patients with controlled, asymptomatic or with resected CNS metastases with no radiological evidence of disease or with stable brain metastasis with no progression may be are eligible. 6.Patients who have neuromuscular disorders or are on concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil. If it is essential that the patient remains on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only Pravastatin may be used with extra caution. 7.Patients who require the use of warfarin (substrate of CYP2C9) cannot be enrolled as LDE225 and BKM120 are competitive inhibitors of CYP2C9 based on invitro data. 8.Patient is currently being treated with drugs known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5, which cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication 7 days prior to starting study treatment and for the duration of the study. 9.Patient has a score ≥12 on the PHQ9 questionnaire. A normal evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist can overrule this exclusion). 10.Patients who select responses of "1", "2" or "3" to question number 9 on the PHQ9 questionnaire regarding potential for suicidal thoughts or ideation (independent of the total score of the PHQ9), (a normal evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist can overrule this exclusion). 11.Patient has a GAD7 mood scale score ≥ 15, (a normal evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist can overrule this exclusion) 12.Patient has a documented medical history of or active major depression episode, bipolar disorder (I or II), obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of suicidal attempts or ideation, or homicidal ideation (e.g. risk of doing harm to self or others) 13. Patient has ≥CTCAE grade 3 anxiety 14.Current medical history of the following: Use of a pacemaker History of or presence of clinically significant ventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmia Clinically significant resting bradycardia (&lt; 45 beats per minute) History of clinically documented myocardial infarction History of unstable angina pectoris History of known structural abnormalities (i.e. cardiomyopathy) 15.Clinically significant cardiovascular disease 16.Clinically significant abnormal ECG 17.Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% as determined by Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) 18.Patient is currently receiving treatment with QT prolonging medication known to have a risk to induce Torsades de Pointes, and the treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication 7 days prior to starting the study and for the duration of the study 19.Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception as defined by the protocol during the study and through the duration of the study. Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraception 20.Sexually active males who are unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications and agree not father a child in this period. 21.Patients is currently receiving increasing or chronic treatment with corticosteroids ((≥ the antiinflammatory potency of 4mg dexamethasone) or another immunosuppressive agent. 22.Patient has been treated with any hematopoietic colonystimulating growth factors (e.g., GCSF, GMCSF) ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting study drug.

Provision of an archival tumor sample to a Novartis designated laboratory for molecular profiling. It is accepted that it may not be possible to obtain all samples prior to commencing study treatment. It is also accepted that it may not be possible to obtain a sample (e.g. if sufficient sample does not exist), and in this situation inclusion of the patient should be discussed with Novartis (as this may not make a patient ineligible). 5. Patients with primary CNS tumor (except recurrent GBM), uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastasis. However, patients with controlled, asymptomatic or with resected CNS metastases with no radiological evidence of disease or with stable brain metastasis with no progression may be eligible.
