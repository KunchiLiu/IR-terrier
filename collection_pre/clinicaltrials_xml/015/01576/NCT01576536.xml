	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to test whether genetic variation in the alpha 2A adrenergic receptor affects diurnal variation in platelet aggregation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Variation in Platelet Aggregation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a marked diurnal fluctuation in the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death, with peak incidences occurring in the early morning. Platelet aggregation has also been shown to increase in the early morning. The investigators will test the hypothesis that ADRA2A genetic variation, specifically haplotype 4, affects platelet aggregation. The investigators will compare diurnal platelet aggregation in haplotype 4 subjects with subjects in the other haplotype families. In addition, the investigators will compare platelet aggregation after the cold pressor test in haplotype 4 with the other haplotype families.</detailed_description>
