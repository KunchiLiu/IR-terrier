	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the post operational mobilization after volar locking plate osteosynthesis of distal radius fractures. One group is admitted training exercises just after the fracture treatment, one group after 14 days immobilization in a cast. The primary hypothesis is, that immediate training leads to earlier and faster recovery. Our second hypothesis is, that immediate training does not lead to increased risk of fracture displacement.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients were followed for one year with controls after one, three, six and twelve months. Occupational therapists blinded for the intervention examined the patients at all times. ROM, strength and DASH score was performed.</detailed_description>
