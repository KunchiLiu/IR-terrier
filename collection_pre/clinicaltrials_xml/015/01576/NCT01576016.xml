	<brief_summary>The MRI Study is a prospective, multi-center, clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Accent MRI™ System in a patient population indicated for implant of a pacemaker within and outside of the MRI environment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of the Accent Magnetic Resonance Imaging™ (MRI) Pacemaker and Tendril MRI™ Lead</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety and efficacy of the Accent MRI pacemaker and Tendril MRI lead will be evaluated as described below: Lead Safety Safety of the Tendril MRI™ lead will be evaluated in terms of freedom from RA and RV lead-related complications at implant to 2 months, and at the 2 through the 12 month visit. MRI Safety The safety of the Accent MRI™ system will be evaluated in terms of freedom from MRI scan related complications in the month following the MRI scan. Lead Efficacy Efficacy of the Tendril MRI™ lead will be evaluated in terms of the change in atrial and ventricular capture and sensing thresholds before and after the MRI scan. Secondary Endpoints Safety Safety of the Accent MRI™ system will be evaluated in terms of freedom from system-related complications through the 12 month visit. Efficacy Efficacy of the Tendril MRI™ lead will be evaluated in terms of the atrial and ventricular capture thresholds at the MRI Visit.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligible patients will meet all of the following: 1. Have an approved indication per American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) guidelines for implantation of a pacemaker 2. Will receive a new pacemaker and lead 3. Be willing to undergo an elective MRI scan without sedation 4. Be able to provide informed consent for study participation (legal guardian is NOT acceptable) 5. Be willing and able to comply with the prescribed followup tests and schedule of evaluations 6. Is not contraindicated for an MRI scan (per the preMRI safety screening form) Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the following: 1. Are medically indicated for an MRI scan at the time of enrollment 2. Have an existing pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). A new pacemaker and lead is required for enrollment 3. Have an existing active/inactive implanted medical device, e.g., neurostimulator, infusion pump, etc. 4. Have a nonMRI compatible device or material implanted (e.g., intracranial aneurysm clip, nonMRI compatible devices or material, metals or alloys, etc.) 5. Have a lead extender or adaptor 6. Be unable to fit in MRI bore; will come into contact with the magnet façade inside the MRI bore. 7. Have a prosthetic tricuspid heart valve 8. Are currently participating in a clinical investigation that includes an active treatment arm 9. Are allergic to dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) 10. Are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the duration of the study 11. Have a life expectancy of less than 12 months due to any condition 12. Patients with exclusion criteria required by local law (e.g., age) 13. Are unable to comply with the follow up schedule</criteria>
