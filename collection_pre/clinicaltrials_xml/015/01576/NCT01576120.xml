	<brief_title>Evaluation of a PillCam Colon Bowel Preparation Regimen in Crohn's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Primary Scientific Objective Evaluate the effectiveness of the PillCam COLON 2 Prep Regimen in CD patients. Secondary Objective To evaluate safety of the PillCam™ COLON 2 procedure in CD patients 2. Study Hypothesis Crohn's Disease may be pan-enteric in nature and can affect the small bowel, the colon or both. PillCam COLON 2 may be used for visualization of both SB and colon mucosa in Crohn's Disease patients. However, bowel prep is required in order to evacuate all fecal matter prior to the exam and in order to propel the capsule and complete its traverse through the entire GI track within examination time. 3. The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the prep regimen in terms of transit, excretion and cleansing in CD patients All end points will be evaluated within 4 months from end of enrollment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is 18 years of age and above Subjects who are determined by their physician to have active Crohn's disease based on at least one of the following tests which were performed in the past 3 months : Colonoscopy Capsule endoscopy of the small bowel or colon Other radiology tests Clinical symptoms with elevated positive inflammatory markers ;ESR, CRP, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, fecal lactoferrin, or fecal alpha1 antitrypsin Proven patency by the Agile capsule or another approach deemed clinically acceptable by the investigator, e.g. CT enterography, performed within the 3 months prior to enrollment Subject is able and agrees to sign the Informed Consent Form • Subject has dysphagia Subject has congestive heart failure Subject has renal insufficiency Subject has cirrhosis Subject is known or is suspected to suffer from intestinal obstruction Subject has known previous stricture/obstruction of the SB or colon Chronic use of laxatives Subject has a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted electro medical device. Women who are either pregnant or nursing at the time of screening, who intend to be during the study period, or are of childbearing potential and do not practice medically acceptable methods of contraception. Subject is expected to undergo MRI examination within 7 days after ingestion of the capsule. Subject has had prior abdominal surgery of the gastrointestinal tract other than uncomplicated procedures that would be unlikely to lead to bowel obstruction based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. Subject has any condition, which precludes compliance with study and/or device instructions. Subject suffers from life threatening conditions Subject is currently participating in another clinical study Subject has known slow gastric emptying time or GI transit time. Subject is allergic or contraindicated to any of the study medications</criteria>
