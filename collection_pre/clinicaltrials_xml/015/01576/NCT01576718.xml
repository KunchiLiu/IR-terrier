	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo and open-label active controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, dose ranging study in male or female subjects ages 12 years and older with severe persistent asthma who remain symptomatic despite high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose response, efficacy and safety of 4 different doses of fluticasone propionate (Dose 1, Dose 2, Dose 3, and Dose 4) delivered as Fluticasone Dry Powder Inhaler (Fp DPI) when administered twice daily.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Written informed consent/assent signed and dated by the subject and/or parent /legal guardian before conducting any study related procedure. 2. Male or female 12 years and older, as of the Screening Visit. Male or female 18 years and older, as of the Screening Visit, in countries where local regulations or the regulatory status of study medication permit enrollment of adults only. 3. General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study observations/results, or put the subject at increased risk during the study. 4. Asthma Diagnosis: Asthma as defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 5. Severity of Disease: • A best forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40%85% of the predicted normal value during the Screening Visit. NHANES III predicted values will be used for subjects aged ≥12 years and adjustments to predicted values will be made for African American subjects. ATS/ERS 2005 criteria for acceptability, reproducibility, and end of test must be met for spirometry 6. Reversibility of Disease: Demonstrated a ≥12% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 2 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (if required, spacers are permitted for reversibility testing only) at the Screening Visit. If a subject fails to demonstrate an increase in FEV1 ≥12% then the subject is not eligible for the study and will not be allowed to rescreen. Reversibility values of 11.50 11.99 will be rounded to 12. Documented historical reversibility of ≥ 12 % within 3 months of the Screening Visit will be accepted. 7. Current Asthma Therapy: Subjects will be required to be on a short acting β2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroid for a minimum of 8 weeks before the Screening Visit and have been maintained on a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroids for four weeks prior to the Screening Visit at one of the following doses: Fluticasone propionate HFA MDI ≥ 880 mcg/day Fluticasone propionate DPI≥ 1000 mcg/day Beclomethasone dipropionate DPI ≥ 2000 mcg/day Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA (QVAR)≥ 640 mcg/day Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA (Clenil Modulite)≥ 2000 mcg/day Budesonide DPI ≥ 1600 mcg/day Budesonide MDI ≥ 1600 mcg/day Flunisolide ≥ 2000 mcg/day Triamcinolone acetonide ≥ 2000 mcg /day Mometasone furoate DPI ≥ 880 mcg/day Ciclesonide HFA MDI ≥ 640 mcg/day Exception 1: Based upon the investigator's judgment that there is no inherent harm in changing the subject's current ICS/LABA therapy and the subject provides consent, subjects on inhaled Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DPI ≥ 1000 mcg/day, or Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol HFA ≥ 880 mcg/day, or Fluticasone propionate/Formoterol ≥ 1000 mcg/day,or Beclomethasone dipropionate/Formoterol ≥ 400 mcg/day, or Budesonide/formoterol HFA ≥ 640 mcg/day, or Budesonide/formoterol DPI ≥ 800 mcg/day, or Mometasone furoate/formoterol MDI ≥ 800 mcg/day or subjects on a qualifying ICS dose plus a longacting β2agonists (LABA) administered via separate inhalers, may be switched to a qualifying dose of fluticasone propionate provided the subjects will not participate in the PK portion of the study. Exception 2: Subjects on a qualifying dose of fluticasone propionate who wish to participate in the PK portion of the study and who provide consent may have their fluticasone propionate switched to a different qualifying ICS (nonfluticasone propionate) at a prescreening visit. The subject will be required to return to the clinic to complete the Screening Visit following a 1week washout period. 8. ShortActing β2Agonists: All subjects must be able to replace their current shortacting β2agonists with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol at the Screening Visit for use as needed for the duration of the study. The use of spacer devices with the metered dose inhaler (MDI) will not be allowed during the study with exception of it's use during reversibility testing at the Screening Visit. Nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not be allowed at any time during the study. Subjects must be able to withhold all inhaled shortacting β2 sympathomimetic bronchodilators for at least 6 hours prior to all study visits. 9.

Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 1 month of the Screening Visit. A subject must not have had any hospitalization for asthma within 2 month prior to the Screening Visit. Note: An exacerbation of asthma is defined as any worsening of asthma requiring any treatment other than rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI and/or the subject's regular inhaled corticosteroid maintenance treatment. This includes requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or emergency room visit or hospitalization, a change in the subject's regular inhaled corticosteroid maintenance treatment, or the addition of other asthma medications. 4.
