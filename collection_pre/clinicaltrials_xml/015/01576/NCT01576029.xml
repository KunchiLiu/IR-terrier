	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To compare the continuation of treatment with docetaxel versus switching to cabazitaxel regarding the time to PSA (Prostatic Specific Antigen) progression (TTP-PSA), in patients with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) that, after four cycles of docetaxel, have minor PSA response (defined as a reduction between 1% and 49%) or increase of up to 24% in PSA levels. Secondary Objectives: - PSA response rate - Overall survival (OS) - Incidence of Adverse Events</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Documentation of histological prostate cancer; Patients with metastatic CRPC (CastrationResistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer) who progressed with hormone deprivation, including the withdrawal of antiandrogenclass drugs for at least 4 weeks, and 6 weeks for bicalutamide or if documented that PSA did not decrease during 3 months of this therapy; Documentation of metastasis by imaging (computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or bone scan), in patients with PSA &lt; 20 ng/mL at the time of inclusion Provide minor PSA response (characterized by a reduction between 1% and 49%) or increase up to 24% in PSA levels, in relation to the value measured before starting docetaxel therapy, measured at least 7 days after the fourth cycle of docetaxel; Patient has received 4 cycles of docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 ; ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; Marrow, liver and renal function within acceptable values; PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL; Testosterone level ≤ 50 ng/dL (for patients with no prior history of orchiectomy). Exclusion criteria: Prior use of chemotherapy, except for docetaxel for four cycles; Documented disease progression during treatment with docetaxel (first 4 cycles); Patients with metastases resulting in neurological damage; Inability to continue receiving gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists in patients with no prior history of orchiectomy; Use of recombinant methionyl human granulocytecolony stimulating factor nonglycosylated (GCSF) in the 24 hours preceding baseline; Any other current neoplasia or over the past 5 years, except for basal cell skin carcinoma or squamous skin cell carcinoma; Known seropositivity for HIV (Human immunodeficiency Virus ); Concomitant diseases, such as significant neurological or psychiatric disease; uncontrolled hypercalcemia or any other serious comorbidity; Hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the study treatments.
