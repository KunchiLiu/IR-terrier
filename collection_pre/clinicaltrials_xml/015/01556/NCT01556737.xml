	<brief_summary>Alleged benefits experienced after the consumption of soy in Asian countries have been attributed to the isoflavone content of soy products. Amongst other benefits, isoflavones are believed to relieve menopausal symptoms and are therefore often consumed in supplement form in Western countries. These supplements contain relatively high amounts of isoflavones and are on the market in different compositions. The question is whether supplements with different compositions exert similar effects or whether the effects differ substantially.</brief_summary>
