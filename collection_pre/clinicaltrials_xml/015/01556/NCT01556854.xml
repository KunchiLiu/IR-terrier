	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare effectiveness of five different neuroprotectants, including butylphthalide, edaravone, citicoline, cerebrolysin, and piracetam, among patients with acute ischemic stroke. The secondary objectives of the study are as follows: - To compare safety of five different neuroprotectents, including butylphthalide, edaravone, citicoline, cerebrolysin, and piracetam, among patients with acute ischemic stroke. - To compare cost-effectiveness of five different neuroprotectents, including butylphthalide, edaravone, citicoline, cerebrolysin, and piracetam, among patients with acute ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Population:The study population will consist of consenting patients who are on neuroprotectant injection for the treatment of acute IS during hospitalization. Hospitals may contribute differing numbers of patients to the total sample size. Primary analyses will be conducted on the total sample size only. Assessment of Outcomes:The outcome measures in this study include effectiveness, safety and cost measures.</detailed_description>
