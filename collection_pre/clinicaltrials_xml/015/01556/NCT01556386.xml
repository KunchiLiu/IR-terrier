	<brief_title>Pharmacogenetic Analysis of Korean Pediatric Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cure rate of pediatric ALL dramatically improved over 80%. Resistance to drug and hematologic relapse are remaining problem in ALL treatment. One of the explanations of drug resistance and toxicities is the pharmacogenetic effect. Germline polymorphisms in genes that code for proteins involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antileukemic agents are various, and inter-patient variability is the main factor for pharmacogenetic difference. Since multiple chemotherapeutic agents are involved in treating ALL, many genes related to the metabolic pathways of those drugs have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of patients with ALL. In Korea, pharmacogenetic study including multiple genetic loci for pediatric ALL has not been reported.In this study, the distribution of genetic polymorphisms and genes related to antileukemic drugs were analyzed, and their relations to the outcome of treatment and relapse rates were assessed.</detailed_description>
