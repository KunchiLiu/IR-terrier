	<brief_summary>This study will test the following hypotheses: 1. Treatment of newly diagnosed Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in acutely ill patients with auto-adjusting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) would result in fewer in-hospital complications, as compared to no treatment (primary outcome). 2. Treatment of newly identified OSA in acutely ill patients with auto-adjusting CPAP would result in shorter length of stay, lower re-admission rate, better blood pressure (BP) control, better long term compliance with OSA treatment, as compared to no treatment (secondary outcomes).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initiation of Auto-adjusting CPAP for Newly Diagnosed OSA in Hospitalized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a pilot study performed as a randomized controlled prospective study of patients admitted to the general medical floors at MetroHealth Medical Center (MHMC). This study will be an add-on investigation to an original funded study: "Evaluation of Screening Tools for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in Hospitalized Medical Patients: A Validation Study" (the STOMP study). In the STOMP study, patients admitted Sunday through Thursday (day or night) to MHMC who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and are willing to participate in the study will complete the STOMP study by undergoing an in-hospital PSG (within 48 hours of admission to the medical floor). Those who's PSG shows clinically significant OSA (an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &gt; 5) will be approached for participation in this study. It is anticipated that at least 50 patients from the STOMP study will be eligible for randomization into this study. Participants will be randomized into an auto-adjusting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (ACPAP) (ResMed S9) arm or a standard therapy arm (control - no specific therapy for OSA other than possibly supplemental nocturnal oxygen if deemed necessary by the clinicians caring for the patient). Those randomized to ACPAP will continue this therapy until they undergo a repeat diagnostic sleep study (PSG) and then, if indicated, a titration PSG as an outpatient. Those in the standard therapy arm will receive no specific treatment for their OSA until they undergo a a repeat diagnostic study and then, if indicated, a full night titration PSG as an outpatient. Once the titration PSG has taken place, subjects will be changed to fixed CPAP and followed for an additional 6-8 weeks to assess compliance with therapy.</detailed_description>
