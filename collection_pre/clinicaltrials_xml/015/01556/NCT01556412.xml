	<brief_summary>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare chronic cholestatic liver disease, typically affecting middle aged men and is frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Establishing diagnosis in early stages of cholestatic hepatopathy is still a clinical challenge and based on invasive diagnostic procedures: endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) or percutaneous liver biopsy are needed when magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography remains inconclusive. As these procedures are associated with significant risks for the patient, the goal of this study is to evaluate, if endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) of the biliary tract is a useful diagnostic tool in suspected PSC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Different parameters of the common bile duct (wall thickness and irregularity, irregularity of the common bile duct and enlarged lymph nodes) are measured in patients with cholestatic hepatopathy of unknown causes via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). This EUS of the CBD is performed from the bulbar position in the duodenum and at least 5 cm of bile duct had to be visualized to correctly analyze bile duct structure. Further diagnostic work-up of these patients is performed following current guidelines, and definite diagnosis is compared with results of EUS parameters measured. Thus, diagnostic yield of EUS in patients with suspected PSC is further evaluated.</detailed_description>
