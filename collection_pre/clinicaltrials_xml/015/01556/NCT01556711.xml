	<brief_title>Assessment of Head Injury in the Emergency Department Using BrainScope速 Ahead速 Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the current study is proposed to prospectively validate the BrainScope Ahead速 M-100 device design, performance, and labeling with respect to the device's target intended use and indications for use: - Primary Endpoint: - Structural Injury Assessment - There are four co-primary endpoints in this study: two sets of sensitivity and specificity to divide the data into three classes. - Using a BrainScope classification algorithm, the Ahead速 M100 will identify subjects showing sensitivities among 3 classes: Green-normal, nonhead injured controls,Yellow-head injured subjects who do not exhibit brain electrical activity that is consistent with a structural brain injury observable on CT or for whom CT was not deemed necessary,Red-head injured subjects who exhibit brain electrical activity consistent with a structural brain injury observable by CT. - Secondary Endpoint: - Functional Injury Assessment - There are two co-secondary endpoints for the secondary objective, the sensitivity and specificity to split Yellow from the primary endpoint into two sub groups depending on degree of brain functional impairment observable by an evaluation of the clinical findings on a clinical charter used as the assessment of truth.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females ages 18 to 80 (the entire age range), who are admitted to the Emergency Department (ED), who are suspected of a traumatically induced structural brain injury and/or clinical manifestations of functional brain injury, as a result of insult to the head from an external force, e.g., the head being struck by an object, the head striking an object, the head being exposed to forces generated from a blast or explosion, and/or the brain undergoing an acceleration/deceleration movement without direct external trauma to the head with a Glasgow Coma Scale of &gt; 8. The acute, suspected traumatically induced structural brain injury and/or clinical manifestations of functional brain injury will have occurred within the past 24 hours upon admission to the ED. The ED normal control group will be males and females ages 18 to 80 (the entire age range), who are admitted to the ED for presenting complaints that do not involve the head or neck (no trauma above the clavicles) and no history of MVA requiring an ED visit or TBI within the past one (1) year, and no primary complaint of syncope Subjects will be excluded who have forehead, scalp, or skull abnormalities or other conditions that would prevent correct application of the electrode headset on the skin. In addition, subjects with dementia, Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorder, brain tumors, history of brain surgery, mentally retarded, psychiatric disorder for which there is a prescribed psychiatric medication taken on a daily basis, substance dependence, history of TIA or stroke within the last year, currently receiving dialysis or in endstage renal disease, active fever defined as greater than 100oF or 37.7oC, current condition is listed as "critical" in the opinion of the investigator, subject is suffering from an open head injury, subject requires advanced airway management (i.e. mechanical ventilation), currently receiving procedural sedation medications (e.g. benzodiazepine, anesthetic, NMDA receptor antagonist, or opioid agonist), subjects below the age of 18 years, pregnant women, and prisoners will not be eligible for study. ED normal control subjects will be excluded if there is a suspected neck injury or trauma above the clavicles, a primary complaint of generalized weakness, or a primary complaint of headache or migraine</criteria>
