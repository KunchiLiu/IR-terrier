	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effect on the body of LY2127399 in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of LY2127399 in Japanese Participants With Relapsed or Refactory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study has 3 cohorts. Participants will only enroll in one cohort. Cohort 2 and cohort 2-SC will be conducted in parallel. Cohort 1 - Participants will receive 100 mg LY2127399 intravenously (IV), 1.3 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) bortezomib IV, and 20 mg dexamethasone orally. Cohort 2 - Participants will receive 300 mg LY2127399 IV, 1.3 mg/m^2 bortezomib IV, and 20 mg dexamethasone orally. Cohort 2-SC - Participants will receive 300 mg LY2127399 IV, 1.3 mg/m^2 bortezomib subcutaneously (SC), and 20 mg dexamethasone orally. Cohort 2-SC was added per protocol amendment in February 2013.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have relapsed or refractory MM treated with at least 1 prior regimen. Prior therapy with bortezomib is allowed if there was previously at least a minimal response (MR). Have measurable disease as defined by one or more of the following: serum Mprotein concentration ≥ 1 g/dL (10 g/L) urine monoclonal light chain concentration ≥ 200 mg/24 hours as determined by urine protein electrophoresis involved serum free light chain (SFLC) concentration ≥ 10 mg/dL (100 mg/L) and an abnormal SFLC ratio Have adequate organ function including: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/microliter Platelet (PLT) count ≥ 75,000/microliter Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 8.0 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (if total is elevated check direct and, if normal, patient is eligible) Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are ≤ 3 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 3.0 mg/dL. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score of ≤ 2. Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy for at least 2 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycinC or nitrosoureas) before study enrollment and recovered from the acute effects of therapy. Males and females with reproductive potential: Must agree to use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the study and for 4 months following the last dose of study drug. Females with childbearing potential: Must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy test &lt;7 days before the first dose of study drug. Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥16 weeks, in the opinion of the investigator. Have received treatment within 30 days of the initial dose of study drug with an experimental agent for noncancer indications that has not received regulatory approval for any indication. Have one or more serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study. Have an uncontrolled infection. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Have known positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B*, or hepatitis C antibodies (HCAb). * Have evidence of or test positive for hepatitis B. A positive test for hepatitis B is defined as: 1. positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg+). OR 2. positive for antihepatitis B core antibody and positive for hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA). OR 3. positive for antihepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb+) and positive for hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA). Have ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or any grade with pain as assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03 (CTCAE v 4.03). Have previously received an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Have previously received treatment with an experimental agent that targets Bcell activating factor (BAFF). Have a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;470 msec on their baseline electrocardiogram (ECG). Have interstitial pneumonitis (interstitial pneumonia) or pulmonary fibrosis manifested as opacity on chest Xray or computed tomography (CT) scan. Have had another active malignancy within the past 5 years.</criteria>
