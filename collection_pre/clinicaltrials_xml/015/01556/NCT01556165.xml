	<brief_summary>Rasagiline has been developed for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD), as monotherapy in early PD patients not treated with levodopa, and as adjunct therapy to levodopa in levodopa-treated PD patients with motor fluctuations. The rationale for conducting this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of rasagiline compared to placebo in Chinese PD patients not treated with levodopa.</brief_summary>
