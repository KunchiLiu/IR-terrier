	<brief_summary>The safety and effectiveness of TheraSphere will be evaluated in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in whom treatment with standard-of-care sorafenib is planned. All patients receive the standard-of-care sorafenib with or without the addition of TheraSphere.</brief_summary>
