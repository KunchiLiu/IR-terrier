	<brief_summary>Open label, two part, Phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of repeat dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients with previously treated Stage 3 or 4 solid tumors. Part 1 to evaluate escalating dose levels of ONT-10 administered subcutaneously every two weeks (Q2W) or weekly (QW) over 8 weeks. Part 2 evaluates the safety, immunogenicity, and potential anti-tumor activity of ONT-10 administered over 8 weeks at the Q2W and QW maximum tolerated does/recommended dose (MTD/RD) in cohorts of 15 patients each.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study of ONT-10 in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label, two part, Phase 1 dose escalation study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of repeat dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients with previously treated Stage 3 or 4 solid tumors with histologies that have been associated with expression of the MUC1 antigen as described in the medical literature. Part 1 will evaluate escalating dose levels of ONT-10 administered subcutaneously Q2W over 8 weeks (for a total of 4 doses) or QW over 8 weeks (for a total of 8 doses) to identify a MTD and/or RD for each dosing schedule, for further evaluation in Part 2 of the study. Part 2 will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and potential anti-tumor activity of ONT-10 administered over 8 weeks at the Q2W and QW MTD/RD in cohorts of 15 patients each.</detailed_description>
