	<brief_summary>This will be a prospective, single-center clinical trial of up to 50 eyes of subjects scheduled to undergo LASIK surgery requiring an initial corneal flap. Subjects will be screened for eligibility. Subjects will undergo LASIK surgery using the LenSx Laser to create the corneal flap prior to excimer laser treatment. Subjects will be evaluated intraoperatively to assess the ease of lifting the flaps, the stromal bed quality, and the amount of opaque bubble layer. All patients will be followed with routine vision exams for 3 months postoperatively to evaluate changes in visual acuity, manifest refraction, slit lamp examination, and endothelial cell counts.</brief_summary>
