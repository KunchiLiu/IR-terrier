	<brief_title>RCT of SMS for Drivers With Pre-DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mobile phone use is almost a routine part of society worldwide. All mobile phones can deliver and receive short-messaging service text messages, providing a perfect medium for delivering information and support. Since short-messaging service is little exploited in clinical research or practice in Chinese population, this study examined the effectiveness of one-way messaging which is less expensive and is easier to undertake. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of using SMS to provide pre-diabetes and diabetes information by promoting healthy lifestyle modification and reducing the two-hour post-glucose loading plasma glucose, the risk of acquiring Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among professional drivers with pre-diabetes.</detailed_description>
