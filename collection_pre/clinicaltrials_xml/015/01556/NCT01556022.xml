	<criteria>Key 1. Males or females 2080 years of age 2. Significant multivessel coronary artery disease not amenable to percutaneous or surgical revascularization in the target area 3. CCS Angina Functional Class IIIV and/or NYHA Stages of Heart Failure Class II or III 4. On maximal medical therapy for anginal symptoms and or heart failure symptoms 5. Hemodynamic stability (Systolic Blood Pressure ≥ 90 mm/Hg, Heart Rate &lt; 110; PulseOxygen &gt; 95) 6. Ejection fraction ≤ 45 7. Left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 8 mm at the target site for cell injection, confirmed by 2D contrast echo within 4 weeks prior to enrollment, free of thrombus Key 1. Atrial fibrillation or flutter without a pace maker that guarantees a stable heart rate 2. Unstable angina 3. LV thrombus, as documented by echocardiography 4. Planned staged treatment of CAD or other intervention on the heart 5. Platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 6. WBC &lt; 2,000/mm3 7. TIA or stroke within 90 days prior to randomization 8. ICD shock within 30 days of randomization 9. Any condition requiring immunosuppressive medication 10. A highrisk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a myocardial infarction within 60 days prior to randomization 11. Revascularization within 60 days prior to randomization 12. Inability to walk on a treadmill except for class IV angina patients who will be evaluated separately 13. Hepatic dysfunction, as defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and /or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal range (x ULN) prior to randomization</criteria>
