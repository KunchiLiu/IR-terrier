	<brief_summary>The Institute of Medicine identifies Prolonged Grief (PG) as a critical under-addressed public health problem for which are no empirically supported treatments. The purpose of this application is to pilot-test Behavioral Activation (BA) therapy for PG. BA is a well supported, stand alone intervention for depression and recently applied to posttraumatic stress disorder, which reduces rumination and avoidance behaviors that otherwise thwart access to natural rewarding contingencies and resources. The treatment focuses on promoting stable, active routines, self-care behaviors, enhanced self-efficacy, and reengagement with pleasurable activities and significant social resources. Rumination, disengagement, and low self-efficacy are defining features of PG. Further, in response to loss of intimates, the key factors that differentiate resilient people from those that have difficulties adapting is the maintenance or fast resumption of social and occupational functioning. Thus, the main hypothesis of this study is that BA for PG will result in clinically significant reductions in rumination and functional disengagement. This is a preliminary small-scale pilot assessment of potential efficacy and feasibility of completing a large scale study of BA for PG.</brief_summary>
