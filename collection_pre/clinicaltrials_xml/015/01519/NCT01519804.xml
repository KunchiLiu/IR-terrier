	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of onartuzumab (MetMAb) in combination with paclitaxel plus platinum in patients with incurable Stage IIIB or Stage IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients will be randomized to receive either onartuzumab (MetMAb) 15 mg/kg iv or placebo on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle in combination with 4 cycles of paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 iv and platinum (carboplatin/cisplatin) iv on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Patients who have not progressed after 4 cycles will continue with either onartuzumab (MetMAb) or placebo as maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
