	<brief_summary>Non-Ergot Dopamine agonists are meanwhile the drugs of first-choice in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The receptor profile of the non-ergot dopamine-agonist piribedil is unique. In addition to agonistic effects on dopaminergic D2- and D3-receptors piribedil has adrenergic alpha-2A- and alpha-2C-receptors antagonisic properties. There is evidence from the literature that the antagonistic properties of piribedil are correlated with an improvement of cognitive function and vigilance parameters in parkinson's disease. The aim of the present non-interventional study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of piribedil during long-term therapy of patients with M. Parkinson under consideration of cognitive functions and quality of life.</brief_summary>
