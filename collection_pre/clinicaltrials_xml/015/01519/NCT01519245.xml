	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to determine whether the use of tranexamic acid, a clot-promoting drug, applied topically over the heart in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) will reduce post operative blood loss. The investigators' hypothesis is that the use of a tranexamic acid-containing cardiac bath prior to chest closure will result in a statistically significant reduction in blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients who undergo CABG.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Application of Tranexamic Acid to Reduce Post-operative Bleeding in Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bleeding is expected during major surgeries. In patients who undergo CABG, the risk for bleeding is increased because of the need for intra-operative anticoagulation, or thinning, of patient blood. This anticoagulation is necessary to reduce the risk of thrombosis potentially precipitated by the cardiopulmonary bypass machine, which pumps blood throughout the body while the surgeon operates on the heart. Strategies are currently used in the operating room to minimize blood loss and the need for allogenic blood transfusion during and after cardiac surgeries. These strategies include the use of intravenous antifibrinolytic agents, intra-operative red blood cell salvage devices, and topical fibrin sealants. Although the risk of infection from a blood transfusion is very small with modern methods of blood screening, the risk of developing a transfusion reaction is possible and not predictable. Therefore, it is preferred to avoid administering a blood transfusion unless absolutely necessary. The use of topical antifibrinolytic agents has been explored to further reduce blood loss in cardiac surgery. Several trials have been published in the literature since 1993 evaluating the efficacy of various antifibrinolytic medications applied topically, as a cardiac bath, prior to chest closure in CABG patients to reduce post-operative blood loss and potential need for blood transfusion. The applicability of the methodology utilized in these studies, however, is limited in the context of the current Canadian practices of cardiac surgery. Considerable differences in the perioperative strategies of these trials are seen, in comparison to current North American practices of cardiac surgery. These trials also compared use of topically applied antifibrinolytic agents, including the lysine analogue tranexamic acid, to a control in the absence of intravenous antifibrinolytic agents. The use of intravenous lysine analogues to reduce peri-operative bleeding has now become a near-standard of care in CABG patients. Currently, the only available antifibrinolytic agent in Canada is the lysine analogue tranexamic acid. This drug is widely used administered as an intravenous preparation in cardiac surgery because its safety profile and reduction in blood loss and frequency of blood transfusion. There is presently no published randomized controlled trial evaluating blood loss in CABG patients who have received intravenous tranexamic acid, plus topical tranexamic acid or placebo.</detailed_description>
