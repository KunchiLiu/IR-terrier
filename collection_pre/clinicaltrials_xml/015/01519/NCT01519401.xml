	<brief_summary>The estrogenic component of estro-progestin (EP) is responsible for a negative impact on the metabolic and lipid assessment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The objective of this study is to compare the effects of a long term administration of two EP combinations, containing the same progestin (3 mg drospirenone) and a different dose of ethinyl-estradiol (EE) (20 vs 30 μg ) on the clinical and endocrine-metabolic parameters in normal weight PCOS women. The investigators enrolled 30 patients, randomly allocated to group A (20 µg EE - 3 mg DRSP) and 15 to group B (30 µg EE - 3 mg DRSP). Hirsutism score evaluation, hormonal assays, oral glucose tolerance test, euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp and lipid profile were performed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of therapy.</brief_summary>
