	<brief_summary>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a 3D nuclear medicine imaging technique that is used extensively to study the heart and diagnose heart disease. There are three major limitations in SPECT imaging: attenuation or loss of signal, scattering of the signal in the patient tissues and resolution, where the signal gets blurrier the further the nuclear activity is away from the camera. New software, Evolution for CardiacTM, by GE Healthcare and new cameras with computed tomography (CT) decrease the time needed for images to be obtained while maintaining image quality. Evaluation is needed before they become standard of care.</brief_summary>
