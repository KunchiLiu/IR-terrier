	<brief_summary>Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels, insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required insulin dosage based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon. The main goal of this project is to assess whether a dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) without a significant degradation in post-meal glucose control. Each patient will be admitted twice to a clinical research facility. In one visit, patients will eat a morning meal accompanied with a matching insulin bolus (depending on the carbohydrate content of the meal) and glucose levels will be subsequently regulated using dual-hormone closed-loop system. In the other visit, patients will eat the same meal but will inject only a partial insulin bolus (not depending on carbohydrate content of the meal) and the remaining needed insulin will be delivered based on glucose sensor excursions as part of closed-loop operation. If post-meal glucose levels were indifferent between the two visits, then this would suggest that carbohydrate counting may not be necessary during closed-loop operation as the closed-loop system will give any remaining insulin needed to cover the glucose absorbed from the meal. Twelve subjects will be enrolled in this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and females ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years of old. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment and medical history (e.g. history of acidoketosis, etc.); C peptide level and antibody determinations are not needed. The subject will have been on insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months. Last (less than 3 months) HbA1c ≤ 12%. Clinically significant nephropathy, neuropathy (especially clinically significant gastroparesis) or retinopathy as judged by the investigator. Recent (&lt; 3 months) acute macrovascular event e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiac surgery. Pregnancy. Severe hypoglycemic episode within two weeks of screening. • Medication likely to affect with the interpretation of the results: Prandase, Victoza, Byetta and Symlin Known or suspected allergy to the trial products or meal contents. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator. Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to eat snack, not willing to change pump parameters, etc). Unreliable carbohydrate counting Problems with venous access</criteria>
