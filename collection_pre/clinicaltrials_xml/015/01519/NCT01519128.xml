	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Effect of Steady-State TMC278 on the Pharmacokinetics of a Single Dose of Digoxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), crossover (method used to switch patients from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study) study to investigate the effect of steady-state TMC278 on the single dose pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The study consists of 3 phases, including screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. After the screening phase, participants will be randomized to one of 2 treatment sequences consisting of Treatments A and B, ie, Sequence AB (11 participants), and Sequence BA (11 participants). Treatment phase includes, Treatment A: digoxin 0.5 mg (single oral dose), and Treatment B: TMC278 25 mg once daily with digoxin 0.5 mg (single oral dose). The 2 consecutive sequences will be separated by a washout period (period when receiving no treatment) of at least 14 days. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, cardiac telemetry, vital signs, physical examination, alcohol breath test, and specific toxicities will be monitored throughout the study.The study duration for treatment phase will be at least 26 days.</detailed_description>
