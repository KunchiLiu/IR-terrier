	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare unfractionated heparin (UFH) and bivalirudin in the performance and subsequent outcomes of Primary percutaneous coronary intervention. This will be a pragmatic trial. Interventional procedures will be performed to reflect current and evolving standards, including predominant radial access. All patients will be treated with routine oral anti-platelet therapy pre-procedure. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors will be reserved for 'bail out' treatment only.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HEAT-PPCI is a single-centre prospective, dual-arm, open-label, randomised controlled trial comparing two antithrombotic agents in patients undergoing PPCI. All patients presenting to the PPCI service at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital will be assessed for trial eligibility. The patients will be allocated by randomisation in equal proportions to the two treatment groups receiving UFH (70 units/kg prior to the procedure) or bivalirudin (bolus of 0.75 mg/kg prior to the start of the intervention, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg per hour for the duration of the procedure). Pre-Specified Subgroup Analyses - Subgroup analyses looking at the impact of access site comparing radial versus femoral route - Assessment of the outcomes in diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycaemic or insulin therapy versus all other patients - Comparing the outcomes in patients &lt; or ≥ 75 years of age - Type of p2y12 receptor inhibiting antiplatelet agent (Examples: clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) - Patients with impaired LV function versus normal LV function - Patients managed with actual or attempted primary PCI versus no immediate PCI procedure attempted PLATELET FUNCTION SUBSTUDY A substudy will be performed to assess indices of coagulation and platelet function studies comparing the impact of heparin or bivalirudin therapy on coagulation status at the end of the PPCI procedure. This study will be performed on all patients treated between the hours of 0800 and 1600, Monday to Friday. A single blood sample taken at the time of general blood sampling for routine clinical screening will be analysed.</detailed_description>
