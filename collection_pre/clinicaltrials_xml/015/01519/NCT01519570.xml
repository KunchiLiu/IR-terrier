	<brief_summary>Despite the significant benefits of herpes zoster vaccine (HZV), vaccination rates remain low. Electronic medical records (EMR) can serve as a practical strategy to better facilitate the application of preventative health care, such as increasing immunization rates. A new care model that can increase the herpes zoster vaccination rate, as well as other preventative health services, is warranted. The objective of this study is to investigate if the functions of an EMR, in combination with a pharmacist as part of the care team, can improve the herpes zoster vaccination rate.</brief_summary>
