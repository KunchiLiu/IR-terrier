	<brief_summary>Street children and children of vulnerable families in conflict or former conflict regions are often exposed to multiple traumatic events and situations in which they are forced to engage in violent behavior. The Narrative Exposure Therapy for violent offenders (NETvo) aims to reduce both PTSD symptoms and aggressive behavior. It helps the children to anchor fearful experiences and positive emotions linked to violent behaviour in the past. Additionally, visions for the future are developed in order to foster successful reintegration into society.</brief_summary>
