	<brief_summary>This comparative, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group study will evaluate the effect of altitude on dose requirements of Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) to achieve a target haemoglobin concentration of 11-12 g/dL in patients with chronic renal anemia in pre-dialysis and dialysis. Four groups of patients, at sea level or an altitude above 6'000 feet and in pre-dialysis or dialysis, will receive 50-250 mcg Mircera subcutaneously according to local label. Anticipated time on study treatment is 36 weeks.</brief_summary>
