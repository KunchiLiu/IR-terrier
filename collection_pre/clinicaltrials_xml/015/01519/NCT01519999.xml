	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to increase colorectal cancer screening by implementing a community-wide shared decision-making (SDM) intervention, which embeds shared decision making within clinical practice and also uses an extensive community engagement campaign. The investigators hypothesize that colorectal cancer screening adherence will be higher in the intervention group (participating communities) compared to the usual care control group (non-participating comparison communities).</brief_summary>
