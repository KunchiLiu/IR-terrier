	<brief_summary>Principles of motor control suggest that breast hypertrophy can lead to sensoriomotor alterations and impairment in body balance due to postural misalignment. The investigators conducted this study to evaluate the postural control with different sensorial information condition in women with breast hypertrophy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postural Control in Breast Hypertrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to the moment, changes caused by breast hypertrophy are described based on the alteration of body mass distribution leading to an impact of psychological and physical aspects. However, the investigators hypothesize that due to alterations in postural alignment, sensoriomotor inputs are also impaired and postural or motor control are ultimately compromised.</detailed_description>
