	<brief_summary>The investigators have recently discovered a genetic variant in an adrenergic receptor that leads to increased risk for type 2 diabetes. The investigators have also seen that blockers of that receptor improves impaired insulin secretion in animals. The investigators will now test the blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without the risk variant in an effort to make diabetes treatment more individualized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study of Yohimbine Treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Patients Carrying a Specific Genetic Risk Variant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have recently discovered a genetic variant in an adrenergic receptor that leads to increased risk for type 2 diabetes. We have also seen that blockers of that receptor improves impaired insulin secretion in animals. We will now test the blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without the risk variant in an effort to make diabetes treatment more individualized. Patients will receive two different doses of the blocker and the effect will be measured with oral glucose tolerance tests. The study is a randomized placebo-controlled study.</detailed_description>
