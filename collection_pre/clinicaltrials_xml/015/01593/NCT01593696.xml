	<brief_summary>Background: - Although progress has been made in treating children with B-cell cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, many children do not respond to the standard treatments. One possible treatment involves collecting white blood cells called T cells from the person with cancer and modifying the cells to attack the B-cell cancer. The cells can then be given back to the participant. This study will use T cells that have been modified to attack the CD19 protein, which is found on the surface of some B-cell cancers. Objectives: - To see if anti-CD19 modified white blood cells are a safe and effective treatment for children and young adults with advanced B-cell cancer. Eligibility: - Children and young adults between 1 and 30 years of age who have B-cell cancer (leukemia or lymphoma) that has not responded to standard treatments. - The leukemia or the lymphoma must have the CD19 protein. - There must be adequate organ function. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies or bone marrow biopsies may be performed depending on the type of cancer. - Participants will undergo a process where white blood cells are collected, called apheresis. These cells will be modified to contain the anti-CD19 gene. - Participants will have 3 days of chemotherapy to prepare their immune system to accept the modified cells. - Participants will receive an infusion of their own modified white blood cells. They will remain in the hospital until they have recovered from the treatment. - Participants will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the outcome of the treatment. - If the participant benefits from the treatment, then he/she may have the option for another round of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-CD19 White Blood Cells for Children and Young Adults With B Cell Leukemia or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that recognize the CD19 antigen have been constructed and are in clinical trials at several institutions. In this trial, the POB will utilize a chimeric receptor containing the signaling domains of CD28 and CD3-zeta, currently under study in the CCR in adults, for children and young adults with CD19 expressing malignancies. In co-cultures with CD19-expressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells show robust killing, and in xenograft models, can rapidly clear CD19- expressing ALL cell lines. Objectives: 1. Primary: To determine the safety and feasibility of administering escalating doses of anti-CD19-CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes in two strata (prior allogeneic stem cell transplant [SCT] vs. no prior SCT) of children and young adults with B cell malignancies following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen. COMPLETED March 2014. 2. Primary: To determine the safety of administering cells in two groups of children and young adults with B-cell malignancies expressing CD19: - Arm 1 - Patients without high-burden disease or patients for whom chemotherapy toxicity is a concern will receive standard preparative regimen. - Arm 2 - Patients with high-burden disease who receive standard chemotherapy to reduce burden, (defined as patients with ALL who have M3 bone marrow blasts and/or presence of peripheral blood blasts on routine CBC, or patients with lymphoma). 3. Primary: To determine the feasibility of administering anti-CD19 CAR transduced T cells within 21 days of the target date in children and young adults with B-cell malignancies expressing CD19 enrolled on arm 2: Patients with high-burden disease who receive standard chemotherapy to reduce burden. 1) Secondary: 1) To determine if the administration of anti-CD19-CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes can mediate antitumor effects in children with B cell high-burden disease after standard chemotherapy, or in patients without high-burden disease who receive standard preparative regimen. 2) To evaluate the ability of CRS treatment algorithm to reduce the incidence of Grade 4 Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) to less than or equal to 10% of patients. 3) To measure persistence of adoptively-transferred anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells in the blood, bone marrow and CSF of patients. 4) To describe the toxicity of administration of anti-CD19-CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes in children and young adults with CNS disease. Eligibility: Patients 1-30 years of age, at least 15 kg, with a CD19-expressing B-cell malignancy that has recurred after or not responded to one or more standard chemotherapy-containing regimens for their malignancy and is deemed incurable by standard therapy. Patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant who meet all eligibility criteria are eligible to participate. Design: - PBMC will be obtained by leukapheresis. Anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be manufactured from fresh or frozen PBMCs. On Day -7, PBMC will be enriched for CD3+ cells and cultured in the presence of anti-CD3/-CD28 beads followed by retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-CD19 CAR. Total culture time is approximately 7-14 days. - Patients will be divided into the 2 groups listed above. Arm 1: Patients will begin preparative regimen comprising fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) on Days -4, -3 and -2 and cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m(2) on day -2. Arm 2: Patients with high-disease burden will be treated with intensive standard of care chemotherapy to decrease disease burden during cell manufacturing. - All patients: The CD19-CAR cells will be infused on Day 0, with up to a 72h delay allowed for fresh cells or a 21 day delay if cells are cryopreserved, if needed for resolution of clinical toxicities or to generate adequate cell numbers. - The previously determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 1 X 10(6) will be administered intravenously. - Patients will be monitored for toxicity, response and T cell persistence.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patient must have a CD19expressing B cell ALL or lymphoma and must have relapsed or refractory disease after at least one standard chemotherapy and one salvage regimen. In view of the PI and the primary oncologist, there must be no available alternative curative therapies and subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), have refused SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits SCT at this time. CD19 expression must be detected on greater than 15% of the malignant cells by immunohistochemistry or greater than 30% by flow cytometry in a CLIA approved test in the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI, NIH or from the referring institution or reference laboratory. The choice of whether to use flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily available tissue sample in each patient. In general immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Greater than or equal to 1 year of age (and at least 15 kg) and less than or equal to 30 years of age. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated to be required to obtain target cell dose based on discussion with DTM apheresis and Cell Processing Section, DTM. Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of neurologic symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial nerve palsy: CNS 1, defined as absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs; CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/uL WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for blasts, or &gt; 5/uL WBCs but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3 with marrow disease who has failed salvage systemic and intensive IT chemotherapy (and therefore not eligible for radiation) Patients with isolated CNS relapse will be eligible if they have previously been treated with cranial radiation (at least 1800 cGy). Ability to give informed consent. For subjects &lt;18 years old their legal guardian must give informed consent. Pediatric subjects will be included in age appropriate discussion and verbal assent will be obtained for those greater than or equal to 12 years of age, when appropriate.

Subjects who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are upright in a wheelchair will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of calculating the performance score. Patients of childbearing or childfathering potential must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for four months after receiving the preparative regimen. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the potentially dangerous effects on the fetus. Cardiac function: Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40% by MUGA or cardiac MRI, or fractional shortening greater than or equal to 28% by ECHO or left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50% by ECHO.
