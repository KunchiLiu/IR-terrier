	<brief_title>Radiographic and Intravascular (IVUS) Evaluation of Venous Morphology During CCSVI Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the safety and validity of venous angioplasty and valvuloplasty in the treatment of CCSVI. In addition, it will allow researchers to sub-classify valve morphology in relation to treatment success. This will be evidenced by venous patency forty-eight hours by Doppler ultrasound as well as clinical symptom improvement.</detailed_description>
