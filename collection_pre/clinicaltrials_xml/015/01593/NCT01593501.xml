	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to recruit 60 women who have agreed to participate in an existing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Treatment of Vitamin D Insufficiency, HSC 2009-0055). In this trial, the investigators propose to evaluate the associations between magnesium intake, magnesium stores, fractional magnesium absorption and calcium homeostasis. The investigators will stratify 60 subjects in the sub-study, ensuring that approximately 20 subjects are randomized into each treatment arm (placebo, low-dose and high-dose vitamin D). The investigators already assess calcium homeostasis throughout the study by measuring bone mineral density, fractional calcium absorption, serum and urine calcium levels, among other tests. In the sub-study of 60 women, the investigators will evaluate whether habitually higher magnesium intake increases or decreases fractional calcium absorption. The investigators will evaluate the interplay between magnesium stores, vitamin D levels and serum parathyroid hormone levels. The investigators will directly assess magnesium stores using serum magnesium and 24-hour urine magnesium levels, and will measure magnesium absorption using the dual stable isotope approach.</brief_summary>
