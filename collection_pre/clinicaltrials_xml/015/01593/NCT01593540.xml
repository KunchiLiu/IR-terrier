	<detailed_description>Self-performed interdental cleaning is a crucial element in preventing gingival or periodontal diseases. Interdental cleaning is most efficiently performed through usage of interdental brushes. Commonly used metal-core interdental brushes can harbour the risk of hard tissue damage when used inappropriately.The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction of a novel metal-free interdental brush. This was tested on healthy participants. The control group performed interdental cleaning with a commonly used metal-core interdental brush.</detailed_description>
