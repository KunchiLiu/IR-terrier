	<brief_title>Melatonin for Prevention of Metabolic Side Effects of Olanzapine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine are associated with significant metabolic side effects. Animal studies have suggested that melatonin might prevent some of the olanzapine-associated side effects. Melatonin is safe and is widely used as a sleep-promoting complement, and is not associated with side effects seen with other used drugs such as metformin.</detailed_description>
