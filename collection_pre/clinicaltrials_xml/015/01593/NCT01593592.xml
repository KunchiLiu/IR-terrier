	<brief_title>Lactobacillus Reuteri in Management of Helicobacter Pylori Infection in Dyspeptic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) infection is a wide spread disease and is endemic in many countries including Egypt with a wide range of morbidity; that requires appropriate antimicrobial therapy . However, worldwide the eradication rate following the standard triple therapy is declining and this may necessitates introduction of new antimicrobial agents . On the sight of bearing in vivo and in vitro activity against H. Pylori, the use of different strains of probiotics in treatment of H. Pylori may be thus justifiable, Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) which through different mechanisms including production of reuterin have anti H.pylori activity have been tried in improving the eradication rates of H.pylori with contradictory results . This study is conducted to test the assumption that addition of L. reuteri to the standard triple therapy in treatment of H. Pylori improves the eradication rates and clinical aspects in H. Pylori infection.</detailed_description>
