	<brief_summary>Oral hypoglycemic agents encompass the mainstay of treatment in the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes. Thiazolidinediones (such a pioglitazone) and Biguanides (such as metformin), are two major groups of hypoglycemic medications that while function via different pathways, are both effective in short- and long-term glycemic control . These medications diminish or at least delay long term micro- and macrovascular complications associated with prolonged insulin resistance although at different rates. The mechanisms by which this aim is achieved, nevertheless, remains largely unclear. With adipokines playing a key role in development of both insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, oral hypoglycemic agents might regulate these substances by direct and indirect routes.</brief_summary>
