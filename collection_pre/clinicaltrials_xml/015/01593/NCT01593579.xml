	<brief_summary>Some Akt inhibitors have produced functional cardiovascular effects such as marked hypotension that may limit their clinical benefit. There are no current data on whether this autonomic failure presents in humans at clinically used doses. We will test the hypothesis that Akt inhibition causes an acute decrease in sympathetic tone and lowers blood pressure.</brief_summary>
