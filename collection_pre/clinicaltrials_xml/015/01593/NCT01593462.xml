	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of ultrasound imaging compared to MRE (Magnetic Resonance Enterography) a form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in accurately diagnosing and following Small Bowel Crohn Disease (SBCD) in children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness of MR Enterography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computed Tomography (CT) is an imaging tool that exposes patients to radiation, and until recently it was the most commonly used imaging method to evaluate small bowel Crohn disease. Recently, Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) which is a form of magnetic resonance imaging that provides detailed images of the bowel and less frequently, Ultrasound (US) are replacing CT as the standard of care imaging tool at some institutions. The investigators would like to determine how effective US imaging is compared to MRI imaging in accurately diagnosing and following SBCD in children. Along with enteric ultrasound (EnUS) we will also be comparing a new ultrasound technology called Ultrasound Elastography Imaging (UEI) for this study in which we will be using a second form of UEI called Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI). This technique uses sound waves to asses the stiffness properties of soft tissue. The study will compare costs, patient preferences, and imaging accuracy.</detailed_description>
