	<brief_summary>The investigators will perform a randomised controlled trial of the provision of food designed for rehabilitation of malnourished children that is supplemented with n-3 fatty acids compared to usual composition. The investigators want to see whether the provision of such a food normalises the deficiencies in essential fatty acids observed in severely malnourished children faster than standard composition.</brief_summary>
