	<brief_summary>Even in the absence of a preliminary diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, symptoms of attention deficit, hyperactivity and cognitive impairment are common in cocaine addicts. Several factors indicate that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation might be a strategy to aid in the treatment of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and cognitive function in cocaine addicts. However, up to current days there have been no studies evaluating the effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on neurocognitive performance of individuals suffering from the ADHD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is a noninvasive technique that can influence specific areas of the brain and has very few side effects. The treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation requires attendance to hospital daily sessions for 4 consecutive weeks. Each session lasts up to 30 minutes. Side effects include scalp discomfort and mild headache. No anesthesia is required. Stimulation aims the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region previously studied to treat depression symptoms with positive results. The present technique has never been employed in previous studies, but risks are insignificant.</detailed_description>
