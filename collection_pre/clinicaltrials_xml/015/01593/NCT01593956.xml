	<brief_summary>Concussed athlethes have discrete decreased abilities in motor learning. Recent research could further show, that cortical plasticity, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is reduced. This is possibly due to an increased GABAergic activity, what have been found in concussed athletes by paired pulse protocols in TMS. GABAergic acitivty can be modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a polar-specific manner: anodal tDCS was able to decrease GABA, whereas cathodal tDCS increased tDCS. Our study aimes to assess the influence of anodal tDCS on cortical plsticity in concussed athlethes. We hypothesize, that anodal tDCS is able to increase cortical plsticity in concussed athlethes.</brief_summary>
