	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of CG400549 (960 mg daily) in subjects with cABSSSI (major cutaneous abscesses) due to MRSA. Secondary Objective(s): - To assess the pharmacokinetics of CG400549 (960 mg daily) in subjects with cABSSSI due to MRSA - To explore the in vitro susceptibility of cABSSSI-related bacteria to CG400549. - To assess the safety of multiple doses of CG400459</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2a Study of CG400549 for the Treatment of cABSSSI Caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, exploratory study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of CG400549, daily for 10 to 14 days, in subjects with cABSSSI (major cutaneous abscesses) due to MRSA. All subjects will receive active treatment. Subjects will begin study treatment upon confirmation of clinical eligibility (ie, confirmation of MRSA infection is not required pretreatment). Subjects who begin treatment with CG400549 and are subsequently not found to have S. aureus infection will be discontinued from study treatment, treated as appropriate for the identified pathogen(s), and followed for safety. These subjects will be included in the safety analyses but not in the primary efficacy analysis.</detailed_description>
