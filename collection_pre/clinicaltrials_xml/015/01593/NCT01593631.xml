	<brief_summary>Fermented dairy products, especially real Yoghurt, are often tolerated better by lactose malabsorbers than unfermented dairy products. The intake of dietary supplements containing acid Lactase derived from Aspergillus oryzae with lactose containing foodstuffs is known to reduce/alleviate symptoms of lactose intolerance in lactose malabsorbers. The study aims to compare the effect of the intake of a combination of yoghurt bacteria and acid lactase to the effect of yogurt bacteria or acid lactase alone on the lactose digestion in lactose malabsorbers. It is hypothized that the combination preparation will be more effective and/or will show a more reliable effect than the two mono-preparations.</brief_summary>
