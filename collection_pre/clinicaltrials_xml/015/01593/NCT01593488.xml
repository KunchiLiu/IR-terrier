	<detailed_description>Liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) is a new formulation of the drug cytarabine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of ALL. This formulation of the drug can be given intrathecally (into the spinal fluid), and is released slowly over a longer period, about two weeks. This allows a longer exposure of the drug to the central nervous system, and requires fewer intrathecal injections for the patient.</detailed_description>
