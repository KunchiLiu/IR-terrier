	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II therapeutic trial combining Decitabine days 1-5 with oral Vorinostat twice daily days 6-15 followed by a single infusion of CD3-/CD19- enriched donor natural killer (NK) cells on day 17 and a short course of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) to facilitate NK cell survival and expansion. Two courses of treatment will be given separated by 6-8 weeks. The intent is to administer all treatment in the outpatient setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine and Vorinostat Conditioning Followed by CD3-/CD19- NK Cells Infusion for High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single donor apheresis will be collected on day 15 of cycle 1, enriched for NK cells with the large scale CliniMacs device (Miltenyi) and activated by overnight incubation with IL-2. After washing, the final NK cell product will be divided in two, with half given fresh on day 17 of course #1 and half stored frozen until day 17 of course #2. Clinical response will be formally assessed 4-6 weeks after the start of 2nd course based on International Working Group (IWG) criteria; however, bone marrow evaluations will be completed to assess for any sign of significant disease progression between cycle 1 and 2.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of high risk myelodysplastic (MDS) that meets one of the following disease classifications and is requiring treatment: International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) Category: INT2 or High Risk WHO Classification: RAEB1 or RAEB2 High risk cytogenetic abnormality as defined by presence of Monosomy 7, complex karytope, or monosomal karyotype WHO Based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS): High or Very High Risk Patients may be untreated or have had a maximum of 2 cycles of hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) without evidence of treatment failure as defined by progression to more advanced MDS Who classification or AML. Patients must not have received treatment for their MDS within 4 weeks of beginning the trial. Treatments allowed prior to that time include azacitidine or decitabine and hematopoietic growth factors. No prior AMLlike induction therapy allowed.
