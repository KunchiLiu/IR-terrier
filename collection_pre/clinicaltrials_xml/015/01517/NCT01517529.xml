	<brief_title>Evaluating the Role of Immune Responses in the Emergence of Protease Inhibitor Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective 1: Evaluate the role of the immune responses in determining the emergence of HCV NS3 resistance mutation during protease inhibitor therapy Hypothesis 1 (HT 1): Low HLA binding to peptides containing protease inhibitor resistance mutations is associated with the emergence of protease inhibitor mutants during therapy and failure of the treatment. Hypothesis 2 (HT 2): A hole in T cell repertoire may allow emergence of protease inhibitor mutants during protease inhibitor therapy which leads to loss of the immune responses to these mutants and failure of treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All chronically HCVinfected patients who fail pegIFN and RBV therapy and are eligible for combined treatment with PI therapy will be enrolled. Briefly, this includes: 1. Male or female 2. Age 18 to 65 3. Chronic HCV infection evidenced by liver biopsy or persistent HCV viremia for &gt;6 months 4. Treatment experienced and classified as nonresponder or relapser to prior interferonbased therapy. Exclusion criteria: 1. Treatment na√Øve chronically HCVinfected patients. 2. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) or suspected IBD, autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, and any patients on systemic immunomodulators. 3. Pregnancy 4.
