	<brief_summary>Overweight patients are susceptible to develop acute complications when they are admitted in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Severe infection can be associated with cardiovascular failure ('shock") and is associated with 35-50% mortality. One of the key issue to cure infection is to administer antibiotics. However, under dosing antibiotic is one of the main reason that explain treatment failure. There are very few data concerning particularities of antibiotic dosing in critically ill, overweight, patients. The aim of the present study is to describe the pharmacokinetic of two main antibiotics (doripenem and piperacillin/Tazobactam) in both overweight and non overweight critically ill patients presenting a septic shock. The investigators hypothesis is that usual dose for those antibiotic may be accurate in non overweight patients but is not in overweight patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic of Doripenem and Piperacillin/Tazobactam in More Than 120 kg Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>N=52 patients divided in 4*13 patients (13 per antibiotic and per group, overweight or non overweight). Overweight is defined by a weight over 120kg. Antibiotic chosen by the intensivist in charge of the case. Doripenem 1g/8h with a 4h IV infusion whatever the patient's weight. Piperacillin/Tazobactam 4g IV (1h) and then 16g/24h IV continuously whatever the patient's weight. Piperacillin/Tazobactam plasma dosage: after the first dose and then every 12h. Doripenem plasma dosage: after the first dose and then twice a day, at peak and residual value. Usual plasma and urine samples for urea, creatinine, electrolytes, platelets and bilirubin each 24h. Microbiology: bacterial identification and MIC measurement with E-test</detailed_description>
