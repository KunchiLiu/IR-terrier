	<brief_summary>Retinal function is highly dependent on the glucose supply. Thus, functional adaptations occur in response to both acute and long-term changes in glycaemia. The purpose of this study is to examine functional and metabolic aspects of retinal adaptation to long-lasting changes in glycaemic control in patients with diabetes. The adaptational phenomena will be characterized by electroretinography, dark adaptation, measures of retinal perfusion and oximetry as well as diabetic retinopathy grading and (OCT).</brief_summary>
