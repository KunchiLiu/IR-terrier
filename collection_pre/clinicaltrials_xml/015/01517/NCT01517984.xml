	<brief_summary>The study will compare how well transplanted kidneys work and the response of people's immune systems as tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), is withdrawn. In addition, this research study will evaluate whether reducing immunosuppression can decrease some of these side effects while still preventing rejection of the kidney.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Monitoring and CNI Withdrawal in Low Risk Recipients of Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation is a treatment option for people with kidney disease. However, there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it functioning for a long time. Transplant recipients take immunosuppression (anti-rejection) drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs are used to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney. All anti-rejection medications have unwanted side effects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of slowly removing tacrolimus, a CNI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Initial Enrollment/Screening: Patients who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment as study subjects: Subject must be able to understand and provide written informed consent; Primary livingdonor (related or unrelated) kidney transplant recipients; Peak flowbased PRAs for class I and class II &lt;30%(performed by local center); Current (within 8 weeks prior to transplantation) flowbased PRAs for class I and class II &lt;30% (performed by local center); No donor specific antibody by flow solid phase method on the peak PRA serum (if serum available), or on the current PRA serum (within 8 weeks prior to transplantation) performed by central core laboratory. If the sera for the peak PRA is not available, then only the current PRA serum will be tested; Negative Tcell and Bcell crossmatch by flow cytometry (performed by local center); Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) upon study entry; Female and male subjects with reproductive potential must agree to use FDA approved methods of birth control while participating in the study. Inclusion Criteria for Randomization: Participants who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for randomization: No history of acute rejection episodes; The prerandomization protocol biopsy should confirm no rejection, including borderline rejection (based on the central pathology read); No donor specific antibody as detected by flow solid phase method (performed by the central core laboratory). EXCLUSION CRITERIA Initial Enrollment/Screening: Participants who meet any of these criteria are not eligible for enrollment as study subjects: Recipient of multiple organ transplants; Prior history of organ transplantation; Deceaseddonor source; Any condition that would preclude protocol biopsies; HLA identical recipients; Currently breastfeeding or plans to become pregnant during the timeframe of the study follow up period; Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to comply with study requirements; Inability or unwillingness to comply with study protocol; Use of investigational drugs within 4 weeks of study entry and for the duration of the study; Recent recipient of any licensed or investigational live attenuated vaccine(s) within two months of prior to study entry. Exclusion Criteria for Randomization: Participants who meet any of these criteria are not eligible for randomization: Subjects who receive less than 4.5mg/kg of Rabbit ATG (Thymoglobulin®) induction therapy; Subjects who test positive for BKV by PCR in the blood at 6 months posttransplant; Any condition that would preclude protocol biopsies; Currently breastfeeding or plans to become pregnant during the timeframe of the study follow up period; Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to comply with study requirements; Inability or unwillingness of a subject to give written informed consent or comply with study protocol; Use of investigational drugs within 4 weeks of study entry and for the duration of the study; Subjects who receive less than 1500 mg daily of Mycophenolate Mofetil (CellCept®) or equivalent.</criteria>
