	<brief_summary>In total 50 patients diagnosed with long-segment infrapopliteal arterial disease will be randomized in two groups. The patients randomized in the Drug coated balloons (DCB) study arm will undergo a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with the use of a paclitaxel-coated balloon, while the patients randomized in the drug-eluting stent (DES) study arm will undergo primary stenting using drug-eluting stent(s). The study's primary endpoints will be the 6-month angiographic binary restenosis rate. Secondary endpoints will include the immediate technical success,6-month primary patency, target lesion revascularization and limb salvage and complication rates.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients programmed to undergo PTA due to angiographically-proven infrapopliteal arterial disease in our department will be randomized in the above mentioned study arms. The studies primary endpoint will be assessed with the use of intra-arterial digital subtracted angiography and subsequent Quantitative Vascular Analysis (QVA) analysis.Clinical follow-up is set at 1, 3 and 6 months. Patients' baseline demographics and procedural details will be recorded and analyzed.</detailed_description>
