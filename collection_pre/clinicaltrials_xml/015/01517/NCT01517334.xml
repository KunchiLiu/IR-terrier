	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and anti-microbial effects of Arestin (minocycline HCl) 1 mg Microspheres in the treatment of subjects with peri-implantitis, when used in combination with mechanical debridement. The hypothesis of the study is that Arestin in combination with mechanical debridement is more effective in the treatment of peri-implantitis when compared to mechanical debridement alone. The primary efficacy measure will be the reduction of probing depth at Day 180 as measured at qualifying implant sites.</brief_summary>
