	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with central nervous system (CNS) demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. Multiple sclerosis exhibits an unpredictable and variable clinical course. Multiple sclerosis plaques contain numerous types of cells and infiltrating macrophages have been identified to contribute significantly to demyelination in both clinical MS and animal models of MS. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM CSF) stimulates proliferation and activation of macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells and microglia with subsequent induction of proinflammatory biomolecules. Therefore blocking GM CSF activity might be a therapeutic approach for the treatment of MS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib Study to Evaluate MOR103 in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent clinical studies demonstrated a possible dysregulation of the balance of pro and anti inflammatory lymphocytes, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of MS. It was shown in animal models of EAE that during the disease effect or phase GM CSF sustained neuroinflammation via myeloid cells that infiltrate the CNS proving an essential role of GM CSF in encephalitogenicity.</detailed_description>
