	<brief_title>Pilot Study of CoolTXT for Non-Invasive Fat Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a new product under development for non-invasive fat reduction. The new product delivers controlled cooling via a conformable surface applicator, rather than the existing vacuum applicator. A range of treatment parameters will be investigated. At the investigator's discretion, each treatment area may receive up to 3 treatments, spaced 2 - 8 weeks apart. The subjects will return for follow-up at 2 months and 4 months after final treatment. Therefore, the entire study period may last up to 8 months.</detailed_description>
