	<brief_title>Treatment of Natural Killer/T Cell Lymphoma-Ⅲ/Ⅳ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with NK/T cell lymphoma usually have a bad prognosis. These patients cannot be treated successfully with the conventional chemotherapy of CHOP. The investigators have been proceeding this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination chemotherapy regiment DDGP (gemcitabine，pegaspargase, cisplatin, dexamethasone) in the patients with stage Ⅲ/Ⅳ NK/T cell lymphoma.</detailed_description>
