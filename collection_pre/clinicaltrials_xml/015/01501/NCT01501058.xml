	<brief_summary>This study aims to develop a parent-assisted social skills training program for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder(ASD) and verify therapeutic effects of the program through case-control study. 1. Both the case and the control of this study shall be a high-functioning group consisting of adolescents aged 11 to 18 years with ASD and an IQ of 80 or over. A total of 40 adolescents will be recruited and divided into two groups of twenty. One will be the case group and the other will be the waitlist control group. Again, the case will be divided into two sub-groups of ten and carry out this new developed program for both parents and adolescents. That is, the program will be carried out two times in each of both groups. The waitlist control group will be allowed to receive personal outpatient treatment and general therapeutic intervention from community while waiting. 2. Effects of the program will be measured both at the case and the control by using a scale which measures social interaction, quality of peer relationship, disposition of autism and social anxiety. Equal assessments for both the case and the control will be conducted right before the beginning of the program and right after the completion of the program and some of the survey will be retried in order to see mid- and long-term effects three months after the completion of the program.</brief_summary>
