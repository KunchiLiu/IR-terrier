	<brief_summary>A multi-centric initiative to study safety,feasibility and efficacy of using intravenous autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells(BMMC) in patients with acute ischemic stroke.This phase of study is visualised as phase 2 study and will aim to determine dose response gradient of stem cell therapy and to explore if there is favorable risk to benefit ratio for autologous stem cell therapy in patient with acute ischamic stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Autologous Bone Marrow-derived Stem Cells Therapy for Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase of the study will have two arms developed through random allocation: one arm for intravenous autologous bone marrow derived stem cell/mononuclear cells(BMMC arm); and second control arm. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke between 7-30 days after onset with moderae severity in sable condition will be entered into the study after informed consent. Both arms will receive standard treatment but BMMC arm will,in addition,have bone marrow aspiration and receive autologous 30-500 million bone marrow mononuclear cells intravenously on the day of randomisation and all patients will be followed at DaY 7 Â± days, Day 90(-7 days to +14 days), Day 180(-7 days to +28 days)and Day 365 (-7 days to + 28 days). A number of safety and efficacy variables will be measured. This phase 2 study will aim to determine dose response gradient of stem cell therapy and to explore if results have a favourable risk to benefit ratio to justify a phase 3 study. This will be the first human trial to determine and compare favourable and unfavourable effects of bone marrow mononuclear cells(mainly CD34) in acute ischamic stroke and also the first multi-centric study with potential to achieve a reasonable sample size in a relatively short time.</detailed_description>
