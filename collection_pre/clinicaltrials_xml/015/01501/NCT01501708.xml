	<brief_summary>In this prospective phase II observational study, we plan to assess the efficacy and tolerability of caspofungin based combined anti-fungal therapy for proven or probable IFI in a group of patients received allo-HSCT transplantation with high risk of IFI: HLA matched unrelated donor or mismatched donor conditioning with ATG containing regimen or present III-IV aGVHD or extensive GVHD undergoing high-dose steroid treatment.</brief_summary>
