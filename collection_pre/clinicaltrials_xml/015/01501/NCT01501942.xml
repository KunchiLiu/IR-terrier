	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to evaluate the efficacy of AIM-102 for the treatment of allergen-induced asthma. Individuals with stable, mild to moderate allergic asthma by American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (1), with a history of episodic wheeze and shortness of breath, will be eligible for enrollment. The patients will receive 4 consecutive days of dosing of AIM-102 or placebo (inactive product) with an allergen challenge on day 3 of dosing to see how the patient's lung function is changed by using AIM-102 or placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to evaluate the efficacy of AIM-102 for the treatment of allergen-induced asthma. Individuals with stable, mild to moderate allergic asthma by American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (1), with a history of episodic wheeze and shortness of breath, will be eligible for enrollment. The study is divided into 2 parts. Part 1: Screening Patients who meet all entry criteria will be screened with a history, physical examination, spirometry, and routine laboratory tests. If they continue to meet entry criteria, their atopic status will be documented by skin testing against common airborne allergens (including cat, dust mite, grass, pollen). Twenty-four (24) hr later, an allergen challenge will be performed to confirm the presence of an Early Asthmatic Response (EAR) and Late Asthmatic Response (LAR). Methacholine PC20 and sputum differentials will be performed before and after allergen challenges. Only patients with a documented early and late asthmatic response to inhaled incremental allergen challenge will be eligible for entry into Part 2 of the study. Part 2: Dosing and Follow-up Patients will be assigned to receive drug and placebo in a random order, with at least a two week washout between treatment periods. Spirometry, vital signs, and asthma symptomatology, methacholine challenge, sputum differentials will be evaluated before the first dose and again 24 hr before allergen challenge. Allergen challenge will be performed in the morning of Day 3 of dosing, post-dose, with spirometry measured until seven hr post-challenge. Sputum will also be induced at seven hr following the allergen challenge. Methacholine challenge and sputum induction will be performed 24 hr after allergen challenges. Any adverse events (AEs) and asthma symptoms will be evaluated at each clinic visit. A physical examination, vital signs, ECG, spirometry and laboratory tests will be repeated at the termination visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The following inclusion must be met for study entry (Part 1 Screening): Males and females between ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years of age. Able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study, in accordance with ICH GCP requirements. Non or exsmoker, defined by an exsmoker is defined as someone who completely stopped smoking for at least 12 months before Visit 1 of this study. Able to adhere to study procedures. In good general health without clinically significant medical history (see also Exclusion criteria below). Physical examination and laboratory results within the normal ranges, if not within the ranges, they must be without clinically significance within 28 days prior to dosing. Available for followup for the duration of the study (i.e. up to 10 weeks, including the Screening and Treatment Phases). Mild to moderate, stable, allergic asthma by the ATS criteria (1) History of episodic wheeze and shortness of breath; FEV1 at baseline at least 70% of the predicted value Males agree to practice adequate contraception throughout the duration of the study and up to one month after drug administration. FEMALESPECIFIC INCLUSION CRITERIA: All females must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening Days 5 to 1 (Visit 5) and a negative urine pregnancy test at Day 1 of each Treatment Phase prior to dosing (Visits 6 and 11). A female patient must meet one of the following criteria: No reproductive potential, defined as: menopausal for at least two years or surgically sterile for at least six months (i.e. has undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) OR Participant agrees to be heterosexually inactive from Screening Visit 1 until one month post final dose OR Participant agrees to consistently practice adequate contraception from Screening Visit 1 until one month post final dose by one of the following methods, two methods must be used if hormonal contraception is used: Contraceptive pills (stable dose for at least 2 months prior to dosing on Day 1 (Visit 6) or patch, Norplant or Provera; intrauterine device (IUD), condom with spermicide or diaphragm (cervical cap) with spermicide. In addition the inclusion criteria above, the following inclusion criteria must be met for entry into the Dosing Phase (Part 2): Positive methacholine challenge (PC20 ≤ 16 mg/ml) Positive skinprick test to common aeroallergens (including cat, dust mite, grass, pollen) Positive allergeninduced early and late airway bronchoconstriction A patient will be excluded if one or more of the following conditions apply. FEMALE ONLY EXCLUSIONS: Females who are pregnant or are lactating Females of childbearing potential who refuse to use an acceptable contraceptive regimen throughout the entire duration of the study (from the Screening visit until study completion) and for one month post dosing RELEVANT MEDICAL HISTORY: Use of any nicotine containing products within 12 months prior to Screening or a smoking history &gt; 10 pack years A worsening of asthma or a respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks preceding study entry Clinically significant and relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history, physical examination, ECG, or laboratory tests during Screening that would interfere with the objectives of the study or that would in the Investigator's opinion preclude safe completion of the study.
