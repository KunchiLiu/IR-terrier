	<brief_title>Role of PET/CT With Fluorine-18 Tracers of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with high risk prostate cancer and high PSA levels, PET/CT with fluoride (18F) and FLUOROCHOLINE (18F) and whole-body MRI will be performed within one month. Data of a 6 month follow-up after those examination will be made available to a panel of independent experts. They will determine the standard of truth (SOT) concerning the invasion of the skeleton and also of soft tissue by prostate cancer tissue, the impact of each imaging modality on patient management and the adequacy of the decisions. In some cases (anti-hormone treatment without histology), it will not be possible to determine the SOT. By comparison of the results of blind readings for each imaging modality with the standard of truth, the diagnostic performance will be determined. By simulation, several strategies will be constructed concerning the best examinations to be performed and the sequence according to the precise clinical circumstances. Their cost and effectiveness will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
