	<brief_summary>Cytoplasmatic maturation is an important event in the general maturation of of the oocyte. Mitochondria is one of the major organelles involved in the process of cytoplasmatic maturation. The aim of this study is to investigate the presence and distribution of the mitochondria in the cytoplasma of immature oocytes that are retrieved in the routine in-vitro maturation cycle with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). These oocytes will not undergo ICSI because of their immaturity. Usually, they are discarded. In addition to these immature oocytes the investigators shall also investigate the mitochondria in mature oocytes that underwent ICSI but did not become fertilized and are discarded.</brief_summary>
