	<brief_summary>Background/Aims: The investigators explored the therapeutic effects of probiotics in patients with AH. Methods: Between September 2010 and April 2012, the investigators conducted a 7-day, double-controlled, randomized, prospective clinical trial comparing the efficacy of probiotics in improving liver enzymes, LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines. AH was defined as an aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 and elevated AST (ALT) level with an alcohol consumption history within 48 hours. Patients were randomized to receive 7 days of probiotics (1500 mg/day) or placebo. The levels of liver enzymes, modified Discriminant Function (mDF), LPS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were checked at baseline and again after therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Probiotics on Gut-Liver Axis of Alcoholic Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Aims: Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is one of the leading causes of liver diseases. Gut-derived microbial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been known as a central role in the pathogenesis of AH. Some animal studies suggested an emerging role of probiotics in restoration of the bowel flora and improving liver enzymes. We explored the therapeutic effects of probiotics in patients with AH. Methods: Between September 2010 and April 2012, we conducted a 7-day, double-controlled, randomized, prospective clinical trial comparing the efficacy of probiotics in improving liver enzymes, LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines. AH was defined as an aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 and elevated AST (ALT) level with an alcohol consumption history within 48 hours. Patients were randomized to receive 7 days of probiotics (1500 mg/day) or placebo. The levels of liver enzymes, modified Discriminant Function (mDF), LPS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were checked at baseline and again after therapy.</detailed_description>
