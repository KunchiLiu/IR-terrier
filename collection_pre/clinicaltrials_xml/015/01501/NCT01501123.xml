	<brief_summary>PREHOSPITAL AGITATION AND SEDATION TRIAL (PHAST) - The goal of the PHAST is to demine whether haloperidol is superior to midazolam for the sedation of agitated patients in the prehospital environment - The primary outcome is the time to a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) ≤1 o The RASS is a well validated standardized score to measure a patient's agitation - The secondary outcomes are - Time until RASS returns to 0 or 1 if RASS &lt;0 - Need for additional sedation - Adverse effects (need for intubation, arrhythmia) - Mercy EMS will be the only EMS agency in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania carrying haloperidol - Identification of potential study patients will be per state protocols - Exclusion Criteria for the study - Age &lt;18 - Pregnant - Allergic to study medication - Transport to hospital other than Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital - Unable to reach medical command prior to giving medication - When a paramedic identifies a possible study candidate, the paramedic will consult medical command to see if the patient is appropriate for the study - If the medical command agrees the patient is appropriate for the study, patients will be randomized to - Odd days: Haloperidol 5mg IM (age &lt;65) or haloperidol 2.5 mg IM (age ≥65) - Even days: Midazolam 0.05 mg IM to maximum of 5mg IM (age &lt;65) or maximum of 2.5mg (age ≥65) - The RASS will be documented by the prehospital providers every 5 minutes until arrival at the hospital - Once the patient arrives at the ED, the RASS will be documented in PICIS® by the emergency department nurse at the time of triage and at a minimum of hourly until the RASS =0 or 1 for 2 consecutive hours - Questions may be directed to Dr. Isenberg at disenberg@mercyhealth.org or at (267) 205-6453 Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale RASS RASS Description - 4 Combative, violent, danger to staff - 3 Pulls or removes tube(s) or catheters; aggressive - 2 Frequent non-purposeful movement - 1 Anxious, apprehensive, but not aggressive 0 Alert and calm - 1 Awakens to voice (eye opening/contact) &gt;10 sec - 2 Light sedation, briefly awakens to voice (eye opening/contact) &lt;10 sec - 3 Moderate sedation, movement or eye opening. No eye contact - 4 Deep sedation, no response to voice, but movement or eye opening to physical stimulation - 5 Unarousable, no response to voice or physical stimulation</brief_summary>
