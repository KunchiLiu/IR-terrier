	<brief_summary>To date, the investigators still do not know the annual incidence of Superficial Vein Thrombosis in the legs, although the investigators do know that this pathology is frequent and the investigators can assume its incidence is greater than Deep Vein Thrombosis which is of 1 to 2 cases per year per 1,000 inhabitants. Furthermore, the high percentage of SVT with concomitant DVT and Pulmonary Embolism only concerns patients seen in vascular medicine, so it is important to re-evaluate this rate on an unselected population from general practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence of Superficial Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The method is a prospective observational study involving all the general practitioners and vascular physicians of the Saint Etienne region, i.e. 276 general practitioners, 27 vascular physicians and 341,822 inhabitants. Any new case of symptomatic SVT in the legs suspected by the general practitioner and confirmed by compression ultrasonography by the vascular physician would be listed over one year. The confirmed SVTs, directly seen by the vascular physicians would also be listed. The incidence would be calculated by relating the total number of SVTs observed to the number of inhabitants of the Saint Etienne region. Information on whether concomitant DVT exists or not at the time of the compression ultrasonography would also be collected.</detailed_description>
