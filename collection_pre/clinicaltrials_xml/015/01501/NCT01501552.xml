	<detailed_description>The study will be a stepped cluster RCT in 5 countries and the endpoint of the study is the number of interventions delivered during a certain time period. More specifically, the RCT will examine: - The effect of Continuous Medical Education (CME) to PHC providers - The effect of financial reimbursement to PHC providers as a pay-for-performance of brief alcohol interventions - Whether an alternative internet based method of delivering brief intervention can increase the proportion of patients reached - If one implementation strategy will give an added value to one already enforced.</detailed_description>
