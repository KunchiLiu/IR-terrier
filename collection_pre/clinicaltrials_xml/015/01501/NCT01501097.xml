	<brief_title>The Impact of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy on the Outcomes of Burn Patients With Early Phase of Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) on the outcomes of patients with sepsis is controversial, and there is no consensus for the timing and dose of CRRT may improve the outcomes. The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to assess the effect of different CRRT intensity (25ml/kg/h or 50ml/kg/h) on the outcomes of burn patients with early phase of sepsis</detailed_description>
