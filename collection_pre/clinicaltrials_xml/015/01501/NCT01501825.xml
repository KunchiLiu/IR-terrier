	<brief_summary>The Multiway stimulator is a novel TMS stimulator with several new and unique properties. Currently standard TMS devices include a single channel, and can operate only a single coil. The Multiway stimulator includes five channels which can operate up to five independent TMS coils, either simultaneously or sequentially. The Multiway device may be used to obtain a differential activation of various brain regions. For instance it can be used to induce high frequency stimulation of a certain brain region, thus inducing facilitation, while simultaneously stimulate at low frequency in another brain region, leading to inhibition. The purpose of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Multiway deep TMS in comparison to a single channel DTMS treatment in subjects with MDD. Subjects will be treated with one of two designs of the study device (the Multiway Coil TMS Device): 1. Single Channel with a coil placed over the left PFC (10 Hz). 2. Four channels: a. 10 Hz over the left PFC. b. 1 Hz over the right PFC. c. 10 Hz over the left parietal cortex. d. 1 Hz over the right parietal cortex.</brief_summary>
