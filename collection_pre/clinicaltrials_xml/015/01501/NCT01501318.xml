	<brief_title>Impact of Personalized Feedback Alone on Substance Use Behaviors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening and brief intervention (SBIRT) generally involves universal screening for risky substance use behaviors in medical settings and the immediate provision of a 3-15 minute intervention to those found to be at risk. In this pilot study, the investigators seek to develop a more efficient and effective approach to providing brief behavioral health interventions in the field by comparing a brief coach directed intervention to a tailored report only group. The goal is to create a cost-effective and sustainable system that provides consumers with tailored information that will help them both initiate and sustain the lifestyle changes necessary for improving their overall health. Hypothesis 1: In a medical setting, personalized feedback alone will be associated with a reduction in risky substance use behaviors. Hypothesis 2: In a medical setting, personalized feedback alone will have the same impact on behavior as that information plus a brief coach education session on risky substance use behaviors..</detailed_description>
