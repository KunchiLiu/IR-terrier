	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Hair Stimulating Complex (HSC) on Hair Growth in Males With Androgenetic Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HSC consists of proteins secreted by human dermal cells under proprietary culture conditions that include reduced oxygen and bioreactors. Under these conditions, the cells secrete soluble proteins that include both growth factors and soluble precursors to the deposited extracellular matrix. Several of these proteins are known to be important in the control of the hair cycle and will stimulate resting hair follicles to resume hair formation.</detailed_description>
