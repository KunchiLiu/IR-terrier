	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Kinesio Taping to Treat Muscular and Joint Problems in Chronic Venous Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is a very common disease. Patients with this pathology present peripheral muscle pump impairment and restricted range of ankle motion. Few data are available on the use in chronic venous insufficiency patients of Kinesio Taping, a physical therapist's elastic dressing that permits action on muscle activity and joint range.</detailed_description>
