	<brief_title>Gadoxetic Acid-enhanced MR Evaluation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Dysplastic Nodules in the Cirrhotic Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver cirrhosis is a progressive, diffuse disease of the liver characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, fibrosis, distortion of the normal hepatic architecture and a spectrum of nodular lesions that includes regenerative nodules (RN), dysplastic nodules (DN) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Since HCC is the leading cause of death among the patients with liver cirrhosis, Early and accurate diagnosis of HCC and its precursors by using optimal imaging technique is critical for its treatment and management. Recently state-of-the-art magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadoxetic acid, which works both an extracellular and hepatocyte-specific contrast agent, has been increasing used to evaluate the patients with liver cirrhosis. Several studies correlated gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR of HCC and hepatocellular nodules with the pathology from biopsy or surgical resection specimens. However, all of those studies are limited by its lack of complete correlation between pathologic and imaging findings and the resulting bias being toward the positive studies. Ideally, the use of whole explant pathologic correlation would be helpful for exact characterization of HCC and its precursors on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR. The question of our study is how accurate gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR is in the evaluation of the patients with cirrhotic liver to detect HCC and dysplastic nodules and, by using thin-section whole-explant correlation following liver transplantation as the reference standard.</detailed_description>
