	<brief_title>Prevention of Hypergranulation Tissue After Gastrostomy Tube Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypergranulation tissue is one of the major immediate complications of gastronomy tube placement. This study aims to determine if using a foam dressing upon placement will prevent its formation, as it has been demonstrated as an effective treatment in healing hypergranulation tissue formation post-operatively. Study participants will be randomized into one of three treatments after gastronomy tube placement (1) standard care, (2) plain foam treatment or (3) silver foam dressing. These treatments will be applied for 30 days post-operatively in addition to standard care of cleaning the gastronomy site daily with soap and water, if assigned to foam intervention. All study materials are free for duration of 30 day intervention and participation will not interfere with routine post-operative care of gastronomy tube site. The total duration of trial will be 6 months and will not require additional study visits outside of routine care. The rate of G-tube dislodgements and associated outcomes will also be measured during the trial.</detailed_description>
