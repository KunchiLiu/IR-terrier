	<brief_summary>The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the MDLAP (MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas system)automated insulin management system using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and subcutaneous insulin pump infusion in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The study will include 3 inpatient admissions (12-24 hr), which will include overnight sleep, over-bolus meal, under-bolus meal and exercise.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the MDLAP (MD-Logic artificial pancreas system)automated insulin management system using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and subcutaneous insulin pump infusion in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The study will include 3 inpatient admissions (12-24 hr), which will include overnight sleep, over-bolus meal, under-bolus meal and exercise. During the the visits, meal boluses will be semi-automated, with manual meal announcement by the physician/nurse, automated bolus recommendation by the system, and automated delivery of the bolus following confirmation of the recommendation. Between-meal insulin dosing will be fully automated. Bolus confirmation by the physician/nurse will be requested by the closed loop controller only when it determines that carbohydrates may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia following the bolus.</detailed_description>
