	<brief_title>Pulmonary Fibrosis and Telomerase Mutation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two "control" subjects will be enrolled for one subject with telomerase mutation. The data are all the results of investigations conducted for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and during routine follow up of patients. The CT scans will reviewed centrally to homogenize the description.</detailed_description>
