	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to gain new knowledge on the impact of hamstring tendon harvest and apply that knowledge to the treatment and management of patients who undergo anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. There are three main components of this study: 1. How do muscle shape, size, strength, and ability to function change following hamstring grafting for ACL reconstruction; 2. How does physical activity change following ACL reconstruction; 3. Is there a difference in outcome if graft harvest is done from the injured versus uninjured limbs</brief_summary>
