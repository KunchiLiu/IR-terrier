	<brief_summary>A small 14-French(F) pigtail catheter (PC) has been shown to work equally well with traditional 32-40F chest tube (CT), especially in traumatic pneumothorax. There are no clinical data on tube-site pain. The investigators hypothesize that PC tube site pain is less than CT.</brief_summary>
