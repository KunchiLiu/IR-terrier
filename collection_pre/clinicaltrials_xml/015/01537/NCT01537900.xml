	<brief_summary>The goal of this study was to compare hepatic pharmacokinetics (PK) derived from liver tissue to plasma PK after administration of grazoprevir (MK-5172) to participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Participants will be randomized to one of four different liver ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) schedules (at 4-, 8-, 24-, or 72-hours after the Day 7 dose).</brief_summary>
