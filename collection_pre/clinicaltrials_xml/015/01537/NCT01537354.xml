	<brief_summary>This is a null hypothesis study. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference in changes in dynamic compliance when measured at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minute intervals after administration of either surfactant and there will be no differences in the number of doses needed between the two surfactants in premature infants admitted to our NICU.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison in Pulmonary Compliance Between Curosurf and Survanta in Preterm Infants With Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature newborn infants may have impaired lung function as a result of their prematurity. When this occurs, the newborns show poor oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange and difficulty in breathing. The reason for these symptoms is due in part to the lack of special chemicals in the lungs, called phospholipids or surfactant. The lack of these special chemicals causes the babies lung to be difficult to ventilate. Treatment of this condition can require placing an artificial airway (endotracheal tube) into the babies windpipe (intubation) and use of a breathing machine (ventilator). In addition, physicians frequently give these special chemicals (phospholipid) through the childs airway. There are several different types of phospholipids available for this treatment in newborns but very limited amount of studies have been done to examine differences in the ability to ventilate between the various types of surfactant. The investigators propose to examine immediate changes in ability to ventilate (dynamic compliance) at specific time intervals after administration of either type of surfactant; Curosurf or Survanta.</detailed_description>
