	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine if wounds with elevated protease activity (EPA) treated with targeted interventions such as protease modulating therapies can improve clinical and economic outcomes.

	<brief_title>WOUNDCHEK™ Protease Status Point of Care (POC) Diagnostic Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this trial is to determine if wounds with elevated protease activity (EPA) treated with targeted interventions such as protease modulating therapies can improve clinical and economic outcomes. It is hypothesized that protease modulating dressings may provide significantly better clinical outcomes on EPA wounds over current standard of care. Wounds with EPA will be determined using a new POC diagnostic test, WOUNDCHEK™ Protease Status, and the efficacy of PROMOGRAN®, a protease modulating therapy will be determined against standard of care (moist wound healing and compression) in VLU wounds in both elevated EPA and low protease activity wounds.</detailed_description>
