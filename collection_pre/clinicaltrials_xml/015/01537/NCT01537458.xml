	<brief_summary>Tricuspid valve insufficiency (TI) is often noted on echocardiography. Although severe TI is known to cause significant morbidity and mortality, no good guidelines are available to guide intervention. Literature is mostly confined to tricuspid valve repair concomitant with mitral valve repair. Treatment options for isolated repair have not been investigated thoroughly. The investigators want to evaluate retrospectively the outcome of isolated tricuspid valve repair, performed in our center. By doing this, the investigators want to evaluate predictors of outcome after repair.</brief_summary>
