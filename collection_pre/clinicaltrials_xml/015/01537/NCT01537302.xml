	<brief_title>Chronic Total Occlusion Crossing With the Ocelot System - CONNECT II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Ocelot System to provide OCT-assisted orientation while simultaneously crossing chronic total occlusions (CTOs) in femoropopliteal arteries. The Ocelot Catheter is a minimally invasive percutaneous device that is designed to traverse arterial occlusions through the use of spiral wedges contained in the distal tip of the device. The device is also equipped with an OCT (optical coherence tomography) imaging fiber that provides directional orientation and an intravascular view of the vessel wall and target lesion. The Ocelot Catheter is used in conjunction with standard endovascular devices and as an adjunct to fluoroscopic guidance.</detailed_description>
