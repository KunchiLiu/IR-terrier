	<brief_summary>This trial will attempt to develop the use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as a tool for the evaluation of both new and existing pharmacological treatments for type 2 diabetes, using the twice daily administered dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, vildagliptin as a probe. The primary hypothesis is that two weeks of treatment with 50 mg of oral Vildagliptin, twice daily will lead to a statistically significant decrease in 24 hour weighted-mean glucose (WMG) relative to placebo.</brief_summary>
