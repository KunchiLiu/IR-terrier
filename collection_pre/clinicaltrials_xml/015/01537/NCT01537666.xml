	<brief_title>Inhaled Vancomycin Tolerability, Safety and Pharmacokinetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study has three main objectives: - To evaluate the safety, and tolerability of AeroVanc inhalation powder in healthy volunteers, and in patients with CF. - To determine the systemic bioavailability of vancomycin in healthy volunteers following single dose pulmonary administration of 16 mg, 32 mg, and 80 mg doses of AeroVanc in comparison with a 250 mg dose of vancomycin administered intravenously. - To estimate the lung sputum concentrations of vancomycin in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) following single dose pulmonary administration of 32 mg and 80 mg doses of AeroVanc.</detailed_description>

Participation in a clinical study within three months on Investigational Product administration. 11. Donation of blood or plasma within three months of Investigational Product administration. 12. Any other condition which in the view of the Investigator is likely to interfere with the study or put the subject at risk. Inclusion Criteria CF Patients: 1. Able to communicate with site personnel and to understand and voluntarily sign the Informed Consent Form. 2. Able and willing to comply with the protocol, including availability for all scheduled study visits. 3. Have a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (by two established methods, e.g. positive sweat chloride value ≥ 60 mEq/L, nasal potential difference test, and/or genotype with two identifiable mutations consistent with CF, accompanied by one or more clinical features consistent with the CF phenotype). 4. Be aged ≥ 18 years old 5. Have FEV1 &gt;40 % of predicted 6. Be able to perform all the techniques necessary to measure lung function 7. No liver enzymes increased by more than twice the upper limit of normal 8. Ability to spontaneously produce bronchial sputum daily Inclusion Criteria CF Patients: 1. Administration of any investigational drug or device within 28 days of Screening and within six halflives of the investigational drug. 2. Oral corticosteroids in doses exceeding 10 mg per day or 16 mg every other day. 3. History of sputum culture or throat swab culture yielding B. cepacia in the previous two years. 4. History of positive MRSA culture, or sputum culture positive for MRSA at screening. 5. Current daily continuous oxygen supplementation or requirement for more than 2 L/min at night. 6. A history of previous allergies or sensitivity to vancomycin, or other component(s) of the study drug. 7. Changes in antimicrobial, bronchodilator, antiinflammatory or corticosteroid medications within 7 days prior to Screening. 8. Changes in physiotherapy technique or schedule within 7 days prior to Screening. 9. History of lung transplantation. 10. A chest XRay at Screening or within the previous 90 days of Screening, with abnormalities indicating a significant acute finding (e.g., lobar infiltrate and atelectasis, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion). 11. Positive pregnancy test. All women of childbearing potential will be tested. 12. Female of childbearing potential who is lactating or is not practicing acceptable method of birth control (e.g., hormonal or barrier methods, or intrauterine device). 13. Findings at Screening that, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the safety of the subject or the quality of the study data. 14. History of severe cough/bronchospasm upon inhalation of dry powder inhalation product. 15. Considered "terminally ill" or eligible for lung transplantation. 16. Have had a significant episode of hemoptysis (&gt;60 mL) in the three months prior to enrolment.</criteria>
