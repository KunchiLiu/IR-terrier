	<brief_summary>This study will assess the pharmacokinetics of MK-8931, a ß-secretase inhibitor, in participants with renal insufficiency. In Part 1 of the study, pharmacokinetics of MK-8931 in participants with severe renal disease and in healthy matched control participants will be studied. If data from Part 1 confirms that severe renal impairment does not alter the pharmacokinetics of MK-8931 to the extent requiring dosage adjustment, then no further study will be required and Part 2 will be optional. If the data does not support this conclusion, then Part 2 will be conducted to study the pharmacokinetics of MK-8931 in participants with moderate and mild renal impairment compared to healthy matched controls.</brief_summary>
