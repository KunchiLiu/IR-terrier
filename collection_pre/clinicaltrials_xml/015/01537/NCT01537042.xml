	<brief_summary>This is a sleep laboratory study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Rotigotine in subjects with Restless Legs Syndrome and End-Stage Renal Disease requiring hemodialysis. The objectives are to demonstrate superiority of Rotigotine against Placebo as well as to investigate the effect of Rotigotine on quality of life and sleep.</brief_summary>
