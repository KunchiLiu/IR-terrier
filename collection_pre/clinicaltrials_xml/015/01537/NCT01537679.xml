	<brief_title>Meditation to Reduce Caregiver Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an 8-week study to determine if meditation or listening to a relaxation CD will be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and stress, and in improving memory and cognition of caregivers who perform a daily meditation for 12 minutes a day for 8 weeks compared to caregivers listening to a relaxation CD for 12 minutes a day for 8 weeks. A second purpose of this study is to examine the role of genetic and inflammatory markers in response to listening to a relaxation CD and meditation.</detailed_description>
