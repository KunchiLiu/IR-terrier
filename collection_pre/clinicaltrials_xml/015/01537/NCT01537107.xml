	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of sirolimus when given together with vismodegib in treating patients with solid tumors or pancreatic cancer that is metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Sirolimus and vismodegib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus and Vismodegib in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors or Pancreatic Cancer That is Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of vismodegib and sirolimus in unresectable solid tumors. (Cohort I) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the adverse event profile associated with this treatment combination. II. To describe the tumor responses to treatment combination. CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the effect of the sirolimus and vismodegib combination on selected biomarkers in tumor biopsies of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. II. To assess the effect of the combination of vismodegib and sirolimus on fludeoxyglucose F 18 (F18-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging in Cohort II (MTD) patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. III. To study the association of clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) with the biologic (pharmacodynamic) results obtained by examining tissue biopsies and PET or PET/CT imaging from the same patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sirolimus. Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) and vismodegib PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.</detailed_description>

Note: this is part of the mandatory translational research component Women of childbearing potential only: Negative serum pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to registration; NOTE: female subjects who are pregnant or nursing are excluded from this study; there is no specific mitigation strategy for vismodegib toxicity; however, male patients should be made aware of it during the consent process; although this effect is expected to be reversible with discontinuation of dosing, longterm effects on male fertility cannot be excluded at this time Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1 or 2 Able to swallow or have medication administered through a Gtube and absorb the medication Participant agrees to use acceptable form of contraception during the study and for up to 7 months after last study drug dose Acceptable forms of contraception: Latex condom (always used with spermicide) Diaphragm (always used with spermicide) Cervical cap (always used with spermicide) Acceptable forms of secondary contraception, when used along with a barrier method: Hormonal contraception methods, including pills, patches, rings, or injections except progestinonly containing pills (i.e. "Minipill") Tubal ligation Partner's vasectomy Intrauterine device (nonprogesterone T) Vaginal sponge (containing spermicide) Other acceptable forms: 100% commitment to abstinence Unacceptable forms of contraception for women of childbearing potential: Oral contraception containing progestins only Intrauterine device (IUD) progesterone T Female condom Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding Fertility awareness Withdrawal Cervical shield Willing not to smoke Willing to complete a pill diary each day COHORT I (DOSE ESCALATION): Known standard therapy for the patient's disease that is potentially curative or definitely capable of extending life expectancy Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Any of the following prior therapies: Chemotherapy =&lt;
