	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that alpha-lipoic acid and L-acetyl carnitine may have some neuroprotective activities and it is hoped that they could be helpful for people with neurodegenerative illnesses such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The purpose of this study is to find out whether the nutritional supplement alpha-lipoic acid/L-acetyl carnitine is safe and well-tolerated in individuals with PSP when given daily, and whether it affects their well-being, brain scan measurements and blood tests that measure the energy metabolism in cells.</brief_summary>
