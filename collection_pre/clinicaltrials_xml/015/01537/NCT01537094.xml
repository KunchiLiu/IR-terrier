	<brief_summary>Obesity is associated with reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion. GH secretion is regulated by nutritional stimuli including fasting, insulin, glucose and free fatty acids. However, the role of micronutrients, such as vitamins, on GH secretion has not been investigated in much detail. Vitamin C levels are also reduced in obesity, and the investigators recently demonstrated a possible role for dietary vitamin C intake in the regulation of GH secretion in two preliminary retrospective studies. The investigators therefore propose a more detailed prospective physiological study to examine the effects of increasing dietary vitamin C intake on GH secretion in a physiologic, intervention study. The investigators hypothesize that increasing vitamin C concentrations in obese subjects with sub-optimal plasma vitamin C levels and reduced GH secretion will increase GH secretion.</brief_summary>
