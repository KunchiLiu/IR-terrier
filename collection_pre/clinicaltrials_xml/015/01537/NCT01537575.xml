	<brief_summary>Postpolio syndrome is a condition that affects many polio survivors years after the acute infection and causes symptoms to increase or new symptoms to develop. Proinflammatory cytokine production within the central nervous system (CNS) indicates an underlying inflammatory process, amenable to immunomodulatory therapy. In this study the investigators sought to confirm that antiinflammatory treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin improves the disease.</brief_summary>
