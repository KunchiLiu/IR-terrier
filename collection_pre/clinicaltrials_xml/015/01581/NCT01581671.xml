	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the non-invasive, Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (PAT) testing as another way of predicting potential coronary artery blockages in the heart.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive EndoPAT Increases Diagnostic Yield of CAD by Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are conducting a 16 minute, non-invasive EndoPAT test on patients coming to our cath lab for a first-time angiogram. The angiogram results will be compared to the EndoPAT results to determine if the EndoPAT test, which generates a score, is successful in predicting who may have blockages in their coronary arteries.</detailed_description>
