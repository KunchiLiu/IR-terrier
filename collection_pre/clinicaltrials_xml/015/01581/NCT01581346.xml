	<brief_summary>In the course of their disease patients with Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often experience impaired psychological and physical functioning resulting in a reduced quality of life (QoL). The aim of the study is to explore the feasibility and the effects of an eight weeks combined muscle strength and endurance training on physical capacity and QoL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Study in Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this open, prospective, single center study 40 patients (pts) with NSCLC undergoing adjuvant or palliative chemo-/ or radiotherapy are enrolled. Physical status is assessed by using the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) for endurance and by using the Handheld Dynamometer (HHDM) for strength (flexion and extension of elbow, hip and knee). Psychological performance is measured by standardized questionnaires (MFI, FACT-L, PHQ - 9). Data are collected at baseline (T0) and after the 8 weeks sports intervention (T1). Pts are instructed to train at least 5 times/ week in the inpatient setting. After discharge pts are instructed to train in a home-based setting at least 3 times/week for a period of 8 weeks. Feasibility is defined as an adherence of two trainings per week during at least 6 weeks (out of 8 weeks of the intervention).</detailed_description>
