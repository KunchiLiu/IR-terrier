	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the degree of stent malapposition on an immediate optical coherence tomography (OCT) after nominal stent pressure and at a final post-procedure OCT (ANCHOR-I) and the neointimal coverage on 3-months OCT following the intervention with the randomly assigned two drug-eluting stents (DES), PromusTMElementTM stents versus Xience PRIME® stents.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient is ≥ 20 years old Significant coronary de novo lesion (&gt; 70% by quantitative angiographic analysis) treated by single DES in each vessel. Patients with stable angina who are considered for coronary revascularization with stent implantation. Reference vessel diameter of 2.5 to 3.5 mm by operator assessment Complex lesion morphologies such as aortoostial, unprotected left main, chronic total occlusion, graft, thrombosis, and restenosis Reference vessel diameter &lt; 2.5 mm or &gt; 4.0mm and lesion length &gt; 28 mm Heavy calcified lesions (definite calcified lesions on angiogram) Lesions requiring more than 2 DES in each vessel Acute coronary syndrome Contraindication to antiplatelet agents Treated with any DES within 3 months at other vessel Creatinine level ≥ 2.0 mg/dL or ESRD Severe hepatic dysfunction (3 times normal reference values) Pregnant women or women with potential childbearing Life expectancy 1 year</criteria>
