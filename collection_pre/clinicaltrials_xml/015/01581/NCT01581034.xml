	<brief_summary>This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial investigates the effect of a 6 week intake of PADMA 28 on the endothelial function, biomarkers and the autonomic nervous systems in patients with coronary artery disease. The investigators hypothesize that PADMA 28 has a beneficial effect on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, the autonomic nervous systen and the blood inflammatory markers in patients with coronary artery disease compared to placebo treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial investigates the effect of a 6 week intake of PADMA 28 on the endothelial function, biomarkers and the autonomic nervous systems in patients with coronary artery disease. PADMA 28 contains 20 herbs from Tibet. The endothelial function will be measured by EndoPAT 2000, the autonomic nervous system by an ambulatory electrocardiography during the orthostatic reaction and the biomarkers will be analyzed with taking a blood sample. The investigators hypothesize that PADMA 28 has a beneficial effect on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, the autonomic nervous systen and the blood inflammatory markers in patients with coronary artery disease compared to placebo treatment. Objective To assess the effect of PADMA 28 on endothelial function, autonomic nervous system and biomarkers in patients with coronary artery disease. Methods 80 patients with coronary artery disease will be recruited for the study. To measure endothelial function, the investigators use EndoPAT 2000. The autonomic nervous system will be analysed with ambulatory electrocardiography.</detailed_description>
