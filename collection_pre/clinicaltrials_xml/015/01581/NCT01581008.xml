	<brief_title>Improving Symptoms and Quality of Life in Chronic Heart Failure: Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will examine the feasibility of two palliative care interventions designed to improve different facets of quality of life. Briefly, the two interventions are: 1. A palliative symptom management and psychosocial care intervention named Collaborative Care to Alleviate Symptoms and Adjust to Illness (CASA) that includes 1. evidence-based palliative symptom management of breathlessness, fatigue, and pain, provided by a nurse; 2. a 6-session structured psychosocial care protocol targeting depression and adjustment to illness, supplemented by informal (family) caregiver assessment and support, provided by a social worker or psychologist; and 3. brief weekly team meetings with the nurse, social worker/psychologist and a palliative care specialist, cardiologist, and primary care provider. 2. A psychospiritual intervention that is home-based, self-guided, and requires minimal resources. It will be delivered in written modular form via US Mail along with brief weekly telephone support. The specific aims of the study are to: 1. Examine intervention feasibility and determine preliminary estimates of intervention effect 1. Determine patient participation rates and cohort retention 2. Conduct a preliminary assessment of outcomes by measuring pre-post changes in quality of life, depressive symptoms, health status, life meaning, and spirituality. 2. Obtain qualitative feedback from study participants, the persons providing the intervention, and providers/leaders in primary care, mental health, palliative care, chaplaincy, and hospital operations.</detailed_description>
