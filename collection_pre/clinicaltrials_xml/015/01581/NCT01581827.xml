	<brief_summary>Heart failure (when the heart does not pump as well as it used to) is a medical condition which reduces the quality of life for the sufferers. Approximately 10% of people in western societies aged over 75 develop heart failure. There has been a shift towards prevention of this disease and it is hoped that BNP (brain natriuretic peptides) and NT-proBNP (N-terminal proBNP) will prove to be useful indicators of those at greatest risk. The current study therefore plans to follow up the 3500 participants at risk of heart failure from the original SCREEN-HF study. Participants who are willing to participate will be contacted annually. They will undergo a short physical exam, will be asked to complete a Quality of Life questionnaire and will have a blood sample taken. At the end of the study participants will also have an ECG and an echocardiogram.</brief_summary>
