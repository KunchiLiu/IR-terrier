	<brief_summary>The primary safety purpose of this study is to estimate the rates of immediate and long-term high grade (grade 3-5) gastrointestinal and genitourinary side effects during the five years after TrueBeam stereotactic body radiotherapy in low-risk and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. The primary efficacy purpose is to compare 5 year biochemical disease free survival rates with TrueBeam to 5 year biochemical diseases free survival rates with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Truebeam for Low-Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prescribed PTV dose of 36.25Gy shall be given in 5 fractions using the Truebeam STx. At one week after treatment, toxicity and AUA score will be evaluated. At 1 month following treatment, patients will be assessed for acute toxicity, and will fill out AUA form, SF-12, EPIC-26, SHIM and Utilization of Sexual Rx/Devices. At 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 month intervals (and every 6 months thereafter, through year 5, and annually through year 10, if investigators opt to continue past year 5), patients will be seen and evaluated, including a history, physical exam, ECOG performance status, PSA, toxicity evaluation, and AUA score. In addition, at 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter, the SF-12, EPIC-26, SHIM and Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices will be administered. Examination and studies may be done at outside facility. A prostate biopsy will be performed at time of biochemical or local clinical failure, and is encouraged at 2 years following treatment and at time of distant failure.</detailed_description>
