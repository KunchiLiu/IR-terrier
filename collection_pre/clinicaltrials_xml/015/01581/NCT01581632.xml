	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesis is that local activation of the endogenous Lp-PLA2 plays an integral role in early atherosclerosis, and contributes to the mechanism of coronary endothelial dysfunction and to the structural and mechanical properties that characterize plaque vulnerability. Thus, our study will characterize prospectively the correlation between the functional and structural vascular wall properties, and the activity of the Lp-PLA2 pathway.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Coronary Plaque Composition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study will be a substudy of our National Institute of Health (NIH) funded and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved (08-008161) protocol "Lp-PLA2 and Coronary Atherosclerosis in Humans" and (10-000044) "Lp-PLA2 and Coronary Atherosclerosis in Humans AIM III" in which the investigators are examining the impact of long-term inhibition of Lp-PLA2, with a specific novel inhibitor, on LpPLA2 activity and improvement in coronary endothelial function. The substudy will allow the investigators to also examine the additional endpoint of lipid core content of atherosclerotic plaques and hence plaque vulnerability. Plaque lipid composition will be measured using the LipiScan or LipiScan IVUS catheter (InfraReDx NIRS(Near Infrared Spectroscopy) System with or without IVUS (Intra Vascular Ultrasound) capability) at baseline and again at 6 month following Lp-PLA2 inhibition. The study will provide insight into the role of the endogenous Lp-PLA2 in early coronary atherosclerosis, a potential therapeutic target for early coronary atherosclerosis in humans.</detailed_description>
