	<brief_summary>Temperature in the vitreous cavity decreases during vitrectomy, and the same effect is seen during an uneventful phaco surgery. Significant changes occur between the baseline temperature and after every step of the surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes in Vitreous Temperature During Phacoemulsification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 23-gauge thermometer probe inserted prior to the beginning of the cataract surgery to measure the vitreous temperature at different stages of the procedure (capsulorrhexis, hydrodissection, phacomulsification, irrigation/aspiration and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation). Room temperature also registered during every step. At the end of the surgery, oral temperature will be measured.</detailed_description>
