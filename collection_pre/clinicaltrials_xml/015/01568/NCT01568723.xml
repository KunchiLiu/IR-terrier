	<detailed_description>This Project is designed to identify biologically-based and clinically-useful biomarkers of tissue at risk for neoplastic progression as well as of response to ablation therapy. These results will result in improved risk stratification in BE and better targeting of resources for patients who are candidates for ablative therapy, while simultaneously providing key information regarding the origins of Barrett's esophagus.</detailed_description>
