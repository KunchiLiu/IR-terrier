	<brief_title>Global Postural Reeducation and Segmental Exercises in Patients With Scapular Dyskinesis and Cervicalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: To assess the effectiveness of global postural reeducation relative to segmental exercises in the treatment of scapular dyskinesis with cervicalgia. Methods: Participants with scapular dyskinesis and cervicalgia (n = 30) aged 18 to 65 years were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Global Postural Reeducation and Segmental Exercises(stretching and strengthening). Upper extremity was assessed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Function of the neck was estimated using the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Pain severity was measured using a Visual Analogical Scale. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the Short Form (SF)-12. Assessments were conducted at baseline and after 10 weekly sessions (60 minutes each). Significance level was established at 5%.</detailed_description>
