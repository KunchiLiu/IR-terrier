	<brief_summary>Pilot study to determine whether daily consumption of blackraspberry powder (high in polyphenols) can reduce markers of inflammation and to determine whether genetics influence baseline levels of inflammatory markers as well as individual's response to polyphenols. A total of 10 males participated in this cross-over study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A high-fat, high-calorie challenge meal is administered to induce an inflammatory response in overweight and obese adult males. Serum levels of CRP, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 are measured prior to the challenge meal and at various times (1,2,4,8, and 12 hours) after the challenge meal. The challenge meal is given once without intervention and once after 5 daily doses of concentrated black-raspberry powder mixed in water.</detailed_description>
