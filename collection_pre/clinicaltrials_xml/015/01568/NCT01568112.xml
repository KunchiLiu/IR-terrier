	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether premedication with 325 mg microcoated aspirin (ASA) tablet or a slow-titration dosing schedule of BG00012 reduces the incidence and severity of flushing and GI events following oral administration of BG00012 dosed at 240 mg twice a day (BID) in healthy volunteers. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BG00012 when administered orally as a 240 mg BID dose regimen with and without 325 mg ASA premedication or following a slow-titration dosing schedule in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
