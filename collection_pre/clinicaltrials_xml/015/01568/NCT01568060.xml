	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Korean male or female subjects who are eligible for the primary and/or booster doses of InfanrixIPV according to the Korean Prescribing Information. Written or signed informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/ legally acceptable representative(s) of the child. Where parent(s)/ legally acceptable representatives are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by an impartial witness. Prior to enrollment of the subject into the postmarketing surveillance, the subject's parents/legally acceptable representatives will be requested to provide information regarding the enrollment of their child in a same/similar study previously. And prior to obtaining informed consent form, the investigator will check whether the subject is eligible for vaccination. At the time of postmarketing surveillance (PMS) entry, the contraindications and precautions of use indicated in the local Prescribing Information should be checked and the subject must not be included in the PMS if there is any contraindication. Any changes in the locally approved Prescribing Information must be implemented immediately. Subjects who receive any investigational or nonlicensed DTPaIPV vaccine within 30 days prior to study start will not be enrolled. Child in care.</criteria>
