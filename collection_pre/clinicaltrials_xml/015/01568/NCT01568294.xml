	<criteria>Must be ≥ 20 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document The subject must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any study related assessments/procedures are conducted. Must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements Subjects must have documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma and have measurable disease All subjects must have had at least 2 prior lines of antimyeloma therapy. Induction therapy followed by stem cell transplant and consolidation/maintenance will be considered as one line All subjects must have either refractory or relapsed and refractory disease defined as documented disease progression during or within 60 days of completing their last antimyeloma therapy. Primary refractory: Subjects who have never achieved any response better than progressive disease (PD) to any previous line of antimyeloma therapy. Relapsed and refractory: Subjects who have relapsed after having achieved at least stable disease (SD) to at least one prior regimen and then developed progressive disease (PD) on or within 60 days of completing their last antimyeloma therapy. Subjects must have also undergone prior treatment with at least 2 cycles of lenalidomide and at least 2 cycles of bortezomib (either in separate regimens or within the same regimen). All subjects must have received adequate prior alkylator therapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2.
