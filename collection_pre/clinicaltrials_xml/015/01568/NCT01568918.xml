	<brief_summary>Postoperative urinary retention is a frequent complication of spinal surgeries and impacts a large portion of this population which results in increased morbidity as a result of increased number of catheterizations, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and prolonged hospital stays. With the addition of Tamsulosin, the investigators would anticipate a reduction in the incidence and duration of postoperative urinary retention and therefore a reduction in morbidity related to treatment of urinary retention as well as shortened hospital stays.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Tamsulosin to Reduce the Incidence and Duration of Postoperative Urinary Retention Following Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decompressive laminectomy and spinal fusion procedures are among the most common neurosurgical procedures performed. Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is a frequent complication of such surgeries and impacts a large proportion of this population resulting in multiple intermittent bladder catheterizations for bladder decompression, increased incidence of bacteremia, increased incidence of UTIs, and prolonged hospital stays. Use of a uroselective alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, such as tamsulosin, in the perioperative period (medication started five days prior to surgery and taken until hospital discharge) could reduce both the incidence and duration of postoperative urinary retention, resulting in shorter hospital stays and decreased healthcare costs.</detailed_description>
