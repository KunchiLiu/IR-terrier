	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show the success of the AutoLog System in removing lipids to less than 10mg/dl in vivo. The Autolog registry has two objectives: 1. to determine the lipid removal capabilities of the Medtronic AutoLog System. 2. to obtain in vivo data on blood component removal and washing capabilities of the Medtronic AutoLog System.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry AutoLog Lipid Removal and Blood Component Characterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since the in house data strongly suggest that the Medtronic AutoLog is uniquely high performing in lipid removal in-vitro, the Registry AutoLog Lipid Removal and Blood Component Characterization is initiated to determine if the AutoLog system is successful in removing lipids in vivo as it is in-vitro. Therefore, it is expected that the lipid amounts after washing will be less than 10 mg/dl. The study is designed as a multi-center, non-randomized, non-interventional, post market release study (a registry). The study has a single arm, without controls, as it is descriptive in nature.</detailed_description>
