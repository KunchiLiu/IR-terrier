	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet versus darunavir (DRV)+cobicistat (COBI)+emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive adults as determined by the achievement of HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 24.</brief_summary>

Participants who previously experienced a sulfonamide allergy will be allowed to enter the trial. To date, no potential for cross sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and darunavir has been identified in patients participating in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials.</criteria>
