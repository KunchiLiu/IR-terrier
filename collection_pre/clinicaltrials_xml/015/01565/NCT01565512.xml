	<brief_summary>The indwelling urethral foley is a major source of discomfort following radical prostatectomy. Our hypothesis is that intra-operative dorsal penile nerve block with bupivacaine may decrease immediate post-operative foley discomfort.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dorsal Penile Block for Post-Robotic Prostatectomy Foley Discomfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) will be randomized in a double-blind placebo controlled manner to undergo penile ring block injection at the time of skin incision closure. A visual analog scale (VAS) based questionnaire including newly developed foley discomfort scores will be administered at various time points post-operatively.</detailed_description>
