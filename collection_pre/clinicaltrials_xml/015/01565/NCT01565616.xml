	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this multicenter study is to determine the safety and feasibility of a Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) in young adults with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) using a reduced toxicity conditioning regimen consisting of busulfan (Bu)/ fludarabine (Flu)/ anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). A two-component design will be used for this study. The first component will be restricted to patients who have an HLA-identical sibling donor. Five patients will be enrolled during the first component of the study. The second component of enrollment will include patients who have a related or an unrelated HLA-matched donor. Up to 10 additional patients will be enrolled in this component of the study.</brief_summary>
