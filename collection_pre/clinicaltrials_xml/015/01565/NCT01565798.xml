	<brief_summary>CONTEXT: Healthcare-acquired infections (HAI) cause substantial patient morbidity and mortality. Commonly touched items in the patient care environment harbor microorganisms that may contribute to HAI risk. Thus, reduction in the surface bioburden may be an effective strategy to reduce HAI. Inherent biocidal capabilities of copper surfaces offer a theoretical advantage to conventional cleaning, as disinfection is continuous rather than episodic. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether placement of copper-alloy surfaced objects in an intensive care unit (ICU) reduce risk of HAI. DESIGN: An intention to treat study where patients are sequentially placed into rooms with or without copper-alloy surfaced objects. SETTING: The ICUs of three hospitals, a tertiary academic hospital, an academic cancer center, and a Veteran's Administration Medical Center. PATIENTS: Any patient 18 years of age or older who required admission to an ICU at a study hospital is eligible for placement into a study room if available. INTERVENTION: Placement of copper-alloy surfaced objects in an ICU room. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Rate of incident HAI and/or colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in each type of room.</brief_summary>
