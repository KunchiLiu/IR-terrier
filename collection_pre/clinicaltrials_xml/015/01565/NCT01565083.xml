	<brief_summary>This two-cohort, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study will assess the safety and efficacy of pertuzumab given in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and vinorelbine in first line participants with metastatic or locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Participants will receive pertuzumab and trastuzumab administered sequentially as separate intravenous (IV) infusions (followed by vinorelbine) and conventional sequential administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab in separate infusion bags, followed by vinorelbine.</brief_summary>
