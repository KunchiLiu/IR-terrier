	<brief_title>Computer- Assisted Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Anxiety Disorders in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience substantial anxiety that can cause impairment above that of an ASD alone. Few studies have examined effective treatment options for anxiety in this population.Preliminary studies have established the efficacy of computer-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy in otherwise typically developing youth with anxiety. Accordingly, this study seeks to examine the efficacy of computer assisted CBT in children with autism and ASD. A randomized-control trial will examine the ability of computer-assisted CBT to treat anxiety in comparison to a waitlist condition. This study will recruit approximately 40 youth ages 7-12 years. Significant reductions in anxiety severity and overall improvement of functioning will establish this treatment's ability to treat anxiety. This study aims to evaluate the acute efficacy of CCBT relative to WAITLIST in children with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorders;examine the short-term durability of treatment gains for youth receiving CCBT; examine whether, relative to WAITLIST, CCBT results in improved social; adaptive; and global functioning, as well as reduced child- and parent-rated anxiety symptoms; and examine whether, relative to WAITLIST, CCBT is associated with greater satisfaction and consumer acceptability.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Outpatient children with an autism spectrum disorder (see #2 below) between the ages 712 years. 2. Meets criteria for a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder using scores from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Childhood Autism Rating ScaleII High Functioning Version. 3. Meets DSMIV criteria for a diagnosis of one of the following anxiety disorders: separation anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia, panic disorder or specific phobia as determined by the ADISIVC/P (with CSR 4) and all available information. 4. Minimum score of 12 on the PARS Severity Scale 5. Child has a Full Scale and Verbal Comprehension IQ &gt; 85 as assessed on the KBIT2. 6. Subjects with comorbid depression, ADHD, tic disorder or disruptive behavior disorders will be acceptable as long as the anxiety disorder is primary (i.e., most impairing/distressing). 1. Receiving concurrent psychotherapy, social skills training, or behavioral interventions (e.g., applied behavior analysis). Families will have the option of discontinuing such services to enroll in the study. 2. New Treatments: Initiation of an antidepressant within 10 weeks before study enrollment or an antipsychotic 6 weeks before study enrollment. No new alternative medications, nutritionals or therapeutic diets within 8 weeks of study enrollment. 3. Established Treatment changes: Any change in established psychotropic medication (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) within 6 weeks before study enrollment, or any change in alternative medications that might have behavioral effects within 4 weeks prior to the study baseline assessment. 4. (a) Current clinically significant suicidality or (b) individuals who have engaged in suicidal behaviors within 6 months will be excluded and referred for appropriate clinical intervention. 5. Lifetime DSMIV bipolar, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders; or Substance abuse in past 6 months. 6. Unwillingness of parents to make the commitment to accompany their child for multiple study visits. 7. Presence of a significant and/or unstable medical illness which might lead to hospitalization during the study or if the computerassisted CBT is not a good avenue of treatment for the child.</criteria>
