	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to compare patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage on dexmedetomidine compared to propofol to assess if one group has decreased inflammation. The investigators hypothesis is that the group assigned to receive dexmedetomidine will have a more profound decrease in markers of inflammation over time.</brief_summary>
