	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate differences between use of Ultrasonic Coagulation Device (New Harmonic ACE™, Ethicon endo-surgery) and Bipolar Energy Sealing System (LigaSure Precise™, Covidien) in surgery for thyroid cancer. Abbreviations: Ultrasonic Coagulation Device (UC), Bipolar Energy Sealing System (BES), Recurrence-free survival (RFS), Overall survival (OS)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Thyroid is an organ that has abundant vessels. In thyroid surgery, it should be cautious to avoid injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and parathyroid, thus careful hemostasis during surgery is crucial for surgeons who perform thyroid surgery. Recently, there have been significant advances in vessel sealing systems for the occlusion of vessels during surgery as endoscopic surgery has been developed. UC and BES are now commonly used in thyroid surgery. However, only a few studies have compared the two surgical devices to determine which technique is superior in terms of operative time and complication rate. Thus, this single-blind prospective randomized trial is conducted to determine if there was a difference in operative time, complication rate, postoperative drainage volume, admission time, cost, and, furthermore, oncologic outcomes (RFS and OS) between the two surgical devices in surgery for thyroid cancer.</detailed_description>
