	<criteria>All subjects: Male and female Caucasian subjects 18 to 70 years of age At least 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) within 1835 kg/m2. CYP2C9 wildtype (CYP2C9*1 homozygous carriers) Hepatic impairment: Subjects must have either mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment All subjects Hepatic impairment due to nonliver disease. Use of other investigational drugs within certain timelines Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood or plasma within eight (8) weeks prior to initial dosing History of cardiac rhythm abnormalities or cardiac rhythm abnormalities identified in the 24h Holter ECG recording including episodes of bradycardia (HR &lt; 50 bpm) during waking hours and/or arrhythmic episodes; subjects with history or presence of ventricular rhythm disturbances (ventricular extrasystoles &gt;100/24h, or higher grade), or supraventricular arrhythmias (other than occasional supraventricular ectopic beats with a maximum of 5 subsequent ectopic beats per event) or subjects with conduction disturbances (higher than AVblock grade 1) or bradycardia or tachycardia. History of cardiac catheter ablation. Women of childbearing potential History of malignancy of any organ system Recent and/or recurrent history of acute or chronic bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) History or presence of symptomatic postural hypotension or syncope. Total WBC or lymphocyte counts which falls outside the 1.5fold local laboratory normal range or platelet count &lt; 30,000/Î¼L at screening or baseline. Clinically significant infection or recent vaccination with liveattenuated vaccines. History or presence of hepatitis B or C and/or positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result at screening. History or presence of coronary heart disease (stable or unstable), myocardial infarction, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, heart failure NYHA II IV. Hepatic impairment: History or presence of any noncontrolled and clinically significant disease that could affect the study outcome or that would place the patient at undue risk. Any surgical or medical condition other than hepatic impairment which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the safety of the study subject in case of participation in the study. Treatment with certain drugs Healthy subjects: History or presence of any clinically significant disease of any major system organ class including (but not limited to) cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, neurological or psychiatric diseases. Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject in case of participation in the study.</criteria>
