	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate a medicine for the treatment of symptoms and complications of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in children and adolescents. NDO often occurs in patients with spina bifida or other spinal cord damage where the bladder muscle contracts more than normal during filling. These patients often have an inability to void, so that catheterization is required to empty the bladder. The medicine being tested in this study is called solifenacin succinate. Solifenacin tablets are given to adults for the treatment of overactive bladder. A new liquid suspension has been developed to treat children and adolescents in this and other studies. The efficacy and safety of the solifenacin suspension will be investigated. The take-up and length of time that the solifenacin suspension stays in the body will also be investigated during this study. The study will last for approximately 12 months, where completing patients will receive 52 weeks of continuous treatment. Effectiveness will be measured by urodynamics (the filling and emptying of the bladder) and urine volumes measured during catheterization together with the diary responses relating to the number of incontinence episodes or incontinence free days. Safety assessments include analysis of the blood and urine, review of the ECG, ultrasound of the kidney, simple memory and understanding tests (cognitive function) and the ability to see near and far objects (visual accommodation).</brief_summary>
