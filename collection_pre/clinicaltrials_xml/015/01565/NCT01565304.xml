	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the POWER Through Choices Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Youth in foster care are at especially high risk for teen pregnancy and associated sexual risk behaviors. The POWER Through Choices (PTC) program is a 10-session sexuality curriculum that aims to increase contraceptive use and delay sexual initiation by empowering youth to make healthy, positive choices about their sexual behaviors. This study uses a cluster randomized design to compare the effectiveness of PTC to usual programs and services provided to youth living in group foster care homes. Study participants will be youth living in group foster homes recruited in four locations: Kern County, CA; Cook County, IL; Baltimore County, MD; and Oklahoma (statewide). The study is being conducted as part of the national Evaluation of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Approaches funded by the Office of Adolescent Health in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</detailed_description>
