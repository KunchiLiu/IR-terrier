	<detailed_description>Design: Clinical randomised non blinded controlled trial. Setting: The study was performed in an outpatient primary health care centre serving 36 000 inhabitants. Participants: Patients (n=278), aged 18-65 years, with common mental problems or disorders were referred to the study by the GPs and 245 were included in the study. Interventions: Participants were randomised to CAU or one of two group interventions in addition to CAU. These were: a) group cognitive behavioural based therapy (CBT) administered by psychologists once a week for 12 weeks, and b) group multimodal intervention (MMI) based on a protocol comprising a mix of existing group interventions and exercises borrowed from multiple techniques and therapeutic schools and administered by assistant nurses with brief training, including two sessions per week for 6 weeks. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome measure was the Mental Component Summary score of SF-36. Secondary outcome measures were perceived stress scale (PSS) and Self-Rating Scale for Affective Syndromes (CPRS-S-A)</detailed_description>
