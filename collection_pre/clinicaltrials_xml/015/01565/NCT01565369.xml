	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is re-read of brain amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans acquired in previous florbetapir F 18 clinical studies by readers trained using updated reading methodology. The scans in this study came from subjects who had an autopsy to reveal the subject's true amyloid status.</brief_summary>
