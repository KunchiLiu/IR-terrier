	<brief_summary>Biofreeze® is a topical ointment that has menthol and alcamphor. Its analgesic effect lies in the stimulation of A and C fibers by cold and nociceptive stimulation, respectively, which is produced by menthol, apparently through the newly discovered receptor TRPM8 (Transient Receptor Potential melastatin-8) The aim of this study is to investigate if BIOFREEZE ® treatment (Performance Health Inc., Export, PA) improves symptoms associated with moderate knee osteoarthritis, which would decrease the immobility and isolation in older adults.</brief_summary>
