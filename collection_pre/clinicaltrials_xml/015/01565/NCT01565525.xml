	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot project is to test anticipatory guidance, which is information given to families during a well child visit to prevent obesity during childhood. The objectives were to compare two styles of anticipatory guidance during the first year of life, maternal focused and infant focused, versus usual care and determine which style, if any, showed the most ideal infant feeding behaviors at age 1 year and to see if there were any differences in infant weight for height at one year of age. The investigators hypothesized that mothers who received the maternal focused anticipatory guidance (which gave information on eating family meals, not having tv on during meals, and maternal nutrition) would actually have the best infant feeding behaviors and weight for height of infants at one year.</brief_summary>
