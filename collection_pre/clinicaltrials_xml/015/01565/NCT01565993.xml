	<brief_summary>The aim of our study is to analyze the advantages of the prophylactic use of hemoclips before polypectomy in our usual clinical practice, through a prospective randomized study that determines their effectiveness compared to conventional polypectomy, assessing the decrease in immediate and delayed post-polypectomy bleeding</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Prophylactic Hemoclips in the Endoscopic Resection of Large Pedunculated Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The methods for preventing post-polypectomy bleeding (PPB) are not standardised and there are groups that use hemoclips for this purpose. The aim of our study is to analyze whether the use of hemoclips reduces PPB complications. It is a prospective, randomised study of patients with pedunculated polyps larger than 10mm. The patients were included in two groups (hemoclip before polypectomy -HC- and standard polypectomy -SP-)</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients with one or more pedunculated polyps, the heads of which measured more than 1cm (regardless of the stalk thickness and length), and they were compared against the size of the biopsy forceps (6mm) and subsequently confirmed in the anatomical specimen Not to have any hemostatic alterations at the time the endoscopy was performed (confirmed by the usual blood tests taken before the procedure). Patients younger than 18 years of age Patients with a platelet count of less than 50000, INR larger than 1.5 Patients who refused to give their informed consent.</criteria>
