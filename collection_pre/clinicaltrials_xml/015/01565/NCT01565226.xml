	<brief_summary>- This will be an observational study. Respiratory data will be recorded using Capnostream20p. There will be no use in the recorded data for the medical care of the patients. Other clinical data will be captured in the CRF. Similar study is currently conducted in Bnai Zion MC since 2008. Thirty four (34) patients have been recruited without any adverse events. - During the study the medical team will capture in the CRF the following: Blood gas and distal capnography values at time of sampling, ventilator settings at time of sampling. - Changes made in the ventilation parameters, blood gas time and results, concomitant treatment (e.g. suction) and concomitant medication (respiratory related e.g. surfactant), vital signs all these will be retrieved from the patient's medical charts.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Intubated neonates with doublelumen ETT (Uncuffed Tracheal Tube, Mallinckrodt Inc., Chih, Mexico) Neonates that their respiratory condition requires HFV Neonates expected to have at least 3 pairs of distal capnography measurements and blood gas samplings. Intubated neonates with singlelumen ETTs Neonates who are ventilated with conventional ventilation Any significant medical condition which, at the investigator's discretion, may interfere with the study.</criteria>
