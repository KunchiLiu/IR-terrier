	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: I. Compare neuroradiological phenotype and cognitive functioning of MCPH patients caused by ASPM mutations already characterized and published (Passemard et al. 2009a) with other MCPH-related patients (patients with MCPH1, WDR62, CDK5RAP2, CEP 152, CENPJ, STIL, or PCNT mutations) II. Describe the neuro-radiological and cognitive phenotype of microcephalic patients suffering from Fanconi anemia, and compared them to subjects with: - Fanconi anemia but normal OFC (head circumference) - MCPH patients - Healthy control subjects Our hypothesis is that mutations in genes responsible of microcephaly impact differentially cortical brain development and functioning</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phenotyping study on 2 different cohorts of rare disease affected patients: - Group1: MCPH (including different MCPH subtypes) - Group2: Fanconi Anemia (with or without microcephaly) Inclusion criteria: Common to each group: - Age &gt; 3 years - Access to french "Social Security" - No contraindication for MRI Group1: - Primary microcephaly without gross malformation within or extra nervous central system - OFC &lt; -2SD at birth and &lt; -3 SD after age 6months - Mutation in one MCPH gene Group2: Proven Fanconi Anemia with: - Positive chromosome breakage blood test - One of the 3 following elements: FANCD2 positive test Fibroblast sensitivity to mitomycin Mutation in one FANC gene Control subjects: - No antecedent - Normal education Aims: 1. Description of neurological, neuropsychological and radiological phenotype for each group 2. Phenotype comparison: - groups 1&amp;2 - group1 or 2 with control subjects - different MCPH subtypes within group1 - with or without microcephaly within group2 3. Epidemiological data on these rare diseases in our population Protocol: Patients from both groups and control subjects will be evaluated in CIC for 1 day ½. They will be examined by a child neurologist and a geneticist. All of them will have cranial MRI (1.5Tesla). Neuropsychological assessment will be performed (Wechsler scales) for patients and control subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients aged ≥ 3 years: Microcephalic phenotype consistent with MCPH (recruitment already done as part of a network GISRare Diseases Institute).
