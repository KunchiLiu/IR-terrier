	<brief_summary>Combat soldiers are required to perform under strenuous physical conditions; hence, their physical fitness is a crucial factor in their survivability. The Auxiliary Device- "Minkal", is suggested (by its manufactures) to be able to reduce the soldiers' physiological strain by lowering the absolute load being carried by the soldier. As a result, it may improve the soldier's physiological abilities and performance through enduring missions with heavy loads, and may lead to better protection on the soldier from overuse injuries.</brief_summary>
