	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, openangle glaucoma, or pigment dispersion glaucoma in both eyes. On a stable IOPlowering regimen of prostaglandin fixed combination (either Xalacom or Ganfort) within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. IOP between 19 and 35 mmHg at any time of day in at least 1 eye. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/60 (20/200 Snellen; 1.0 LogMAR) or better in each eye. Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular hypotensive medication(s) prior to receiving the study medication for the entire course of the study. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor tolerance to any component of DuoTrav® deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal Investigator. Corneal dystrophies in either eye. Risk of visual field or VA worsening as a consequence of participation in the study, in the investigator's best judgment. Any disease or condition that would preclude the safe administration of a topical betablocker, present a special risk to the subject, or interfere with optimal participation in the study. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
