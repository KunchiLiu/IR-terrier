	<brief_summary>5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a nutritional supplement sold in many health food stores, and is taken in order to raise levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of mood. Previous research has assessed the effects of raising serotonin levels using tryptophan (the precursor of 5-HTP) and serotonergic antidepressants on emotional processing in healthy volunteers. However, to date there has been no human trial investigating the effects of 5-HTP on emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Thus, the current study aims to assess the effects of 5-HTP, on emotional processing and mood in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sub-chronic Effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan on Mood and Emotional Processing in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The serotonin precursor 5-HTP is sold as a nutritional supplement and has been used to offset low mood for over 30 years due to its ability to raise levels of neural serotonin. However, evidence for the efficiency of 5-HTP is limited and the mechanism of action of 5-HTP in offsetting low mood has not been well-characterised. The current study assessed the ability of 5-HTP to induce biases for positive emotional material in healthy volunteers, similar to those induced by serotonergic antidepressants and the nutritional supplement tryptophan. The effects of 5-HTP on subjective mood and depressive symptoms were also assessed. Participants were randomised to receive either 150mg of 5-HTP or placebo daily for 14 days. Depressive symptoms and subjective mood were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Emotional processing was assessed on the 15th day using a battery of emotionally valenced cognitive tasks.</detailed_description>
