	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible association between postoperative anaemia and functional outcomes the first 2 weeks after primary hip arthroplasty. The investigators hypothesise that patients with a higher degree of postoperative anaemia have impaired postoperative rehabilitation as measured by standardized functional outcome tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Anemia and Functional Outcomes After Fast-track Primary Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative anemia may impair postoperative rehabilitation due to anemia related symptoms such as fatigue or dizziness. Although, the impact of postoperative anemia on postoperative rehabilitation and function has previously been examined the results are conflicting. Patients undergoing fast-track hip arthroplasty (THA) are mobilized early and participate in physiotherapy during the admission but are discharged early (2-3) days postoperative. However, the ability to rehabilitate early after discharge has not been evaluated in relation to postoperative anemia. The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the possible association between postoperative anaemia and functional outcomes the first 2 weeks after primary hip arthroplasty. The investigators hypothesise that patients with a higher degree of postoperative anaemia have impaired postoperative rehabilitation as measured by standardized functional outcome tests. Hb concentrations and functional outcome measurements will be performed preoperatively, at the day of hospital discharge and during a postoperative visit 12-16 days after surgery.</detailed_description>
