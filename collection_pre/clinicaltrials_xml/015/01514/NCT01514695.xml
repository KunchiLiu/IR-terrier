	<detailed_description>Upper endoscopy is a valuable procedure that involves a camera advanced from the mouth into the intestines. It is a routine test and considered very safe. However, patients can experience discomfort from air insufflation in the stomach and unpleasantness due to gagging during the procedure. Conscious sedation with medications like sedatives and narcotics are used to improve patient satisfaction and enhance physician ability to perform an optimal examination. The choice of drugs used for sedation in upper endoscopy varies by endoscopist and the goal is always to use the lowest dose possible to achieve the best examination. Combination therapy (with a sedative &amp; narcotic) may increase the adverse effect profile compared to a sedative alone and not improve the overall experience of the physician or patient. The goal of our study is to assess in randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, the effect of using a narcotic (fentanyl) and sedative (midazolam) for sedation compared to a sedative (midazolam) alone.</detailed_description>
