	<brief_summary>Despite current antipsychotic treatment, the majority of people with schizophrenia continue to exhibit persistent positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. An alternative approach to the use of psychotropic agents for the treatment of persistent symptoms is the use of anti-inflammatory agents to reverse the pro-inflammatory state hypothesized to underlie the symptom and sign manifestations of the illness. The investigators primary hypothesis is that add-on anti-inflammatory combination therapy will have significant beneficial effects on persistent positive symptoms and cognitive impairments. The investigators secondary hypotheses are: 1. add-on anti-inflammatory combination therapy will be associated with improvements in depressive and negative symptoms and a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines 2. add-on anti-inflammatory combination therapy compared to placebo will not be associated with elevated adverse risk.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia has been hypothesized to be due, in part, to disruptions of normal immune system and inflammatory responses to viral or bacterial infections or other stimuli of these systems. Epidemiological and clinical studies have provided extensive evidence that perinatal exposure to infection contributes to the etiology of schizophrenia. The recent reports of associations between markers of single nucleotide polymorphisms located within the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6p22.1 and schizophrenia provide further support for etiological hypotheses of immune system dysfunction in schizophrenia. There are a large number of reports that suggest that people with schizophrenia have altered cytokine levels, with one or more studies reporting elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, CRP, IFN-γ, and TNF-α; and reduced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine: IL-10. In this study we examine the use of combination anti-inflammatory therapy as an intervention in patients with schizophrenia. We will use 1. Salsalate, 4 gm/day. Salsalate is a potent inhibitor of nuclear transcription factor NF-κB activation. NF-κB is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines; 2. Omega-3-fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 2 gm/day) and docosahexaenoic (DHA; 2 gm/day). Omega-3-fatty acids exert their anti-inflammatory effects through their oxygenation into resolvins or protectins, which are potent anti-inflammatory agents; 3. Fluvastatin, 40 mgs/day. Fluvastatin is a lipid-lowering drugs, which acts through the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA). Fluvastatin may also exert anti-inflammatory effects independent of its lipid-lowering effects via a mechanism involving HMG-CoA inhibition and decreased NF-κB activation. We have chosen to use combination therapy with three different classes of anti-inflammatory agents to address the potential benefit of this therapeutic approach for persistent positive symptoms and cognitive impairments. The three agents have unique anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action, which we believe offers the most robust evaluation of this therapeutic approach and maximizes the likelihood of eliciting pronounced therapeutic effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants will meet DSMIVTR criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants will be required to meet the following symptom criteria: 1. BPRS total score of 45 or greater on the 18 item version (scale: 17) or a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity of illness item score of 4 (moderate) or greater. 2. BPRS positive symptom item total score of 8 or greater and a score of 4 or more on at least one individual item. Participants will be clinically stable, be treated with the same antipsychotic for at least 60 days and a constant therapeutic dose for at least 30 days prior to study entry. Participants must be judged competent to participate in the informed consent process and provide voluntary informed consent Participants who meet DSMIVTR criteria for alcohol or substance dependence (except nicotine) within the last 6 months or DSMIVTR criteria for alcohol or substance abuse (except nicotine) within the last month will be excluded Participants with a current infection or an organic brain disorder or medical condition, whose pathology or treatment could alter the presentation or treatment of schizophrenia or significantly increase the risk associated with the proposed treatment protocol will be excluded. Participants with a history of: aspirin allergy, preexisting tinnitus, tuberculosis, HIV, or hepatitis C; or autoimmune disease. Participants who are currently treated with a statin, warfarin, dipyridamole, or other anticoagulants. Participant is currently treated with an omega3fatty acid preparation and cannot discontinue their use of the preparation for the duration of the study. Female participant who is sexually active and not using any form of birth control such as oral contraceptives or IUDs. Female participant who is pregnant or breastfeeding. Participant with current/active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis; anemia or thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤120). Participant who is currently treated with a medication that can increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis such as Fluconazole, Ketoconazole, Colchicine, Daptomycin, Erythromycin, or immunosuppressants that alter statin levels.</criteria>
