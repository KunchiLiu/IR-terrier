	<brief_summary>Super Obesity, i.e. a BMI above 50, is difficult to treat. Normal gastric bypass surgery is not always enough. Bypassing a longer segment of the gut may be more beneficial. Which part to bypass is not clear. The investigators want to compare the effects between preventing a proximal (oral) portion of the jejunum from food contact with the effects when preventing the jejunum from contact with bile and pancreatic juice. Endpoints are quality of life, gstrointestinal function, and weight development.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Long Biliopancreatic Limb vs. Long Alimentary Limb in Superobesity, a Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two variations of gastric bypass are compared: Method 1:A 200 cm BP-limb (distance Treitz to EA)+ 150 cm common channel (EA to ileocecal valve) + Roux-Y-limb variable Method 2: A 60 cm BP limb + 150 cm Roux-Y-limb + common channel variable. Patients are evaluated according to the principles of the Scandinavian Obesity surgery registry (SOReg) with the addition of two additional questionnaires. FU time is set at 5 years.</detailed_description>
