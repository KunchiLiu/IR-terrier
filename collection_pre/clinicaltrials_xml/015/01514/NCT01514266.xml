	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are leading causes of death and health care use. Diffuse airways inflammation is seen in COPD and is thought to be the reason for deterioration of lung function in COPD. Currently there is no medication available that can modify or reduce this inflammation. Furthermore, from literature review it has been shown that chronic inflammation can result in cancerous changes. Curcumin is a food additive used for centuries. Several studies showed that curcumin suppress the different inflammatory pathways. Specially, the TNF-alpha and the NF kappa-b are down regulated by this substance. This study was designed to evaluate effect of combination of curcumin+Bioprine on sputum cytology in patients with COPD. This is double-blind randomized pilot study.</brief_summary>
