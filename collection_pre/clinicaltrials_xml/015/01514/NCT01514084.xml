Research Questions 1. What is the association between wound characteristics, wound management in the ED, patient satisfaction in the ED, and patient-rated cosmetic appearance of sutured wounds? 2. Is there a difference noted among ED providers with different levels of training? 3. Is there an association between initial satisfaction scores and wound outcome? 4. Is there an association between short term and long term wound scores? Design This is a non-randomized, prospective, observational study of patients who present to the ED seeking treatment for facial laceration repair.</brief_summary>
