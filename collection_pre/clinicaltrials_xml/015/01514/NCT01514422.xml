	<brief_title>Minocycline for Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar depression remains the great unmet need in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Only two treatments have been FDA-approved for the management of acute bipolar depression (the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine and quetiapine). Early pilot data suggests the drug minocycline has potent antidepressant effects. Minocycline is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (for acne and bacterial infections), is inexpensive and readily available in generic formulation, and is generally well-tolerated. This study will examine whether administering the drug minocycline to individuals with bipolar depression over 8 weeks will improve their depressive symptoms. This study will also offer an option to participate in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to measure N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the brain, which are thought to be decreased in bipolar disorder.</detailed_description>
