	<brief_summary>Glucose has analgesic and calming effects in newborns. To date, it is not known whether the beneficial effects extend to care giving procedures that are performed after painful procedures. The investigators objective is to determine the effect of glucose 25% analgesia in comparison to Materna RTF Stage 1 for procedural pain on infant pain responses during a subsequent care giving procedure.</brief_summary>
