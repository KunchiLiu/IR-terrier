	<criteria>18 years of age or older. Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, exfoliative openangle glaucoma, or pigment dispersion glaucoma in at least one eye (study eye). Be on a stable intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering regimen within 30 days of the Screening Visit. IOP considered safe in both eyes in such a way that should assure clinical stability of vision and optic nerve throughout the study period. Best corrected visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200 Snellen; 1.0 LogMAR) or better in each eye. IOP between 19 and 35 mmHg in at least one eye (which would be the study eye) while on brimonidine/timolol fixed combination therapy. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Presence of other primary or secondary glaucoma not listed in inclusion criteria #2. History of ocular herpes simplex. Abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. Corneal dystrophies. Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, or uveitis in either eye. Blepharitis or nonclinically significant conjunctival injection is allowed. Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in study eye(s) less than three months prior to the Screening Visit. Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in the study, in the investigator's best judgment. Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause. Use of systemic medications known to affect IOP which have not been on a stable course for 7 days prior to the Screening Visit or an anticipated change in the dosage during the course of the study. Pregnant or lactating. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
