	<brief_summary>It is known that volumetric response of leiomyomas following uterine artery embolization correlates well with patients clinical outcome. The aim of this study is to assess diffusion -and perfusion weighted MRI for the prediction of volumetric response following uterine artery embolization in patients with symptomatic leiomyomas.</brief_summary>
