	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the coagulation changes that occur in laboring patients undergoing non-elective (intrapartum)Cesarean delivery using thromboelastography (TEG). We will compare coagulation data to assess potential coagulation changes associated with hemoglobin changes before and after surgery, and related to estimated blood loss.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to assess the coagulation changes that occur in laboring patients undergoing non-elective (intrapartum)Cesarean delivery using thromboelastography (TEG). TEG is a point- of-care device which measures the viscoelastic properties of clot formation. This device can provide rapid and detailed information about coagulation changes in the perioperative period. We will compare coagulation data collected from the study to assess potential coagulation changes associated with Hemoglobin changes before and after surgery, and related to estimated blood loss.</detailed_description>
