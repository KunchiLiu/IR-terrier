	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Study of Isavuconazole and Tacrolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive a single dose of tacrolimus on Day 1 followed by a 15 day wash-out period (time from tacrolimus dosing to isavuconazole dosing). On Days 16 and 17, isavuconazole will be dosed three times daily (TID). TID doses will be administered 8 hours apart. On Days 18 through 28 isavuconazole will be administered once daily (QD). All subjects will be administered a single dose of tacrolimus on Day 20. A follow up visit will occur approximately 7 days after the last dose of isavuconazole. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics will be collected throughout the study.</detailed_description>
