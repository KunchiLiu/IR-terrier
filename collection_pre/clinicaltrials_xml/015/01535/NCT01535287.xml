	<brief_summary>The investigators are inviting your child to participate in this research study because your child is having myringotomy (putting a tiny incision in the eardrum with or without tube insertion) under general anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single injection of Dexmedetomidine (study medication) decreases the frequency of awaking from anesthesia frightened or agitated in children having myringotomy surgery as compared to those children who receive placebo (sterile saltwater).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Intramuscular Dexmedetomidine on Emergence Agitation in Children Undergoing With or Without Tube Insertion Under General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence agitation (EA) is common in children, especially in the preschool age group who undergo general anesthesia. It has been described as a mental disturbance during the recovery from general anesthesia and can consist of hallucinations, delusions and confusion in the child. To the parent or caregivers this may be seen as moaning, restlessness, involuntary physical activity &amp; thrashing about in bed. Emergence agitation (EA) can result in the child losing their intravenous therapy (IV) access &amp; bodily injury. Some agitated children may retain vivid memories about their negative experience waking up from anesthesia. This can result in seeing new behaviors by the child such as anxiety, nighttime crying and temper tantrums. Dexmedetomidine given as an injection into the muscle of children is considered investigational, which means it hasn't been approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of this problem in children. Immediately following surgery measurements of eye contact, purposeful actions, aware of surroundings, restless and crying are observed and recorded using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale in PACU. Follow-up is made approximately 3 days after surgery by phone call or/and email with parent(s) to see if child has experienced any of the following: sleep disturbances, anxiety, eating disturbances, postoperative muscle pain or swelling at the injection site.</detailed_description>
