	<brief_summary>This will be a stepped wedge randomized trial design to evaluate the implementation of cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) screening and preemptive anti-fungal therapy of HIV-infected persons entering antiretroviral therapy (ART) outpatient treatment in Uganda. Those who are ART eligible with a CD4≤100 cells/mcL will have a serum/plasma CRAG performed by lateral flow assay. Those who are CRAG-positive and asymptomatic will be treated with high dose fluconazole. After 6 months survival with retention-in-care will be compared between those who are CRAG+ and CRAG negative</brief_summary>
