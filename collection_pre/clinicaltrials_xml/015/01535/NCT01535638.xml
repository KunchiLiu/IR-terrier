	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of three trial formulations of BI 207127, the trial formulation 2 (TFII), the final formulation (FF), and a FF modified formulation. All formulations are supplied as film-coated Tablets and administered as single dose treatments of BI 207127 (3 film-coated Tablets) in healthy volunteers, with the aim to compare the bioavailability of the three formulations. All treatments will be applied fed, 30 minutes after start of the intake of a standard normal breakfast.</brief_summary>
