	<brief_summary>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as concussion, occurs commonly in sport. Despite ongoing research, there is no highly sensitive clinical test for cognitive function. This makes the clinical diagnosis of concussion particularly difficult as the clinical presentation of concussion is highly variable with symptoms often evolving over time. Given the variability in concussion presentations, there is no single test that can diagnose a concussion. Current recommendations are that sports medicine providers apply a multifaceted concussion assessment battery that combines subjective symptoms, motor control and cognitive assessment. This investigation is designed to evaluate the clinical utility of ElMindA's BNA scores in detecting and managing concussive injuries. This study will establish the reliability of BNAâ„¢ scores over clinically relevant assessment intervals and investigate the effect of SRC and sub-concussive head impacts on BNA scores.</brief_summary>
