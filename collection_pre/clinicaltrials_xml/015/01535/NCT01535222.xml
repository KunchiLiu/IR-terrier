	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that periprocedural infusion of escalating doses of MDCO-2010 is safe and tolerated in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery, to characterize the single dose pharmacokinetics of MDCO-2010, to investigate the effect of MDCO-2010 on pharmacodynamics (biomarkers of fibrinolysis and coagulation parameters), and to investigate the effect on exploratory clinical endpoints of bleeding, transfusion requirements and reexploration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of MDCO-2010 in Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol describes a study of the investigational drug MDCO-2010 as a haemostasis modulator in patients undergoing elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery involving a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Perioperative bleeding is a serious complication that adversely affects the morbidity and mortality of cardiac surgery. To alleviate this complication, prophylactic antifibrinolytic therapies are now widely accepted as a strategy to inhibit excessive fibrinolysis. MDCO-2010, a synthetic small molecule, is a direct inhibitor of plasmin and plasma kallikrein. Both of these have been implicated with impaired haemostasis. In addition, potent inhibition of coagulation factors Xa, XIa and activated Protein C has been demonstrated. Thus, MDCO-2010 has the potential to mitigate excessive fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery involving a cardiopulmonary bypass. In particular the latter is supposed to provide additional benefits beyond reducing transfusion requirements.</detailed_description>
