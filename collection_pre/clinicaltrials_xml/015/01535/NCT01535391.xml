	<brief_summary>This study is an open-label, multicentric, phase IIIb study of NILOTINIB administered orally twice daily for 24 months and indefinitely if it is in the interest of the patient. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of nilotinib, 300 mg twice daily with dose increase to 400 mg twice daily in case of suboptimal response or failure (excluding patients who will fail for progression to ABP), in a population of patients with Ph-positive, BCR-ABL positive CML in early CP.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, multicentric, phase IIIb study of NILOTINIB administered orally at the dose of 300 mg twice daily (total daily dose 600 mg daily) for 24 months (study core), and indefinitely if it is in the interest of the patient (the drug will be given free-of-charge after 24 months to all those patients achieving the CMR4 at 24 months and in absence of safety concerns). Nilotinib dose is increased to 400 mg BID in case of suboptimal response or failure (with the exception of patients who will fail for progression to ABP: in case of progression to ABP, the patient will not be treated with study drug and the choice of the treatment will be up to the physician). Study duration is estimated in 6 years, 1 year of estimated enrollment, 2 years therapy duration. Thereafter, information on course and survival is due for other 3 years. The main data analysis will be performed when all patients will complete 24 months of treatment (or discontinued earlier). Safety and tolerability profile will be assessed by collecting hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events, laboratory examinations and ECG data. The molecular response will be assessed using the GIMEMA standardized molecular laboratories (Labnet network).</detailed_description>
