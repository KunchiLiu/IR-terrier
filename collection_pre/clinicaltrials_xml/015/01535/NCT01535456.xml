	<brief_title>FLT-PET Imaging for MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objectives 1. To evaluate if FLT-PET uptake shows variation during the treatment course in subjects with MDS being treated with 5-azacitidine therapy Secondary objectives 2. To assess FLT-PET uptake heterogeneity within given subjects being treated with 5-azacitidine therapy 3. To generate preliminary data regarding correlation between FLT-PET imaging parameters and clinical responses based on bone marrow aspirate/biopsy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subjects with previously untreated, Intermediate2 or High risk myelodysplastic syndrome are eligible. These patients have an international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) score of 1.5 to 3.5 based on bone marrow blast percentage, karyotype, and the number of cytopenias 26. Subjects will receive the standard FDAapproved dose and schedule of 5azacitidine. This dose is 75mg/m2 SQ or IV daily for seven days with cycles repeated every 28 days The subject's treating physician must have an initial intent of treating with at least four cycles of therapy Subjects must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Subjects must not have been treated with chemotherapy or radiation for another malignancy within the preceding 6 months Subjects must be &gt; 18 years of age Subjects must have a serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL and/or calculated GHF 50 ml/min/1.73m (MRDR formula) or greater Subjects must have a serum direct bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL unless related to Gilbert's syndrome of hemolysis. Alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), and SGPT (ALT) must be less than 4 x upper limit of normal Women must not be pregnant nor breastfeeding Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to use an accepted and effective method of contraception Subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding Subjects for whom a therapy other than 5azacitidine is recommended as first line treatment. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with a suitable donor, lack of comorbidities, and good performance status</criteria>
