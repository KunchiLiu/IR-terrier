	<brief_summary>This protocol is a phase I study. Patients may be eligible for an infusion of Multi-virus Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) if they received a T-cell depleted (TCD) transplant from a related family member or an unrelated donor. Recipients of these types of transplants are severely immune compromised during the early post-transplant period and are more susceptible to certain viruses. The investigators hypothesize that the adoptive transfer of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) against certain viruses: Adenovirus, Cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr Virus (Ad, CMV, and EBV) will be safe with regard to producing graft versus host disease (GVHD) or other infusion related toxicities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Multi-virus Cytotoxic T-cells Following T-Cell Depleted Allogeneic HPCT for Prophylaxis Against Epstein Barr Virus, Adenovirus, And Cytomegalovirus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within this clinical trial, the investigators will test the hypotheses that the administration of CTLs for prophylaxis against Ad, CMV and EBV in recipients of TCD-HPCT will be safe and well tolerated. Graded doses of Multi-Virus CTL will be administered to recipients of genotypically haploidentical or mismatched unrelated TCD grafts.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient age &lt; 22 years. Both genders and all races are eligible. The patient population chosen for the Tcell depleted allogeneic HPCT from a related or unrelated allogeneic donor must meet eligibility based on institutional SOPs and/or the IRB approved T cell depleted allogeneic HPCT protocol which they are enrolled. Must be willing to sign a written informed consent. Patient Organ Status at the time of enrollment (pretransplant) Lansky or Karnofsky score &gt; 50 Echocardiogram shortening fraction &gt; 27% Renal function: serum creatinine &lt; 2 x normal for age DLCO &gt; 50% predicted in patients old enough to comply with PFTs or no baseline oxygen requirement for younger patients. Hepatic: AST, ALT &lt; 5x upper limit of normal; bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl Sexually active patients must be willing to utilize one of the more effective birth control methods for 6 months following CTL infusion. The male partner should use a condom. Patients must be between 28 and 100 days post Tcell depleted allogeneic HPCT Patients must meet the following criteria (within 72 hours of CTL infusion): Achieved primary engraftment with an ANC of at least 1000 per Î¼l for 3 consecutive days. No oxygen requirement with oxygen saturations &gt; 90%. AST, ALT &lt; 5x upper limit of normal for age; bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl. Hemoglobin &gt; 8 gm/dl prior to infusion. (May be transfusion dependent). Renal function: serum creatinine &lt; 2 x normal for age. The Patient must not have the following conditions on the day of CTL infusion: Exhibit overt hematologic manifestations of relapse or persistent disease. Evidence of recurrent/persistent disease based primarily on flow cytometry, cytogenetics, chimerism analysis, or other molecular studies does not by itself represent grounds for exclusion. Currently enrolled on another Phase I clinical trial. Pregnant or nursing Overt hematologic manifestations of relapse or persistent disease Having &gt; grade 1 graftversushost disease.</criteria>
