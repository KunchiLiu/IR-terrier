	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of bendamustine hydrochloride when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug, combination chemotherapy, may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Bendamustine in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the toxicity and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combined bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. To determine the overall response rate of bendamustine and gemcitabine in patients with relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether therapy with bendamustine in the setting of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma will impact future stem cell collection. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bendamustine hydrochloride followed by a phase II study. Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
