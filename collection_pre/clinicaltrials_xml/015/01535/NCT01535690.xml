	<brief_summary>Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a method of microbial reduction which can benefit periodontal treatment in areas of difficult access, such as deep pockets and furcations. The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of PDT as an adjunct to full-mouth ultrasonic debridement in the treatment of severe chronic periodontitis. Methods: Twenty-two patients with at least one pocket with probing depth (PD) ≥ 7 mm and one pocket with PD ≥ 5 mm and bleeding on probing (BOP) on each side of the mouth were included, characterizing a split mouth design. The control group underwent full-mouth ultrasonic debridement and test group received the same treatment associated with PDT. The following clinical parameters were evaluated: plaque index, gingival index, BOP, gingival recession (GR), PD, and clinical attachment level (CAL). All parameters were collected before, 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study was a randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial, which used a split-mouth design. Prior to commencement, the study design was approved by the Ethics Committee of Bahiana School of Medicine and Public Health (12/2008). All patients were informed individually about the nature of the proposed treatment, and informed consent forms were signed.</detailed_description>
