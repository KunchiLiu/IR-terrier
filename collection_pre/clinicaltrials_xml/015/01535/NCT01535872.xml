	<brief_title>Study of Dehydroepiandrosterone Treatment for Poor Responders in In Vitro Fertilization Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poor responders to IVF treatment occurs in 5-24% of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles, resulting in the cancellation of the cycle translating in very low pregnancy rate. Current interventions based upon the use of different stimulation regimen do not address the fundamental underlying physiological basis of follicular recruitment and development. The over-riding objective of this proposal is to devise novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment of poor responders of IVF treatment through dietary supplementation with Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The investigators hypothesise that DHEA supplementation leads to improvements in ovarian steroidogenesis in poor responders, leading to improved IVF outcome. Specifically, the investigators aim to 1. Conduct a prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of DHEA supplementation in women who are poor responders to IVF treatment. 2. Investigate the effects of DHEA supplementation on ovarian steroidogenesis and biochemical and ultrasonographic markers of ovarian reserves.</detailed_description>
