	<brief_summary>Youth with mental illnesses are disproportionately represented in juvenile correctional facilities and limited evidence exists about effective treatments in this setting. This study will adapt Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), a treatment found to be efficacious in community settings, to the correctional setting and study the feasibility of its implementation. Conducted within Texas youth correctional facilities, the findings will be rapidly disseminated in the state. The goal is to enhance the TF-CBT approach to meet the unique needs of incarcerated youth and the correctional system, one of the priorities outlined in the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan.</brief_summary>
