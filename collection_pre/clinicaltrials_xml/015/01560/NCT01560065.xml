	<brief_summary>Myo-Inositol (MI) is a precursors for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates (PIPs). In male reproduction, it was shown that MI concentration in the seminiferous tubules is higher than in serum and it was increasing during the movement through the epididymis and the deferent duct. In the present study, the role of myo-inositol has been investigated as a possible antioxidant agent for the systemic treatment of male infertility and the improvement of the sperm's quality. Samples of seminal fluid were obtained from two groups of patients undergoing to a IVF cycle: healthy subjects and subjects with oligoasthenospermia (OA, &lt; 15 mil/ml). The collected samples were submitted to optic microscopy in order to evaluate semen's volume, spermatozoa's number and motility, during the initial semen analysis and after density gradient separation method; these parameters were evaluated before and after the administration of 4000mg/die of myo-inositol associated to 400 Âµg of folic acid for three months. These values were compared with samples of seminal fluid of healthy patients undergoing to a IVF cycle for a female cause of infertility (control group).</brief_summary>
