	<brief_summary>A prospective, open, randomized trial, in which the investigators aim to achieve optimal immunosuppression after renal renal transplantation with maximal reduction of side effects, especially of vascular injury, chronic allograft nephropathy, osteoporosis and malignancies. Immunosuppression without steroids and CNI minimization is compared to standard immunosuppression, consisting of tacrolimus OD, mycophenolic acid and corticosteroids.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before transplantation 300 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 in three groups. Group 1 will be treated with basiliximab induction and a three day course of steroids followed by a steroid free maintenance regimen consisting of standard-dose tacrolimus OD and mycophenolic acid. Group 2 will be treated with Basiliximab induction followed by standard-dose tacrolimus OD, mycophenolic acid and steroids. Group 3 will be treated with basiliximab induction followed by standard-dose tacrolimus OD for six months, whereafter the dose will be reduced plus mycophenolic acid and steroids. The total study period will be 2 years. Primary endpoint will be renal function, proteinuria and microalbuminuria measured 6, 12, and 24 months after transplantation. Renal function will be measured by serum Creatinine, Creatinine clearances and Nankivell GFR (4). Secondary endpoints will be the degree of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and the degree of arteriolar hyalinosis in renal biopsies taken at 12 and 24 months after transplantation. Biopsies will be evaluated according to the Banff '07 Criteria for Renal Allograft Biopsy Interpretation (appendix II). Quantitative morphometric analysis of interstitial fibrous tissue will be performed using the digital image analysis technique. Other secondary endpoints are patient and graft survival, the incidence of allograft rejection, cardiovascular accidents, pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, the number of antihypertensives, lipid profile, the incidence of malignancies, the incidence of infectious complications, the incidence of post transplant diabetes mellitus and the development of osteoporosis.</detailed_description>
