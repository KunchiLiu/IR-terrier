	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double blind, multi-institutional phase II therapeutic study of Indoximod or placebo after the completion of standard of care sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer that is castration resistant (hormone refractory). Patients are randomized to receive either twice daily oral Indoximod or placebo for 6 months beginning the day after the third and final sipuleucel-T infusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Sipuleucel-T and Indoximod for Patients With Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sipuleucel-T will be administered as standard of care. Oral Indoximod/placebo will be self-administered twice daily for 6 months starting after the last infusion of sipuleucel-T. Patients will be treated for a minimum of 12 weeks of Indoximod/placebo before disease progression can be declared and Indoximod/placebo will not be discontinued for increasing prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the absence of symptomatic clinical progression.</detailed_description>
