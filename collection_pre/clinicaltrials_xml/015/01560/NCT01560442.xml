	<brief_summary>The purpose is to study the relation between pupillary diameter measured under scotopic conditions, and the pain thresholds measured at the time of peak and residual effect of methadone/buprenorphine in opiate-dependent patients following a substitution program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pupillometry and Pain Thresholds Patients Substituted by Methadone and Buprenorphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients substituted since at least 3 months shall be included during a regular control visit. Each session shall consist in - check for toxics in urine sample; - measurement of pupil diameter; - measurement of mechanical punctuate pain threshold; - measurement of mechanical bone pain threshold. A first session shall be done at time of residual effect of the opiate. A second session shall be done at time of peak effect of the opiate.</detailed_description>
