	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to ascertain: 1) the rate of smoking cessation obtained using an adaptive treatment algorithm developed in previous clinical trials, in order to calculate cost-effectiveness of the treatment; 2) the relationship between genotype and response to cigarette smoking cessation treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tailored Smoking Cessation Treatment for LIVE FOR LIFEÂ® Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research has shown that the initial response to nicotine patch treatment can be used to decide whether the patch alone is likely to help smokers to quit or whether alternative prescription medications may be needed to achieve smoking abstinence. This study applies the knowledge gained from this previous research to adapt the smoking cessation treatment provided to participants, based on their degree of smoking reduction during the first four weeks of nicotine patch treatment. By demonstrating effectiveness of this algorithm, this study may lead to further dissemination of the adaptive treatment strategy to other health care settings. Additionally, by gathering further information relating genomic markers to outcome, the foundation will be laid for potential practical application of this index in other settings.</detailed_description>
