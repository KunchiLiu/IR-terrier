	<brief_summary>Study design and objective The primary outcome of this prospective cohort study was to identify the endoscopic findings that have diagnostic value for the prediction of NERD (minimal change esophagitis) by using HD endoscopy with i-scan. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in GERD patients with or without minimal change esophagitis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background and aims Majority of patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) were non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). High definition (HD) endoscopy with i-scan could enhance visualization of mucosal and vascular pattern and might identify changes that were invisible at standard endoscopy. This study aimed to evaluate the endoscopic findings that may have diagnostic value for the prediction of NERD by using HD endoscopy with i-scan. Methods Patients with typical GERD symptoms and healthy control without GERD symptoms were included and 2 validated GERD questionnaires were completed. The endoscopist was blinded to the presence of reflux symptoms and distal esophagus was examined using standard white light endoscopy followed by i-scan. Mucosal morphology at squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) observed by i-scan were compared between GERD patients and controls.</detailed_description>
