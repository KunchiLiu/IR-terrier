	<brief_summary>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, Phase 2 Trial Comparing Veliparib Plus Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Versus Placebo Plus Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Previously Untreated Metastatic or Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Conducted in Multiple Centers Comparing Veliparib in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Versus a Placebo in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups. The safety of each treatment group will be assessed by evaluating study drug exposure, adverse events, serious adverse events, all deaths, changes in laboratory determinations and vital sign parameters. Progression -Free Survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1) will be assessed as well as Overall Survival (OS) and the Objective Response Rate (ORR). Study visits will be conducted according to the protocol schedule. Study visits will include physical examination, laboratory blood sample collection, and assessment of vital signs, medical history and urinalysis. 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at protocol specified visits.</detailed_description>

Subject must consent to provide available archived formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sample of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lesion (primary or metastatic) for central review and biomarker analysis. Subject must have no history of brain metastases or evidence of primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors as demonstrated by a baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subject must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 01.
