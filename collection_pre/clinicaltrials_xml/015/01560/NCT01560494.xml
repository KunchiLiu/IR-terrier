	<brief_summary>This study describes the development and validation of a structured training and assessment curriculum (STAC) for a basic laparoscopic procedure. The investigators hypothesized that residents trained using the STAC curriculum would demonstrate superior technical skills in the operating room compared to residents that were trained using a traditional curriculum.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of a Curriculum (STAC) for Technical Skill Acquisition in Minimally Invasive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study was to develop and validate an ex-vivo comprehensive curriculum for a basic laparoscopic procedure. Although simulators have been well validated as tools to teach technical skills, their integration into comprehensive curricula is lacking. Moreover, neither the effect of ex-vivo training on learning curves in the operating room (OR), nor the effect on non-technical proficiency has been investigated. This randomized single-blinded prospective trial allocated 20 surgical trainees to a structured-curriculum (STAC) group or conventional residency training. The STAC curriculum consisted of: case-based learning, proficiency-based virtual reality training, laparoscopic box training, and OR participation. After completion of the intervention, all participants performed 5 sequential laparoscopic cholecystectomies in the OR. The primary outcome measure was the difference in technical performance between the 2 groups during the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Secondary outcome measures included differences with respect to: learning curves in the OR, technical proficiency of each sequential laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and non-technical skills.</detailed_description>
