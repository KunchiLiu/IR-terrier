	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cells Transplantation For Retinitis Pigmentosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective phase II, nonrandomized open-label study of retinitis pigmentosa patients with best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 20/200. Standardized ophthalmic evaluation will be perform at baseline and at weeks 1, 4,12 and 24 (Â±1) following intravitreal injection of 10 x 106 bone marrow stem cells/ 0,1ml . Three measures will be used to evaluate the short-term safety of intravitreal of ABMDSC: 1) severe visual loss, defined as a drop in 15 letters on ETDRS visual acuity scale; 2) decrease in ERG response; 3) decrease in 5 square degrees on visual field; secondary safety outcomes : 1) increase in intra-ocular inflammation defined herein as anterior chamber cells and flare higher than 3+ for more than 1 month after injection according to a classification described elsewhere ; 2) decrease in CMT more than 50um; 3)genesis of abnormal tissues (teratomas) or tumors; 4) qualitative changes in retinal or choroidal perfusion, like macular nonperfusion. Secondary outcome measures will be used to evaluate the short-term efficiency of intravitreal of ABMDSC: 1) improvement in ERG response; 2) increase in visual field: 3) increase in CSMT &gt; 50um and not related to macular edema; 4) increase &gt; 5 letters on BCVA</detailed_description>
