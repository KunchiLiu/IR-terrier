	<brief_summary>Open, multicenter, randomized study is enrolling patients in 3 sites in Czech Republic. Patients with refractory hypertension will be randomized in 1:1 manner either to renal denervation plus optimal medical antihypertensive treatment without spironolactone or to antihypertensive treatment alone including spironolactone if not contraindicated. The primary end-point is change in Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (BP) between baseline and 1 year after randomization evaluated by 24-hours BP monitoring. Expected enrollment is 120 patients. Patients follow-up is planned for 3 years.</brief_summary>
