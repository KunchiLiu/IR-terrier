	<brief_summary>Objective: To determine the preliminary outcome of external over the counter (OTC) povidone iodine (PI) application in the management of chronic and acute blepharitis vs. currently clinically accepted medical regimen, i.e. eyelid hygiene, antibiotic drops, or antibiotic/steroid ointments. Methodology: One hundred adult patients with chronic and acute blepharitis will be enrolled and randomized into four groups. In group one, 25 patients will be instructed to scrub the lid margin of one eye with 5% PI twice daily for 10 days and the other eye with no intervention. In group two, 25 patients will be instructed to scrub the lid margin of one eye with 5% PI and the other eye will receive warm soaked eyelid wash. In group three, 25 patients will be instructed to scrub the lid margin of one eye with 5% PI and the other eye will receive 1 drop of azithromycin ophthalmic solution twice daily for 10 days. In group four, 25 patients will be instructed to scrub the lid margin of one eye with 5% PI and the other eye will receive tobradex ointment applied to the lid margin. Subjective variables assessed included itchiness, foreign body sensation and eyelid edema (grade 0-4). Objective variables assessed included lid margin redness, meibomian gland plugging and presence/absence of collarets (grade 0-4). Cultures of lid margin at the initiation and at the cessation of treatment were obtained.</brief_summary>
