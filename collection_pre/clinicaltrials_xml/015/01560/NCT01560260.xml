	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well linsitinib works in treating younger and adult patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Linsitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Linsitinib in Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the response rate to treatment with OSI-906 (linsitinib) 150mg BIO in patients with advanced wild-type (WT) gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the clinical benefit rate (stable disease [SD] &gt;= 9 months, partial response [PR], or complete response [CR]) in patients with advanced WT GIST treated with OSI-906. II. To determine the response duration, progression free survival, and overall survival in patients with advanced WT GIST treated with OSI-906. III. To determine the tolerability and adverse event profile of OSI-906 in patients with advanced GIST. IV. To explore patterns of protein expression in serum and tumor tissues as predictors of response and progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced WT GIST treated with OSI-906. V. To evaluate the metabolic response to OSI-906 using fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET). VI. To determine if tumor metabolic response correlates with anatomic response and clinical benefit. VII. To measure changes in tumor metabolism by FDG-PET qualitatively and semi-quantitatively with standard uptake value (SUV) and tumor body ratio (TBR) from baseline to first computed tomography (CT)-response evaluation and correlate the findings with size changes as defined by conventional cross-sectional imaging scans. VIII. To investigate correlations between glucose, insulin, and candidate tumor tissue and blood biomarkers with FDG-PET metabolic response. OUTLINE: Patients receive linsitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 12 weeks for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with confirmed genotype of wildtype in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory Patients will be stratified into pediatric and adult cohorts;

ascites, pleural fluid, and lesions seen on PET scan only are not considered measurable White blood cells count &gt;= 2.0 x 10^9/L (being &gt;= 14 days off growth factors) OR Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L (being &gt;= 14 days off growth factors) Platelet count &gt;= 75 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin =&lt;

abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; women of childbearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 7days prior to registration Patients with diabetes mellitus should have controlled disease on oral medications, defined as: no diabetic ketoacidosis (hyperglycemia, ketonuria, pH &lt;
