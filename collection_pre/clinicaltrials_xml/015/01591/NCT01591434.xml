	<brief_summary>Based upon the in-vitro data AQUACEL® Extra™ achieves a 39% increase in absorbency. As such it is anticipated that through improved exudate management a longer wear time will be achieved in the AQUACEL® Extra™ group compared to AQUACEL® in the management of chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers.</brief_summary>
