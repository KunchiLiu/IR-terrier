	<brief_summary>Objective: To compare the incidence of chronic pain at 3 months among adults undergoing craniotomy between those received two different doses of pregabalin and those receiving placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Perioperative Pregabalin for Post-Craniotomy Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: Perioperative pregabalin will reduce the incidence of chronic post-operative pain, and will reduce the opioid consumption, opioid-related side effects, and hospital length of stay compared with placebo in patients undergoing elective craniotomy. Methods: 316 adults (18-65y), ASA I-III, undergoing elective craniotomy will be randomized to receive: 100mg or 150mg pregabalin or placebo once pre-operatively and 50mg or 75mg or placebo twice daily for 14 post-operative days. NRS pain scores, opioid consumption and side effects will be assessed up to 48h, and long-term pain at days 7, 14, 30, and 90. The primary analysis will involve the comparison between the 2 treatment groups together vs. placebo. A stepwise method will be used to evaluate the pairwise comparisons. Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the incidence of chronic post-craniotomy pain at 3 mos. Important secondary outcomes are: neuropathic component of pain at 3 mos., total opioid consumption in the first 24h, and incidence and severity of opioid-related side effects at days 1, 2 and 7.</detailed_description>
