	<brief_summary>This clinical trial investigates relative benefits (clinical effectiveness and quality of life) of two extraction patterns when lower first permanent molars (FPM) are extracted in children: the conventional treatment where current guidance is followed and extraction of the upper FPM is carried out, compared with the intervention where there is no compensation extraction of the upper FPM following extraction of the lower FPM. Study objectives: To determine whether compensating extraction of upper FPMs following loss of lower FPMs in children is of benefit. The particular benefits being investigated are related to the resulting occlusion, patient experience and oral health related quality of life. The follow up will extend over a period of 5 years or until the patient is 14 years of age - whichever is earlier.</brief_summary>
