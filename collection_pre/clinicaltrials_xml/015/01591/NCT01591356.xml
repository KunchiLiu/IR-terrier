	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of siRNA-EphA2-DOPC when given to patients with advanced, recurrent cancer. Researchers also want to learn the highest tolerable dose of this drug that can be given. siRNA-EphA2-DOPC is designed to shut down the activity of a genetic biomarker called EphA2. Biomarkers are found in the blood and tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug. You are being asked to take part in this study because you have advanced cancer that is recurrent (has come back).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study. Up to 5 groups of up to 6 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study. Up to 10 will be enrolled in Part 2. If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of siRNA-EphA2-DOPC you receive will depend on when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of siRNA-EphA2-DOPC is found. If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive siRNA-EphA2-DOPC at the highest dose that was tolerated in Part 1. Study Drug Administration: You will receive siRNA-EphA2-DOPC 2 times a week (Days 1 and 4 of each week) by vein over 120 minutes (+/- 10 minutes). You will be given standard drugs (hydrocortisone, Benadryl [diphenhydramine], Tylenol [acetaminophen], and dexamethasone) to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Cycles in this study are 3 weeks long. Study Visits: On Day 1 of Cycle 1, if you have not already had these procedures done within the last week: - Any updates to your medical history will be recorded, including any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be having. - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are able to become pregnant, this blood and/or urine will be used for a pregnancy test. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing before the study drug dose, 1 time during the dose, at the end of the dose, and 6 times during the 6 hours after the dose. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - If you are in the third dose level in Part 1 of if you are in Part 2, you will have a dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) scan, a diffusion weighted imaging MRI (DWI-MRI) scan, and a fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan to check if the study drug may be able to affect the tumor. On Day 2 of Cycle 1 (24 hours after the first study drug dose), blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing. On Day 3 or 4 of Cycle 1: - You will have a core biopsy at the same site(s) that may have been tested at screening to check the status of the disease. This sample will be compared to the sample collected at screening. - If you are in the third dose level in Part 1 of if you are in Part 2, you will have an FDG-PET scan, DCE-MRI scan, and a DWI-MRI to check the status of the disease and to learn how the drug may be affecting the tumor. On Day 4 of Cycle 1: - Your vital signs and weight will be measured. - You will be asked about any side effects you may be having. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing before and at the end of the study drug dose. On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will be asked about any side effects you may be having. On Days 11 and 18 of Cycle 1: - Your vital signs and weight will be measured. - You will be asked about any side effects you may be having. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons will be drawn for routine tests. Before Cycle 2, if you are in the third dose level in Part 1 of if you are in Part 2, you will have an FDG-PET scan, DCE-MRI scan, and a DWI-MRI to check the status of the disease and to learn how the drug may be affecting the tumor. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, and weight. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and about any side effects you may be having. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - If you are able to become pregnant, blood (about 2 teaspoons) and/or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. On Days 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18 of Cycles 2 and beyond: - Your vital signs and weight will be measured. - You will be asked about any side effects you may be having. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - In Cycle 3 only, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. On Day 1 of every even numbered cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on): You will have a CT scan or x-ray to check the status of the disease. Length of Dosing: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if study drug dosing is delayed for more than 2 weeks, if the disease completely responds, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-dosing visit. End-of-Dosing Visit: After you have finished taking the study drug: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - You will have a CT scan, MRI scan, or x-ray to check the status of the disease. - You will have an ECG. - If you are able to become pregnant, blood (about 2 teaspoons) and/or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. This is an investigational study. siRNA-EphA2-DOPC is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. Up to 40 patients will be enrolled on this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
