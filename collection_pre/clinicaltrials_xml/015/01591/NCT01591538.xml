	<brief_title>Multi-Antibiotic Resistance Carriage in Gut Flora</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence of MDRGN bacteria is blowing worldwide up leading to therapeutical failure in hospitalized patients with severe infections, as well as in outpatients with community-acquired infections such as UTI. Variation in prevalence exists across countries and regions. Travels outside own country of residence, like France, whatever the duration (short or long)or the reason (professional or leisure), are known risk factors for acquiring and disseminating MDRGN bacteria. Digestive carriage of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae could be a source of infection for the host as well as a source of dissemination. Qualitative and quantitative gut colonization by MDRGNB is poorly studied in non-hospitalized people who stayed for a few months out of France. The total amount of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae influences the spread of the dissemination. In our knowledge, no clinical study has been carried out to qualify and quantify gut colonization by MDRGNB in volunteers after staying 4-6 months outside country of residence such as France. A specific microbiological method will be evaluated in this study.</detailed_description>
