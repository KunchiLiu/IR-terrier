	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, treatment response guided study will evaluate the sustained virological response and safety of the triple combination therapy boceprevir, Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) and Copegus (Ribavirin) in previously untreated patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. In the lead-in phase, patients will receive a dual combination therapy of Pegasys and Copegus for 4 weeks. In the following triple combination therapy phase, 800 mg boceprevir, 180 mcg Pegasys and 1000-1200 mg Copegus will be administered for 24, 32 or 44 weeks; the duration depending on the patient's treatment response. The anticipated time on study treatment is up to 48 weeks.</brief_summary>
