	<brief_summary>The purpose of the type II diabetes (T2D) screening study is to improve diabetes care in minority communities by identifying undiagnosed and uncontrolled T2D patients, as well as help patients without a regular primary care physician (PCP) find one within their community. These goals will be achieved first through a glucose measurement. Individuals with a high glucose measurement will be confirmed with a rapid hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c) test. The HgA1c test will tell us about the patients average blood sugar over the past 3 months, which will allow us to immediately diagnose new and uncontrolled type II diabetics. All participants will fill out a survey on healthcare seeking behaviors before glucose testing. All patients who enter the study will receive education on T2D and the value of regularly visiting their PCP, and will be provided a list of PCP currently accepting new patients within a 3 mile radius. Follow-up visits at 4 and 8 months will help us determine the success this community based screening. The investigators hypothesis is that community based screening designed with adequate education and follow-up, and performed by qualified medical professionals will improve diabetes care in minority communities as assessed through hemoglobin A1c levels over 8 months, and in the change in the number patients who visit/obtain their PCP within the study period.</brief_summary>
