	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to study whether paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil has better overall survival than cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil in chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. 436 patients will be recruited into this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Study of Comparing Paclitaxel Plus 5-Fluorouracil Versus Cisplatin Plus 5-Fluorouracil in Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. T2-4N0-1M0-1a,TxN1M0-1a，TxNxM1a （according to AJCC2002） Scheme: Eligible recurrent patients with esophageal cancer will first be stratified by nodal staging (N0 or N1), then randomized to 2 arms at 1:1 ratio. Arm Cisplatin: Chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for 4 cycles. Arm Paclitaxel: Chemoradiotherapy with weekly paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil for 5 weeks followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for 2 cycles.</detailed_description>
