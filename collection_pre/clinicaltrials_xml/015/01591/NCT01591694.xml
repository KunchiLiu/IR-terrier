	<brief_title>National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) Quality Improvement Initiative Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is to request permission to continue federally mandated data collection to examine the clinical outcomes of children at the Family Center at Kennedy Krieger Institute who are enrolled in evidence-based and promising trauma-informed treatments as part of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The purpose of the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative(NCTSNI) Evaluation is to determine the extent to which the NCTSI, through the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), has raised the standard of care and improved access to services for traumatized children. In addition, the evaluation assesses the extent to which the NCTSI has served as a national resource capable of improving children's access to high-quality, trauma-informed mental health services. This data, previously collected and managed by the Category I NCTSN Center at Duke will now be managed by ICF Macro in a data system entitled NICON.</detailed_description>
