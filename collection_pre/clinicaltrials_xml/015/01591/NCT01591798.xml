	<brief_summary>After introducing minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery has been increasingly used in colorectal cancer. However, there is a few prospective study for robotic surgery. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of robotic surgery in mid or low rectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Robotic Surgery for Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed as randomized phase II trial (laparoscopic versus robotic). The primary end point is quality of mesorectal excision.</detailed_description>
