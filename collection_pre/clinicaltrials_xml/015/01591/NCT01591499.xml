	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-centre, randomised, single-blind, cross-over study to compare the BIOFINITY® MULTIFOCAL lens and respectively the AIR OPTIX® AQUA MULTIFOCAL lens (lenses allocated on a ratio of 1/0.5) and the PUREVISION® MULTIFOCAL lens (lenses allocated on a ratio of 1/0.5), in presbyopic patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-centre, randomised, single-blind, cross-over study to compare the BIOFINITY® MULTIFOCAL lens and respectively the AIR OPTIX® AQUA MULTIFOCAL lens (lenses allocated on a ratio of 1/0.5) and the PUREVISION® MULTIFOCAL lens (lenses allocated on a ratio of 1/0.5), in presbyopic patients. Each subject will have 5 visits with the investigator: - (V1) An inclusion visit during which the first pair of lenses are fitted; - (V2) An optimization visit after 7 to 9 days of wearing the first lens; - (V3) An evaluation visit after an additional 10 to 15 days of wearing the first lens (17 to 24 days) and at which time the second pair of lenses are fitted; - (V4, V5) Visits are conducted as in V 2 and V3 with the second pair of lenses.</detailed_description>
