	<brief_title>Proactive Treatment of Tacrolimus Ointment for Adult Facial Seborrheic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD) is a common chronic papulosquamous dermatosis, affecting 2% to 10% of the adult population, mainly those between the ages of 20 and 50 years with a male bias. The affected skin appears erythematous and oedematous, covered with yellow-brown scales, and is often accompanied by pruritus. It typically affects areas containing sebaceous glands, particularly the scalp, ears, face, chest, and intertriginous areas. SD has a chronic course, and relapse is common. Therefore, therapy is directed toward reducing the symptoms or aggravating factors of SD, such as loosening and removal of scales and crusts, inhibition of yeast colonization, control of secondary infection, and reduction of erythema and pruritus. Standard topical treatments for SD include corticosteroids and anti-mycotic medications. However, the chronic use of topical corticosteroids particularly on the face could result in undesirable outcomes, such as telangiectasia, atrophy, striae, peri-oral dermatitis, or tachyphylaxis, and early relapse after discontinuation of treatment. SD relapse prevention strategies have not yet been established, so the investigators suspected that intermittent use of tacrolimus ointment can be effective in preventing SD relapse.</detailed_description>
