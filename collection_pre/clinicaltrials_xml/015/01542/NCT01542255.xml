	<brief_summary>SUMMARY: Metronomic Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma: A Phase II Study of Low Dose Vinblastine, Cyclophosphamide, and Dacarbazine. Patients with measurable metastatic melanoma are eligible. All patients will be treated as outlined below with combined vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, and dacarbazine. Patients will be treated continuously, until evidence of progression of disease, or for up to two cycles following disappearance of all disease. A cycle will be defined as three weeks of continuous therapy with a one week rest.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low dose continuous chemotherapy, called metronomic chemotherapy, is designed to target vascular cells and inhibit tumor growth and metastasises. A recent study in a melanoma mouse model has identified low dose vinblastine, cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as a treatment which improves the animal's survival and is superior to full dose dacarbazine alone. This clinical trial seeks to translate this laboratory model directly into metastatic melanoma patients.</detailed_description>
