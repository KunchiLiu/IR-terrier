	<brief_summary>Induction chemotherapy is regarded as an effective way to reduce or downgrade the locally advanced or aggressive cancers, and to improve the chance of eradication of the locoregional lesions by radical surgery and/or radiotherapy. However, there are still debates on the clinical value of induction chemotherapy for patients with advanced and resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma. The hypothesis of this study is that the induction chemotherapy of TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil) protocol could benefit the patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma. The endpoints of this study are the survival rate, local control, and safety.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint of this study is the survival rate (2, 3, 5 years) after induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy. The second endpoint of this study is locoregional control rates (1, 2 years), and the safety.</detailed_description>
