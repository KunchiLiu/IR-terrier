	<brief_summary>This new model to manage patient expectations was developed based on our international study conducted in four countries. The model is designed to address the main issues that lie at the core of initiatives to manage patient expectations and improve patient satisfaction. It is a structured interventional set of activities, which gives the clinician an opportunity to meet patient expectations and needs and thereby, improve patient satisfaction. The interventional model comprise teachable-learnable communicative steps occurring between the clinician and the patient which are: Gather information on the patient's expectations and perception of the hospitalization, Respond, Provide relevant information and Document the intervention. The intervention includes all frontline care givers; however, most of the activities will be done by the nursing staff. The set of activities will be executed by the nurses at three separate periods of time during the patient's hospitalization: time of admission, intermediate time and at time of discharge. The study is based on the hypothesis that a structured interventional model will significantly improve patient satisfaction during hospitalization.</brief_summary>
