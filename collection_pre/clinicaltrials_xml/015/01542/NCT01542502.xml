	<criteria>Symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure Recent Imaging Study (&lt;12 months) showing Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &gt;50% and Left Ventricular End Diastolic Volume Index (LVEDVI) &lt;97ml/m2 Evidence of abnormal Left Ventricular (LV) relaxation, filling, diastolic distensibility, and diastolic stiffness as shown by one of the following: 1. Invasive Hemodynamic measurements mean Pulmonary Capillary Wedge pressure (mPCW) &gt;12 Left Ventricular End Diastolic Pressure (LVEDP) &gt;16 mmHg 2. Tissue Doppler Echocardiogram E/E' &gt;15 E/E' 815 and one of the following Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) Atrial Fibrillation Left Atrial Enlargement E/A &lt;0.5 + Deceleration Time (DT) &gt;280 (if &gt;50yrs of age) 3. Biomarkers Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) &gt;200pg/mL Age &lt;18 Recent changes (previous 3 months) in HF maintenance medications (betablockers, angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, vasodilators, cardiac glycosides, diuretics) Hospitalization for worsening Heart Failure (HF) or acute decompensated HF within the previous 12months Anticipated need for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or automatedimplantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) Angina or electrocardiograph (ECG) changes that limit maximum exertion during cardiopulmonary exercise testing Active infection including chronic infection Active cancer Recent (&lt;14 days) use of antiinflammatory drugs (not including NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs [NSAIDs]), Chronic inflammatory disorder (including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), malignancy, or any comorbidity limiting survival or ability to complete the study Pregnancy (determined by urine pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential) Inability to give informed consent Other conditions limiting completion of cardiopulmonary exercise test or completion of the study</criteria>
