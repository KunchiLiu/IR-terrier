	<brief_summary>The PRIMACY trial seeks to assess whether a strategy of delayed stent implantation combined with adjunctive anticoagulation is superior to immediate stent implantation at improving cardiovascular outcomes in patients with mechanically reperfused ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). The investigators hypothesize that delayed stent implantation combined with systemic anticoagulation and maximal antiplatelet therapy will reduce the combined occurrence of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and target vessel revascularization at 90 days.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age between 18 and 80 years; 2. STEMI, presenting within 12 hours of symptoms onset, and persisting for more than 20 minutes; 3. ECG that fulfills any of the following criteria: ≥ 2 mm ST elevation in two anterior or lateral leads; or ≥ 1 mm ST elevation in two inferior leads; or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) with at least 1 mm concordant ST elevation; 4. Infarctrelated artery with TIMI flow 0 or 1 at baseline angiogram; 5. Successful reperfusion (TIMI 23 flow), either spontaneously or after wire passage, thrombectomy, small size (≤ 2.0mm) angioplasty catheter, and persisting for more than 10 minutes; 6. Infarct related artery with a diameter above 2.5 mm. 1. Prior STEMI in the qualifying coronary artery; 2. Coronary dissection following reperfusion; 3. STEMI caused by acute stent thrombosis or a venous or arterial bypass graft occlusion; 4. Significant left main disease, as determined by angiography (≥ 50%) or other imaging technologies; 5. Cardiac condition requiring emergent or urgent surgical repair; 6. Failed thrombolysis and rescue PCI; 7. High risk of bleeding; 8. Contraindication to either ticagrelor or GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors; 9. STEMI with Killip IIIIV or cardiogenic shock or presenting as sudden death, ventricular fibrillation, or sustained ventricular tachycardia; 10. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; 11. Creatinine clearance &lt; 20 ml/min; 12. Other contraindication to PCI; 13. Participation with another investigational drug or investigational device study within 30 days prior to randomization (participation to registries is allowed); 14. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude compliance with the study protocol.</criteria>
