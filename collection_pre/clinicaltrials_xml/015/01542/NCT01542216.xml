	<brief_summary>With the increased success in breast cancer therapies, survivors develop unhealthy changes in body composition, such as muscle loss and fat gains, which lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in survivorship. This study will examine the effects of a nutrition, cardiovascular and strength exercise program compared with a yoga program (representing usual care) on body composition and metabolism in recently diagnosed breast cancer patients. Nutrition and exercise may improve various body composition and metabolic parameters, which may improve quality of life in survivorship, reduce risk of recurrence and reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes in survivorship.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Nutrition and Metabolism in Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the increased success of novel anti-neoplastic therapies, breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy develop unfavourable changes in body composition, including lean tissue loss and fat gains (1,2). These detrimental changes associate with poor quality of life (3,4) and may lead to treatment complications (5,6) during the cancer trajectory. In non-malignant populations, fat gain and muscle loss associate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes (7). Cancer survivors who gain fat and lose lean mass are not only predisposed to these diseases but also have an increased risk of cancer recurrence (3). Proper nutrition as well as exercise can independently improve metabolic profiles (i.e. immune function, lipid and glucose metabolism) and overall health outcomes in non-malignant populations (7-9). While exercise has enhanced quality of life in breast cancer patients (4), overall nutritional needs and the metabolic benefits of exercise are unclear in this patient group. Understanding the effects of nutrition and exercise interventions in breast cancer patients will form the basis for future studies and programs that integrate nutrition, exercise, and metabolism to reduce cancer recurrence and other morbidities in survivorship. This study will examine the effects of nutrition and exercise intervention on body composition and metabolism in recently diagnosed breast cancer patients.</detailed_description>
