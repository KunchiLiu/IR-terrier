	<brief_summary>Patients with stage IIIB and IV lung adenocarcinoma and progression to first-line chemotherapy were enrolled to receive afatinib 40 mg/day. Mutational EGFR and HER-2 status were assessed by RT-PCR. HER2 amplification was evaluated by FISH. Plasma HGF levels were measured by ELISA before and 2 months (mo) after the start of treatment. We assessed changes in serum HGF levels and their association with objective response rate (ORR), PFS and overall survival (OS).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer is the main cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for 1.6 million deaths in 2012. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histology comprises ap-proximately 85% of cases. At the time of diagnosis, 75% of the patients have locally advanced or metastatic disease, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Although treatment options for these patients remain limited, drugs targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have proved to be a highly effective therapy in NSCLC patients harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations. Afatinib, a second-generation irreversible TKI, confers a theoretical advantage over re-versible TKIs in patients with acquired resistance. Through covalent binding to the kinase domain of EGFR, afatinib down regulates signaling from all homodimers and heter-odimers formed by ERBB receptor family members including EGFR, HER2 (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4). HER2 mutations in NSCLC are rare, being found in approximately 1-4% of lung adenocarcinomas. In contrast with reversible TKIs, the mechanisms of resistance to irreversible TKIs have not been fully elucidated, and identification of biomarkers that predict response to these drugs, particularly in patients progressing after first line therapy, is needed. In this study we assess the usefulness of plasma HGF concentrations as a predictor of response to afatinib in patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.</detailed_description>

Patients must have recovered from any toxic effects and should have passed at least 2 weeks after the last dose prior to registration (14 days for vinorelbine and other vinca alkaloids or gemcitabine). Patients in the opinion of the investigator are fully recovered from surgery for 4 weeks at least, can also be considered for the study. Patients must have recovered from any severe toxicity (CTC ≤ 1) caused by any previous therapy. granulocyte count ≥ 1.5x 109 / L and platelet count&gt; 100 × 109 / L. serum bilirubin should be ≤ 1.5 X ULN AST and / or ALT ≤ 2 ULN (or ≤ 5 x ULN when clearly attributable to the presence of liver metastases). Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 (ULN) or creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min Ability to comply with study procedures and monitoring. Of all women of childbearing potential should be obtained a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of therapy. Patients with reproductive potential must use effective contraception. Written informed consent (signed) to participate in the study. Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, grade 4 hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, liver disease, renal or metabolic). Pretreatment with systemic antitumor therapy with EGFR inhibitors (tyrosine kinase inhibitors). Any other malignancy within the previous 5 years (except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or skin cancer adequately treated basal cell type). Excluded patients with brain metastases or spinal cord compression of newly diagnosed and / or have not been definitively treated with surgery and / or radiation, supporting both patients with CNS metastases or spinal cord compression previously diagnosed and treated with evidence of stable disease (clinically stable on imaging studies) for a minimum of 2 months. Any significant ophthalmologic abnormality, especially severe syndrome of dry eye, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Sjogren's syndrome, severe keratitis exposure and any other condition that may increase the risk of corneal epithelial damage. We do not recommend the use of contact lenses during the study. The decision to continue with the use of contact lenses should be discussed with the treating oncologist and the patient's ophthalmologist. Patients unable to take oral medication, requiring intravenous nutrition, which have undergone prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or who have active peptic ulceration. lactating women.</criteria>
