	<brief_summary>The proposed study will compare a well defined and integrated yoga practice (postures/breath control/meditation) to a conventional exercise program in reducing hypertension. The expected outcomes include data on the effects of yoga on ambulatory blood pressure, psychosocial stress, and the autonomic system in individuals with pre- and Stage I hypertension. The information gained in this study will have a positive impact by providing critical preliminary and feasibility data to support a larger multi-ethnic randomized clinical trial on the effects of yoga on individuals with hypertension.</brief_summary>
