	<brief_title>Calcium Intake and Fat Excretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several reports have found inverse associations between calcium intake and body weight. Few intervention studies have shown that a high calcium diet resulted in a greater body weight loss than a low calcium diet. The mechanism is not clear, but one possible explanation is reduced absorption of fat in the gut, due to formation of insoluble calcium fatty acid soaps or binding of bile acids which impairs the formation of micelles. The aim of this study is to examined for an association between habitual calcium intake and fecal energy and fat excretion, concentrations of substrates involved in energy metabolism, blood pressure and body weight</detailed_description>
