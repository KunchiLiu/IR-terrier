	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare effects of preoperative and postoperative use of topical ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% versus placebo in uncomplicated cataract surgery. Patients scheduled to undergo phacoemulsification will be randomized to receive either topical prednisolone acetate 1% 4 times daily (QID) plus dextran 70/hypromellose QID (placebo group) or topical prednisolone 1% QID plus ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% QID (ketorolac group) for three days preoperatively and four weeks postoperatively. The primary outcome 5 weeks after surgery will be angiographic cystoid macular edema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Topical Ketorolac 0,4% Versus Placebo in Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: To compare effects of preoperative and postoperative use of topical ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% versus placebo in uncomplicated cataract surgery. Methods: This will be a masked single-center, randomized clinical study comprising 80 patients undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Patients scheduled to undergo phacoemulsification and with no recognized cystoid macular edema (CME) risks (diabetic retinopathy, retinal vascular disease or macular abnormality) will be randomized to receive either topical prednisolone acetate 1% 4 times daily (QID) plus dextran 70/hypromellose QID (placebo group;n=40) or topical prednisolone 1% QID plus ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% QID (ketorolac group;n=40) for three days preoperatively and four weeks postoperatively. In both groups topical gatifloxacin will be administered to the treated eye QID, starting three days before surgery and continuing for seven days. The primary outcome 5 weeks after surgery will be angiographic cystoid macular edema. Other included outcomes will be best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), CME incidence, retinal thickness as measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).</detailed_description>
