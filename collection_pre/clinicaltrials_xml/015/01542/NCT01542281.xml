	<brief_summary>1. To determine whether a combined nutritional support program and exercise-based prehabilitation is superior to nutritional support alone in increasing functional recovery and reducing post-operative morbidity after surgery for HPB malignancy. 2. To understand which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to prehabilitation interventions and predict change in later outcome measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-habilitation to Improve Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Liver Resection for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for elective liver resection be will be approached andrandomized to one of two groups using a computer generated block randomisation scheme. The first group (pre-hab) will receive both nutritional supplementation and a prehabilitation program as outlined below. The second group (nutrition) will receive only nutritional supplementation. Both groups will be given a post-operative exercise program. Once randomized, the subjects will be called by the research co-ordinator and an appointment will be made for the initial assessment. After the study is explained and consent obtained, subjects will be tested on 6MWT, followed by a 30 minute rest period during which various questionnaires assessing physical activity, quality of life, fatigue and nutritional status will be completed with the aid of the coordinator. The prehabilitation program will last a minimum of four weeks and a maximum of 8 weeks. Surgery will be performed by one of the HPB surgeons at the McGill University Health Center. Surgical approach, including laparoscopic or open surgery will be at the discretion of the surgeon. Perioperative care will follow an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)-based clinical care pathway27, 28, a fast-track care plan including patient education, afferent neural blockade, multimodal analgesia, early oral intake and mobilization, early removal of catheters and drains, and a planned 6-8 day hospital admission. This pathway has already been implemented at the Royal Victoria Hospital as part of standard patient care.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible to enter the prehabilitation program will include those aged 18 and above and referred electively for resection of malignancies. Excluded will be persons with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) health status class 45 or comorbid medical, physical and mental conditions (e.g. dementia, disabling orthopedic and neuromuscular disease, psychosis), cardiac abnormalities, severe endorgan disease such as cardiac failure, COPD, and hepatic failure (ALT and AST &gt;50% over the normal range), and sepsis), morbid obesity (BMI &gt;40), anemia (hematocrit &lt; 30 %) and other conditions interfering with the ability to perform exercise at home or to complete the testing procedures. Patients will be excluded if they have poor English or French comprehension.</criteria>
