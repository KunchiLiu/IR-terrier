	<brief_summary>Degarelix is an approved drug that is used to treat prostate cancer by lowering testosterone levels in the body. Degarelix is commonly given with radiation for prostate cancer, but less frequently with surgery since there has been no proven benefit with this approach. The investigators do not expect the patient to benefit directly from treatment with degarelix since their prostate will be removed shortly after the drug is given. Instead, the investigators hope to learn about how degarelix and other treatment that lowers your testosterone effects prostate cancer cells and use this information to develop better treatments in the future.</brief_summary>
