	<brief_summary>Proper selection of ureteral stent length might help in reducing comorbidities associated with ureteral stenting, currently there is no standardized way of measuring ureteral length. Measurement of ureteral length according to Computed Tomography (CT) scan might provide useful information when selecting the length of a ureteral stent. Our aim in this study is to compare ureteral measurements using CT scan and measurement of actual ureteral length measured during ureteral stenting.</brief_summary>
