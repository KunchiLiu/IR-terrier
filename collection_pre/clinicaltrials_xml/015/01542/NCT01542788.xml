	<brief_summary>This multicenter study was to evaluate subjects with chronic genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection who were interferon (IFN) ineligible, IFN intolerant or unwilling to take IFN. Participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive sofosbuvir (SOF)+ribavirin (RBV), or placebo to match SOF+placebo to match RBV. Randomization was stratified by presence/absence of cirrhosis. Approximately 20% of participants may have had evidence of cirrhosis at screening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sofosbuvir + Ribavirin for 12 Weeks in Subjects With Chronic Genotype 2 or 3 Hepatitis C Infection Who Are Interferon Intolerant, Interferon Ineligible or Unwilling to Take Interferon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants who were randomized to the placebo arm and completed all scheduled study procedures were eligible to receive active SOF+RBV in open-label Study GS-US-334-0109. Participants who do not achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) were eligible for enrollment in the Sequence Registry Study GS-US-248-0123. The purpose of the Sequence Registry Study is to monitor the persistence of resistant mutations for up to 3 years. Participants who achieved SVR were eligible for enrollment in the SVR Registry Study GS-US-248-0122. The purpose of the SVR Registry Study is to evaluate durability of SVR for up to 3 years after treatment.</detailed_description>
