	<brief_summary>A Phase 1 study to compare the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of different dose schedules of subcutaneously (SC) administered dengue vaccine in healthy adults and to compare the immunogenicity of different dose schedules of the vaccine. Blood samples were obtained for safety labs on Days 0, 7, 14, 90, 97, 104 and measurement of viremia at baseline [during the screening period or on day of vaccination (Day 0)], and then on Days 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 21, 90, 97, and 104. Blood samples for measurement of dengue neutralizing antibodies in serum were obtained at baseline [during the screening period or on day of vaccination (Day 0)], then on Days 30, 90 and 120. The entire duration for each individual subjects participation was approximately 5 months including recruitment and collection of data for primary outcomes (through Day 120).</brief_summary>
