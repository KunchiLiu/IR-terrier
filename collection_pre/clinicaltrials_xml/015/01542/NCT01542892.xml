	<brief_summary>Several trials have found that nutritional supplementation can elicit an increased rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis following a single bout of exercise in both young and older individuals. However, there have been no studies that have investigated if nutritional supplementation and exercise can cause a sustained increase in physical functioning and fat free mass, particularly in older adults with functional limitations. This study will compare the effects of a nutritional supplement versus a placebo on exercise training induced changes in physical functioning older adults who are at risk for mobility disability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Nutritional Supplementation on Physical-activity Mediated Changes in Physical Functioning Older Adults at Risk for Mobility Disability (The VIVE2 Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise Intervention: Participants will complete exercise sessions 3 times per week for 6 months. The exercise sessions will involve walking, lower extremity strength exercises, flexibility, and balance training. Supplement Intervention: Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the nutritional supplement or placebo. The participants will consume on beverage immediately after each exercise session. Primary Outcome: The primary outcome will be the time to walk 400 meters, expressed as average gait speed during the 400 M walk. All participants must be able to walk 400 meters in &lt;15 minutes at walking at their normal speed. The 400 M walk will be assessed at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months, with the changes at 6-months being the primary outcome. Secondary Outcome Measures: - Stair Climb Test - Body Composition - Skeletal muscle cross sectional area - Isokinetic/Isometric peak torque/power - Hand-grip strength - Nutritional status - Quality of Life/Depressive symptoms Expected enrollment: 150 (80 at Tufts University (Boston, MA, USA), 70 at University of Uppsala (Uppsala, Sweden))</detailed_description>
