	<brief_summary>Liraglutide is a glucagon like peptide -1 (GLP-1) agonist, which is approved for use in patients with type 2 diabetes. Studies of liraglutide have shown an appetite suppressive effect and has been associated with weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide use in the treatment of PWS is limited to one case report by Cyganek et el (See attached Citation). In this case report, the subject showed improvements in hemoglobin A1c and body weight over 14 weeks. The investigators plan to examine the use of liraglutide in a single subject with Prader Willi Syndrome and type 2 diabetes for one year. The investigators will examine clinical parameters, clinical assessment of hunger, and biochemical markers of diabetes and lipid control.</brief_summary>
