	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance With Gadoxetic Acid for the Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients With Liver Cirrhosis. Evaluation of Its Impact for the Non-invasive Diagnosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to define the imaging patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients when studied with gadoxetic acid magnetic resonance imaging including the dynamic phase and the hepatobiliary phase at 10 and 20 minutes after contrast injection and to evaluate the usefulness of liver magnetic resonance imaging with gadoxetic acid in the differentiation between benign and malignant nodules in the cirrhotic liver. To determine the diagnosis and clinical significance of the infracentimetric additional nodules detected in the hepatobiliary phase</detailed_description>
