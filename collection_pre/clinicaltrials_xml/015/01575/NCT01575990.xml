	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to explore ways to improve appropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in the elderly by attempting to target screening in those most likely to benefit and avoiding screening in those least likely to benefit.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial at the patient level to determine the efficacy of a colorectal cancer screening decision support intervention for patients ages 70 to 84 within a clinical setting. The investigators hypothesize that the use of the intervention will prepare patients for individualized decision making with their providers and result in an improvement in appropriate CRC screening decisions and screening outcomes. To assess appropriate CRC screening decisions and screening, the investigators will use a classification scheme derived from the literature based on age and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Using this scheme, appropriate screening will include screening for those in the best health because they are likely to benefit, no screening for those in the worst health because they are unlikely to benefit, and evidence of a discussion about CRC screening for those in the intermediate health group because the benefit is unclear.</detailed_description>
