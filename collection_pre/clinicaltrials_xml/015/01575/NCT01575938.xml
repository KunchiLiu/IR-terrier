	<brief_title>HIV Prevention Intervention for Young Transgender Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a uniquely targeted HIV risk reduction intervention for young transgender women (YTW), ages 16 to 29, at risk for HIV acquisition or transmission. The study will test this intervention in a three-arm randomized controlled trial in two major U.S. cities with excellent access to and research experience with the population (Chicago, Boston). We will enroll at risk YTW, ages 16-29; two-fifths of the sample randomized to the intervention will participate in the 6-session group-based and manualized Life Skills intervention; two-fifths will be randomized to the standard-of-care (SOC) control condition; and one-fifth will be randomized to the time-matched attention control condition and receive standard health promotion information in a group-based multi-session format. All three arms will receive HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) (Chlamydia and gonorrhea) testing and pre-posttest risk reduction counseling (i.e., SOC). Sexual risk will be assessed at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months post-intervention Our specific aims are: 1) to determine the efficacy of the Life Skills intervention in comparison to a SOC arm and a time-matched attention control on the primary outcome: number of unprotected anal sex acts (UAS) (in the previous four months) among YTW, ages 16-29; and 2) to examine the degree to which improvements in sexual risk taking are mediated by the conceptual mediators of the intervention: transgender adaptation and integration, collective self-esteem/empowerment, information (HIV knowledge), motivation (attitudes, norms, and intentions for safer sex), and behavioral skills (discussing sex and condom use with sexual partners, acquiring and using condoms); and to explore whether reductions in sexual risk are associated with epidemiologically-linked moderators of sexual risk behavior: age, race/ethnicity, and psychosocial factors. An additional exploratory aim is to describe the prevalence of HIV and STIs in the community recruited sample; in the SOC arm, we will assess the natural trajectory of sexual risk behavior and the acquisition of HIV and STIs (incidence rate) in YTW over a 12-month follow-up period.</detailed_description>
