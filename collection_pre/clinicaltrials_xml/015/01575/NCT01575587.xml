	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effect of Timing of Food Intake on the Pharmacokinetics of Abiraterone Following Single-Dose Administration of Abiraterone Acetate Tablets in Healthy Caucasian and Japanese Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (individuals will be assigned by chance to study treatments), open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), single dose, 4-way crossover study of abiraterone acetate in approximately 48 healthy adult Japanese and Caucasian men. For the crossover design, the treatment sequences are defined as follows: 1 - ADBC, 2 - BACD, 3 - CBDA, and 4 - DCAB; where Treatment A = abiraterone acetate administered in the fasted state, Treatment B = standardized meal administered 1 hour after abiraterone acetate dose, Treatment C = standardized meal administered 2 hours after abiraterone acetate dose, and Treatment D = standardized meal administered 2 hours before and 2 hours after abiraterone acetate dose. This study will consist of a screening period followed by four open-label treatment periods separated by a washout period of at least 14 days between dosing. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned on Day 1 to 1 of 4 treatment sequences that differ with regard to timing of food intake before and/or after dosing with a single dose of 1000 mg of abiraterone acetate. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) samples will be collected during the open-label treatment phase as detailed in the protocol. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. End-of-study assessments will be performed on Day 4 of Period 4 or upon early withdrawal.</detailed_description>
