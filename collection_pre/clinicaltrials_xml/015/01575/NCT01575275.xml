	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and performance of an investigational agent, known as 5-ALA or Gliolan (aminolevulinic acid), that many be useful to a surgeon for visualizing a tumor during surgery. It is also being studied to determine if there are differences in what Gliolan shows a surgeon compared to intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aminolevulinic Acid in Visualizing a Tumor During Surgery in Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the volume of residual enhancing tumor after a 5-ALA guided resection of a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). II. Determine the volume of tissue removed compared to the measured enhancing tumor evaluated on a pre-operative MRI. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the time to tumor progression. II. Evaluate the overall survival. OUTLINE: Patients receive aminolevulinic acid orally (PO) 2-4 hours before surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a suspected or biopsy proven newly diagnosed GBM, or a recurrent GBM or suspected GBM (in patient with pathologically diagnosed prior World Health Organization [WHO] grade II or III tumor) in a patient undergoing a clinicallyindicated surgery.
