	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect a cohort of patients treated with GLP-1R Agonists and to assess phenotypic, genetic and genomic biomarkers of glycaemic response to these agents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DIabetes REsearCh on Patient sTratification (DIRECT): GLP-1R Agonists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To develop a cohort of patients treated with GLP-1 R Agonists who are phenotyped at baseline and at 6 month follow up to determine clinical, imaging and other biomarker predictors of glycaemic response to GLP-1R Agonists. The hypothesis is that one, or a combination, of these biomarkers is associated with glycaemic response to GLP-1R Agonists. The primary outcome is therefore HbA1c reduction after 6 months of GLP-1R A treatment. This is a cohort study of 800 patients being treated with either exenatide or liraglutide for 6 months, and carried out in 4 UK centres.</detailed_description>
