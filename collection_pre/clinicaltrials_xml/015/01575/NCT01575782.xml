	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIII small cell lung cancer, excluding malignant pleural/pericardial effusion. At least one measurable disease site, defined as lesion of ≥ 1 cm unidimensionally on CTscan WHO performance status 02 Absolute neutrophil count at least 1800/µl and platelets at least 100000/µl and hemoglobin at least 6.2 mmol/l. Adequate renal function: calculated creatinine clearance at least 60 ml/min Adequate hepatic function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the institution; ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the institution (in case of liver metastases ≤ 5 x ULN for the institution) No previous platinum chemotherapy or topoisomeraseinhibitors for SCLC. Lung function: FEV1 at least 30 % and DLCO at least 30 % of the age predicted value No history of prior chest radiotherapy Life expectancy more than 6 months Willing and able to comply with the study prescriptions 18 years or older Not pregnant or breast feeding and willing to take adequate contraceptive measures during the study Ability to give and having given written informed consent before patient registration No mixed pathology, e.g. nonsmall cell plus small cell cancer No recent (&lt; 3 months) severe cardiac disease (NYHA class &gt;1) (congestive heart failure, infarction) No history of cardiac arrythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia) which is symptomatic and requiring treatment (CTC AE 3.0), or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia. Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation controlled on medication is allowed. No cardiac conduction disturbances or medication potentially causing them: QTc interval prolongation with other medications that required discontinuation of the treatment Congenital long QTsyndrome or unexplained sudden death of first degree relative under 40 years of age QT interval &gt; 480 msec (note: when this is the case on screening ECG, the ECG may be repeated twice. If the average QTinterval of these 3 measurements remains below 480 msec, patient is eligible) Patients on medication potentially prolongating the QTinterval are excluded if the QTinterval is &gt; 460 msec (Appendix, table 2). Medication that might cause QTprolongation or Torsades de pointes tachycardia is not allowed (Appendix, Table 1). Drugs with a risk of prolongating the QTinterval that cannot be discontinued are allowed, however, under close monitoring by the treating physician (Appendix, table 2). Complete left bundle branch block No uncontrolled infectious disease No other active malignancy No major surgery (excluding diagnostic procedures like e.g. mediastinoscopy) in previous 4 weeks No treatment with investigational drugs in 4 weeks prior to or during this study No chronic systemic immune therapy No known G6PD deficiency Patients must not have psoriasis or porphyria. No known hypersensitivity to 4aminoquinoline compound. Patients must not have retinal or visual field changes from prior 4aminoquinoline compound use. No known prior hypersensitivity to cisplatin, etoposide or chloroquine or any of their components. The opposite of the above</criteria>
