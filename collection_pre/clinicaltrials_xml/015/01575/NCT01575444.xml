	<brief_summary>This proposal has been developed through collaboration between the University of Minnesota and New American Community Services (NACS), and the research design is based on a needs assessment conducted by the community partner. The investigators will test the hypotheses that women who are offered home vaginal bio-specimen collection will have higher rate of cervical cancer screening completion than that of women referred for clinic-based Pap test. All participants will be given identical education materials on cervical cancer screening and HPV, currently in use by the Minnesota Sage Program.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial will pilot text a protocol for home vaginal bio-specimen collection for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for cervical cancer screening. The main objective is to estimate the successful screening completion rate among a sample of Somali women who have not undergone cervical cancer screening for three or more years. Women will be randomized to either home vaginal bio-specimen collection or referral to undergo a clinic-based Pap test.</detailed_description>
