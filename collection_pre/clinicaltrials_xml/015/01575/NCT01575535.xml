	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies bone marrow samples from women with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0106B Studying Bone Marrow Samples From Women With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Estimate the proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AMLs) that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors. - Explore whether there is an association between the cellular origin of AML (i.e., origination in CD33+ precursors or not) and cytogenetic, molecular, and other patient characteristics. - Explore whether overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), response rate (RR), or relapse rate is improved for patients with AMLs that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors compared to patients with clonally involved cells not detected. OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow samples are analyzed for CD33+ progenitors, X-chromosome inactivation, and somatic mutations (t(8;21), inv(16), FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, KIT) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, long-term culture in hypoxic condition in cytokine-containing liquid media, and flow cytometry. Results are then compared with each patient clinical data.</detailed_description>
