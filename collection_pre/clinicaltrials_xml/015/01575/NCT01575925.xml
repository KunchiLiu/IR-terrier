	<brief_title>Study of Pomalidomide to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety for Patients With Multiple Myeloma and Impaired Renal Function (POM Renal)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to determine the PK and safety for the combination of POM + (LD-DEX) in subjects with RRMM and impaired renal function. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of POM + (LD_DEX) in subjects with RRMM and impaired renal function. This is a 3+3 dose escalation design, with one cohort each for patients with severely impaired renal function patients (CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min) requiring and not requiring dialysis respectively. There will also be one control cohort with normal renal function, these patients will receive 4 mg POM. Dosing will be 21 days out of a 28 day cycle.</detailed_description>
