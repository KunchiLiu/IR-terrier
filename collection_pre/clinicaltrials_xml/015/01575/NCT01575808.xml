	<brief_summary>The utility of GP1101 will be evaluated relative to that of surgical bypass in the treatment of Femoral/Popliteal Arterial Symptomatic Peripheral Arterial Disease. Efficacy will be measured by comparison to a Surgical Bypass Efficacy Goal, and Invasiveness will be measured by comparison to Surgical Bypass data derived from a retrospective study.</brief_summary>

At least 20 years of age. Anklebrachial index (ABI) in the study limb in the noninvasive lower extremity arterial studies within 30 days prior to study procedure or at the time of study procedure is less than or equal to 0.9, or toebrachial index (TBI) is less than or equal to 0.5. Male, infertile female, or female of childbearing potential practicing an acceptable method of birth control with a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study procedure. Projected life expectancy of greater than 2 years. The ability to comply with the study protocol, followup requirements and required testing. Surgical bypass candidate Qualifying lesions by angiography Untreated flowlimiting aortoiliac disease. Any previous stenting or surgery in the target vessel(i.e. femoropopliteal artery). Vascular access/catheterization in the target or contralateral limb within 30 days of study enrollment. Planned surgery or intervention within 30 days after study procedure. Femoral artery or popliteal artery aneurysm &gt; 1.5 X healthy adjacent vessel diameter. Nonatherosclerotic disease resulting in stenosis and/or occlusion (e.g., embolism, Buerger's disease, vasculitis). Severe medical comorbidities (untreated CAD/CHF (Congestive Heart Failure), severe COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), severe dementia, NYHA (New York Heart Association) 3/4, severe hypertension, etc.) Any medical condition that would preclude postprocedural ambulation or completion of study followup. Rutherford 5 patients with active infection.

Rutherford 5 characteristics in nonstudy limb. Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study or nonstudy limb. Active infection that could adversely impact patient outcomes in the study, or any patient with septicemia or bacteremia. Any previously known coagulation disorder, including hypercoagulability. Morbid obesity or operative scarring that precludes percutaneous approach Contraindication to anticoagulation or antiplatelet Known allergies to stent/stentgraft components, including heparin sensitivity, allergy, or previous incidence of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II. Current peritoneal or hemodialysis Participation in another clinical trial (except F/P device clinical trial) up to 3 months prior to study enrollment. Enrollment in a F/P device clinical trial within the last 12 months. Interventional or surgical treatment on arteries distal to the target vessel for this study within the past 12 months. Any other factor identified by the Principal Investigator</criteria>
