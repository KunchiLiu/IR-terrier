	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of manipulative treatment of children with neck and back pain. Because manipulation is the most frequently used treatment of musculoskeletal complaints in children, and an increasing number of Danish children see a chiropractor, it appears obvious to start the search for evidence by examining the effect of this treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manipulative Treatment of Children With Neck and Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parents receive text messages [SMS) on a weekly basis inquiring about the child's musculoskeletal pain as well as amount and types of sport during leisure time the past week. Following a report of pain, the parents will be interviewed by phone by a member of the clinical team, consisting of two licensed physical therapists and two licensed chiropractors, for a thorough description of the complaint. Based on this, the interviewer determines whether the complaint is negligible or whether the child should be seen by a member of the clinical team, in which case the child will be examined at his or her school. At this examination, the child will be evaluated for inclusion and exclusion criteria.</detailed_description>
