	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal Ketalar (ketamine hydrochloride) in the treatment of primary symptom manifestations of pediatric bipolar disorder; Fear of Harm (FOH) phenotype. This phenotype represents those children who are most resistant to traditional treatments and suffer repeated hospitalizations. Primary symptoms include fearfulness, aggression secondary to threat, mood and/or arousal instability, and psychosis. In addition to evaluation of efficacy and safety, the investigators will also analyze whether therapeutic response depends upon the degree to which the subject fits the FOH phenotype.</brief_summary>
