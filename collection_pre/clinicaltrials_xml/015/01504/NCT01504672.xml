	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized controlled study is to investigate if medication reviews performed by a clinical pharmacist as part of a ward team can reduce drug related problems and reduce readmissions to hospital among elderly patients (≥65 years) with dementia and cognitive failure. Four hundred and sixty patients will be recruited and randomized to control (usual care) and intervention group (enhanced service in which a pharmacist is part of the health care team). Six months after the last patient of the 460 has been discharged the study will be closed. Data about the number of readmissions and visits to the emergency room will be collected during the six-month follow-up and also, the costs associated with each visit or admission. Time until institutionalization will be compared between intervention group and control group.</brief_summary>
