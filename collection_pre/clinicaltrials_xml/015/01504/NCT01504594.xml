	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether an autologous stem cell infusion through catheterism is safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy. Process: 1. Primary Evaluation - Clinical History - Echocardiogram to evaluate ejection fraction and other parameters 2. Signing of Informed Consent and clearing doubts 3. Bone Marrow stimulation for 3 consecutive days with G-CSF (Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor) applied subcutaneously 4. On the 4th day, in operation room and under sedation: Bone Marrow Harvest performed by hematologists through posterior iliac crests(amount calculated at 8cc/kg, without exceeding 150ml). 5. Recovery room with family members while the cells are being processed in the Hematology Laboratory. 6. Approximately 3 hours after the 1st procedure, the patient re-enters the operation room, which is equipped for cardiac catheterization, so that cardiologists infuse the stem cells through the femoral artery into the coronary arteries which irrigate the heartÂ´s muscle fibers. 7. Patient goes back to the recovery area until the anesthesia effect is gone and can tolerate oral liquids. 8. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-ups at 6 weeks and 6 months after the procedure.</brief_summary>
