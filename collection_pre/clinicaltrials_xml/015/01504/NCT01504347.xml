	<brief_summary>Section 1: The purpose of the study is to obtain safety and immunogenicity data of different dose levels of a multivalent recombinant OspA Lyme Borreliosis (mv rOspA LB) Vaccine with and without adjuvant in seronegative healthy adults aged 18 to 70 years. The outcome shall provide the basis for dose/formulation selection for Section 2 of the study. Section 2: An additional purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the optimal dose(s)/formulation of the mv rOspA LB Vaccine in a larger population of seronegative and seropositive healthy subjects aged 18 to 70 years.</brief_summary>
