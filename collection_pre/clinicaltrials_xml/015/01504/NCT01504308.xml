	<brief_title>Sonalleve Fibroid Ablation Pivotal Clinical Trial for MR-HIFU of Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine Fibroids are the most common benign tumors in pre- and peri-menopausal women. Fibroids occur in 20-50% of women over 30 years of age, and with increasing size can produce pain, menorrhagia, pressure, bloating and urinary and bowel compression symptoms. Fibroids may also cause infertility. Symptomatic fibroids impact health and well-being of the female including lost work hours and reduced quality of life. Current medical treatments include invasive removal of the fibroid (hysterectomy, myomectomy), drug therapy, or treatments causing necrosis of the fibroid tissue such as ablation (freezing or heating) or embolization. It has been estimated that 600,000 hysterectomies are performed per year in the United States and more than half of the conducted hysterectomies are due to fibroids. For the relief of symptoms, women wishing to preserve the uterus may choose between invasive procedures of myomectomy, Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE), ablation or cryotherapy. The surgically invasive procedures require anesthesia, hospital stays, and long recovery periods. However, High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) shows promising results in relieving fibroid symptoms. This study will confirm the safety and clinical effectiveness of Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU Fibroid Therapy system for ablating symptomatic fibroids.</detailed_description>

Fibroids selected for treatment meeting the following criteria (further extrapolated in the protocol): 1. Total planned ablation volume of all fibroids should not exceed 250 ml and 2. No more than 5 fibroids should be planned for ablation and 3. Dominant fibroid (diameter) is greater than or equal to 3 cm and 4. Completely nonenhancing fibroids should not be treated as the identification of treated volume becomes ambiguous Patient's selfassessment indicates that she has had episodes of heavy menstrual bleeding in the past 6 months.
