	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare three different techniques in ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Namely, the Medtronic multi-electrode phased radiofrequency ablation system, the Biosense Webster irrigated multi-electrode phased radiofrequency ablation system, and minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgical ablation. The study hypothesis is that surgical and Biosense Webster ablation are non-inferior to Medtronic ablation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Atrial Ablation of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation With Implantable Loop Recorder Follow Up Study: The LAAPITUP 2 Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A target of 75 participants will be randomised 1:1:1 to one of the three treatment arms. Each participant will have an implantable loop recorder (ILR) prior to ablation in order to assess AF burden. After ablation, each participant will be followed up for a year. The ILR will be used to assess reduction in AF burden.</detailed_description>
