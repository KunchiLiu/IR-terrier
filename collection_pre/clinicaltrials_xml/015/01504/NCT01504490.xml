	<brief_summary>This study is for patients with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of a new combination of drugs, CS-7017 and Bexarotene in patients with advanced cancer. CS-7017 and Bexarotene both have many effects on cancer cells, including stopping cancer cells from growing and dividing, and causing the cancer cells to die. CS-7017 and Bexarotene work on cancer cells in a similar manner and both drugs together may have an even greater effect against cancer cells, hopefully, increasing the killing of cancer cells. CS-7017 is an investigational or experimental anti-cancer agent that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in any type of cancer. Bexarotene is an anti-cancer agent that has been approved by the FDA for patients with a specific type of cancer, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This study will help find out what effects the combination of drugs, CS-7017 and Bexarotene, has on cancer. This research is being done because it is not known if CS-7017 is safe to be given with Bexarotene.</brief_summary>
