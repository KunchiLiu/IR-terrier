	<brief_summary>Cataract surgery is known to cause loss of corneal endothelial cells. In adults, it is reported that anywhere between 2 to 15% loss of corneal endothelial cell density occurs following cataract surgery. However, no data is available regarding endothelial changes after cataract surgery with IOL implantation in pediatric eyes. The aim of this study is to prospectively observe changes in endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation and hexagonality following cataract surgery with IOL implantation in pediatric eyes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eyes undergoing pediatric cataract surgery with IOL implantation at Iladevi Cataract &amp; IOL Research Center, Ahmedabad, India. Children older than 4 years undergoing cataract surgery with IOL implantation were included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: eyes with traumatic or subluxated cataract and inability to get preoperative specular. Intraoperatively, sulcus fixated IOLs, and eyes with no IOL implantation were excluded.</criteria>
