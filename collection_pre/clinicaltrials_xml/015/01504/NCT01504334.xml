	<brief_summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive form of lung disease characterized by fibrosis of the supporting framework (interstitium) of the lungs. By definition, the term is used only when the cause of the pulmonary fibrosis is unknown ("idiopathic"). Microscopically, lung tissue from patients shows a characteristic set of histologic/pathologic features known as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). UIP is therefore the pathologic counterpart of IPF.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by radiographically evident interstitial infiltrates predominantly affecting the lung bases and by progressive dyspnea and worsening of pulmonary function. No therapy has been clearly shown to prolong survival. The current strict definition of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis provides a new focus for basic and clinical research that will improve insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder and stimulate the development of novel therapies. Pirfenidone has proven antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in various in vitro systems and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis, although its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. It attenuates fibroblast proliferation, production of fibrosis-associated proteins and cytokines, and the increased biosynthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β. It is also shown to slow tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Pirfenidone has not been widely approved for clinical use in China, in this study, safety and efficacy were evaluated to see if pirfenidone has a significant advantage over placebo in terms of improving lung function and life quality etc. (see primary and secondary criteria) or slows down the deterioration of lung function in Chinese subjects diagnosed with IPF.</brief_summary>
