	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome affects a striking 9-18% of Australian reproductive aged women and has been associated with a number of metabolic abnormalities. Given the strong correlation between metabolic abnormalities and increased sympathetic activity, we hypothesise that reducing this activity using medication (moxonidine) can help improve the metabolic abnormalities, and therefore improve outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome.</brief_summary>
