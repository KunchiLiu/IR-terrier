	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics equivalence and safety by comparing pharmacokinetics characteristics between the SYO-1126 and Glivec Film Coated tab 4T (400mg) when administered a single-dose to healthy male volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crossover Study to Compare Pharmacokinetic Property of SYO-1126 and Glivec Film Coated Tab in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteers are administrated single-dose over the period I and II (crossover) of SYO-1126 and Glivec Film Coated tab 4T (400mg) as of imatinib 400mg. Every time before and after each medication, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and safety of SYO-1126 and Glivec Film Coated tab 4T (400mg) is performed using a blood sample and conducting some tests (vital signs, physical exam, ECG, laboratory test, etc.) respectively.</detailed_description>
