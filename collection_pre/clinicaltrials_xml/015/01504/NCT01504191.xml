	<brief_title>Internet-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy After Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major or minor depressive disorders and anxiety disorders are present in many patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, even after controlling for other risk factors. 500 patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression after MI will be randomized either to a 14 week Internet-based CBT-program or to treatment as usual (TAU) which is the control condition. A reference group of 250 participants without depressive or anxiety symptoms will also be studied during TAU. Data will be collected before, after and 7 months after treatment. Anxiety and depression according to ratings on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) are the primary outcome measures.</detailed_description>
