	<brief_summary>Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are widely used as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for infants and children, but NNRTI resistance is increasing, leading to treatment failure. This study will test the safety, tolerability, and dosing levels of etravirine (ETR), a new NNRTI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of Etravirine in HIV-1 Infected Infants and Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use of NNRTI-based regimens as initial therapy for HIV-infected children is increasing, especially in areas where newborns exposed to HIV-1 receive single-dose nevirapine (NVP) as part of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) regimens and/or daily NVP for prevention of transmission through breastfeeding. First-generation NNRTIs have a low genetic barrier to the development of resistance; in two of the most widely used NNRTIs, NVP and efavirenz (EFV), even a single amino acid mutation in the virus can lead to a reduction in the drug's effectiveness. Even short-term use of these NNRTIs, including only a single dose of NVP, can cause NNRTI resistance. Second-generation NNRTIs are needed as part of ARV regimens for newly diagnosed infants and children who have been exposed to single-dose NVP or who have failed their current antiretroviral (ARV) regimens. In this study, the second-generation NNRTI ETR will be tested for safety, tolerability, and appropriate dosing. Children will be assigned to one of three cohorts based on age: - Cohort I: At least 2 but younger than 6 years of age - Cohort II: At least 1 but younger than 2 years of age - Cohort III: At least 2 months but less than 1 year of age Children in all cohorts will be treatment experienced, defined as being on a failing combination ARV regimen (containing at least 3 ARVs) for at least 8 weeks or having a treatment interruption of at least 4 weeks with a history of virologic failure while on a combination ARV regimen (containing at least 3 ARVs). Children will receive ETR together with an optimized background regimen (OBR) consisting of at least 2 active agents (a boosted protease inhibitor [PI] and at least 1 additional active ARV drug). OBR will be based on clinical status, treatment history, resistance data, and availability of appropriate pediatric dosing and formulations. Some ARVs used as part of the OBR may be provided by the study. The children will receive an oral dose of ETR twice daily. Most children will have 11 visits: at screening, entry (Day 0), Day 14 (intensive pharmacokinetic [PK] visit), and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48. Most visits will include a physical exam, giving a medical history, discussion of adherence, and blood and urine collection. The screening and intensive PK visits will also include an electrocardiogram (ECG). During the intensive PK visit, the child will have blood drawn approximately 7 times over 12 hours. After the Week 48 visit, children will enter the long-term follow-up phase of the study and will have a visit every 12 weeks for up to 5 years. These follow-up visits will include giving a medical history and undergoing a physical exam and blood draw.</detailed_description>

Current or anticipated use of any disallowed medications (listed in the protocol) Child's family is unlikely to adhere to the study procedures or keep appointments or is planning to relocate to a nonIMPAACT study site during the study History of nonadherence with ARV medications that in the investigator's opinion could affect the ability of the child to comply with the protocol/procedures Child is currently participating, or has participated within the previous 30 days prior to screening, in a study with a compound or device that is not commercially available Grade 3 or higher QTc or PR interval prolongation from the electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening.
