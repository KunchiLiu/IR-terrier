	<brief_title>Measuring the Effect of Chair Massage on Stress Related Symptoms for Nurses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nursing staff working in a hospital in-patient psychiatric unit and out-patient pain rehabilitation/ fibromyalgia units each have varying causes of stress as both are intensely demanding environments. The physical and psychosocial demands of these stress-loaded work environments place a significant amount of strain on the physiological well-being of the employee. Nurses in these settings are considered healthy employees and able to participate in the workforce, although symptoms such as headaches, shoulder tension, insomnia, fatigue, and muscle and joint pain are often a part of their work day. As these stress related symptoms become more chronic, they lead to days missed and become pre-cursors to physiological illnesses so warrant further search for prevention tactics. Massage therapy has been noted to decrease levels of anxiety and fatigue which is essential to maintaining employee's efficient care in a dynamic environment. This study will provide massage in the workplace utilizing chair massage as it is easy to set up, does not need a great deal of space, and can be provided in semi-private areas, as the participant remains clothed. A 2006 report on a small study indicated chair massage can be effective in reducing stress perception in nurses within a hospital setting, at least in the short-term. Another study reported some short-term positive effects on stress related symptoms; and came to the conclusion that further studies are indicated to examine the efficacy of workplace-based massage therapy programs.</detailed_description>
