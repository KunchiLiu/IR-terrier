	<brief_summary>This study will enroll patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-EGFR mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) lung cancer after failure of at least one but no more than two prior approved treatment regimens. Patients will be randomized to receive one of two doses of vaccine or placebo to be dosed twice weekly for 18 weeks (36 doses total) and patients will also receive erlotinib 150mg taken orally once daily for the duration of the trial. The study will examine the immune effects, safety and efficacy of two different doses of HS110 vaccine in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response and Safety of HS110 Vaccine in Combination With Erlotinib in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will enroll patients with advanced NSCLC (squamous cell or non-squamous cell) without EGFR mutations (either L858R or 746-750 deletions) who have had progression or recurrence of their disease following at least one but no more than two prior regimens (adjuvant therapy excluded) of approved therapy that did not include immunomodulating or anti-EGFR targeted therapy for their disease. EFGR status must be known at the time of enrollment either via prior determination or testing performed from archival tissue during the screening process. Patients with resectable disease will eligible if resection can be deferred for the first six weeks of vaccine. Patients will receive twice weekly dosing of vaccine (spatially divided as 5 intradermal injections) for 18 weeks (36 total doses). Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion; with 30 patients in each of the HS110 treatments groups (high and low dose) and 15 patients will receive placebo injections. Patients will also receive erlotinib 150mg once daily for the duration of the trial. A total of 75 patients will be enrolled in the trial. The study includes a lead-in phase of 9 patients (3 from each dosing group) who will be observed weekly for 4 weeks to assess the safety of combining HS110 with erlotinib. Treatment of the first 4 patients will be staggered by 2 week intervals to allow for safety evaluation before treating additional patients. If the combination of proves to be safe and well-tolerated in the first 9 patients, enrollment will be opened up to the predetermined sample size for each arm. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be used in this study to independently monitor adverse events and progression/survival data. The DMC will meet at the completion of the run-in period and after half the patients have been dosed through week 6 and week 12.</detailed_description>
