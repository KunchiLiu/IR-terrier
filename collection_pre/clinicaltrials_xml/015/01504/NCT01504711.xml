	<brief_title>Fosaprepitant Dimeglumine in Preventing Nausea and Vomiting in Patients With Gastrointestinal Cancer Receiving Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate efficacy of the addition of fosaprepitant (fosaprepitant dimeglumine) in controlling acute and delayed vomiting with the standard prophylactic anti-emetic combination of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone for gastrointestinal cancer patients receiving FOLFIRINOX (5-FU [fluorouracil], oxaliplatin and irinotecan [irinotecan hydrochloride]) chemotherapy. II. To determine the rate of complete response (no emetic episode and no rescue medication) in the combined acute and delayed phase from 0-120 hours after chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the incidence of nausea and vomiting in both acute (&lt; 24 hours) and delayed (24- 120 hours) setting in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Follow overall survival in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive fosaprepitant dimeglumine intravenously (IV) 30 minutes prior to FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 months.</detailed_description>
