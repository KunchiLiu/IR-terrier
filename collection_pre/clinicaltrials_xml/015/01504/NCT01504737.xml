	<brief_summary>SURVEY OF THE FIELD Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease and increasing due to a growing elderly population. The therapy is aortic valve replacement (AVR). Studies on postoperative rehabilitation of AS pts are scarce. In the few studies available, a mix of valve diseases is presented without considering the differences in pathophysiology and the training regimes are not clearly described. PURPOSE, AIMS &amp; HYPOTHESIS The investigators purpose is to evaluate whether a supervised cardiac rehabilitation program improves the objective physical capacity and quality of life (QoL) of patients after AVR due to AS, and compare this to patients training by their own. The investigators hypothesize that supervised exercise training may be a more efficient way of rehabilitating these patients. DESIGN This is a controlled randomized clinical trial comparing 12 weeks of supervised exercise training 3 times per week to home-based training based upon public health recommendations of minimum level of physical activity. SIGNIFICANCE &amp; IMPLEMENTATION Positive results would support that an organized program of exercise training improves physical capacity and QoL in AS patients following AVR with potential benefit for both patients and society.</brief_summary>
