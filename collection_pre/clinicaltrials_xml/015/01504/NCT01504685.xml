	<detailed_description>Obesity is a public health problem that has grown exponentially worldwide. Bariatric surgery has been recognized as the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. However, the debate about the best surgical procedure is still considerable. Among a wide range of operations that have been used for morbid obesity, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has shown an appropriate risk/benefit balance and has achieved a high degree of acceptance in America. The weight loss pattern in RYGB is characteristic and includes significant eight loss during the first 2 years after surgery, followed by some weight regain after the second or third postoperative year. To prevent this some authors suggest the placement of a premeasured band or ring around the gastric reservoir, adjacent to the gastroenterostomy. This procedure has been called banded RYGB.</detailed_description>
