	<brief_summary>The goal of this single-center, comparative, open label, in-vitro diagnostic device performance evaluation was to investigate the performance of two sanofi-aventis BGMSs (BGStar® and iBGStar®) with regard to system accuracy (Polaris), precision and Hct influence (Helios).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main study (Polaris) investigated blood glucose measuring accuracy and intra-assay precision while the substudy (Helios) investigated potential haematocrit interference of sanofi-aventis BGMSs BGStar® and iBGStar® and partly of competitor BGMSs according to ISO 15197 [1] and TNO 2001 Quality Guideline [2], respectively. The primary objective of the system accuracy evaluation is to identify the number of blood glucose readings of both sanofi-aventis devices within the ISO 15197 area of acceptable accuracy of ± 20% [DEV%] for blood samples with glucose concentration &gt; 75 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L) and within the ISO 15197 area of acceptable accuracy of ± 15 mg/dL (± 0.83 mmol/L) for blood samples with glucose concentration &lt; 75 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L) as compared to the StatStrip® Connectivity reference method. The primary objective of the haematocrit interference evaluation is to demonstrate that the BGStar® and iBGStar® devices meet the Hct interference requirements according to TNO 2001 Quality Guideline when used to measure BG of venous whole blood as compared to a venous plasma reference method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus™) at Hct levels between 35 - 55% in terms of:(1) a mean deviation not exceeding ± 10% [DEV%] for hyperglycaemic glucose concentrations (150 - 180, 250 - 280, 320 - 350 mg/dL) and (2)a mean deviation not exceeding ± 18 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) [DEVtotal] for hypo- and normoglycaemic glucose values (50 - 60, 100 - 120 mg/dL) compared to the reference method at Hct levels between 35 - 55%.</detailed_description>
