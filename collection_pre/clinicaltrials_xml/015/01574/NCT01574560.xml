	<brief_summary>Smoking is widely accepted to cause an increase in an individual's likelihood of developing cancer and heart disease. The effects of tobacco smoke are not limited to smokers. Secondhand smoke inhaled by a non-smoker has also been associated with the development of several illnesses. This study focuses on learning how to make your home smoke-free.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>P60 Program Project Grant-Outreach for Smoke-Free Homes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will be qualitative focus groups/pilot study with the purpose to develop a motivationally enhanced biomarker feedback counseling protocol and all printed materials to be used in Phase 2. After investigators develop a good working treatment protocol, an active intervention in smoking homes who live with a child in their home will be carried out. Those randomized to the Control Group will receive health education in the form of brochures detailing the health effects of secondhand smoke and how to make their home smoke free. Participants randomized to the Treatment Group will receive tobacco-specific biomarker feedback and personalized motivationally enhanced counseling.</detailed_description>
