	<brief_summary>The SALTO-SNA study is an ancillary study of the SALTO study (Suivi À Long Terme en Oncologie des enfants guéris d'un cancer pédiatrique en régions Rhône-Alpes et Auvergne) coordinated by Dr. Claire Berger, pediatric oncologist at the CHU, Saint Etienne. It aims at re-examining, in their initial treatment center, all patients (a cohort of 495 patients alive in 2011), diagnosed between 1987 and 1992, and cured of childhood cancer (except leukemia) in the Rhône-Alpes and Auvergne regions. The rationale for this study is based on the observation that although the survival rate of childhood cancers has now reached 75%, complications of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are high and greatly increase the risk of mortality in later years (estimated to be 14% in the literature). The morbidity risk of chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be quantified by assessing the activity of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic regulation, which represents a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity to the individual.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For this purpose, analysis of the cardiac RR variability is a reliable, non-invasive and reproducible system that could be used in this population as a tool for early detection of cardiovascular dysfunction.</detailed_description>
