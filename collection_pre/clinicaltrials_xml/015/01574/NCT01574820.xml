	<brief_summary>Objectives: The investigators examined whether rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD), is beneficial for pre-diabetes mellitus (DM) adults with documented coronary artery disease (CAD). Background: Microvascular and macrovascular complications are common in type 2 DM. There is no evidence about the effects of TZDs, synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-Î³ activators (insulin sensitizers and adipose transcriptional regulation and anti-inflammatory process activators) on pre-DM patients with documented CAD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of Rosiglitazone on Pre-Diabetes Mellitus and Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Materials and Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients will be randomly assigned to the TZD group and to the placebo group with a 6-month treatment period. Biomarkers will also examined before and 6 months post-treatment during the trial. The primary end-points will be the diagnosis of major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, overt heart failure, and surgery or coronary intervention for CAD.</detailed_description>
