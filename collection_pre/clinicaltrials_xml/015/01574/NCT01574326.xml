	<brief_summary>Objective: In hyperphosphatemic pediatric participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of sevelamer carbonate - Evaluate the efficacy of sevelamer carbonate on the control of serum phosphorus</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Sevelamer Carbonate in Hyperphosphatemic Pediatric Participants With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was divided into 3 periods: a phosphate binder washout Period; a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Fixed Dose Period; and an open-label, sevelamer carbonate Dose Titration Period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participant had CKD requiring dialysis or CKD not on dialysis with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 based on central laboratory results. The participant had a serum phosphorus level greater than the age appropriate upper limit of normal based on central laboratory results. The participant had active dysphagia, swallowing disorders or a predisposition to or current bowel obstruction, ileus or severe gastrointestinal motility disorder(s) including severe constipation, or major gastrointestinal tract surgery. The participant had a nonrenal case of hyperphosphatemia.</criteria>
