	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to collect maternal blood samples from pregnant women to develop a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic test based on fetal DNA isolated from maternal blood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will seek to enroll subjects to collect the following types of samples: - Up to 2,000 maternal blood samples along with their corresponding paternal blood, buccal or saliva samples (1,000 required for final analysis). - Up to 200 maternal blood samples from carrying a fetus with a confirmed chromosomal abnormality or genetic disorder, along with their corresponding paternal blood, buccal or saliva samples (50 required for final analysis). For women who opted for termination, a genetic sample of the fetus may also be collected. - Up to 1,000 buccal or saliva samples from paternal grandfathers and/or the biological father's brothers. - Up to 1,000 cord, buccal or saliva samples from the born children. - Up to 40 blood samples (20 non-pregnant females and 20 males) from healthy volunteers (20 required for final analysis) - Up to 400 blood samples from women undergoing D&amp;C procedure following a miscarriage along with corresponding paternal blood (or buccal or saliva samples) (200 required for final analysis).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pregnant women who volunteer to donate blood sample during the first , second and/or third trimester The biological father of the child (or the father's brother and/or father) has to be at least 18 years of age and consent to his blood, buccal, or saliva collection. Pregnant women whose fetus was diagnosed with a chromosomal abnormality or genetic disorder by either amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling who volunteer to donate a blood sample. Pregnant women who volunteer to donate a blood sample after their spontaneous miscarriage prior to undergoing D&amp;C procedure and who choose to utilize Natera's commercial products of conception molecular karyotyping service. Healthy volunteers (nonpregnant female and male) who volunteer to donate their blood sample. Umbilical cord blood or cheek swab/saliva samples from born children o Pregnant women who have participated in donating a blood sample during their pregnancy have the option to donate either an umbilical cord blood sample after child delivery, or a cheek swab or saliva sample from the born child using Natera's home kit.
