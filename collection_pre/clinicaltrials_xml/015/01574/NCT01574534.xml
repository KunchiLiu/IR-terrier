	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that in a real-world population undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for de-novo stenoses in small native vessels with a diameter &lt;3 mm, drug eluting balloons (DEB) are non inferior to third-generation drug eluting stents (DES).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Basel Stent Kosten Effektivitäts Trial Drug Eluting Balloons vs. Drug Eluting Stents in Small Vessel Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug-eluting balloons are an established treatment for in-stent stenoses and showed good results in small vessels. Moreover, the available data suggest that DEB are a promising new technique for the treatment of de-novo stenoses in small vessels if pre-dilatation is performed and geographical mismatch is avoided. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that DEB is non-inferior to DES in a real-world population with respect to the combined clinical endpoint Major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization after 12 months.</detailed_description>
