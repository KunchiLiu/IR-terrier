	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the present randomized controlled trial is to compare the effectiveness of three anti-smoking interventions of different intensities. It has been hypothesised that early follow-up visits facilitate post-stroke smoking cessation in patients hospitalized because of first-ever ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Interventions in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: It is well known, that continued smoking after stroke increases the risk of death and stroke recurrence within a few years after the first stroke. Searching for more efficient methods of antismoking interventions is therefore justified. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of three anti-smoking interventions of different intensities. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. METHODS: Study participants will be recruited among patients of neurological clinics of Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, hospitalized because of their first in a lifetime ischemic stroke. All stroke patients will be screened regarding their smoking status. The subjects will be patients smoking cigarettes immediately before their first-ever stroke, able to understand the research protocol procedures and able to cooperate during the investigation. Antismoking interventions will be based on the "5A's" method. Study participants will be randomized to one of three interventions differing in follow-up intensity.</detailed_description>
