	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the efficacy and safety of surgery combined with rAd-p53 gene therapy in treatment of advanced Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The study efficacy endpoints include overall survival, progress-free survival, quality of life, and local recurrent rate. The safety endpoint is complications and adverse effects. The study hypothesis: rAd-p53 gene therapy can prolong the overall survival and reduce the local recurrent rate.</brief_summary>
