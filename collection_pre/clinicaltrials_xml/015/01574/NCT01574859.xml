	<brief_summary>Retrospective trial of 300 patients with pituitary insufficiency treated in Department of Medica Endocrinology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University concerning levothyroxine (T4) replacement and cardiovascular risk factors. The hypothesis is that subtle central hypothyroidism is associated with adverse cardiac risk factors, such as body composition and serum lipids, and that improved T4 replacement will eliminate this increased risk, independently of other pituitary hormone replacements.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Retrospective trial of 300 patients with pituitary insufficiency treated in Department of Medical Endocrinology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University concerning levothyroxine (T4) replacement and cardiovascular risk profile. The patient files are recruited among hypopituitary patients treated with growth hormone from the period 1993 to 2008. The trial is a retrospective assessment of data already collected for routine purposes and thus an audit of daily clinical practice. All information on the patients is obtained from the paper and electronic files existing in the department and no new measurements are foreseen.</detailed_description>
