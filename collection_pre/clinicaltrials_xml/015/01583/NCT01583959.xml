	<brief_summary>Introduction: Methotrexate is the sheet anchor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Folic acid supplementation is usually given at a dose of 5-30 mg per week to ameliorate adverse effects. Patients at our center are usually on the higher dose. However, it is unclear if higher doses are required, recent international recommendations suggest 5-10 mg per week only. Objectives: To randomize rheumatoid patients being being started on Methotrexate into 2 groups- one on 5mg for 6 days a week (30mg per week) of folic acid and the other 5 mg twice a week (10 mg per week) for 24weeks. To look at difference in 1. Adverse effects due to methotrexate a. Minor adverse effects: By symptom chart a. Major adverse effects: Cytopenia (predefined) and transaminitis. 2. Disease activity using Disease activity score 28 joints (3 variable) and functional status by health assessment questionnaire 3. RBC folic acid levels Methodology: Randomised controlled trial, double blinded, placebo controlled. Sample size 50 in each group. One group of patients will receive folic acid 5 mg twice a week with placebo for 4 days and the other group will receive folic acid 5 mg 6 days a week for 24 weeks. Patients will be administered adverse effects proforma, assessed for having cytopenias and transaminitis (pre defined) and disease activity will be calculated at every visit, ie., in the beginning at then at 8,16 and 24 weeks. In addition will look at the functional status and RBC folate levels at 0 and 24 weeks. Statistical analysis using chi-square test for proportions and t test for continuous variables.</brief_summary>
