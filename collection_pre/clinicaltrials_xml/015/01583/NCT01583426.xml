	<brief_summary>Current guidelines as those from the AGO-Breast commission recommend for neoadjuvant breast cancer patients either a sequence of 4 cycles EC followed by 4 cycles of a taxane or 6 cycles of TAC based on previous large scale studies. Treatment of patients with HER2-positive disease should include also simultaneous application of trastuzumab. Solvent-based taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) cause severe toxicities not only by the active agents itself but also by the solvents like cremophor. Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) is a solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin. It does not require premedication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to prevent the risk of solvent-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. This new formulation improves safety profile, allows higher dosing with shorter infusion duration, and produces higher tumor drug concentration. As neoadjuvant treatment does not only allow to compare competing treatment approaches with a very high quality (homogenous treatment population, precise assessment of response by histological assessment), but also to identify predictive markers, this trial will compare weekly nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel at their currently optimal doses. In case of HER2-positive tumor status patients receive Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab additionally.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives: To compare the pathological complete response (pCR=ypT0 ypN0) rates of neoadjuvant treatment of nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel as part of neoadjuvant treatment of operable or locally advanced primary breast cancer Secondary Objectives: - To assess the pCR rates per arm separately for the stratified subpopulations. - To determine the rates of ypT0/is ypN0; ypT0 ypN0/+; ypT0/is ypN0/+; ypT(any) ypN0; and regression grades. - To determine the response rates of the breast tumor and axillary nodes based on physical examination and imaging tests (sonography, mammography, or MRI) after treatment in both arms. - To assess clinical response rate after taxane in both groups - To determine the breast conservation rate after each treatment. - To assess the toxicity and compliance. - To assess the time of onset of grade 3 neuropathy - To assess the time of resolution of grade 3/4 neuropathy to at least grade 1 - To determine loco-regional invasive recurrence free survival (LRRFS), distant-disease-free survival (DDFS), invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and overall survival (OS) in both arms and according to stratified subpopulations. - To assess regional recurrence free survival (RRFS) in patients with initial node-positive axilla converted to negative at surgery and treated with sentinel node biopsy alone. - To determine the pCR rate and local recurrence free survival (LRFS) in patients with a clinical complete response (cCR) and a negative core biopsy before surgery. - To examine and compare pre-specified molecular markers such as SPARC, gp60, calveoline 1 and other markers potentially differentially predicting efficacy of nab-paclitaxel and solvent-based paclitaxel on core biopsies before, during and after chemotherapy. Objectives of Substudies: - To assess, characterize, and correlate circulating tumor cells and proteins with the effect of treatment (CTC Substudy). - To correlate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes with the associated toxicity and histologically assessed treatment effect (Pharmacogenetic substudy) - To assess ovarian function measured by amenorrhea rate in correlation with changes in E2, FSH, LH , Anti-Müller Hormone, ultrasound-follicle count in patients aged &lt; 45 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients will be eligible for study participation only if they comply with the following criteria: Written informed consent for all study according to local regulatory requirements prior to beginning specific protocol procedures. Complete baseline documentation must be sent to GBG Forschungs GmbH. Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by core biopsy. Fineneedle aspiration alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not allowed. In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint. Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of &gt;= 2 cm or a sonographical size of &gt;= 1 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions, preferably by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation can be used as measurable lesion. Patients must be in the following stages of disease: cT2 cT4ad or cT1c and cN+ or cT1c and pNSLN+ or cT1c and ERneg and PRneg or cT1c and Ki67 &gt; 20% cT1c and HER2pos In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should be measured. Centrally confirmed ER/PR/HER2, Ki67 and SPARC status detected on core biopsy. ER/PR positive is defined as &gt;1% stained cells and HER2positive is defined as IHC 3+ or insitu hybridisation (ISH) ratio &gt;2.0. Formalinfixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the Dept. of Pathology at the Charité, Berlin prior to randomization. Age &gt;= 18 years. Karnofsky Performance status index &gt;= 80%. Normal cardiac function must be confirmed by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or shortening fraction) within 3 months prior to randomization. Results must be above the normal limit of the institution. For patients with HER2positive tumors LVEF must be &gt;= 55%. Laboratory requirements: Hematology Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 2.0 x 109 / L and Platelets &gt;= 100 x 109 / L and Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 g/dL (&gt;= 6.2 mmol/L) Hepatic function Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x UNL and ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) &lt;= 1.5x UNL and Alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2.5x UNL. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all women of childbearing potential. Complete staging workup within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must have bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound (&lt;= 21 days), breast MRI (optional), chest Xray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan done. In case of positive bone scan, bone Xray is mandatory. Other tests may be performed as clinically indicated. Patients must be available and compliant for central diagnostics, treatment and followup.

Patients of childbearing potential must implement adequate nonhormonal contraceptive measures (barrier methods, intrauterine contraceptive devices, sterilization) during study treatment.

Known or suspected congestive heart failure (&gt;NYHA I) and / or coronary heart disease, angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication, previous history of myocardial infarction, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, uncontrolled or poorly controlled arterial hypertension (i.e. BP &gt;160 / 90 mm Hg under treatment with two antihypertensive drugs), rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment, clinically significant valvular heart disease. History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including psychotic disorders, dementia or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent. Persons who have been admitted to an institution by order of jurisdictional or governmental grounds. Preexisting motor or sensory neuropathy of grade 2 or more by NCICTC criteria v 4.0.
