	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish whether or not there is a clinical advantage to the use of Aquamantys® System from Medtronic Advanced Energy (formerly Salient Surgical Technologies) in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty via the anterior supine intermuscular surgical approach in terms of blood loss, transfusion and wound healing. Wound healing will be assessed by a blinded observer and based upon a simple and subjective criteria: a) as expected, b) better than expected or c) worse than expected. The blinded observer is experienced in the care of the surgical patient and wound evaluation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Aquamantys for Reducing Transfusions With Anterior Supine Intermuscular Approach Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish in a randomized, blinded study whether or not there is a clinical advantage to the use of Aquamantys® System from Medtronic Advanced Energy (formerly Salient Surgical Technologies) in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty via the anterior supine intermuscular surgical approach in terms of blood loss, transfusion and wound healing based on early collected data. Data will be analyzed using StatsDirect in standard fashion to elucidate any difference between control and treatment groups. Wound healing will be assessed by a blinded observer and based upon a simple and subjective criteria: a) as expected, b) better than expected or c) worse than expected. The blinded observer is experienced in the care of the surgical patient and wound evaluation.</detailed_description>
