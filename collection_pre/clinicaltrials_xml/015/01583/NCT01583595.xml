	<brief_summary>Most patients with chronic lung disease underestimate their actual walking ability due to low confidence. To better understand the relationships between lung function, self-efficacy for walking (confidence in ability to walk a defined distance), actual walking ability for the same distance gait speed and physical activity level-PAL- (total energy expenditure/resting metabolic rate). Quality of life, self efficacy for activity questionnaires, physical activity level measurement, 4-meter gait speed and 6-minute walk distance will be measured.</brief_summary>
