	<brief_title>Olaparib in Adults With Recurrent/Metastatic Ewing's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives Evaluate the objective response rate of olaparib in adult patients with recurrent and/or metastatic Ewing's sarcoma following failure of conventional chemotherapy. Secondary Objectives To evaluate the progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety of olaparib in this patient population. As an exploratory objective, the investigators will evaluate (in subjects who agree to an optional biopsy) differences in pre- and post-treatment tumor DNA alterations and differences in levels of protein and RNA expression related to PARP inhibition. Study Design Potential subjects who discuss and sign the informed consent form will undergo screening studies. Eligible patients will administer olaparib and obtain restaging imaging studies after 6 and 12 weeks on study, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Participants will remain on study drug until disease progression, onset of unacceptable toxicities, or subject withdraws consent.</detailed_description>
