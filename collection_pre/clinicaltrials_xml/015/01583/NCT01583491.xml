	<brief_title>Evaluation of Platelet Rich Fibrin on Reduction of Periodontal Problems After Surgical Removal of Mandibular Third Molar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After extraction or surgical removal of third molar, a deep bony pocket created behind the second molar specially in the mandible. For reduction of this problem, investigators, needed to acceleration tissue healing.
