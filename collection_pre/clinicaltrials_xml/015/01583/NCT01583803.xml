	<brief_summary>Females have a lower incidence of hypertensive and cardiovascular disorders that may relate to differences in nitrogen oxides in the blood and saliva. Some nitrogen oxides are recycled with the help of oral bacteria to nitric oxide which is protective against vascular disorders. This study will test the hypothesis that females have different numbers and species of these nitrogen-oxide reducing bacteria.</brief_summary>
