	<brief_summary>The goal of the "Mochudi Prevention Project" is to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the village of Mochudi, Botswana by promoting a comprehensive package of interventions that have proven to be effective in preventing the spread of HIV. This antiretroviral treatment (ART) clinical study is nested within the Mochudi Prevention Project, and is being conducted in the north-east segment (NES) of the village of Mochudi. The ART intervention component of the Mochudi Project is designed to determine the uptake of, adherence to, and feasibility of 3-drug combination ART as a component of a package of transmission prevention strategies. The hypotheses are 1) that ART (with 3 antiretrovirals from two classes of drugs) among participants with CD4 ≥ 250 cells/mm3 and VL ≥ 50,000 cp/mL will be acceptable and safe and 2) Eighty percent of eligible participants will agree to start 3-drug ART.</brief_summary>
