	<brief_summary>The single-ring ablation method aims for isolation of the posterior LA wall including the pulmonary veins. If avoiding ablation on the posterior LA wall esophageal injury is unlikely. Aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an RMN-guided single-ring ablation method as compared to standard RMN-guided circumferential PVA.</brief_summary>
