	<brief_summary>Apremilast is a new, orally available, small molecule drug that specifically inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme that modulates inflammatory cytokines. This clinical study tests whether apremilast can improve the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Apremilast to Treat Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be assigned two different treatments based on chance (randomized) to placebo or apremilast (20 or 30 mg tablet). The duration of the study is approximately 5 years. The double blind period (when patients nor the physician knows whether placebo or apremilast is taken) is 24 weeks. At Week 16, subjects who do not have either a ≥ 20% improvement or a ≥ 1 unit improvement from baseline in at least two of the four SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) domains will enter the "early escape" from their current treatment in a double-blinded manner. However, such subjects will be permitted to continue in the study. At Week 24, subjects may enter a long-term extension phase for up to an additional 4.5 years (236 weeks). At "second escape" (at Week 24), apremilast 20 mg BID treated subjects will be transitioned to receive double-blinded apremilast 30 mg BID; apremilast 30 mg BID will remain on double-blinded apremilast 30 mg BID because they may continue to improve with a longer duration of treatment. After Week 24 and during the early portion of the long-term extension through Week 52, all subjects will continue on either double-blinded apremilast 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID treatment. After all subjects have completed Week 52 or have terminated early from the study and the 52-week data base is locked, open-label apremilast 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID treatment will be provided.</detailed_description>
