	<brief_title>Study of Computer Attention Training Programs in Schools for Children With Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study is examining a neurofeedback (NF) computer attention training system that teaches children to alter their brainwave activity with a Cognitive Training attention training system (CT). The investigators hypothesize that both treatments will show improvement in ADHD symptoms and academic outcomes compared to a control condition. 104 children with ADHD in grades 2 and 4 are randomly assigned to receive the NF, CT, or a Waitlist-Control (WLC) condition that receives NF or CT the following academic year. Children receive forty 45-minute sessions three times a week at school for 4 months. A comprehensive assessment, consists of data completed by teachers, parents, participants, and double-blind classroom observations.</detailed_description>
