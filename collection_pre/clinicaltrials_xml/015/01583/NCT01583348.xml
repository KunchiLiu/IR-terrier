	<brief_summary>While gold standard in the treatment of symptomatic gall stones is laparoscopic cholecystectomy with instruments introduced through multiple abdominal wall incisions, transvaginal access to the peritoneal cavity offers an alternative avoiding injury of the abdominal wall. Transvaginal hybrid-NOTES cholecystectomy has been demonstrated effective and safe. However it has not been demonstrated up-to-date if intraoperative cholangiography is feasible during such procedure. This observational case series describes success and technical feasibility of intraoperative cholangiography during transvaginal cholecystectomy. The investigators hypothesis is that cholangiography is feasible equal to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</brief_summary>
