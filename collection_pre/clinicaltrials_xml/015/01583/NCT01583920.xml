	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy is considered a standard treatment option for the management of localized prostate cancer. Among the 20-30% who recur, a proportion of them will present with an isolated local recurrence, meaning no distant metastases. If left untreated, it may serve as a source for subsequent metastases. Salvage options available for isolated local recurrence include; temporary or permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate, complete removal of the prostate gland, use of low temperatures to treat the disease, and high frequency ultrasound to treat the disease. There are risks of complications associated with all these treatments, and there is presently no consensus as to which treatment is the best. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to look at the feasibility and toxicities of focal treatment of the prostate using temporary implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate which the investigators hope will be less since the entire prostate is not treated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Biopsy confirmed locally recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma &gt; 30months after the completion of radiotherapy by a stereotactic transperineal biopsy Staging T2 weighted, DWI and DCEMRI that demonstrates solitary recurrence confined to prostate, and correlates with stereotactic transperineal biopsy American Urological Association Symptom Index Score (ie. IPSS) &lt; 15 Baseline (post radiotherapy) serum PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL Prostate volume as measured by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) &lt; 50cc ECOG performance status 01 Prior radiotherapy to the prostate that exceeded 78Gy (2Gy fractions) Any of the following prior therapies: transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), radionuclide (permanent or temporary implantation) prostate brachytherapy, prostatectomy or prostatic cryosurgery, HIFU (hiintensity focused ultrasound), bilateral orchiectomy, chemotherapy for prostatic carcinoma Evidence of castrate resistance (defined as PSA &gt; 3 ng/mL while testosterone is &lt; 1.7 nmol/L). Patients could have been on combined androgen blockade with initial radiotherapy but are excluded if this was started due to PSA progression.</criteria>
