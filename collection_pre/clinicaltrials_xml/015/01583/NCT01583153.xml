	<brief_summary>Total knee replacement (TKR) surgery is a common and highly effective treatment option for alleviating the pain and disability caused by chronic arthritis. The associated rehabilitation costs, however, impose a significant burden on the health system. In particular, inpatient rehabilitation - utilised by approximately 43% of private TKR recipients in NSW and 29% Australia-wide is of greatest concern, costing, on average, $7000 (AU) per inpatient episode. The overarching aim of this study is to establish whether inpatient rehabilitation is necessary after TKR for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who could otherwise be discharged directly home. The main hypothesis to be tested by the proposed study is that TKR recipients who receive inpatient rehabilitation in addition to participating in a home programme, compared to patients who participate in a home programme only, will achieve a superior level of mobility. If superiority is shown, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken. Secondary hypotheses to be tested relate to patient-reported knee pain and function, health-related quality of life, functional ambulation, and knee joint mobility. Superiority in these outcomes will be evident at six months after surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As preferences for therapy can be a confounder in RCTs, patients will be asked their preference for rehabilitation post TKR, prior to randomisation. Patients will be randomised once a hospital bed is available.</detailed_description>
