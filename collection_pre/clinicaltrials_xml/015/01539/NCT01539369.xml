	<brief_summary>The purpose of this parallel design study is to assess the relative effects of two 12-week healthy eating dietary interventions: general healthy eating (Diet A) and general healthy eating combined with advice to increase fibre intake (Diet B) to at least 25g/day (with a large proportion of the fibre intake derived from cereal or wheat bran), in overweight low-fibre consuming premenopausal female adults on body weight change (kg). It is hypothesized that adding fibre to a healthy eating diet (Diet B) would lead to greater weight loss and/or weight loss maintenance than following a healthy eating diet alone (Diet A).</brief_summary>
