	<brief_summary>Malnutrition and lack of regular exercise are often found in older adults and have been identified as important risk factors for independence loss and nursing home admission in older community-dwelling adults. Existing evidence suggests that high protein nutritional supplements can increase skeletal muscle protein synthesis following exercise in older individuals. However, increase of muscle strength by resistance training does not decrease the rate of falls and is not necessarily linked to an improvement of physical function. In contrast to resistance training, T'ai Chi, dance and eurhythmics have been shown to decrease fall incidence and improve mobility and physical function in older adults. The investigators will examine the combination of eurhythmics and high protein nutritional supplements. The aim of the study is to investigate whether there is an increase in normal walking velocity due to the nutritional supplement on top of once weekly Jacques-Delacroze Eurhythmics training.</brief_summary>
