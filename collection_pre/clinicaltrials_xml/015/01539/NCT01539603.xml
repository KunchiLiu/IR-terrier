	<brief_title>Comparison of Drug Eluting Balloon and Drug Eluting Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent trial to test premount bare metal stent on drug-eluting balloon failed to demonstrate non-inferiority and safety compared to drug-eluting stent alone for treatment of coronary artery stenosis. We think that inappropriate drug delivery to diseased vessel due to stent strut might affect the efficacy of drug-eluting balloon. Therefore, we design a clinical study with a different protocol, that is, drug-eluting balloon first and then bare metal stent implantation in comparison to drug-eluting stent.</detailed_description>
