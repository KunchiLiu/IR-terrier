	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center natural history study that will be conducted at participating centers in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG). Following a baseline evaluation, participants will have three follow-up visits over a three-year period. The investigators will characterize the Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype, and correlate specific abnormal dystrophin proteins with the range of clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will utilize the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research group (CINRG) network to collect cohorts of Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) patients with in-frame deletions in the dystrophin gene. We will collect clinical data across multiple body systems and correlate these findings to the high-resolution deletion break-point mapping performed from the tissue samples. We will investigate the observed variability to deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms relevant to the optimization of exon skipping therapeutic approaches.</detailed_description>
