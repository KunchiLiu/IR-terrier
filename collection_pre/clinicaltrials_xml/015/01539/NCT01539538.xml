	<brief_summary>The study is intended to show that the Sufentanil NanoTab PCA System is as effective as morphine intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) for treating pain after surgery. Each patient will use either the Sufentanil NanoTab PCA System or morphine IV PCA to treat their pain for at least 48 hours and up to 72 hours after surgery while in the hospital.</brief_summary>
