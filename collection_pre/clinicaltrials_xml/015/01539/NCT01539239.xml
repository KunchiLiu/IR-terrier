	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, study. After informed consent is obtained, patients will be evaluated for eligibility based on glaucoma severity, eye health, and visual acuity. Following successful screening, use of all topical glaucoma medications will be stopped for a period of "washout" to establish a qualifying medication-free intraocular pressure (IOP) value. Clinical follow up will be scheduled over the course of the 24 month study, and examinations will be repeated to monitor eye health. At the 1 and 2 year follow up, those patients on ocular hypotensive medications will be instructed to washout, and then have the diurnal (IOP taken in the morning, mid-day, and afternoon in the same day) IOP evaluation. Annual follow up will occur up to 5 years. The primary effectiveness endpoint is a decrease in diurnal IOP from baseline compared to the 24 months diurnal IOP following medication washout.</brief_summary>
