	<brief_summary>The proposed exploratory study aims to understand the in vivo skin distribution properties of subcutaneously (s.c.) administered AIN457 in psoriatic and healthy skin using open flow microperfusion (OFM). The data of this study will help to understand the mode of action of AIN457 in its target tissue. It aims to establish a technique assessing in vivo distribution of AIN457 and its metabolites in human dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) and exploring a potential pharmacodynamic effect in situ. In addition, the study will further evaluate safety and local tolerability of subcutaneously administered AIN457 and explore dermal interstitial fluid skin levels of potential disease relevant biomarkers. The study is divided into two parts - Part I with 8 healthy volunteers (HV) to validate the method is completed and Part II with 8 psoriasis patients will start based on the outcome of Part I.</brief_summary>
