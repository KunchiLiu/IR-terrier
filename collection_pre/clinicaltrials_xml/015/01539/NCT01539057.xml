	<brief_summary>Objective: - To evaluate the efficacy of preoperative administration of fibrinogen in liver transplantation by maintaining a preoperative plasma level equal to 2.9 g / L compared with placebo, reflecting a reduction in the number of RBC units transfused during the procedure. - To determine the influence of fibrinogen administration on mortality and survival of liver graft evaluated one year after the procedure. - To determine the safety of fibrinogen administration recording thrombotic complications evaluated during hospitalization or at least 30 days postoperatively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of the Administration of Fibrinogen in Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. One hundred thirty two patients (132) will randomly be assigned to: Treatment group, Fibrinogen administration; doses of fibrinogen: 1 g for an increase in the plasmatic value of fibrinogen of 0.29 g / L to obtain a value of 2.9 g / L. Placebo group, to whom the same dose volume of saline will be administered. Determinations of haematocrit, electrolytes and kidney function tests and coagulation and haemostasis and thrombelastography test are made at all stages of the proceeding. A standard protocol for intraoperative management will be applied. Blood loss, administration of blood products, fluid therapy, presence of reperfusion syndrome, operative complications and mortality and survival will be registered. Patients will be followed for one year after transplantation.</detailed_description>
