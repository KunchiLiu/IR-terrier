	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial among women who deliver by cesarean at UNC Women's Hospital and desire an Intrauterine Device (IUD) for contraception postpartum. After consenting, women will be randomized to receive an IUD at time of cesarean delivery or at a postpartum visit 4-8 weeks later. After randomization, subjects will be given a choice of the Mirena® IUD or the Paragard® IUD. Data collection will occur at baseline, delivery, the 4-8 week postpartum visit, and 2 follow-up encounters at 3 and 6 months. We hypothesize that women who receive an IUD at the time of cesarean will be more likely to use an IUD 6 months later than women who plan on receiving an IUD 4-8 weeks after delivery.</brief_summary>
