	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare conventional PET/CT scan performed 1 hour after injection of the radioactive tracer FDG (PET/CT[1]) with PET/CT performed after 3 hours (PET/CT[3]) in a group of patients with biopsy verified lung cancer or high suspicion of lung cancer after initial work-up (chest x-ray and CT of thorax/upper abdomen), who are potentially operable.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators also want to: - To find the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in PET/CT 1h and 3 h in the staging of lung cancer (N-/M-stage). Our gold standard is pathology, when not possible - follow-up (se Gold Standard 6.1.1) - To compare SUVmax with the expression of GLUT1 and G-6-Pase in tumors - To compare the expression of GLUT1 with the activity of G6Pase - To compare SUVmax, RI, tumor/liver ratio, GLUT1 and G-6-Pase with the occurrence of relapse within a year after curative surgery</detailed_description>
