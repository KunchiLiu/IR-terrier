	<brief_summary>Obesity is a worldwide health problematic whose incidence is increasing especially in developed countries. The surgical management of this illness consists in different techniques such as Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy but this treatment could not be efficient enough. The causes of failure after Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy are not known but could include the residual gastric volume. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the residual gastric volume is involved in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy's failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of the Residual Gastric Volume in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy's Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study can be done in three steps: 1. From a prospective database, patients are selected if they were operated by Laparoscopic Sleeve gastrectomy at least two years before. 2. these patients are convoked by their surgeon, who proposed them to participate at this study. During this consultation, the BAROS score is calculated by the surgeon and reported in the case report form of the patient. 3. After checking the possible contraindication, a gastric computed tomography volumetry is done and the residual gastric volume is calculated by two independent radiologists.</detailed_description>
