	<brief_summary>Children with mild persistent asthma that have asthma symptoms once or twice a week and use a daily controller, while children with mild intermittent asthma rarely have asthma symptoms and do not use a daily controller. Inhaled corticosteroids are the standard treatment for mild peristent asthma. The purpose of this study is to measure children rate of growth while on different inhaled corticosteroids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Flovent Discus vs QVAR vs Pulmicort Flexhaler on Short Term Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, cross over study evaluating the effect of Flovent Discus 100 mcg BID vs QVAR 80 mcg BID vs Pulmicort Flexhaler 180 mcg BID on short term growth in pediatric subjects with asthma. Objectives: 1. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of Flovent Diskus 100 mcg BID versus Pulmicort Flexhaler 180 mcg BID on short-term lower leg growth velocity as measured by knemometry in pediatric subjects with mild asthma. 2. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the effect of Flovent Diskus 100 mcg BID versus QVAR 80 mcg BID on short-term lower leg growth velocity as measured by knemometry in pediatric subjects with mild asthma. Aims: 1. The primary aim is to show that there is a growth suppressive effect of Pulmicort Flexhaler 180 mcg BID versus Flovent Diskus 100 mcg BID in children with mild asthma. 2. The secondary aim to show that there is a growth suppressive effect of QVAR 80 mcg BID versus Flovent Diskus 100 mcg BID in children with mild asthma. Hypotheses: 1. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with Pulmicort Flexhaler 180mcg BID as compared to Flovent Diskus 100 mcg BID has a growth suppressive effect on lower leg length as assessed by knemometry in pediatric subjects with mild asthma. 2. The secondary hypothesis is that treatment with QVAR 80 mcg BID as compared to Flovent Diskus 100 mcg BID has a growth suppressive effect on lower leg length as assessed by knemometry in pediatric subjects with mild asthma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects will include females (6 to 9 years of age) and males (6 to 11 years of age). 2. All subjects must have a history of physician diagnosed mild intermittent or mild persistent asthma as documented by PCP medical record or detailed history by study investigator. 3. All subjects must have a height within normal limits (5th to 95th percentile) and no history of abnormal growth as assessed by medical history. 4. All subjects must be prepubertal (Tanner Stage 1 Sexual Maturity) as assessed by physical examination. 5. Subjects may be on current treatment with montelukast as this drug does not affect growth. If a subject is on montelukast at screening/baseline, they will remain on a stable dose throughout the study. 6. Subjects must be willing to comply with study requirements. 1. Subjects will be excluded if they have asthma greater than mild persistent severity as defined by NHLBI guidelines. 2. Subjects will be excluded if they used any systemic or nasal steroids within the past 60 days. 3. Subjects will be excluded if they had more than one burst of systemic steroids within the past year. 4. Subjects will be excluded if their baseline FEV1 is &lt; 80% predicted. 5. Subjects will be excluded if they have any other serious systemic disease other than asthma. 6. Subjects will be excluded if they have taken any medication known to affect growth i.e. ADHD medications within the past 60 days 7. Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of allergy to any of the study medications, milk protein or lactose. 8. Subjects will be excluded if they have active chickenpox or measles or recent exposure to chickenpox or measles. 9. Subjects will be excluded if they have any history of tuberculosis of the respiratory tract. 10. Subjects will be excluded if they have any active fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections. 11. Subjects will be excluded if they have any history of herpes simplex infection of the eye. 12. Subjects will be excluded if they have taken any immunosuppressive drugs within the past 2 months. 13. Subjects will be excluded if they have any history of ChurgStrauss syndrome or other eosinophilic disorders. 14. Subjects will be excluded if an investigator deems they have any mental or development health issues, such as autism, moderate to severe mental retardation or severe ADHD,that interferes with their ability to complete the knemometry measurements. 15. Subjects will be excluded if an investigator deems they have any physical issues, such as inability to sit independently or amputation of lower leg, that interferes with their ability to complete the knemometry measurements.</criteria>
