	<brief_summary>The Covidien OneShot™ ablation system use is to deliver low-level radio frequency (RF) energy through the wall of the renal artery to denervate the human kidney.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Renal Sympathetic Denervation for Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unique to the OneShot™ ablation system is the ability to deliver the desired helical treatment pattern for optimal Renal Denervation (RDN) with a single balloon based-treatment, eliminating user variance inherent in the currently available point-by-point approach. In addition, technological improvements have been incorporated. The OneShot™ RF generator has a touchscreen, user friendly interface; catheter advancement is made safer with the use of a guidewire; two radiopaque markers on the catheter enable more precise device positioning; and the irrigated catheter tip reduces the risk of overheating and clot formation during RF delivery. By offering a more reliable single treatment approach, coupled with enhanced ease-of use and reduced procedure times, this technology has the potential to significantly expand clinical adoption of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation.</detailed_description>
