	<brief_summary>This research study is a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial evaluating the benefit of IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev™) as adjuvant analgesia in geriatric hip fracture patients. IV acetaminophen has received FDA approval. IV acetaminophen does not have the liver toxicity as oral acetaminophen. No oral acetaminophen will be administered. All patients diagnosed with a hip fracture aged at least 65 years and expected to undergo surgical intervention are eligible to participate. Hip fractures affect greater than 300,000 geriatric patients annually, representing the second leading cause of hospitalization for this patient population. Pain control in these patients is often problematic due to co-morbidities and changes in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Subjects may receive the normal DVT prophylactic treatments post-op.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Acetaminophen as Adjuvant Therapy for Pain Control in Geriatric Hip Fracture Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 46 subjects will be enrolled at LGH. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either IV acetaminophen 1000 mg q6 hours (FDA recommended dose) or IV placebo. While receiving the study drug/placebo the subject's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, &amp; pain intensity will be monitored. Additional pain meds will be given if needed. Study treatment will continue until subject is taken into the operating room; at that time the intervention will be discontinued and other pain medication will be provided. Participation in the study will end at time of discharge from the hospital. Researchers are expecting a 33% decrease in opioid use for subjects randomized to treatment group.</detailed_description>
