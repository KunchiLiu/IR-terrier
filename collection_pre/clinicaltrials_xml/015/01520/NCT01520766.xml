	<brief_title>Prefabricated Endodontic Posts: Glass Fiber Versus Titanium - A Randomized Controlled Pilot- Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared to vital teeth the complication rate of restorations fixed on endodontically treated abutment teeth is higher. Endodontically treated teeth are more prone to fracture due to the higher amount of calcified tooth structure loss. To level the biological short coming the choice of the mechanically appropriate post material is still a major concern. There a two major approaches. One is to use a rigid material to stiffen the post-endodontic complex and the other is to use a material which shows dentin-like material properties to allow the post-endodontic complex to flex under load. It was aim of the presented randomised controlled trial to compare the survival rates of abutment teeth self-adhesively restored with either prefabricated glass-fiber reinforced composite posts or titanium posts. The null-hypothesis was that there is no difference regarding survival rate between glass-fiber and titanium post restored endodontically treated abutment teeth with two or less remaining cavity walls.</detailed_description>
