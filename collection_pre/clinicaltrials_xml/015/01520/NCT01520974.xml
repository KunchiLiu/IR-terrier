	<brief_title>Effect of an Oral Probiotic Tablet on Oral Bacteria and Clinical Measurements (ProBiora3)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are over 500 types of bacteria in the mouth. Most of these bacteria do not cause disease. However, some mouth bacteria can cause tooth decay and gum disease. The purpose of a probiotic tablet for the mouth is to put known healthy bacteria in the mouth. This study will compare the effect of the probiotic tablet on the levels of harmful or disease causing bacteria in the mouth to a placebo tablet that does not contain any probiotic bacteria.</detailed_description>
