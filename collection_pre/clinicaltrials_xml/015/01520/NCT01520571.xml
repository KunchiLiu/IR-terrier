	<brief_summary>The investigators asked: (1) Do computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKAs) provide better alignment and clinical function? (2) Do computer-assisted TKAs provide better survivorship of implants and less complication? and (3) Do correction of the mechanical axis of the lower limb to within 3° of neutral is a prognostic marker for late revision surgery due to aseptic loosening?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Do We Need Computer Assistance To Improve the Survival of Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty. A Minimum Ten Years Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is reported to improve the overall accuracy of positioning of the femoral and tibia components. However, an acceptable target for alignment remains a matter for debate. A mechanical axis within 3° of neutral axis has been used as the primary outcome measure in many clinical trials comparing computer-assisted- and conventional TKA. However, the evidence supporting this arbitrary value is unreliable because previous reports are limited by their small sample size, inadequate radiographs, short follow-up and lack of clarity when defining a margin of accuracy.</detailed_description>
