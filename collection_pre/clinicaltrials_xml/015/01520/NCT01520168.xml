	<detailed_description>From 2003 to 2005(2006) we implanted Komposix Kugel Meshes in 21 Patients with incisional ventral hernias. With the recall of January 2006 (in Germany), we stopped the implantation of this mesh and continued to monitor the patients with follow up and phone interviews. Late complications still continue to occur, mainly as a consequence of the product defect identified 7 years ago.</detailed_description>
