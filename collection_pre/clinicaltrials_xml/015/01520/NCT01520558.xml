	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical study designed to examine the safety of infusing escalating doses of CNDO-109-Activated Allogeneic Natural Killer Cells-(from a first or second degree relative), after a preparatory chemotherapy regimen, in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are in their first complete remission at the time of enrollment, are not candidates for stem cell transplant, and are considered to be at high risk for recurrence.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. The patient has pathologically documented AML and is in CR1 at the time of the screening visit 2. The patient achieved CR1 within 10 weeks of the screening visit; the patient may have received postremission consolidation therapy (except for transplant) prior to the screening visit 3. A bone marrow aspiration performed within 21 days prior to the start of preinfusion preparative therapy confirms the patient is in CR1 4. The patient has either refused or is not considered an appropriate immediate candidate for transplantation and is considered to be at high risk for recurrence by having at least one of the following prognostic factors: High risk cytogenetics (5, 7, del(5q), abnormal 3q, 11q23 translocations, complex cytogenetics) or if cytogenetics are normal the presence of a FLT3 mutation without a NPM1 mutation Age &gt; 60 years Antecedent hematological disorder (AHD) AML that is considered to be therapyrelated FAB subtype M0 (minimally differentiated acute myeloblastic leukemia), M6 (acute erythroid leukemias, including erythroleukemia (M6a) and pure erythroid leukemia (M6b)), or M7 (acute megakaryoblastic leukemia) 5. The patient is male or female, age 18 years or older 6. The patient has an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 7. The patient has an available NK cell donor who is a HLA haploidentical firstdegree (parent, child, or sibling) or seconddegree (child of a sibling) relative; minimum testing will be for HLAA, HLAB, and HLADR with donors matched for 3/6, 4/6 or 5/6 antigens 8. The patient has an absence of coexisting medical problems that would significantly increase the risk of the chemotherapy procedure (e.g. poor left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF&lt;40%]) 9. The patient has recovered from reversible toxicity from prior therapy. Permanent and stable side effects or changes are acceptable if ≤ Grade 1 (CTCAE, v4.03) 10. The patient has serum creatinine &lt;2×ULN and not rising for at least 24 weeks before chemotherapy. If elevated, the 24hour creatinine clearance must be &gt;50 mL/min 11. The patient has serum total bilirubin &lt; 2 g/dL (unless the patient has a diagnosis of Gilbert's disease), SGOT (ALT) &lt;3.5×ULN, and SGPT (AST) &lt;3.5×ULN 12. The patient has an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/µL, platelets ≥100,000/µL and is not transfusion dependent for platelets and/or red cells 13. The patient has LVEF ≥40% by ECHO or MUGA scan and no clinically significant abnormalities in 12lead ECG 14. The patient has a PT (or INR) and PTT up to 1.25×ULN 15. The patient must not be dependent on supplemental oxygen 16. The patient is using an effective contraceptive (per the institutional standard), if procreative potential exists 17. The patient must be willing and able to comply with all study protocol requirements. The patient or a legally authorized representative must fully understand all elements of the informed consent and have signed the informed consent according to institutional and federal regulatory requirements 18. The patient has not received an investigational chemotherapy within the last 28 days prior to the screening visit and has never received investigational immunotherapy. In addition, the patient must not receive treatment for AML (including treatment with IL2 or IFNγ) in the interval of time between the screening visit and initiation of preinfusion preparative therapy 1. The patient had a previous bone marrow or stem cell transplant 2. The patient is seropositive for HIV 1, HIV 2, HBV, or HCV 3. The patient has a psychiatric, addictive, neurological or other disorder that compromises the ability to give informed consent or comply with study requirements 4. The patient is pregnant (confirmed by urine or serum pregnancy test) or lactating 5. The patient has a recently diagnosed active malignancy requiring therapy 6. The patient has an uncontrolled infection, or is receiving antifungal treatment for an ongoing infection 7. The patient has known hypersensitivity to bovine proteins 8. The patient has any condition that will place the patient at undue risk or discomfort as a result of adherence to study procedures 9. The patient requires treatment with corticosteroids at a dose &gt; 0.1 mg/kg/day or has a known allergy to DSMO</criteria>
