	<brief_title>The Immune System's Response to Young Women's Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will be looking at the level of immune suppression in different types of breast cancer. The investigators will use blood, urine, and tissue samples from patients with Pregnancy Associated Breast Cancer (PABC) versus non-PABC, as well as comparing different types of breast cancer. If tissue sampling permits, the investigators may use some of the breast cancer tissue to develop models for human cancer for drug targeting. Understanding the immune response and suppression in different types of cancer will help us understand mechanisms involved in breast cancer better and help the investigators in developing new treatment in the future.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Females 50 or younger Histological or cytological confirmation of breast cancer Any clinical stage is allowed Any known autoimmune condition, chronic steroid use, underlying immune disease (other than breast cancer), use of immunomodulatory prescription drugs for any medical condition. The presence of other comorbid conditions known to impact immune function, (such as: type I diabetes, uncontrolled adult onset diabetes, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), uncontrolled infection or known HIV infection.) Underlying psychiatric condition which would, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude compliance with study requirements Diagnosed with another type of cancer within 5 years except for breast cancer, cervical or nonmelanomatous skin cancer.</criteria>
