	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tumor tissue and blood samples from patients with small cell lung cancer registered on CALGB-140202.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers in Tumor Tissue and Blood Samples From Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer Registered on CALGB-140202</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To identify the major genetic alterations in human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) using next-generation sequencing and focusing on mutations in coding sequence. Secondary - To follow up with in-depth assessment of candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes using gene expression analysis, cell culture systems, and murine models of SCLC. OUTLINE: DNA isolated from archived tumor tissue and blood samples are analyzed for genetic mutations and gene expression profiling using Illumina exome sequencing. Results are compared with transcriptome of tumors (or cell lines) with and without the specific mutation. Cell culture studies overexpressing or inhibiting the genes of interest are also performed in a mouse model to identified potential drivers of small cell lung cancer.</detailed_description>
