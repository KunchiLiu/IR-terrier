	<brief_summary>This study has an open-label, five-period, single-sequence design. The purpose of this study is as follows; 1. Primary - To evaluate the influence of genotype of drug metabolizing enzyme or transporter on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel - To evaluate the influence of aspirin on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel 2. Secondary - To explore the representative biomarkers for the variable pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel - To evaluate the influence of genotype of drug metabolizing enzyme or transporter on the drug-drug interactions between aspirin and clopidogrel - To explore the representative biomarkers for the drug-drug interactions between aspirin and clopidogrel</brief_summary>
