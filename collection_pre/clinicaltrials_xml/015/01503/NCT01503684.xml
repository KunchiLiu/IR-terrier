	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Exhaled Breath Condensates of Septic Patients to Predict Development of Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this proposed project, we will focus on the identification of potential biomarkers in EBC with ability to predict development of multi-organ failure. Currently, no tools could be used to evaluate the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis. All the human studies discussing mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis use tissue biopsies as study materials. Repeated tissue biopsy is invasive and not applicable. EBC could be collected non-invasively and conveniently. A study has demonstrated the use of metabolomic technologies in mitochondrial diseases. We believe that the metabolomic biomarkers of EBC could be used to demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction in lungs and respiratory tracts of septic patients. Such metabolomic biomarkers may also reflect similar on-going mitochondrial dysfunction in other organ systems, and could potentially become a novel diagnostic tool and a therapeutic target in future sepsis therapy.</detailed_description>
