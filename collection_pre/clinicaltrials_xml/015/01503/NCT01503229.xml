	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well abiraterone acetate works in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has spread from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body (metastatic). Abiraterone acetate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate in Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the magnitude of tissue testosterone suppression by abiraterone acetate in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (resistant to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist or orchiectomy Â± antiandrogen) after one month of treatment to establish tissue based mechanism of action. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the ability of abiraterone acetate to suppress tumor testosterone after 12 weeks of treatment. II. To determine tissue testosterone from metastasis at time of progression during abiraterone acetate treatment. III. To determine response to dose escalation of abiraterone acetate at clinical progression. IV. To determine potential mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate by analyzing pharmacokinetics at clinical progression, tissue androgen levels at baseline and at radiographic progression, evaluating wild type and splice variant androgen receptor (AR) levels at baseline and at time of progression and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray at progression. V. To determine if micro-ribonucleic acid (RNA) acquired from peripheral blood reflect molecular changes in tumor metastases and are a potential biomarker for mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance. VI. To evaluate pharmacokinetics of dose escalated abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) at 1000 mg twice daily. OUTLINE: Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and prednisone PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
