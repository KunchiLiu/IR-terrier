	<brief_summary>The purpose of the parent study is to assess the short-term safety and tolerability of soluble ferric pyrophosphate (SFP) in dialysate administered to a large number of representative adult chronic kidney disease patients on hemodialysis (CKD-HD). The purpose of the extension study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of SFP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of Soluble Ferric Pyrophosphate (SFP) in Dialysate in CKD Patients Receiving Chronic Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parent Study: randomized, double-blinded, crossover, up to 6 weeks, 700 patients. Patients were randomized to receive SFP 2 µmoles (110 µg) iron/L of dialysate in liquid bicarbonate concentrate or placebo (standard liquid bicarbonate concentrate) x 2 weeks, then a 1 week washout, then crossed over to the alternate treatment x 2 weeks. Extension Study: open-label, single active arm, uncontrolled study, up to 53 weeks, 300 patients. Following completion of the RMTI-SFP-6 parent study, patients could enter the extension study, where they received SFP 2 µmoles (110 µg) iron/L of dialysate in liquid bicarbonate concentrate for up to 52 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Parent Study, Double Blinded, Crossover: Key 1. Adult ≥ 18 years of age. 2. Has chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) (CKDHD subjects) and regularly undergoing 2 or more dialysis sessions per week. 3. Stable predialysis Hgb ≥ 9.0 to ≤ 12.5 g/dL. 4. Stable predialysis TSAT ≥ 15% to ≤ 45%. 5. Stable predialysis ferritin ≥ 100 to ≤ 1200 µg/L (1200 ng/mL). Key 1. Any previous exposure to SFP. 2. Therapy with intravenous, intramuscular or oral iron at any time between the first/screening visit and the randomization visit, or anticipated requirement for iron supplementation during the study period. 3. Nontunneled vascular catheter for dialysis. 4. Scheduled for kidney transplant within the next 8 weeks. 5. Active infection requiring systemic antimicrobial or antifungal therapy within 2 weeks prior to screening, or during screening period prior to randomization. 6. Hospitalization within 1 month prior to screening (except for vascular access surgery). Extension Study, Open Label, Single Active Arm: Key 1. Participated in Parent Study RMTISFP6 and completed the followup/early term visit. 2. Hemoglobin ≤12.0 g/dL at screening. 3. TSAT ≤45% at screening. (Excursion of TSAT by ≤10% outside this range permitted only if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met). 4. Serum ferritin ≤1000 µg/L at screening. (Excursion of ferritin by ≤10% outside this range permitted only if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met). Key 1. Had a serious adverse event attributable (i.e., probably, possibly, or definitely related) to study drug or had an adverse event attributable to study drug that necessitated premature withdrawal from the doubleblind, placebocontrolled crossover phase of the parent study RMTISFP6. 2. Nontunneled vascular catheter for dialysis. 3. Scheduled for kidney transplant within 12 weeks after entry into extension phase. 4. Active infection requiring systemic antimicrobial or antifungal therapy within 2 weeks prior to dosing. 5. Pregnancy or intention to become pregnant during the study.</criteria>
