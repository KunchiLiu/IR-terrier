	<brief_summary>The purpose of this school-based trial is to test the efficacy of an intervention to increase moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among middle school girls. The 17-week "Girls on the Move" (GOTM) intervention has 3 components. Two individual-level components occurring during school hours include: (1) two face-to-face motivational, individually tailored counseling sessions with a school nurse, and (2) an interactive Internet-based session during which each girl receives motivational, individually tailored feedback messages (at 9 weeks). A group-level component, 90-minute Physical Activity (PA) Club provides an important venue after school that includes activities to assist girls in establishing a behavioral pattern of MVPA. The control condition will complete data collection activities and receive their usual school offerings. The investigators hypothesize that immediately post-intervention, minutes of MVPA will be greater by 16 min./wk. in the intervention than control group; At 9 months post-intervention follow-up, minutes of MVPA will be greater in the intervention than control group; and immediately post-intervention and 9-mo. post-intervention follow-up, cardiovascular (CV) fitness will be higher and body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat will be lower in the intervention than control group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our 17-week "Girls on the Move" (GOTM) intervention for middle school girls applies the Health Promotion Model (HPM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and has 3 components. Two individual-level components occurring during school hours include: (1) two face-to-face motivational, individually tailored counseling sessions with a school nurse (occurring at baseline and near 17 wks.), and (2) an interactive Internet-based session during which each girl receives motivational, individually tailored feedback messages (at 9 wks.). A group-level component, 90-min. PA Club, led by PA instructors (e.g., individuals from community; teachers, including physical education (PE); and sports team coaches) provides an important venue after school that includes MVPAs (requested by girls in pilot) to assist girls in establishing a behavioral pattern of MVPA. The control condition will complete data collection activities and receive their usual school offerings. The purpose of this school-based group randomized trial (GRT) is to evaluate the efficacy of the comprehensive GOTM intervention to increase middle school girls' min. of MVPA and improve cardiovascular (CV) fitness, body mass index (BMI), and percent body fat (% BF) immediately post-intervention (after 17 wks.) and at 9-mo. follow-up (F/U; 9 mos. after end of intervention). Secondary analyses will examine if MVPA is mediated by cognitive (e.g., perceived benefits of PA, barriers to PA, and PA self-efficacy; social support) and affective variables (e.g., enjoyment of and motivation for PA). Based on demographics of the urban schools, we expect a low-SES, mixed-race, predominately African American, sample. Eight schools will be randomly assigned to the PA intervention (n = 4) or comparison condition (n = 4) in the fall of yrs. 2, 3, and 4 (total N = 8 X 3 = 24 different schools). Sixty-two girls meeting inclusion criteria based on answers to a screening tool will be recruited in each school during each of the three yrs. The long-term goal is to increase MVPA as a means to address the high overweight and obesity prevalence among adolescent girls.</detailed_description>
