	<brief_summary>1. Chinese herb nephropathy (CHN), a kind of kidney failure caused by Chinese herbs, may be related to the a component called aristolochic acid (AA). 2. AA may form AA-DNA adducts and accumulate in the kidney and ureter and cause kidney failure and/or cancer 3. Different enzymes have been reported to detoxify plant alkaloids or other components. Genes that regulate the production of these metabolic enzymes may affect the chance of CHN. 4. By comparing the differences in the polymorphisms of these genes between patient with CHN and control, we may find the changes that play a significant genetic factors for CHN.</brief_summary>
