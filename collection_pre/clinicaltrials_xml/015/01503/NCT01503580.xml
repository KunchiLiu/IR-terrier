	<brief_summary>Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) affects around 17 % of female population. However, the etiology of OAB was complicated and unclear in many aspects. In particular, the research about psychiatric aspect of etiology in OAB was paucity. Besides, research about prognostic factors and impact of cardiovascular system of OAB treatment was also paucity. Therefore the aims of the investigators study were (1) to analyze the etiology of OAB in psychiatric aspects; (2) to analyze the prognostic factors associated with tolterodine treatment; (3) to analyze the differences of cardiac conduction and heart rate variability before and after tolterodine treatment; (4) to analyze the differences of arterial stiffness between non-OAB and OAB female patients, and before and after tolterodine treatment.</brief_summary>
