	<brief_title>Early Diagnosis of Postoperative Acute Renal Failure-using Biomarker to Predict Outcome of Cardiac Surgery Associated Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common syndrome on Intensive Care Unit, and renal dysfunction would result in a further morbidity and mortality. Critical ills complicated with acute kidney injury are usually accompanied with multi-organ failure. Therefore, National Taiwan University Hospital Study group of Acute Renal Failure (NSARF) realizes that the characteristics of AKI is resulted from the perfusion less of body fluid and attempt to develop therapies to prevent or attenuate AKI, which have had limited success. We attempt to use the novel biomarker soluble hemojuvelin (sHJV) to evaluate the iron homeostasis on acute kidney injury and develop new strategies and therapies such as protease inhibitors on kidney function, as safety markers to monitor toxicity and as measures of treatment effect. Besides, we will focus on validation the sensitivity and specificity of sHJV on the clinical specimen of post-operative patients from NSARF data-bank. Merge the renal function and other types of biomarkers as panel to predict the post-operative outcome. Based on the different expression of these markers, using a panel of serum and urine markers may potentially help us to distinguish between various types of insults, establish the duration and severity of injury, predict the clinical outcome and help to monitor response to treatment in AKI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>AKI is defined as a serum creatinine level greater that 50% more than baseline during the first 3 postoperative days (PODs), and nonAKI, as a less than 10% increase. Patients with chronic kidney disease (baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by using the 4variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, or proteincreatinine ratio &gt; 100 mg/mmol) are excluded.</criteria>
