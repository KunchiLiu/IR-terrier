	<brief_summary>Accelerometer-based neuromuscular monitoring is not the gold-standard method to evaluate residual postoperative paralysis but it represents the most simple, inexpensive and widespread tool in clinical practice. Train-of-four ratio (TOF-ratio) of 100% is considered the gold-standard to avoid PORC (post operative residual curarization). This clinical trial is conducted to verify the reliability of accelerometer-based neuromuscular monitoring in order to exclude postoperative residual paralysis which is not highlighted by this instrument at a TOF-ratio=100%. The study evaluates patients' neuromuscular recovery evaluated using pulmonary function tests after extubation at a TOFratio=100%. Administering placebo or sugammadex at a TOF ratio=100% allows to evaluate whether the recovery of muscle function is concrete, although the monitoring device shows a complete decurarization; patients treated with sugammadex should not be capable to perform better pulmonary function tests if a TOF ratio=100% is reliable.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Accelerometer-Based Neuromuscular Monitoring Reliability to Exclude Postoperative Residual Paralysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From the beginning of the surgery to the time of extubation neuromuscular block is monitored with accelerographic monitor TOF-Watch SX. Patients are extubated when TOF-ratio is 100%. Patients will perform pulmonary function tests (PFTs): - the day ahead of surgery (for elegibility and training) - 60 minutes before surgery - 10 minutes after extubation - 5 minutes after sugammadex or placebo administration - 20 minutes after sugammadex or placebo administration. The following parameters will be evaluated and compared between the 2 groups: - Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) - Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) - Forced Expiratory Volume in the first Second (FEV1) - Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) - Ratio of Maximum Expiratory Flow and Maximum Inspiratory Flow rate at 50% of vital capacity (MEF50/MIF50) - PaO2, PaCO2, pH - heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate Changes of pulmonary tests performed before and after sugammadex or placebo will be compared between study groups.</detailed_description>
