	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Peripheral Blood Mononucleated Cells for Treatment of Liver Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>G-colony stimulating factor(5ug/kg/day)will be administered twice subcutaneously for 3 days to three patients with liver cirrhosis. On the day 4th, plasmapheresis will be done to collect peripheral blood mononucleated cells . And then we are going to infuse the collected peripheral blood mononucleated cells of their own through the portal vein of each patients under ultrasonographic guidance.</detailed_description>
