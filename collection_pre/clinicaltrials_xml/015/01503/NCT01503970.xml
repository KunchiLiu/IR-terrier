	<brief_title>Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation For Articular Cartilage Regeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injuries to the articular cartilage of the knee are common. They produce pain and deteriotation of patients' quality of life. The management of focal chondral lesions continues to be problematic for the treating orthopaedic surgeon. Although many treatment options are currently available, none fulfill the criteria for an ideal repair solution: a hyaline repair tissue that completely fills the defect and integrates well with the surrounding normal cartilage. Autologous chondrocyte implantation is a relatively new cell-based treatment method for full-thickness cartilage injuries that in recent years has increased in popularity, with different studies showing promising results. Typically, this implantation is performed in an open-surgery fashion. In our study the implantation of in-house autologous chondrocyte culture is done arthroscopically, situation that may offer advantages in surgery associated morbidity and patient recovery.</detailed_description>
