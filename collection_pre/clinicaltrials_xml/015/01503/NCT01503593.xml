	<brief_summary>The study was designed to assess the effectiveness of conservation ridge preservation (horizontal and vertical dimension) after tooth extraction with and without combination of bone substitutes based on synthetic (calcium sulfate mixed with phosphate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Combination of Synthetic Bone Substitutes During Extractions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using the combination of these two bone substitute is taken in order to diminish the alveolar ridge alternations after tooth extraction. the investigator will measure the horizontal and vertical changes (primary outcome) and the adverse effects (secondary outcome)in 4 months period</detailed_description>
