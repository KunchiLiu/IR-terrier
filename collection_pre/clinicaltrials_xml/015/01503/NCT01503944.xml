	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability to identify individuals with dopaminergic degeneration in group of patients with a clinical diagnosis of either dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or idiopathic Parkinson's disease and to differentiate them from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control subjects.</brief_summary>
