	<brief_summary>Adults with Social Phobia will be randomly assigned to either an attention bias modification treatment, interpretation bias modification treatment, both, or a placebo control condition not designed to change cognitive bias patterns. Outcome measures will be social anxiety symptoms and severity as measured by gold standard questionnaires as well as diagnosis of social phobia disorder and symptom counts derived from structured clinical interviews based on DSM-IV criteria. The investigators expect to find significant reduction in social anxiety symptoms in the Treatment groups relative to the placebo control group. The investigators want to find out the relative efficacy of attention and interpretation oriented treatments and the combination of the two.</brief_summary>
