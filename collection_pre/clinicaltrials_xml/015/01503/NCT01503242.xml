	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8 when given together with fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation followed by donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8, fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before the transplant together with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening and may be an effective treatment for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>90 Y-BC8-DOTA Monoclonal Antibody, Fludarabine Phosphate, and Total-Body Irradiation Followed by Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the tissue localization of 111In-BC8-DOTA antibody therapy (Ab) and establish reproducibly favorable biodistribution. II. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation delivered via 90Y-BC8-DOTA Ab when combined with fludarabine phosphate (FLU) and 2 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) as a preparative regimen followed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, related or unrelated hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for patients with multiple myeloma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the potential efficacy of this approach, within the limits of a phase I study, by examining disease response, duration of remission, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8 (90Y-BC8 Ab). Patients receive 90Y-BC8 Ab intravenously (IV) on day -12 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2. Patients undergo TBI and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0. Patients also receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 180 or on days -3 to 100 with taper to 180; and mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO BID on days 0-27, or 0-40 with taper to 96. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have history of symptomatic myeloma requiring treatment and meet one of the following requirements: Have at least 1 high risk feature at diagnosis (including deletion 13 or hypodiploidy by conventional cytogenetics, t(4;14), t(14;16) or deletion 17 by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH], beta 2 microglobulin &gt; 3.5, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] greater than 1.5 x upper limit of normal [ULN], history of plasma cell leukemia) (prior to chemotherapy); OR Have progressive disease on primary therapy with or without prior autologous stem cell transplant; OR Have persistent or progressive disease following autologous transplant; it is acceptable for these patients to have a second transplant for disease reduction Bone marrow cellularity of &gt;= 50% of age defined normal values by core biopsy; cellularity must be evaluated within 90 days of the dosimetry infusion and at least 21 days after receiving any cytoreductive/myelosuppressive chemotherapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) =&lt; 2 Measured creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min or estimated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min For females of childbearing potential, must have a negative pregnancy test Patients must have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‐matched related donor or an unrelated donor who meets standard Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and or National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) or other donor center criteria for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donation, or bone marrow donation as follows: Related donor related to the patient and genotypically or phenotypically identical for HLAA, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1; phenotypic identity must be confirmed by highresolution typing Unrelated donor: Matched for HLA‐A, B, C, DRB1 DQB1 by high resolution typing; OR Mismatched for a single allele without antigen mismatching at HLA‐A, B, or C as defined by high resolution typing but otherwise matched for HLA‐A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high resolution typing Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele, in the graft rejection vector are considered a two‐allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA Class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive anti‐donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion Ability to provide informed consent DONOR: Patients must have an HLA matched donor as well as standard Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and or National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)/other donor center criteria for PBSC donation DONOR: Donors must consent and be eligible to undergo granulocyte colonystimulating factor (GCSF) mobilization and PBSC harvest;
