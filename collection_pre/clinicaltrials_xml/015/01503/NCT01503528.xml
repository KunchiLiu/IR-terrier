	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine if three different methods for providing postoperative analgesia following total knee joint arthroplasty affect outcomes. These outcomes include pain and function for a period of up to 3 months, and specific non-pain outcomes, including cardiac, respiratory, central nervous system, thromboembolism, infection, nausea and vomiting and urinary retention. Economic outcomes will also be examined, including length of hospital stay, direct health care costs and patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes After Total Knee Joint Arthroplasty : A Comparative Study Using 3 Different Analgesic Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our objective is to compare the three analgesic regimes for total knee joint arthroplasty currently practiced at our institution with regard to their impact on patient outcomes in the immediate postoperative period and for up to 6 months. The outcome measures that we will be prospectively looking at are: A. Pain and functional outcomes: Twice a day pain scores following activity during the in hospital stay, number of days that patient requires oral narcotics, presence of complex regional pain syndrome, presence and extent of wound hyperalgesia at 3 months, WOMAC scores preoperatively and at 6weeks and 3 months. 'Timed up and go' test will be performed on day 3 or at discharge and at 2 weeks and 3 months. Incidence of falls while in hospital and following discharge. B. Specific non pain outcomes Cardiac: Myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, Congestive failure, new onset arrhythmia, death Respiratory: Hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen beyond 24 hours, pneumonia, pneumonia requiring prolonged hospital stay CNS: postoperative delirium, cerebrovascular accident DVT: symptomatic DVT, asymptomatic DVT, Pulmonary emboli Infection: wound infection, prosthetic infection, need for major plastic reconstructive surgery or amputation. Incidence of nausea and vomiting. Incidence of urinary catheterization. C. Economic outcomes: Length of hospital stay, direct health care costs, patient satisfaction Primary hypothesis (null): Perioperative analgesia provided by femoral and sciatic catheters, or by peri-articular wound catheters does not reduce the rate of combined serious outcomes compared with analgesia provided by peri-articular infiltration alone.. Secondary hypotheses (null): 1. Perioperative analgesia provided by femoral and sciatic catheters or by peri-articular wound catheters does not improve functional recovery compared with analgesia provided by peri-articular infiltration alone. 2. Perioperative analgesia provided by femoral and sciatic catheters, or by peri-articular wound catheters does not reduce the cost of delivery of care compared with analgesia provided by peri-articular infiltration alone. 3. Perioperative analgesia provided by femoral and sciatic catheters or by peri-articular wound catheters is not improved compared with analgesia provided by peri-articular infiltration alone.</detailed_description>
