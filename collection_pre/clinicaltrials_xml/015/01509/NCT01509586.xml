	<brief_summary>This nationwide telephone and mail- based research study will recruit 1,400 cigarette smokers who are not motivated to quit to test the effects of a marketed oral, non-combustible smokeless tobacco product on cigarette smoking behaviors. It will also track the participants' usage patterns of the smokeless tobacco product. Half of the participants will receive a new, potentially safer tobacco product during the first six weeks of the study, and half will not. During this six-week period, each participant will complete three brief phone interviews. After this first six week period, participants will complete 6 other brief follow-up interviews, where they will answer questionnaires about their smoking habits.</brief_summary>
