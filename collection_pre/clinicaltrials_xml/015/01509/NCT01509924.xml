	<detailed_description>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by ischemia, i.e. loss of blood flow. The symptoms of a TIA typically resolve within 24 hours. Attacks lasting more than 30 minutes are unusual. TIAs and strokes present with the same symptoms such as sudden weakness, numbness, sudden dimming or loss of vision, aphasia, slurred speech, facial palsy and mental impairments. Subtle problems with cognitive functions and fatigue may not always be addressed before discharge. However, even subtle mental impairments are important to identify, given the problems they might pose.</detailed_description>
