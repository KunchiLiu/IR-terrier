	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether administration of 150 mg clopidogrel is effective in reducing the one-year incidence of thromboischemic events in patients with high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity compared to 75 mg clopidogrel in the patient population overweight or obese with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg.m-2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Platelet Inhibition According to Clopidogrel Dose in Patients With Body Mass Index ≥ 27</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal is to evaluate the effect of the double maintenance dose of clopidogrel versus single dose in patients with proven coronary and with BMI ≥ 27 kg.m-2 1 - Biologically: study and compare the respective effects of the double dose and single dose of clopidogrel on platelet aggregation. 2 - Clinically: to study and compare the cardiovascular events and adverse effects depending on the dose of clopidogrel.</detailed_description>
