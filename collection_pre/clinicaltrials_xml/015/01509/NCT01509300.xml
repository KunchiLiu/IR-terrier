	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI) and fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin may induce the engraftment cross the immunologic barrier in the setting of HLA-haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In addition, T-cell depletion may contribute to prevent developing severe acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) in haploidentical transplantation. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TBI, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin with T-cell depleted graft from haploidentical donors in treating patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
