	<brief_summary>Hyperphosphatemia is a common and severe complication in chronic kidney disease patients treated with hemodialysis. A phosphate restricted diet and oral phosphate binders are the cornerstones in the prevention and treatment of this complication. However, noncompliance is an prevalent problem resulting in poorly controled hyperphosphatemia in a substantial proportion of hemodialysis patients. The present study aims at identifying risk factors for non compliance and also test the hypothesis that compliance can be improved by education patients on the consequences of hyperphosphatemia and the importance of diet and phosphate binder therapy.</brief_summary>
