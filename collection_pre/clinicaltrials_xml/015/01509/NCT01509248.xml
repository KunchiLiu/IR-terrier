	<brief_summary>1. Population pharmacokinetics : The purpose of this study is - to investigate the population pharmacokinetics of theophylline in premature Korean infants and to assess the influence of demographic and clinical covariates. 2. Metabolomics : The purpose of this study are - to predict serum theophylline levels and to assess CYP1A2 activities in premature infants by analyzing urinary metabolites of theophylline - to examine which factors affect clearance of theophylline and CYP1A2 activity in premature infants</brief_summary>
