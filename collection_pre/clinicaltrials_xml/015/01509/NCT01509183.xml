	<brief_summary>Asthmapolis is collaborating with Catholic Healthcare West (CHW) to carry out a focused demonstration project to evaluate the effectiveness and potential cost savings of a deployment of the Asthmapolis approach to asthma management. The Asthmapolis goal is to bring together the best technology and asthma insight in order to provide CHW with an engaging, data-driven chronic care program to improve asthma management and lower healthcare utilization costs, and to respond to prevention-focused reforms to health insurance laws. This project has been designed to implement and evaluate a data-driven program to improve asthma management and control and lower direct costs through reductions in healthcare utilization. This program has been developed by Asthmapolis and has gone through preliminary testing. Each subject participating in the study will receive an Asthmapolis device, which captures the time and location of use of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators over a twelve-month period. This information is processed and delivered at regular intervals to the patient and his or her provider to support improved asthma management. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of the adoption of the Asthmapolis system into a healthcare organization, and to provide sufficient information to inform decision making for potential future adopters. The researchers believe that the Asthmapolis system has the potential to improve asthma control by providing rescue inhaler actuation data and tailored asthma management tips to patients with uncontrolled asthma, and rescue inhaler actuation data to their providers. Improvements in asthma control should be reflected in reductions in healthcare utilization for asthma, and potentially for general healthcare utilization. Reductions in utilization would result in lower healthcare costs. The study has been designed to capture data on individual subject asthma control, and changes in utilization and costs over a one-year introduction period.</brief_summary>
