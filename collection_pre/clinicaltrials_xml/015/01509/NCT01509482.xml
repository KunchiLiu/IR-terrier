	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance in men can be the underlying major factor in reproductive abnormalities ( chronic hypospermatogenesis ) as well as metabolic abnormalities similar to polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) in women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance in Idiopathic Oligospermia and Azoospermia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the past decade IR has been recognized as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism and metabolic abnormalities associated with PCOS . Theoretically IR in men may result in a similar reproductive abnormalities ( chronic hypospermatogenesis ) as well as other metabolic abnormalities similar to what happens in PCOS in women .</detailed_description>
