	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of phenylephrine versus ephedrine on organ perfusion, in women undergoing caesarean section receiving spinal anaesthesia. The organ perfusion is estimated by measuring the maternal cerebral oxygenation by NIRS(Near-infrared spectroscopy)and the foetal heartrate.</brief_summary>
