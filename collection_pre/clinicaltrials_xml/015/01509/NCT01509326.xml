	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effect of chiropractic treatment with and without the use of an acupressure pillow for cervical headaches. Subjects will be randomly allocated to groups with and without the pillow and will be followed for five weeks. The primary outcome measure will be headache frequency. The investigators predict that the group using the pillow on a daily basis will demonstrate significantly greater decrease in headache frequency over a 5-week interval.</brief_summary>
