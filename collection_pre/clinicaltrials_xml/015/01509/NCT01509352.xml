	<brief_summary>This is a prospective trial of the utility of esophageal stitches during fundoplication. The hypothesis is that recurrence rate may be different with or without the esophageal stitches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Trial Evaluating the Utility of Esophageal Stitches During Laparoscopic Fundoplication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single center, prospective randomized clinical trial involving patients who require an operation for gastroesophageal reflux disease. This is intended to be a definitive study. All patients will receive the standard operation for reflux: laparoscopic fundoplication. The dissection will be performed by leaving the phrenoesophageal membrane intact in all patients. One group will undergo laparoscopic fundoplication with 4 esophageal-crural sutures while the other group will not have these placed. The operation, post-operative care, and follow-up plan will otherwise not differ between groups.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients less than 7 years of age requiring fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease who are considered good laparoscopic candidates by the staff surgeon will be considered candidates. 1. Hiatal hernia demonstrated on preoperative contrast study, computed tomography, endoscopy, or intraoperative findings. 2. Prior esophageal operation (e.g. esophageal atresia repair, esophageal myotomy) 3. Prior operation for congenital diaphragmatic hernia 4. Patients not considered laparoscopic candidates by the staff surgeon or anesthesiologist (e.g. carbon dioxide retaining lung disease, congenital heart disease, or complex previous abdominal operations)</criteria>
