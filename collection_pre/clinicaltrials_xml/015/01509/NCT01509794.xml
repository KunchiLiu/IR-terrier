	<brief_summary>As simulation is now used in many post-graduate education and assessment domains, the investigators want to learn about how autonomically engaged healthcare providers are with the investigators computer simulation paradigm. The investigators are interested in the relationship between autonomic arousal (as measured by heart rate variability and galvanic skin response), self-report of engagement, and performance in the simulation and cognitive debriefing.</brief_summary>
