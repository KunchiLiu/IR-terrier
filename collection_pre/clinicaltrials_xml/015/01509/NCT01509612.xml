	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to investigate the validity of their previous results in a randomized prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter controlled evaluation of questionnaires in patients with advanced malignant tumors. The investigators plan to compare the treatment outcome (quality of life and survival) in tumor patients, receiving standard or "add-on" homeopathic treatment. The null hypothesis is that "add-on" homeopathic treatment does not create a benefit for cancer patients. In addition the investigators evaluate survival time.</brief_summary>
