	<brief_title>Varenicline for Adolescent Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this protocol is to examine the efficacy and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation in adolescents. The guiding design philosophy was to model the adult smoking cessation literature (allowing for indirect comparisons of efficacy in different populations) while fine-tuning some elements specifically geared for adolescents. After assessment and inclusion into the study, participants will be randomized to receive a 12-week double blind course of varenicline or placebo. Participants will provide smoking self-report (cigarettes per day) throughout the study. Biological confirmation with carbon monoxide breathalyzer will occur at all visits, and urine cotinine measurement will occur at key time points (baseline, end of treatment and final post-treatment follow-up). Psychiatric/medical visits will occur weekly throughout active treatment to systematically monitor safety and tolerability. After the 12-week treatment course, participants will return for 3 post-treatment follow-up visits (Week 13, Week 18, and Week 26).</detailed_description>
