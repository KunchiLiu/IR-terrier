	<brief_summary>Aim: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of glimepiride(G) and metformin(M) on vascular reactivity, haemostatic factors and glucose and lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: A prospective study will be performed in 20 uncontrolled patients previously treated with dietary intervention. Participants will randomized into M (750 to 2500 mg/day) or G (1 to 8 mg/day) therapy. After 4 months, the patients will be crossed-over with no washout period to the alternative treatment for an additional 4-month period on similar dosage schedule. - The following variables were assessed before (basal values) and after 4 months of each treatment period: 1. Hormonal and metabolic determinations: fasting plasma glucose, insulin, catecholamine, lipid profile and HbA1 levels. 2. Haemostatic factors: t-PA antigen and activity, PAI-1 antigen and activity, platelet aggregation, fibrinogen and plasminogen levels. 3. Cardiovascular evaluation: flow indexes of carotid and brachial arteries. Also, at the end of each treatment period, a 12-hour metabolic profile including measurements of glucose, insulin, glucagon, proinsulin and triglycerides levels at fasting and every 2 hours (7:00 am to 7:00 pm)will be done</brief_summary>
