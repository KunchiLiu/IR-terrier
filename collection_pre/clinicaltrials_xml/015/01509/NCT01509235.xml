	<brief_summary>In the current study, we designed a cross-over, open label, randomized controlled clinical trial that aim to investigate the superiority of physical exercise coupled with self drainage to a chest physiotherapy in stable cystic fibrosis children. We hypothesized that CF children undergoing physical exercise coupled to self drainage will increase the amount of expectorate secretions compared to conventional CP course, while being more satisfied and without worsening their pulmonary function status.</brief_summary>
