	<brief_summary>Head and neck cancer patients often experience a critical weight loss of around 10% following radiation therapy. Of this up to 70% is muscle mass and is an independent predictor of mortality, lowers muscle strength and functional performance. The purpose of this study is in a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of progressive resistance training (PRET) on changes in muscle mass, muscle strength and functional performance in head and neck cancer survivors. The investigators hypothesize that PRET has a positive effect on all primary endpoints and increases muscle mass, muscle strength and functional performance.</brief_summary>
