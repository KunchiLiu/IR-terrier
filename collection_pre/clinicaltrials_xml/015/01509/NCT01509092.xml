	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the anatomical and visual recovery of eyes with traumatic macular hole (TMH) following either early vitrectomy or 6-month observation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Between Early Vitrectomy and Observation for Spontaneous Closure of Traumatic Macular Hole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who received vitrectomy immediately after the injury were compared with patients who were observed for six months for spontaneously closure.The closure rate, foveal microstructure, and final visual acuity were analyzed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>closed globe injury identification of fullthickness macular hole by optical coherence tomography within one month after trauma open globe injury coexistence of idiopathic macular hole severe opaque in the visual axis caused by the injury(eg. severe cataract, severe vitreous hemorrhage) combined injuries requiring immediate surgical intervention (eg. lens dislocation, retinal detachment, cyclodialysis) coexistence of high myopia coexistence of choroidal rupture or subretinal hemorrhage within the diameter of 400Î¼m from the center of the foveola coexistence of severe optic nerve injury (no light perception, positive afferent pupillary defect)</criteria>
