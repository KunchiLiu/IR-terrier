	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the incidence and severity of late Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, defined as CMV syndrome or tissue invasive disease occurring between 100 and 200 days and after 200 days post-transplant in patients treated with valganciclovir per package insert guidelines for prophylaxis against CMV infection for 200 days post-transplant versus valganciclovir per package insert guidelines for 100 days post-transplant with Cytogam 100 mg/kg administered at 90 days, 120 days, and 180 days post-transplant.</brief_summary>

The patient has given written informed consent to participate in the study. 1. Solid organ transplant recipient is CMV seropositive at the time of transplant. 2. Recipient or donor is known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 3. Patient has uncontrolled concomitant infection or any other unstable medical condition that could interfere with the study objectives. 4. Patients with thrombocytopenia (&lt;25,000/mm3 ), with an absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 1,000/mm3); and/or leucopoenia (&lt; 2,000/mm3), or anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 6 g/dL) prior to study inclusion. 5. Patient is taking or has been taking an investigational drug in the 30 days prior to transplant. 6.
