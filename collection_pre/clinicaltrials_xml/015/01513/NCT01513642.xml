	<brief_summary>Although incentive spirometry is commonly used to avoid pulmonary complications in cardiac surgery patients, the breath-stacking technique has been proposed as an alternative to increase pulmonary volumes in the post-operative period. Objective: To compare inspiratory volume and electromyographic activity of respiratory muscles during breath stacking technique and incentive spirometry in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present study are: 1. to evaluate and compare the inspiratory volume during the course of Breath Stacking and Incentive Spirometry techniques in patients submitted to myocardial revascularization surgery. 2. to compare the electromyographic activity of the scalene, sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and diaphragm muscles during both techniques.</detailed_description>
