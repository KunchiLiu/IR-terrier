	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate how people with type 1 diabetes experience and manage their diabetes, eating, and weight. Summary of the Study: If you choose to participate, you will complete a set of questionnaires and a structured interview. You will then wear a continuous glucose monitor and use your cell phone to answer study questions for a period of 3 days. The questions come in the form of regular phone calls between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Each call takes only a minute or two to complete. You will also be asked to call in and answer study questions at other times during the day, especially after eating. The study involves a minimum of 2 clinic visits to Duke. Participants who live greater than 1.5 hours from Duke can be approved to take part in the study by phone/Skype. Participants will receive and return study materials through the mail.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eating Disorders in Type 1 Diabetes: Mechanisms of Comorbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eating disorders (ED) are far more prevalent among individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) than the general population. Yet what accounts for the increased prevalence of ED in T1D, and how to effectively treat these patients is unknown. ED in T1D is dangerous. T1D patients with ED not only engage in behaviors common among non-diabetic ED patients (like binge eating), but also might omit insulin to prevent weight gain. The goal of this study is to understand the psychophysiological precipitants to ED behavior among T1D patients.</detailed_description>
