	<brief_summary>The Percutaneous drainage of symptomatic intra-abdominal collection (primary or secondary to surgery)is the treatment of choice in the absence of peritonitis signs. In critically ill patients, this procedure allows to avoid or postpone surgery. In these settings, the percutaneous drain can be either in Active Vacuum Pressure or in Free drainage. However, no prospective trials has assessed the efficiency of these two modalities of drainage in cases of infected intra-abdominal collections. The investigators aimed then to prospectively analyzed the efficiency (in term of infectious control) of drainage under active vacuum pressure vs. free drainage for the treatment of infected intra-abdominal collections.</brief_summary>
