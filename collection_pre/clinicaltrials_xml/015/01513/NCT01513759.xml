	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the EKOS EkoSonic® Endovascular Device when used in conjunction with recombinant t-PA as a treatment for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) will decrease the ratio of RV to LV diameter within 48 ± 6 hours in patients with massive or submassive PE.</brief_summary>
