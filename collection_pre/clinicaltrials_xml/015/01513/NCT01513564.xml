	<brief_summary>Convalescence after lumbar fusion is dependent on pain. In orthopaedic and abdominal surgery accelerated stay programs with optimized pain management enhance recovery. The objective is to evaluate the effect of a revised and optimized perioperative fast track program in lumbar fusion surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multimodal Perioperative Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major spine surgery is usually associated with high postoperative pain scores and opioid requirements. Epidural analgesia has been reported to be an effective and safe method to control postoperative pain after spinal instrumentation surgery, but the overall effects of pain management on postoperative length of stay and recovery remains debatable. However, in a multimodal approach, including multimodal non-opioid analgesia to control postoperative pathophysiology and rehabilitation, complications and hospital stay have been reduced after arthroscopy, hip arthroplasty and knee arthroplasty, hip fractures and abdominal surgery and other procedures, when combined with an enhanced recovery program. The aim of the study is to assess the effect and safety of a combined analgesic regimen consisting of local anesthetic, intra-operative and post-operative continuous epidural analgesia and a single dose ketorolac together with a fast track rehabilitation program after 360 degree lumbar fusion for degenerative disc disease and spondylolisthesis &lt; 2</detailed_description>
