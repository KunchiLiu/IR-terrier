	<brief_summary>Focal myometrial (uterine) contractions occur in a substantial number of vaginal ultrasound examinations and can impede accurate cervical length measurement and placental location determination. The timing of bladder voiding is associated with the prevalence of focal myometrial contractions on vaginal ultrasound cervical assessment. We propose a blinded randomized-controlled trial of bladder voiding immediately before vaginal ultrasound for cervical assessment compared with no bladder voiding immediately before vaginal ultrasound in order to determine the prevalence of focal myometrial contractions during vaginal ultrasound cervical assessment and test whether timing of bladder voiding is associated with their incidence.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This blinded randomized-controlled trial will be performed through the Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. We will offer enrollment to any pregnant woman at gestational weeks 14+0/7 through 31+6/7 presenting for obstetric ultrasound where cervical assessment and/or placental location determination is indicated. Patient positioning and image acquisition will follow a standard protocol and will be performed by the co-investigators. Outcome ascertainment will be performed by two co-investigators blinded to participant allocation upon completion of data collection. Demographic and obstetrical outcome data will be collected via review of the medical record. Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes will yield incidence data, and comparisons will be made between groups.</detailed_description>
