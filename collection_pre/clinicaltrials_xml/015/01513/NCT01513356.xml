	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamic Study of BKM120 in Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BKM120 is a potent and highly specific oral pan-class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, currently under investigation in a first-in-man study in patients with advanced solid tumors (wild type and PIK3CA-mutated). Consistent, dose-dependent pharmacodynamic activity has been demonstrated and clear signs of anti-tumor activity have been seen with BKM120. Three breast cancer patients showed significant tumor shrinkage after ≥ 2 months. Two confirmed partial responses (PRs) per RECIST have been seen, one in a patient with a triple negative KRAS-mutated breast cancer and the other in a patient with an estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, PIK3CAmutated tumor. Two minor responses have also been observed; one of these occurred in a HER2+/ER+ breast cancer patient.</detailed_description>
