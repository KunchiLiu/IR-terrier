	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to develop and test the efficacy of a scientifically-based, culturally competent seven-session parent directed, obesity prevention program focused on parental feeding strategies that support young children's self-regulation of intake.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Promoting The Self-Regulation Of Energy Intake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention program was developed and piloted. Expected outcomes: At the end of the intervention program, it is expected that parents in the intervention group will: 1) use more child-centered and less parent-centered feeding directives; 2) be less likely to show an indulgent and more likely to show an authoritative feeding style; 3)show lower scores on restriction and pressure to eat and higher scores on monitoring; and 4) demonstrate higher levels of food knowledge. Children in the intervention group are expected to: 1) show more willingness to try new foods, and 2) show increased self-regulation of energy intake. At the end of the interventions, children are expected to show greater consumption of fruits and vegetables (including consuming a wider variety of fruits and vegetables). All effects are expected to continue through the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, although the effects sizes will diminish. Although we do not expect effects on BMI after 6 weeks, we expect to see decreases in children's BMI percentiles by the 6- and 12-month follow-ups for the intervention groupâ€” especially for the top 25% of the BMI percentile range. No parental BMI effects are expected.</detailed_description>
