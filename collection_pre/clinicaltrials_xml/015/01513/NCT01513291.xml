	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MK-6096 versus placebo for preventing migraines in participants with episodic migraine. After a 28-day Screening period during which baseline number of monthly migraine days was assessed, participants were randomized to receive MK-6096 or placebo for a 12-week Treatment Period. Participants who completed all 12 weeks of the Treatment Period received drug or placebo for an additional 2 weeks in the Run-out Period. Treatment assignment in the Run-out Period was determined at the initial randomization. In the Run-out Period, participants who received placebo in the Treatment Period continued to receive placebo and participants who received MK-6096 in the Treatment Period 2 received either MK-6096 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The hypothesis tested in the study is that MK-6096 10 mg is superior to placebo in reducing migraine frequency as measured by the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days averaged over the 12- week treatment period.</brief_summary>
