	<brief_summary>Convalescence after lumbar surgery is dependent on the extensiveness of the surgical procedure. Minimal invasive techniques in lumbar spine surgery are reported to achieve excellent clinical results with less pain, morbidity and disability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Minimal Invasive Pedicular Screw and Rod Insertion in Circumferential Lumbar Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To achieve lumbar fusion when there is no need for decompression of the neural structures a posterior midline approach and a left anterior retroperitoneal approach is used. The retroperitoneal anterior approach to the lumbar spine offers some benefits compared with the posterior approach. Dural injury and epidural scarring can be avoided, and an interbody fusion graft can be placed with minimal risk to the nerve roots. However, the extensive posterior midline approach with extensive muscle dissection is necessary to place the pedicular screws. A report of a follow-up period of 2 years of a randomized trial of minimal invasive insertion of pedicular screws and rods in lumbar fusion.</detailed_description>
