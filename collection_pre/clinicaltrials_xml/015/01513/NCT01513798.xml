	<brief_summary>The investigators investigate if combined progressive aerobic training and resistance training improve metabolic control and fat mass in patients with type 2 diabetes who are eating a modified paleolithic diet. The investigators randomize 40 participants to two groups: 1) Modified paleolithic diet and exercise under observation 3 sessions/week, 2) Modified paleolithic diet and general advice about exercise. The investigators primary hypothesis is that in patients with type 2 diabetes decreases fat mass more with progressive exercise under observation and a modified paleolithic diet than with general advice about exercise and a modified paleolithic diet.</brief_summary>
