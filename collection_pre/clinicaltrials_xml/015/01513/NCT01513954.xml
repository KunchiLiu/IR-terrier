	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether progesterone hormone levels differ following egg retrieval with a single lumen needle compared with a double lumen needle. These levels will be measured on several days before and after egg retrieval. The progesterone levels in each IVF group will also be compared to the group of women who are having IUI. In addition, these progesterone levels will be correlated with pregnancy outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination of Serum Progesterone Levels in an IVF Population Following Two Types of Egg Aspiration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized trial consisting of 3 groups of patients. Following a long lupron protocol IVF cycle there is a need for supplemental progesterone. The purpose of this study is to determine what range of serum levels should be observed when differing methods of egg aspiration have been administered and whether or not there is a correlation with outcomes or pregnancies.</detailed_description>
