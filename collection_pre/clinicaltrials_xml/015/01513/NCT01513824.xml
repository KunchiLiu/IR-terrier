	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine if bio feedback guided stress management by daily measurement of pressure pain sensitivity followed by acupressure reduces signs of depression and number clinical stress signs and increases quality of life in patients with stable, ischemic heart disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stress and Ischemic Heart Disease. The Effect of Bio Feedback Guided Stress Management on Life Quality Including Signs of Depression and Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary outcome Measure: MDI depression score (time frame 3 months) (designated as safety issue: no) The effect of 3 months twice daily measurements of Pressure Pain Sensitivity on the chest bone as a measure of the actual stress level followed by stress management of which Acupressure is mandatory Secondary outcome measures: 1. Clinical stress signs and quality of life measures (time frame 3 months) (designated as safety issue: no) The effect of 3 months twice daily measurements of Pressure Pain Sensitivity on the chest bone as a measure of the actual stress level followed by stress management of which Acupressure is mandatory, on a Clinical Stress Signs score (56 items), SF-36 and WHO-5 questionnaires 2. Measure of Pressure Pain Sensitivity by a professional (designated as safety issue: no) The effect of 3 months twice daily measurements of pressure pain sensitivity on the chest bone as a measure of the actual stress level followed by stress management of which acupressure is mandatory 3. Measures of heart function: Blood pressure, the Pressure-Pulse Product (heart work), Heart Rate Variability inclusive response to Tilting, BNP (time frame 3 months) (designated as safety issue: no) The effect of 3 months twice daily measurements of Pressure Pain Sensitivity on the chest bone as a measure of the actual stress level followed by stress management of which Acupressure is mandatory 4. Measures of the Metabolic Syndrome: HOMA-1, Adiponectin, HBA1C, Lipids, Body Composition (time frame 3 months) (designated as safety issue: no) The effect of 3 months twice daily measurements of Pressure Pain Sensitivity on the chest bone as a measure of the actual stress level followed by stress management of which Acupressure is mandatory Tertiary outcome Measures: Use of health care (time frame one year after start of intervention) The effect of months twice daily measurements of Pressure Pain Sensitivity on the chest bone as a measure of the actual stress level followed by stress management of which Acupressure is mandatory, followed by 9 months bioguided feedback stress management when needed, i.e. post-study maintenance treatment</detailed_description>
