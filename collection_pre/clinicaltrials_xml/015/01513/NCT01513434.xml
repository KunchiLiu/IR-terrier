	<brief_summary>The position of the femoral tunnel in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has been assessed on three dimensional CT (3D-CT) scan or in cadaveric study. However, these methods have some issues; 3D-CT scan has a concern on radiation exposure and cadaveric study is not easily available nor an in vivo test. The purpose of this study is to compare the position of the femoral tunnel aperture on conventional MRI and the outcomes after single bundle ACL reconstruction using free tendon Achilles allograft between transportal technique and transtibial technique in active young men.</brief_summary>
