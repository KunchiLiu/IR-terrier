	<brief_title>The Effect of Dexmedetomidine on the Emergence Agitation in Nasal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence agitation during the immediate postanesthetic period is common. It may lead to serious consequences for the patient, such as injury, increased pain, hemorrhage, self-extubation, and removal of catheters. Emergence agitation is common in ENT surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on the emergence agitation and postoperative quality of recovery in adult patients undergoing nasal surgery.</detailed_description>
