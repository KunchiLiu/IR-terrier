	<detailed_description>The study is designed to evaluate the impact of telemonitoring on the management of CHF compared with outpatient usual care. From a clinical point of view, the trial will allow to investigate how telemonitoring contributes to reduct the combined end point of all cause mortality and re-hospitalizations, as well as the other kinds of access to hospital facilities (bed-days, specialistic and ER visits). The trial will examine whether the CHF patients improve their health-related quality of life and reduct the anxiety about health conditions, thanks to the telemonitoring. A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis will be carried out in order to determine if and how telemonitoring helps to limit the healthcare expenditure. The evaluation will deal also with organizational changes and task shift due to telemonitoring introduction and patients and professional perception towards the service.</detailed_description>
