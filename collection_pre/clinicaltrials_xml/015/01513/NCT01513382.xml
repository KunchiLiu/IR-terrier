	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Methylene Blue Guidance in Total Excision of Pilonidal Sinus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To study the potential benefits of intraoperative methylene blue use in pilonidal sinus surgery in detecting the borders of the disease, the histopathologic correlation between the specimen dyed by methylene blue and also the cavity excision specimen not dyed by methylene blue was investigated. The branches that distinctly exceeded the planned dyed excision borders will tried to be detected histopathologically, if any.</detailed_description>
