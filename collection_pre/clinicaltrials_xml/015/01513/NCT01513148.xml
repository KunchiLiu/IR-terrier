	<brief_summary>The introduction of light emitting diode (LED) devices as a novel treatment for pain relief in place of low-level laser warrants fundamental research on the effect of LED devices on one of the potential explanatory mechanisms: peripheral neurophysiology in vivo. A randomized controlled study will be conducted by measuring nerve conduction on the superficial radial nerve of healthy subjects (n=64). One baseline measurement and five post-irradiation recordings (2-min interval each) will be performed of the nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and peak latency (PL) and peak amplitude (PA). The experimental group (=32) will receive an irradiation of 2 J/cm2 with an infrared LED device (Dynatronics Solaris Model 705), while the placebo group will be treated by sham irradiation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of LED light on the conduction velocity and amplitude of the superficial radial nerve.</brief_summary>
