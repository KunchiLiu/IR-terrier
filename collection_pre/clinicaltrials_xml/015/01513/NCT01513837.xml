	<brief_summary>Based on the evidence for the "common pathway" in asthma presentation, our working hypothesis is that asthma severity and lack of control are related to the prevalence and severity of nasal and sinusal inflammatory pathology, and especially to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rinitis y Sinusitis según la Gravedad Del Asma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: To assess the prevalence and severity of rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, with or without nasal polyposis, in asthmatic patients depending on severity of their disease. Secondary objectives: To assess the impact of nasal and sinusal pathology on asthma control. To correlate asthma severity to rhinitis and rhinosinusitis. To compare the potential association between chronic rhinosinusitis, with and without nasal polyposis, and asthma severity, and to detect radiographic differences, markers of atopy, and pulmonary function.</detailed_description>
