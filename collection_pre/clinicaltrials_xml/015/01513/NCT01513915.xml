	<brief_summary>The fact that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a well known efficacious intervention for children with anxiety disorders (AD) is undeniable. However, most children with AD have limited access to CBT. There is some controversial evidence on group CBT in AD involving families in treatment of their children and a published article on efficacy of a parent only group CBT for these children. Considering these data, the investigators hypothesized that teaching anxiety-fighting skills to parents of children with AD would diminish anxiety symptoms of both parents and children and improve family relational functioning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Parent-only Group Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Children With Anxiety Disorders: a Control Group Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All children and their parents were interviewed using K-SADS-PL-Persian Version, a semi-structured diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnoses and assess possible comorbidities. All diagnostic assessments were conducted by a fellowship of child and adolescent psychiatry. Following assessment, once the participants reached twenty members, they were invited to complete child and parent self-report measures. The level of child functioning and family relationship functioning were also evaluated. Then they were randomly allocated to either parent training (N=20) or a 6 week wait-list (N=22) groups. During 2 weeks after treatment the assessments were repeated and satisfaction ratings were collected for the intervention group.</detailed_description>
