	<brief_summary>When babies are born premature, they often need help with their breathing. The equipment used to help them breathe is not very comfortable and they sometimes need to be put on a specialized breathing machine with a tube into their lungs. The breathing machine or ventilator can be damaging to the newborn's lungs and more damage can occur the longer the newborn stays on a ventilator leading to chronic lung disease later in their lives. A new device called neurally adjusted ventilatory assist or NAVA is available that the investigators believe may be more comfortable for the premature newborn and may help the baby come off breathing support sooner. When using this device, babies may not need to be put on a ventilator and can avoid the lung damage associated with the breathing tube and the ventilator. The objective of this pilot study is to compare this new breathing device called NAVA, to the equipment that is currently being used, called SiPAP, to support premature newborn's breathing after birth without a breathing tube. The investigators hope to show that with this new technology, premature newborns that are having a difficult time breathing, will come off breathing support sooner compared to the breathing machines that are currently being used. The hypothesis for this proposed study is that improved synchrony with noninvasive NAVA will decrease time spent on noninvasive ventilation and avoid intubation.</brief_summary>
