	<brief_summary>Studies in animals and retrospective studies in humans show that regional anesthesia reduces metastatic cancer dissemination. The investigators hypothesize that in patients suffering from malignant melanoma who have to undergo radical inguinal lymph node dissection immune function will be less compromised and long term survival will be superior when spinal anesthesia is compared to general anesthesia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Results of basic science indicate that regional anesthesia prevents perioperative immunosuppression and reduces postoperative metastatic cancer dissemination. If this would occur in humans, optimised anesthetic management might improve long-term outcome after cancer surgery.</detailed_description>
