	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy in preventing cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Vaccines made from a tetanus-CMV peptide or antigen may help the body build an effective immune response and prevent or delay the recurrence of CMV infection in patients undergoing donor stem cell transplant for hematological malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Preventing Cytomegalovirus Infection in Patients With Hematological Malignancies Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To discover whether two administrations of 2.5 mg tetanus (Tet)-CMV peptide co-injected with 1 mg of PF-03512676 (tetanus-CMV fusion peptide vaccine), by subcutaneous (SC) route on days 28 and 56 post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are safe and well tolerated in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A*0201 CMV-positive recipients of allogeneic HCT. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To measure levels of CMV-specific T cells in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated HCT recipients (control arm). II. To assess whether vaccination of HCT recipients with Tet-CMV co-injected with PF03512676 reduces expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) on CMV-specific T cells. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive Tet-CMV + PF03512675 SC on days 28 and 56 post-HCT. ARM II: Patients undergo immune monitoring only. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 70, 84, 100, 130, 160, and 180.</detailed_description>
