	<brief_summary>The effects of a dietary fiber on hunger and food intake will be tested in men and women. Participants will receive fiber as part of a breakfast meal on two occasions. On another occasion, participants will receive the same breakfast, without added fiber. Their feelings of hunger and fullness will be measured over the day. They will be offered lunch, dinner and an evening snack and how much they eat will be recorded. It is expected that the fiber supplement will enhance their feelings of satiety and reduce the amount they eat over the day.</brief_summary>
