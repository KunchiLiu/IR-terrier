	<brief_title>Hearing Preservation Using Dexamethasone and Hyaluronic Acid for Cochlear Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many efforts have been made to prevent residual hearing loss after cochlear implantation, such as the development of soft surgical techniques and pharmacological protection. In this study we investigate whether the topical application of dexamethasone and hyaluronic acid prevents residual hearing loss.</detailed_description>
