	<brief_summary>The DERENEDIAB study is a proof-of-concept, multi-center, prospective, open, randomized, controlled study of the effectiveness of renal denervation in addition to standardized medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone in diabetic subjects with diabetic nephropathy and resistant proteinuria. Bilateral renal denervation will be performed using the Symplicity Catheter - a percutaneous system that delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy through the luminal surface of the renal artery.</brief_summary>
