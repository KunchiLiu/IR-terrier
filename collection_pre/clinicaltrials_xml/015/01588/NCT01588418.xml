	<brief_summary>This research study will examine brain glucose metabolism after an overnight fast to determine the effect of exenatide on brain glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Exenatide on Brain, Adipose Tissue, Pancreas, and Liver Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will elucidate if exenatide has an effect on brain glucose metabolism. This will be accomplished by measuring the rate of glucose binding in various brain regions by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) after glucose load with exenatide injection and compare it with placebo injection measured in the same subject. The changes will be compared with peripheral and hepatic glucose metabolism and lipolysis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males age 1865 years old 2. Patients must have BMI between 25 and 40 kg/m2 3. 2hour glucose concentration above 140mg/dl after 75g glucose load, ie, having impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. 4. Patients must have BMI of 2540 kg/m2 5. Patients must have no known severe liver or kidney disease, cancer, neurologic, psychiatric or systemic disease, ability to understand the study. 6. Only patients whose body weight has been stable (±34 pounds) over the three months prior to study will be included. 7. Patients must have the following laboratory values: Hematocrit ≥ 34 vol% Serum creatinine* ≤ 1.5 mg/dl in males and AST (SGOT): ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal ALT (SGPT): ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal If serum creatinine is ≤ 1.5 mg/dl in males, the PI can grant an exception and not exclude the patient if the GFR is &gt;70 ml/min Patients are excluded from participation in the study if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Patients with major chronic illness (cancer, liver, kidney, cardiovascular disease) 2. Patients with BMI over 40 and under 25 3. Patient with age below 18 yrs and over 65 yrs 4. Female subjects 5. Patients with type 1 diabetes 6. Patients treated for type 2 diabetes 7. Subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT)</criteria>
