This study aims to evaluate the rate of complete responses with induction therapy (primary endpoint) and progression-free survival, overall survival and objective response rates of docetaxel, cisplatin, cetuximab, and bevacizumab (TPE-A) followed by radiation therapy, cisplatin, cetuximab, and bevacizumab (XPE-A).

	<detailed_description>Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is treated with various combinations of radiation and chemotherapy. Docetaxel and cisplatin have been combined in Phase II trials in recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer with very encouraging results. Induction therapy with docetaxel/cisplatin followed by chemoradiotherapy was investigated in a randomized Phase II study in nasopharyngeal cancer and showed superior PFS and OS in comparison with chemoradiation alone. Cetuximab is a chimerized EGFR monoclonal antibody that has produced positive results in Phase III trials in combination with either radiation for locally advanced disease or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been associated with cetuximab resistance. Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody is currently being investigated in SCCHN with promising results. The investigators have previously shown that cisplatin, docetaxel and cetuximab (TPE) followed by radiotherapy, cisplatin and cetuximab (XPE) is feasible and highly efficacious in locally advanced SCCHN (Argiris, A. et al.JCO 2011). In this Phase II study the investigators evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to induction therapy with TPE (TPE-A) and to subsequent XPE (XPE-A). Specific aims: To evaluate the rate of complete responses with induction therapy (primary endpoint) and progression-free survival, overall survival and objective response rates. Also, the investigators plan to investigate a panel of EGFR and angiogenesis biomarkers in pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies. Finally, the investigators will evaluate the associated treatment toxicities and the quality of life. Subject population: The investigators will enroll patients with previously untreated locally advanced SCCHN (see detailed eligibility criteria). Treatment plan: Induction therapy consists of 3 cycles of bevacizumab 15mg/kg on day 1, docetaxel 75mg/m2 on day 1, loading dose of cetuximab 400mg/m2 on cycle 1, day 1, then 250 mg/m2 on all subsequent administrations (Day 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and days 1,8,15 of cycles 2 and 3), cisplatin 75mg/m2 on day 1, docetaxel 75mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 21 days. After 3 cycles of induction therapy, patients will receive standard radiation 70-74 Gy/ 200 cGy/ daily, 5 days/ week with concurrent weekly cisplatin 30mg/m2, cetuximab 250mg/m2 and bevacizumab 15mg/kg every 3 weeks x 3. There is optional surgery for non-responders in the primary (stable disease) after TPE-A. Statistical design and sample size: Phase II, two-stage study with complete response rate after induction therapy as the primary endpoint. The sample size is 33 patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with AJCC 7th edition stage IIIIVB head and neck cancer, all sites, including unknown primary tumors. Prior to entry in the study the resectability and alternative treatment options for each patient will be determined by a team composed of an Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgeon, a Radiation Oncologist and a Medical Oncologist. Stage determination, optimal local treatment, and its timing according to this protocol will be determined at this evaluation. The unequivocal demonstration of distant metastasis (M1) confers ineligibility. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell or poorly differentiated carcinomas, or WHO types IIII of the nasopharynx. Unidimensionally measurable disease is required (RECIST 1.1). No prior chemotherapy, biologic/molecular targeted therapy (including any prior therapy which specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway), or radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Prior surgical therapy will consist only of incisional or excisional biopsy, and organ sparing procedures such as debulking of airway compromising tumors or neck dissection in a patient with an existing primary tumor. Any nonbiopsy procedure must have taken place &gt; 4 weeks but &lt; 3 months of initiating protocol treatment. ECOG performance status 01. Age 18 years or older. Informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy. Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. All patients should have their tumor tissue tested for HPV (in situ hybridization and/or p16 staining by immunohistochemistry), and results must be known prior to study entry, and will consent to have available archival tumor samples, unstained slides or blocks from previous diagnostic or therapeutic procedures submitted for correlative studies, including assessment of target molecules EGFR, VEGF and related biomarkers. Also, patients must agree to submit blood samples for correlative studies at least at baseline. Absolute neutrophil count at or above 1500/µl, Platelet count at or above 100,000/µl Creatinine clearance 60 ml/min or higher calculated using the CockcroftGault formula: Calculated Creatinine Clearance = (140age) X actual body wt (kg)/ 72 X serum creatinine Multiply this number by 0.85 if the patient is female Total bilirubin within normal limits and AST/ALT less than 3 times the upper limit of normal. Urine dipstick must be &lt; 01+ within 2 weeks (14 days) of randomization. If urine dipstick result is &gt; 1+, a calculation of Urine Protein Creatinine (UPC) ratio is required. Patients must have a UPC ratio &lt; 1.0 to participate in the study. NOTE: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24urine protein excretion a UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24hour urine protein of 1gm. UPC ratio is calculated using one of the following formula: [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] if both protein and creatinine are reported in mg/DI [(urine protein) × 0.088]/[urine creatinine] if urine creatinine is reported in mmol/L Patients with a prior history of squamous cell or basal carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer must have been curatively treated. Patients with a history of other prior malignancy must have been treated with curative intent and must have remained diseasefree for 3 years post diagnosis. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. History of severe allergic reactions attributed to docetaxel or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to docetaxel, or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80. Prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody or known hypersensitivity to any component of bevacizumab Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. All patients will have a baseline EKG. If abnormalities consistent with active coronary artery disease are detected, the patient will be referred to a cardiologist for appropriate evaluation and management prior to treatment on study No patients with significant baseline sensory or motor neurologic deficits (&gt; grade I neuropathy) will be treated on this study. Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal Infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy, HIVpositive patients are excluded from the study. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients with HIV and those receiving combination anti retroviral therapies when indicated.
