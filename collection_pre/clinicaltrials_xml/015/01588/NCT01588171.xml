	<brief_summary>The use of a new generation low molecular weight heparin (Bemiparin)and the well known LMWH (Enoxaparin) after Caesarean sections and vaginal deliveries in a risky group patients for venous thrombosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of 2 Low Molecular Weight Heparin as a Thromboprophylaxis Postpartum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the developed and developing world. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis are the two components of a single disease called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pregnancy associated with an average 5 to 10 fold increase in the risk of VTE compared with non-pregnant women. The highest incidence occurring during the post partum period. There are many researches done a broad on the effect of LMWH to decrease the incidence of VTE after Caesarean section using the two LMWH (Enoxaparin and Bemiparin) alone but not in one research comparing both of them alone and both together against a control group. Also according to our knowledge there are no published literature on thromboprophylaxis after vaginal delivery</detailed_description>
