	<brief_title>MRI Hydronephrosis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound is the most commonly performed imaging modality used to assess hydronephrosis. The average renal ultrasound exam takes about 15-25 minutes to complete, however, it does have several disadvantages, including substantial operator dependence, having to rely on an adequate "sonographic window" to see the structures of interest and difficulty in visualization of portions of the kidney and urinary tracts. Recent MRI advances have made rapid imaging possible. Such imaging has minimized motion related artifacts and need for sedation. This study is to compare traditional ultrasound imaging to a raid noncontrast protocol MRI examination of the kidneys and urinary tract that would require no sedation and less than 15 minutes to perform.</detailed_description>
