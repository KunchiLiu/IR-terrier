	<brief_summary>Recently, DPP-IV inhibitors are used as a novel way to augment the incretin system and one of the newest classes of medications in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since the DPP-IV inhibitor was first used, about 5 years have passed in USA. However, there were no major side effects including occurrence of cancers. The main mechanism for DPP-IV inhibitors is due to suppress the function of DPP-IV activity. As it is known that the suppressed DPP-IV activity is a marker for early diagnosis of cancers, the reason of disassociation is not clear. Activation of receptor for advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) is related to sideration of cancers. Meanwhile, the DPP-IV inhibitors may be related to inhibit the activation of receptor for AGE (RAGE). Therefore, DPP-IV inhibitors may work as a cancer protective agent in diabetes by blocking the AGE-RAGE axis. However, it is not demonstrated why DPP-IV inhibitors have no side effect of occurrence of cancer via blocking the activation of AGE-RAGE. The investigators examined effect of DPP-IV inhibitors on frequency of cancers and the underlying mechanism using AGE and RAGE before and 5 years after administration of DPP-IV inhibitors in Japanese patients with T2DM.</brief_summary>
