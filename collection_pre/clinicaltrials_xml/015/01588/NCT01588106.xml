	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use of the CONTOUR Next USB BGMS system with AutoLog and Trends features and integrated data management software (Glucofacts ™ DELUXE) enables behavioral changes that may lead to improvement in glycemic control, expressed as a reduction in HbA1c as primary endpoint. Patients will be randomized either to using CONTOUR Next USB or CONTOUR. Patients will be trained in using the devices and return every 3 months until month 9 after baseline.</brief_summary>

Topic or inhalative use is no exclusion criterion when not used regularly (more than 5 times a week).
