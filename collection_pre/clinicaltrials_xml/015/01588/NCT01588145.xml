	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Profile of HM61713 in NSCLC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Besides the main objective, there are 3 other objectives as follows: - To evaluate the anti-cancer effect of HM61713 in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation - To investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of HM61713 and its metabolites after oral administration - To investigate biomarkers related to the safety and efficacy of HM61713</detailed_description>
