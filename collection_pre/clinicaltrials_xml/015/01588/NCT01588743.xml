	<brief_summary>It is well known that Long-term hyperglycemia (also known as glucose toxicity) contribute to impairment in islet β-cell function and development of insulin resistance. A growing body of evidence also indicates that this impairment inβ-cell function and insulin action could be restored after hyperglycemia is corrected by short-term intensive insulin therapy. In this study, we are determined to use the golden standard of insulin sensitivity evaluation in vivo—hyperinsulinemia euglycemic glucose clamp—to estimate insulin resistance improvement in patients before and after intensive insulin therapy, investigate first phase insulin secretion to evaluate β-cell function, examine the changes in insulin resistance and insulin secretion resulting from normalization of plasma glucose levels in both lean and obese patients by insulin pump therapy.</brief_summary>
