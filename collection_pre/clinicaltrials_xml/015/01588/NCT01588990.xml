	<brief_summary>This open-label, prospective, single-arm, multicenter study will evaluate the relationship of the markers of inflammation and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. The study consists of two phases: Phase A treatment: XELOX plus Avastin (bevacizumab), or mFOLFOX6 plus Avastin administered until first disease progression. Patients will then continue with Phase B treatment: FOLFIRI plus Avastin until second disease progression. The anticipated time on study treatment is 4 years.</brief_summary>
