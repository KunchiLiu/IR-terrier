	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of mandibular repositioning appliance (MRA) versus Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in patients with moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRA Therapy Versus CPAP Therapy in Moderate OSAS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design: In a randomized parallel controlled study 86 patients will be randomly assigned to either MRA therapy or CPAP therapy. Group A receives MRA. Group B receives CPAP. The total duration of the study is 12 months. Measurements will be done at baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months. Intervention: Group A will be treated with a bibloc MRA (Somnodent). The mandible will be set at 70% of the patient's maximum advancement and will be adjusted to the convenience of the patient. Titration will be continued until symptoms abate or until further advancement causes discomfort. Group B will be treated with CPAP. Proper CPAP-pressure will be set for each patient separately. Patients are fitted with a comfortable CPAP mask before titration of the CPAP-pressure. For CPAP-titration, patients are instructed to adopt their own typical sleeping habits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals who have been subjected to polysomnography and are diagnosed as having moderate (AHI 1530) OSAS; Aged â‰¥ 18 years; Medical and psychological criteria: Patients previously treated for OSAS (e.g. CPAP, MRA); Morphologic abnormalities of the upper airway (e.g., a compromised nasal passage, enlarged tonsils or adenoids, or upper airway softtissue or craniofacial abnormality); Reported or documented unstable endocrine dysfunction (hypothyroidism, acromegaly, or pituitary adenoma); Reported or documented severe cardiovascular or pulmonary comorbidity Clinically concurrent cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, heart failure,cardiac arrhythmias) CVA within 6 months prior to randomisation Daytime respiratory insufficiency Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (GOLD 3 or 4; FEV1 / FVC &lt; 70% and FEV1 &lt; 50%); Other diseases that may impact the evaluation of the results of the study according to the investigator's judgement. Reported or documented psychological condition precluding informed consent (e.g., mental retardation, depression or schizophrenia); Whether the patient has unstable endocrine dysfunction, severe cardiovascular or pulmonary comorbidity or a psychological condition precluding informed consent, will be assessed by evaluating the patient's medical record. Dental exclusion criteria: Extensive periodontal disease or tooth decay; Active temporomandibular joint disease (including severe bruxism); Restrictions in mouth opening (&lt; 25mm) or advancement of the mandible &lt;5mm); Partial or complete edentulism (less than eight teeth in upper or lower jaw).</criteria>
