	<detailed_description>Like African-American women, African-American girls suffer disproportionately from obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. One factor strongly associated with the development of obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus disparities in children is low physical activity levels. Low physical activity is more prevalent in African-American girls, pointing to the critical need for effective physical activity interventions. For a physical activity intervention message to be effective among African-American girls, the program must be enjoyable and tailored to African-American girls and women. One possibility for an appropriate physical activity intervention is afro-centric dance, which has strong cultural and historical significance in the African-American community. This form of physical activity may provide girls with sustained bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. There appears to be a strong positive correlation between parental and children physical activity levels. In the African-American culture, maternal health behaviors in particular have a strong influence on children's health behaviors. Currently, there are no studies that examine the effects of a daughter-mother Afro-centric dance program on the physical activity levels of African-American girls. Therefore, the purpose of this study will be to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a 12-week physical activity intervention consisting of afro-centric dance and its ability to affect the physical activity levels of African-American girls. If investigators identify afro-centric dance as a sustainable form of physical activity for African-American daughters and mothers, investigators can use this intervention to significantly reduce obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in these groups.</detailed_description>
