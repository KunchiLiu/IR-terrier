	<brief_summary>CACT-IHF aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Qishen Yiqi Dripping Pills in treating ischemic heart failure. Meeting the diagnosis, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study plans to recruit 640 cases from 35 upper class hospitals in China, who are divided into two groups (treatment and control group) by central randomization service. The treatment group will be administrated with one bag of Qishen Yiqi Dripping Pills (0.52g/bag) three times a day in addition to standardized western medications. Whereas the control group will be given one bag of Qishen Yiqi Dripping Pills dummy (0.52g/bag) three times a day in addition to standardized western medications. Efficacy indicators include primary indicator (6 minute walk test) and secondary indicators: composite endpoint consisting of all-cause death, emergency/re-admission to hospital due to HF, frequency of re-admission due to cardiovascular disease, acute coronary syndrome, severe arrhythmia, cardiac shock, revascularization, stroke, pulmonary embolism and peripheral vascular incidences, etc.; Brain Natriuretic Peptide; echocardiography; cardiothoracic ratio; NYHA cardiac function classification; Minnesota life quality scale; scores from the four traditional chinese medicine (TCM) diagnostic methods). Other indicators include blood cholesterol, triglyceride, high density cholesterol and low density cholesterol. Safety indicators include blood pressure, heart rate, blood and urine routine tests, liver and renal function tests, serum electrolytes, electrocardiogram and adverse events. All of the patients will receive interventional drug treatment for 6 months. Follow up is needed on the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th month after recruitment. All patients will be followed up until the end of study (Refers to the 12th month of the last case recruited into the study).</brief_summary>
