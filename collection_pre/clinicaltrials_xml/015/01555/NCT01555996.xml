	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled trial to compare the efficacy of two strategies of non-pharmacological prevention of delirium in critically non-ventilated older patients: - standard non-pharmacological prevention - intensive nonpharmacological prevention (standard non-pharmacological prevention plus early and intensive occupational therapy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Occupational Therapy for Delirium Prevention in Older Patients Admitted to Critical Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium is a complication in older, with incidences 70-87% in CCU. This increases mortality, hospital stay, hospital cost, and cognitive impairment. Occupational Therapy (OT) improves independence at discharge, and reduction in delirium in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. This study compares the efficacy of non pharmacological standard prevention (control group) versus intensive nonpharmacological prevention (experimental group) in the delirium duration in older admitted CCU.</detailed_description>
