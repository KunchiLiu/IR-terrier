	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to determine the effect of ranolazine when added to metformin on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are inadequately controlled despite current treatment with stable metformin therapy in addition to diet and exercise.</brief_summary>
