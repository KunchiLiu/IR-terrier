	<brief_summary>Background: Small bowel Crohn's disease (SBCD) is a chronic relapsing disease, and clinical presentation can vary considerably. Patients are frequently assessed by capsule endoscopy (CE), which enables direct visualization of small bowel mucosal abnormalities; however, the correlations between CE scoring index (CESI), biological markers, and disease activity indices remain undefined. Methods: A prospective study was conducted between October 2008 and February 2011 on 58 established SBCD patients and suspected patients who received a definitive SBCD diagnosis during study. Patients underwent complete CE, and were scored according to the CESI (inactive, &lt;135; mild inflammation, 135-790; moderate-severe inflammation, &gt;790) and Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI). Statistical correlation between CESI, HBI, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum albumin, and hemoglobin was assessed. At follow-up (~9 months), 11 of the patients underwent CE with scoring for CESI, HBI, and CRP.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parameters CESI To calculate the CESI, the small bowel was divided into three tertiles. The degree of disease involvement in each tertile was determined by assessing three parameters: villous edema, ulceration, and stenosis. Endoscopic remission was defined as CESI of &lt;135. Mild inflammation was defined as CESI of 135-790, and moderate-severe inflammation as â‰¥790. HBI HBI was used to assess the clinical disease activity. Patients with HBI &gt;4 were considered to have clinically active disease.[7] Blood analysis At the time of CE, patients provided a blood sample for measurement of hemoglobin, serum CRP, and albumin. Hemoglobin (normal ranges: women, 120-160 g/L and men, 140-180 g/L), albumin (normal range: 35-55 g/L), and CRP (upper limit of normal: &lt;8 mg/L) were determined by routine laboratory tests.</detailed_description>
