	<brief_summary>Previous studies have demonstrated that Myo-inositol is capable of restoring spontaneous ovarian activity, and consequently fertility, in most patients with PCOS. The aim of our study is to investigate the role of folic acid conteined in the inositol preparation. The study group included 50 patients, randomly allocated to subgroup A (myo-inositol 1500 gr) and subgroup B (myo-inositol 2000 gr + folic acid 200 mcg). The investigation include menstrual pattern and hirsutism score evaluation, hormonal assays, oral glucose tolerance test, euglycemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp and lipide profile at baseline and after six months of treatment.</brief_summary>
