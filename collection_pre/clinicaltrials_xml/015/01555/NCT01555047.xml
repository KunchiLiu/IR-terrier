	<brief_summary>Genital ureaplasmas (Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum) and genital mycoplasmas (Mycoplasma hominis and Mycoplasma genitalium) are natural inhabitants of the male urethra contaminating the semen during ejaculation. However, these microorganisms, especially Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) and Mycoplasma hominis (Mh), are potentially pathogenic species playing an etiologic role in both genital infections and male infertility. Despite there are many consentaneous opinions about its relationship with infertility, its correlation with sperm regular parameters is still controversially. Sperm DNA damage can negatively influence fertilization rate, embryo cleavage rate, implantation rate, pregnancy and live birth rate, and is a novel indicator for intrauterine insemination (IUI) pregnancy rate and IVF or ICSI pregnancy loss rate. Until now, there were fewer clinical researches about the relationship among Uu and/or Mh infection, sperm DNA damage, and the IUI pregnancy rate. Thus, the investigators conduct this prospective study to investigate the relationship among them.</brief_summary>
