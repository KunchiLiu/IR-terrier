	<brief_summary>Endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage (incorporating a suction port above the cuff) have been shown to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Subglottic secretion drainage can be either continuous or intermittent. However, concerns about the safety of continuous subglottic secretion drainage were raised in an experimental study in sheep, which found widespread injuries to tracheal mucosa and/or submucosa. Our objective is therefore to compare intermittent versus continuous subglottic secretion drainage on tracheal mucosa damages in patients requiring mechanical ventilation for an expected duration of more than 24 hours.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage (incorporating a suction port above the cuff) have been shown to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Subglottic secretion drainage can be either continuous or intermittent. However, concerns about the safety of continuous subglottic secretion drainage were raised in an experimental study in sheep, which found widespread injuries to tracheal mucosa and/or submucosa. Our objective is therefore to compare intermittent versus continuous subglottic secretion drainage on tracheal mucosa damages in patients requiring mechanical ventilation for an expected duration of more than 24 hours. Tracheal mucosa injuries will be assessed by tracheal fibroscopy. Secondary endpoints are the volume of daily secretions suctioned, the occurrence of difficulties or impossibilities of secretion drainage, and the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.</detailed_description>
