	<brief_title>A Study of Aneustat (OMN54) in Patients With Advanced Cancer and Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who complete a 28-day cycle, may be eligible to continue receiving Aneustat™ (OMN54) in 4-week increments for up to 6 cycles (inclusive of cycle 1) if further treatment is judged to be of possible benefit; if patient has not experienced unacceptable toxicity; and no study withdrawal criteria has been met.</detailed_description>

Having the initiative and means to be compliant with the protocol (as judged by the Principal Investigator) and is within a feasible geographical proximity of the study center to make the required study visits. Written informed consent obtained prior to any study screening procedures Females of childbearing potential (a female is considered of childbearing potential unless she is postmenopausal, i.e., no menses for at least 12 consecutive months, or is without a uterus) must have a negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) within 7 days of Day 1 (initial dose) Females of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of contraception (i.e., sexual abstinence, condoms, intrauterine device, diaphragm) from Screening period and throughout study participation. Patient has uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases (If a patient has brain metastases and is on steroids, the steroid dose must be stable for at least 30 days prior to Day 1 dosing). Use of an investigational medication or device within 30 days of initiating study therapy (Day 1). Major surgery within 30 days prior to first dose (Day 1). Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy within 28 days prior to Day 1 (not including palliative radiotherapy at focal sites). Pregnancy or lactation. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NY Heart Association Class III or IV, see Appendix 3), unstable angina pectoris, unstable cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Screening (within approximately 28 days of registration) 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that is abnormal and clinically significant Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption. Use of warfarin, i.e., Coumadin®, Jantoven® within 7 days prior to Day 1 (initial dosing) Intolerance or aversion to porcine ingredients that are used for the OMN54 oral capsules in the investigational medicine, OMN54 (Aneustat™).
