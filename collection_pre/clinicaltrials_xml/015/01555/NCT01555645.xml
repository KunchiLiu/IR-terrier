	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study within Caring sciences is to identify women with breast cancer who have stress symptoms and to offer these women appropriate care to reduce stress and increase well-being. This will be achieved by 1. Studying the prevalence of stress related symptoms in female patients with breast cancer 2. Testing the use of two short screening instruments to identify women at risk for developing long-standing stress symptoms 3. Studying the level and intensity of stress management interventions required to achieve increased well-being, using a stepped-care approach. 4. Studying the effects of interventions based on cognitive behavior therapy, delivered individually or in a group format. The hypothesis is that half of the individuals assigned to a low intensity intervention will be significantly improved after treatment. For individuals who continue to have symptoms after low intensity treatment it is hypothesized that continued treatment in a group setting with high intensity interventions will be more cost-effective. In addition the assumption is that reduction of stress symptoms in women with breast cancer will lead to a reduction in socio-economic costs.</brief_summary>
