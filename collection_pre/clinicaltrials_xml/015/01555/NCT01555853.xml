	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects, maximum tolerated dose, and effectiveness of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel) in treating patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. More effective and well tolerated therapies are needed to treat patients with relapsed and refractory lymphomas. Nab-paclitaxel combines a chemotherapeutic agent with a protein which may increase the anticancer drug concentration in the tumor while reducing toxic effects in normal tissue and may be an effective treatment for lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must have histologically confirmed Bcell nonHodgkin lymphoma or classical Hodgkin lymphoma: Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (including transformed large cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma) Mantle cell lymphoma Burkitt's lymphoma Follicular lymphoma Small lymphocytic lymphoma Marginal zone lymphoma Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (including nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte rich, and lymphocyte deplete) Patient must have measurable disease, defined as the presence of ≥ 1 lymph node or tumor mass measuring ≥ 1 cm in a single dimension as assessed by CT or MRI. Patient must have had prior treatment with ≥ 2 chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Prior autologous stem cell transplant is allowed, and prior allogeneic stem cell transplant is allowed as long as the patient has recovered from acute toxicities and is off immunosuppression without evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD). Patient must be ≥ 18 years of age. Patient must have an ECOG performance status ≤ 2. Patient must have adequate bone marrow reserve at the time of therapy initiation, defined as ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L and platelets ≥ 50 x 109/L. Patient must have adequate hepatic function, defined as total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN and AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN. Patient must have adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN. Patient must have recovered from any acute toxicities associated with prior therapy to ≤ grade 1. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Patient (or legally authorized representative, if applicable) must be able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document. Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Patient must not have nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma subtype. Patient must not have a history of a nonlymphoma malignancy except for the following: adequately treated localized basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, superficial bladder cancer, localized prostate cancer, any adequately treated stage I or stage II cancer currently in complete remission, or any other cancer in complete remission for at least 5 years. Patient must not be receiving any other investigational agents, and must not have taken any other investigational agents within ≤ 3 weeks of study entry chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or investigational agents while on study. Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma must not otherwise be eligible for treatment with brentuximab vedotin. Patient must not have central nervous system or leptomeningeal lymphoma. Patient must not have with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Abraxane. Patient must not have any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patient must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must not be known to be HIVpositive. Patient must not have any preexisting peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1. Patient must not have received any chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or investigational agents and/or radiotherapy &lt; 3 weeks prior to starting study drug.</criteria>
