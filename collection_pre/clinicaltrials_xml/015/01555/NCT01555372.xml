	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to test the hypotheses that compared with Hook Plate (HP), Locking Plate (LP) reduces the postoperative complications and leads to a better functional recovery after unstable distal clavicle fractures (Neer 2b).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Unstable Distal Clavicular Fractures (Neer 2b): Hook Plate vs Locking Plate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Controversy exists regarding the optimal treatment for patients with unstable distal clavicular fractures (Neer 2b). The recognized treatment alternatives are Hook plate.Notably, criticisms on this fixation method also appeared and the potential risks of hook migration, loosening, subacromial impingement or rotator cuff injury, and acromial osteolysis were still unsolved. Recently, Herrmann et al.and Largo et al.stabilized the distal clavicle with Locking plate (LP) and these studies offered encouraging support for LP. Because of small sample size (27 patients) and nonrandomization, the convictive power of these researches is not strong enough.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Age 1880 years 2. Unstable fractures of distal clavicle (Neer 2b fractures), acute or chronic and unilateral fractures. 3. Normal shoulder functions before injury. 4. Internal fixation with either HP or LP. 5. The subjects were in good health and were able to comply with all prescribed followup procedures. 1. Patients who present multiple traumas. 2. Patients with other serious injuries to either upper limb that would interfere with rehabilitation. 3. Patients with a pathological, recurrent or open clavicle fracture. 4. Patient unwilling to give written informed consent. 5. Patients with cognitive impairment unable to comply with treatment programme. 6. Patients with a serious disorder of bone metabolism other than osteoporosis (e.g., endocrine bone diseases, osteomalacia and Paget's disease)</criteria>
