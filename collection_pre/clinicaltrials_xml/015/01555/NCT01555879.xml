	<detailed_description>Two secondary hypotheses that will be tested are: - Abatacept aids in achieving low disease activity or clinical remission in patients of the following Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) sub-groups: RF+/CCP+, RF+/CCP- RF-/CCP+ RF-/CCP-; first time on a bio-tech drug; having previously failed a biological drug; having interstitial lung disease; identified as disabled; twenty-eight individual joints identified as {swollen, painful, tender, deformed or having decreased range of motion}; on or not on oral DMARD; age; or gender. - A database with sufficient attributes exists from which a patient's efficacy on abatacept is accurately predictable.</detailed_description>
