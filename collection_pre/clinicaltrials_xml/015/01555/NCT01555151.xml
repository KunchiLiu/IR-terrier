	<criteria>Males or females who were ≥ 12 years old at the time informed consent was obtained Patients with persistent asthma, diagnosed according to GINA 2010 guideline and who additionally met the following criteria Patients who were receiving ICS treatment up to the maximum dose per day as indicated in the corresponding package leaflet and also a stable ICS regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to screening (Visit 2). Patients whose level of asthma control according to GINA 2010 guideline was "Partly Controlled" or "Uncontrolled" at screening (Visit 2). Patients with a prebronchodilator FEV1 value of ≤ 80% of predicted normal value at screening (Visit 2). Patients who demonstrated an increase of ≥ 12% and 200 mL in FEV1 over prebronchodilator value within 30 minutes after inhalation of 400 μg of salbutamol (360 μg of albuterol) at Visit 2 or between Visit 2 and Visit 5. Patients who were confirmed as "ICS sensitive" by ACQ5 and FEV1 at Visit 5. Key exclusion criteria included: Patients diagnosed with COPD as defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, updated 2010. Patients with concomitant pulmonary disease, pulmonary tuberculosis (unless confirmed by chest Xray to be no longer active), or clinically significant bronchiectasis. Patients with any chronic conditions affecting the respiratory tract (e.g., chronic sinusitis) or chronic lung diseases, which in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the study evaluation or optimal participation in the study. Patients with seasonal allergy which is likely to deteriorate his/her asthma condition during the study period judged by the investigator. Patients who have had a severe asthma attack/exacerbation requiring hospitalization in the 6 months prior to Visit 1 or any time between Visit 1 and Visit 5 must discontinue from the trial (screening failure). Patients who have had an emergency room visit for an asthma attack/exacerbation within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or any time between Visit 1 and Visit 5 must discontinue from the trial (screening failure). Patients who have ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation. Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1, or any time between Visit 1 and Visit 5 must discontinue from the trial (screening failure). Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
