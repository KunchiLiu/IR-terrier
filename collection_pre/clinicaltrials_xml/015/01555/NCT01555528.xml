	<brief_summary>This is a Mexican, Multicentre, Observational Study to evaluate Adherence and Long Term Outcomes of Therapy in paediatric subjects using easypod™ electromechanical device for growth hormone treatment to assess the level of adherence of subject receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Assess the Level of Adherence of Subjects Receiving SAIZEN® Via Easypod™ in Mexico</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be enrolled in a multicenter longitudinal observational study. Parents and patients will provide their Informed Consent to upload their data for population-based analyses and optionally to adhere to a patient adherence support program "AUMENTA" designed to improve their adherence and, ultimately, clinical outcomes. Adherence data will be primarily derived from the easypod™ device combined with physician data entry of outcome measures. Data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively. This will allow the establishment of adherence profiles and explore the hypothesis that patient adherence support programs improve adherence and subsequent clinical outcomes. Collected data will be also analyzed in a multinational pooled analysis of comparable national studies. Primary Objective: -To assess the level of adherence of subjects receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™ Secondary Objectives: - To describe the impact of adherence on clinical outcomes for subject receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™ - To identify adherence subject profiling - To asses the impact of adherence on IGF1 (i.e. above, below or within normal ranges) - To assess/describe the impact of Mexico patient support program "AUMENTA"</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Administered growth hormone via the easypod™ electromechanical device according to local Prescribing information Over the age of &gt; 2 years Under &lt; 18 years of age, or over 18 without fusion of growth plates Parents' or guardian's written informed consent, given before entering data into the observational study, with the understanding that the subject or parents/guardian may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice to future medical care. If the child is old (over 18 without fusion of growth plates) or able to give written informed consent, a separate assent form will be given Patient signed informed consent if has 717 years old Patient signed informed consent if has 18 years old Subjects taking growth hormone in whom growth plates have fused (i.e. for taking growth hormone for it's metabolic effects) Contraindications to SAIZEN® as defined in the local prescribing information Use of an investigational drug or participation in another interventional clinical study</criteria>
