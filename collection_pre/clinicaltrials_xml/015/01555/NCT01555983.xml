	<brief_summary>This study will demonstrate that vaporized marijuana results in antinociception when compared to placebo in subjects with spinal cord injury. To further evaluate potential benefits and side effects, the effect of different strengths of cannabis on mood, cognition, and psychomotor performance will also be measured.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaporized Cannabis and Spinal Cord Injury Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will demonstrate that vaporized cannabis can produce antinociceptive effects compared to placebo in human subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). A within-subject crossover study of the effects of cannabis versus placebo on spontaneous and evoked pain will be performed. A synopsis of antinociception with mood, cognitive impairment, psychomotor performance, and side effects will be obtained to help evaluate the utility of vaporized marijuana in SCI neuropathic pain. This study will compare the analgesic and side effect profile of low (3.5%) to high dose (7.0%) delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol in subjects with spinal cord injury pain. It is hypothesized that a low dose will produce a lesser degree of neuropsychological impairment while maintaining a similar degree of pain relief to the higher dose. The use of two different strengths will help determine tolerable dosing for the treatment of SCI neuropathic pain.</detailed_description>
