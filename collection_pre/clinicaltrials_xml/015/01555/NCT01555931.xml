	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized clinical trial of 190 women aged 18-45 who plan to breastfeed their infant for at least 6 months and desire to use the LNG-IUS as their primary contraceptive method postpartum. The investigators will compare the frequency of breastfeeding among women receiving the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) immediately after vaginal delivery compared to 4-8 weeks later. The investigators hypothesize there will be no difference in breastfeeding prevalence between the two groups.</brief_summary>
