	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of filorexant (MK-6096) versus placebo as adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), in participants who are partial responders to antidepressant monotherapy with one of identified selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or bupropion. The primary hypothesis of the study is that filorexant is superior to placebo as augmentation therapy with respect to change from baseline to Week 6 in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will continue to take their pretrial antidepressant medication as prescribed throughout the trial. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive filorexant or placebo for a 6-week treatment period. Following completion of the treatment period, participants will enter a 2-week double-blind run-out period. During the run-out period, participants who received placebo in the 6-week treatment period will continue to receive placebo and participants who received filorexant in the 6-week treatment period will be randomized to receive either filorexant or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.</detailed_description>
