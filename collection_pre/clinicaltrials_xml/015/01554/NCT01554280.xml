	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether preventative placement of a removable oesophageal stent reduces the rate of scar tissue, or stricture formation after removing the precancerous or early cancerous Barrett's mucosa by Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR). The stent will be placed 10-14 days after initial EMR. The stent will then be removed 8 weeks later by repeat Endoscopy. Patients will be followed up weekly following insertion of the oesophageal stent.</brief_summary>
