	<brief_summary>Late Cardiac Evaluation of the Three Arm Belgian Trial A phase III randomized trial involving node-positive early breast cancer patients with a long median follow-up (~ 15 years) OBJECTIFS Primary: â€¢ To compare the incidence of late cardiac events between anthracycline and non-anthracycline chemotherapy given to node-positive breast cancer patients in the Belgian three arm randomized clinical trial Secondary: - To compare the late incidence of cardiac events between higher and lower dose anthracycline treated node-positive breast cancer patients; - To compare anthracyclines (higher and lower doses) and non-anthracycline chemotherapy for: - left ventricular diastolic function assessed by Echo - exercise capacity assessed by 6-minute walk test (6MWT) - cardiac morphology (myocardial inflammation or injury, fibrosis, LVEF) assessed by MRI - serum cardiac biomarkers (BNP and TNT) - patient-reported cardiac symptoms - patient-reported cardiac symptoms assessed by QOL questionnaires are associated with subclinical findings on LVEF assessment - cognitive function, functional autonomy, and psychological distress</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Late Cardiac Evaluation of the Three Arm Belgian Trial Involving Node-positive Early Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the incidence of cardiac events [(defined as asymptomatic systolic dysfunction (LVEF &lt; 50%, asymptomatic NYHA I) or symptomatic heart failure NYHA class II-IV either by Echo and/or by clinical exam (LVEF &lt; 50% and heart failure symptoms)] between anthracycline and non-anthracycline chemotherapy treated node-positive breast cancer patients in a long-term follow-up. We will define a binary status for each patient: no cardiac event / one or more cardiac events. Analysis of the primary endpoint will involve a comparison of the CMF-treated patients versus the pooled anthracycline treated patients (EC and HEC). If a significant difference is detected, all paired comparisons will also be performed for the primary endpoint (CMF versus EC, CMF versus HEC, EC versus HEC).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Alive, free of any recurrence, Not lost to followup Last workup should be no older than 1 year to exclude relapses. If this is older than 1 year, a new workup (PE, blood tests and MMG) will be performed prior to the entry in this study Patients previously diagnosed with CHF who are free of recurrence will also be invited to participate, if there is no contraindication Patients should be able to perform the prescribed assessments Death Breast cancer recurrence Unwilling to perform exams as per protocol</criteria>
