	<brief_summary>This study is a phase 1, intravenous, open-label, single-dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ACP-501 (recombinant human Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase (rhLCAT)) in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD). Four cohorts consisting of 4 subjects each will receive one dose of ACP-501. The dose will be escalated by cohort.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A history of stable documented CAD Currently nonsmoking males and females ages 30 to 85 years inclusive. o Female subjects of childbearing potential (neither pregnant nor breastfeeding) must be using adequate birth control during study conduct. Chronic concomitant medications must be stable for at least 2 months prior to screening HDLC &lt; 50 mg/dL for men and &lt; 55 mg/dL for women Body Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 18 to 35 kg/m^2; and a total body weight &gt;= 50 kg (110 lbs) and &lt;= 110 kg (approximately 242 lbs) Myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary intervention/revascularization procedure within 6 months prior to dosing. Chronic heart failure (&gt; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification II). Ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Uncontrolled Type 2 (HbA1c &gt; 8.5%) or Type 1 diabetes mellitus. History of febrile illness within 5 days prior to dosing. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 10 drinks per week. 12lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt; 500 msec at screening. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.</criteria>
