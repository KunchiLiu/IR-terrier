	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Kidney injury happens in controlled hypotension during brain operations by using Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin ELISA Kit and if so, does VitaminE+Selenium prevent it</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Vitamin E+Selenium on Kidney Function in Controlled Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NGAL(Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin) is a 25KD protein which bounds with Gelatinase in Neutrophil granules.It is also expressed in epithelial cells of kidney tubules.NGAL increases in ischemic and toxic injuries of kidney. During controlled hypotension in brain operations injury to the kidneys might occur . This study is designed to assess this possibility and evaluate the effect of VitaminE+Selenium on prevention of this problem</detailed_description>
