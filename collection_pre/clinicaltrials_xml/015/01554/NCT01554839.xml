	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a unique web based educational tool called "Family of Heroes," which is designed to educate families about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and provide them with practical tools for interacting with affected veteran family members. The study includes veterans and a family member of their choosing. Participants are randomly assigned to a group which takes the online training or a group that does not take the training. Both groups complete a baseline questionnaire and a follow up questionaire 60 days later. The study will examine the number of Veteran Affairs (VA) mental health visits.</brief_summary>
