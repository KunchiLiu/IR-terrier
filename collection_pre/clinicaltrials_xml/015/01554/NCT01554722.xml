	<brief_summary>Ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block is a common regional anesthesia technique. The optimal method of needle guidance (in-plane versus out-of-plane) with regards to the block efficacy and avoidance of needle-nerve contact has not been established. In this study the investigators tests the hypothesis that the incidence of needle-nerve contact is higher with the needle insertion in an out-of-plane than with the in-plane approach.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fourty-four patients with hip fracture (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1-3) are being randomized to receive the femoral block with an out-of-plane (needle inserted at a 45°-60° angle 1 cm caudal to the midpoint of the ultrasound probe just above the femoral nerve) or an in-plane technique (needle inserted 0.5 cm from the side of the probe lateral to the femoral nerve). The data collected includes the depth of needle insertion at the endpoint before injection, response to nerve stimulation, distribution of the injected volume in relation to the nerve (anterior vs posterior, the latter indicating impalement), block efficacy at 20 minutes and 24 hours, and any signs of nerve injury).</detailed_description>
