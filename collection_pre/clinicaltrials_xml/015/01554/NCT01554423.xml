	<brief_summary>This study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of Integrated and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for HIV Prevention in Pretoria, South Africa. The RCT will evaluate the efficacy of a brief motivational interview (BMI) and a cognitive-behavioral couples' (IFCBT) intervention alone and in combination against a comparison condition to reduce new cases of HIV and sexually transmitted infections and increase condom use and decrease sexual risk behavior, drug use, and intimate partner violence among young female drug users in Pretoria, South Africa and their primary intimate partners. In the RCT, 384 couples comprised of young female drug users who do (N = 192) and do not (N = 192) trade sex and their primary intimate heterosexual partners will be randomly assigned to one-of-four conditions: (1) testing and counseling; (2) brief motivational interview (BMI); (3) cognitive-behavioral couples' intervention (IFCBT); or (4) BMI and IFCBT combined. Eligibility criteria for couples include an HIV-negative drug using female aged 18 to 40 and their primary intimate partner or spouse who is also HIV negative. Each partner of each couple will be administered assessments with a rapid test for HIV and urine tests for Chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and drug use at baseline and 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up.</brief_summary>
