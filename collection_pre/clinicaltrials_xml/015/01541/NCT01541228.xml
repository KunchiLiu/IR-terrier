	<brief_title>Photodynamic Treatment of Actinic Keratoses With Different Light Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine and compare clinical and histological effectiveness of different (70 J/cm2 ir 100 J/cm2) light doses when treating actinic keratoses with photodynamic therapy. To determine pain intensity during photodynamic therapy with visual analogue scale and factors influencing pain during the procedure.</detailed_description>
