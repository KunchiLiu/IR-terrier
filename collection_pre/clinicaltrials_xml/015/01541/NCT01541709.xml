	<brief_summary>KIT exon 9 mutants had poorer survival compared with KIT exon 11 mutants when they were treated with the same dose of imatinib, 400 mg per day, and that patients with KIT exon 9 mutation had better progression-free survival with imatinib treatment at an escalated dose, 800 mg per day, than with imatinib treatment at a dose of 400 mg per day.10,11 Based on the results, imatinib 800 mg per day is now considered the standard dose for the treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST showing KIT exon 9 mutation in Western countries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Dose Escalation to 800 mg/Day in Korean Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable GIST Harboring KIT Exon 9 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to our previous prospective phase II study of imatinib 400 mg per day in metastatic or unresectable GIST, hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were more frequent in Korean patients compared to the Western studies.7 It may be caused by relatively higher exposure to imatinib per body surface area in Korean patients than in Western population because the weight and height of Korean patients are relatively smaller than Western people. So, we plan to start imatinib at 400 mg per day and then sequentially escalate the doses of imatinib in this study.</detailed_description>
