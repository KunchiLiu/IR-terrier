	<brief_summary>The current study is being conducted in patients with major depression. The study aims to 1) investigate the combined effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and bupropion compared to SSRI alone on the improvements of depressive symptoms, fatigue, hypersomnia, and neurocognitive functions, 2) observe structural/functional/chemical changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3) and examine a relationship between the improvements of depressive symptoms, fatigue, and hypersomnia and the neural changes.</brief_summary>
