	<brief_summary>Although cardio-embolic etiology of ischemic stroke (IS) is largely respected, there is still no clear recommendation for routine complex cardiological examination in all IS patients. Using complex cardiological examination the investigators expect: 1. more accurate detection of patients with concomitant heart disease (cardiac rhythm disorder, valve disorders, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac thrombus and myxoma, atrial and ventricle septum defects) 2. higher number of etiologically determinated IS, which is crucial for accurate secondary prevention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators expect significant changes of biochemical parameters (NT pro B-type of natriuretic peptide, pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, creatinkinase MB, troponin T), inflammatory markers (interleukine 6, procalcitonin, high sensitive C-reactive protein), and coagulation parameters in patients with CE IS compared to other causes of IS. Assessing the glomerular filtration of cystatin C, glycated haemoglobin and serum lipids and its correlation with prior medicament use will allow to evaluate the long-term compensation of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia in IS patients. In addition to the above mentioned comprehensive cardiological examinations, 1- and 3-week ECG-Holter will be performed in subpopulation of patients old up to 50 years and with cryptogenic ischemic stroke in the period from 1st May 2013 to 31st December 2015. These patients will also fill in a special epidemiologic questionnaire. Anticipated enrollment in this substudy of HISTORY study is 40 - 80 patients. In selected young cryptogenic stroke patients, a subcutaneous cardiac monitor was implanted for the detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the period from 1st January 2014 to 31st December 2015.</detailed_description>
