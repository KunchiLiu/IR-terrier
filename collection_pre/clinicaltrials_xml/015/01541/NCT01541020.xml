	<brief_summary>Proprioceptive weighting changes may explain differences in postural control performance. In addition, the respiratory movement has a disturbing effect on postural balance. Postural balance seems to be impaired in individuals with respiratory disorders. Besides the essential role of respiration, the diaphragm may also play an important role in the control of the trunk and postural balance. Deficits in proprioception are found in a subgroup of patients with low back pain. In addition, disorders of respiration have been identified as strongly related to low back pain. The aim of the study is to clarify whether loading of the inspiratory muscles has a negative effect upon proprioceptive postural control in healthy individuals and individuals with recurrent low back pain.</brief_summary>
