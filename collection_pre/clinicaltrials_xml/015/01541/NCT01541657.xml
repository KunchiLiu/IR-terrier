	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 3 types of sensory-targeted rehabilitation interventions on subjective and objective measures of function for those with chronic ankle instability. The investigators hypothesize that subjective and objective measures of function including self-reported disability, balance, and range of motion will improve after 2-weeks of sensory-targeted interventions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 3 types of sensory-targeted rehabilitation interventions on subjective and objective measures of function for those with chronic ankle instability. If a potential participant is deemed eligible for participation and consents to participate, he/she undergo a pretest session in which balance, gait, and range of motion will be assessed. The participant will then be randomized into one of the 4 treatment groups and undergo the first treatment which takes approximately 5 minutes. After completion of the first treatment, the participant will be immediately retested on the balance, gait, and range of motion measures. Upon completion of testing on the first day, participants in the treatment groups will be asked to return for 5 more treatments over the course of 2 weeks. Upon completion of the treatments, each participant will be tested on their balance, gait, and range of motion again. Then, after 1 month, each participant will be contacted to do a self-reported function follow-up visit in which he/she will be asked to report how stable and functional his/her ankle has been over the past month.</detailed_description>
