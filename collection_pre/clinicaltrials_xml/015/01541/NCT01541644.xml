	<brief_summary>Patients are asked to be in this study if they have multiple myeloma and are having tingling, numbness and pain from taking bortezomib (velcade®). Patients who have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma often take bortezomib (velcade®). This research is being done to find out if acupuncture can reduce the nerve pain, tingling, and/or numbness patients experience due to bortezomib (velcade®). Acupuncture is a medical technique of inserting very thin needles into the "energy points" on the body with the aim to restore health and well-being. It has been used widely to treat pain, such as lower back pain and nerve pain. In this study we will see if acupuncture can be used to ease nerve pain and tingling, numbness that is caused by bortezomib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>1068GCC Evaluate Efficacy &amp; Explore Mechanism of Acupuncture in Treating Bortezomib-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (BIPN) in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Information gained from this clinical trial will provide insight into the efficacy and mechanism of acupuncture in reducing Bortezomib-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (BIPN) in multiple myeloma patients. It will examine the effect of acupuncture on serum proinflammatory cytokine and β-endorphin levels to further understand the mechanism of acupuncture on a molecular level. This study is the first clinical trial studying the effect of acupuncture on treating BIPN. It is also the first study to explore the mechanism of acupuncture through frequent small amount of blood draws at six time points to detect changes in proinflammatory cytokines and β-endorphins. It has the potential to identify a minimal risk non-pharmacological intervention to alleviate BIPN symptoms, and to significantly improve our understanding of the mechanism of acupuncture.</detailed_description>
