	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are to compare regional anesthesia by ropivacaine versus placebo for the bilateral resection of all four third molars under general anesthesia, in terms of: A. intraoperative use of propofol and remifentanil B. postoperative pain (EVN) at different time points C. in-hospital analgesic consumption D. time to first rescue analgesic request E. time spent in the post interventional treatment room F. length of hospital stay G. side effects H. analgesic consumption at home I. analgesic consumption (total) J. patient satisfaction K. Chronic pain after surgery</detailed_description>
