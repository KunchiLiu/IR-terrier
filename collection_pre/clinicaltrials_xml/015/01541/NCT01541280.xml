	<brief_summary>Patients included in the study with high risk acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome as defined will receive an allogeneic transplantation conditioned by either myeloablative or reduced regimen. Following allogeneic transplantation, patients will receive a maintenance regimen combining chemotherapy with azacitidine (aza) and immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusion.</brief_summary>
