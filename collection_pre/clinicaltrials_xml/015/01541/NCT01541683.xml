	<brief_summary>The investigators aim is to study the efficacy of mentholyptus drops in improving the palatability of PEG-electrolyte solution used in bowel cleansing for colonoscopy. The study is a randomized controlled trial which will include patients undergoing elective colonoscopy at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Patients will be randomized into one of two study arms using a computer generated randomization list. Patients assigned to the intervention arm will be asked to have candy (Halls®) during the whole 2 hours period while drinking the PEG solution unlike the control arm patients who will only receive the PEG solution. All patients will then be evaluated for the tolerability of the preparation while taking into account the palatability of the solution as main outcome and the remaining volume of the PEG solution and side effects as secondary outcomes.</brief_summary>
