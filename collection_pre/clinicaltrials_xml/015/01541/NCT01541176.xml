	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that the absence of post-transplantation corticosteroids does not induce a larger increase of renal graft fibrosis (by numerical reading) on biopsy at one year post-transplantation than immunosuppressive treatment strategy that includes standard oral corticosteroids.The secondary objectives of the study consist to compare on various parameters (fibrosis progression, renal function, dialysis, ratio of proteinuria/creatinuria, acute rejection, donor-specific antibody, graft survival, clinical and biological tolerance) therapy with no corticosteroids post-transplantation in comparison to standard immunosuppressive treatment strategies including oral corticosteroids. Secondary objectives of the study consist also to compare the two techniques for assessing fibrosis by numerical reading and by centralized blinded reading of the treatment group (by 2 anatomical pathologists).</brief_summary>
