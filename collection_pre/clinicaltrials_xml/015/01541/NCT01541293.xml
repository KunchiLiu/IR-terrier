	<brief_summary>This is a study to investigate whether instilling a small amount of liquid lidocaine into the uterus will decrease pain felt by women during laminaria insertions done for cervical dilation prior to second trimester abortion. The investigators hypothesize that women who receive intrauterine lidocaine in addition to a paracervical block will experience less pain than women who receive only a paracervical block.</brief_summary>
