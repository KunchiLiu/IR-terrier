	<brief_summary>Since there are no clinical studies available comparing the gold standard (autogenous bone graft plus resorbable membrane) to the promising combination of xenogenic bone graft loaded with rhBMP-2 in combination with a collagen membrane for localized ridge augmentation, the present exploratory study has been designed. The aim of the present study is therefore to test whether or not the application of a xenogenic bone block loaded with rhBMP-2 will results in clinically, radiographically and histologically similar outcomes as the gold standard (autogenous bone block) for the regeneration of chronic ridge defects. The investigators expect that there is no difference in bone quantity and quality between the two methods and that the use of the test treatment will be more user and patient friendly according to the patient perception/acceptance since no second surgical site will be necessary as well as cause less complications.</brief_summary>
