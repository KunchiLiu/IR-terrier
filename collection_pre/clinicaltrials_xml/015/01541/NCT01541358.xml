	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies fluorine F-18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing bone tumors in patients with cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as fluorine F-18 sodium fluoride PET/CT, may help find and diagnose bone cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sodium Fluoride PET/CT for the Evaluation of Skeletal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to use 18F sodium fluoride (fluorine F-18 sodium fluoride) PET/CT scanning to detect and characterize lesions in patients who have suspected skeletal malignancy. We hypothesize that scanning with 18F-NaF (fluorine F-18 sodium fluoride) is more sensitive for skeletal abnormalities and may better characterize lesions than conventional imaging.</detailed_description>
