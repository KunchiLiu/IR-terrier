	<brief_title>Methylphenidate for the Treatment of Acute Mania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mania can be regarded as an autoregulatory mechanism to enhance unstable vigilance. There is increasing evidence that psychostimulants that increase vigilance may be effective in treating mania. However, controlled studies are lacking. This is a two-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel, multi-centre phase IIIb exploratory study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in the initial treatment of acute mania in patients with bipolar affective disorders.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Inpatients 2. Written informed consent by patients who are competent to consent to study participation. 3. Diagnosis: manic episode according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD10): F30.0, F30.1, F31.0 or F31.1 4. Male or female of at least 18 years of age 5. YMRS total score ≥ 20 and ≤ 45 points 6. Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 17 7. Patients must be able to swallow tablets (study drug). 1.

Contraindications for treatment with methylphenidate except as noted otherwise 3. Serious nonpsychiatric disease, that may interfere with the objectives of the study or with the safety or compliance of the subject, as judged by the investigator 4. Oral administration of monoaminooxidase (MAO)inhibitors within two weeks, fluoxetine within 6 weeks and of any other antidepressant or primarily psychotropic substance except for those specified below within one week before study entry. 5. Stable treatment with mood stabilisers including lithium, anticonvulsants (e.g. valproate, carbamazepine) or antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine) or benzodiazepines is NOT an exclusion criterion and will be continued; however, patients receiving more than 2 of these substances are NOT eligible for inclusion 6.
