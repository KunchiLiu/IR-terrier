	<brief_title>Lymphocyte Reconstitution After Administration of Pegfilgrastim Versus Filgrastim After Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation is a standard consolidation treatment used in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in first or second line of treatment. This procedure is associated with prolonged neutropenia and considerable morbidity. Different guidelines have recommended the use of growth factor after peripheral stem cell transplantation.Pegfilgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) resulting from the modification of Filgrastim by chemical addition of a polyethylene glycol(PEG) moiety which increases its half-life by decreasing its renal clearance. Then, a single injection substitutes several Filgrastim injections. The trial "PALM" realized by our team has shown, between these 2 molecules, an equivalent efficacy on the duration of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in patients treated for lymphoma or myeloma. This trial has also shown that Pegfilgrastim is a cost-effectiveness dominant strategy. Some studies have shown that a rapid lymphocyte reconstitution after stem cell transplantation is associated with better overall survival and progression-free survival. In the present PALM2 study, the investigators want to describe the kinetics of different lymphocyte subsets reconstitution within 3 and 6 months after transplantation, in patients with B-cell malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in first or second-line chemotherapy and first autologous transplantation. The investigators will assess the kinetics of reconstitution for T-lymphocytes (Naïve T-lymphocytes, regulatory T-cells and memory T-cells), B-lymphocytes (transitional B cells), cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer T-cells, dendritic cells. A preliminary phase to this assessment will consist in estimate intra-center variability of lymphocyte phenotyping.</detailed_description>
