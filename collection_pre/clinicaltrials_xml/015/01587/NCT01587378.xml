	<brief_summary>The overall aim of the PregMet 2 Study is to investigate whether metformin prevents late miscarriages and preterm deliveries in PCOS women treated with metformin from first trimester of pregnancy to delivery in a large, randomized, controlled, multi-centre trial setting. The investigators hypothesis is that metformin compared to placebo treatment from the first trimester to term, reduces the prevalence of late miscarriage (gestational week 13-22) and preterm birth (gestational week &lt; 37) in PCOS women diagnosed according to Rotterdam 2003 consensus criteria, with singleton pregnancy.</brief_summary>
