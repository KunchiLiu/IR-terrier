	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of the Prima-Temp Thermometer Patch in determining baseline temperatures of research subjects in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Primary Objective: Assess safety of the Prima-Temp temperature patch with nursing staff skin site assessments. Secondary Objective: Establish individual subject baseline temperature using intermittent temperature measurements (every 5 minutes) with the Prima-Temp thermometer patch and wireless transmission of the data to a receiver box and HIPAA compliant, centrally located personal computer (PC) and compare research subject's baseline temperature with temperatures taken in the ICU in the normal course of care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The manifestation of fever and its characteristics is essential to the care of intensive care unit patients. As a marker for infection or other disease process, the presence of a fever and its temperature peak must be reliably obtained in ICU patients and must be monitored closely to optimize effective therapy. Inherent variability of different temperature measurement methods can lead to a difficulty in determining the optimal timing of medical interventions. Ideally, nurses and medical staff in acute care hospital facilities could have a temperature monitoring system that aids recognition of fever and systemic infection that is not labor intensive and provides consistent and reliable temperatures. Automatic transmission to a data recorder lessens the chances of manual entry error into the medical record. Frequent measurements allow establishment of a patient's individual baseline temperature to provide individualized guidelines for medical interventions with an increase of 2°F above baseline as documentation of a fever. Finally, the frequent temperature monitoring should be minimally invasive and comfortable to the patient.</detailed_description>
