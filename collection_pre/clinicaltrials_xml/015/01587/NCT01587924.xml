	<brief_title>4 Week Switch Study in Hemodialysis-dependent Subjects With Anemia Associated With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a four-week, Phase IIa, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of switching subjects from stable rhEPO to GSK1278863 in approximately 68 hemodialysis-dependent subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. The study consists of a screening phase of 2 weeks, a 4-week treatment phase and a 2-week follow-up phase. The range of Hgb values for study eligibility is 9.5-12.0 g/dL and the subjects must have received the same rhEPO product with total weekly doses that varied by no more than 50% during the 4 weeks prior to the Screening visit (Week -1. Eligible subjects, stratified by their prior rhEPO dose will be randomized in equal proportions to receive double-blind GSK1278863 0.5 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg QD (after discontinuing their rhEPO), or to continue to receive their existing type and dose of rhEPO (epoetins or their biosimilars, or darbepoetin). Study treatment will be stopped if Hgb values fall outside of the protocol pre-specified ranges. Subject completion is defined as completion of all study phases including the follow-up phase. This study aims to estimate the relationship between dose of GSK1278863 and Hgb response in hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease after switching from a stable maintenance dose of recombinant human erythropoetin (rhEPO). In addition, the study will characterize the effect of GSK1278863 on various pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, and will investigate the safety and tolerability of GSK1278863. An early interim analysis of the Hgb data is planned after approximately 20 subjects from cohort 1 have completed 3 weeks of treatment. Depending upon the interim findings, a second cohort of subjects may be added to investigate an additional GSK1278863 dose arm. Recruitment to the first cohort will continue during the interim analysis. A second interim analysis is planned after approximately 48 subjects from cohort 1 have completed 4 weeks treatment. The purpose of this interim is three-fold, to investigate if a second cohort of subjects may be added, to facilitate early development of dose-response and PK/PD statistical models, and to generate interim results to facilitate design and dosing decisions for the next trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age and weight: &gt;/=18 years of age and &gt;/=45 kg (weight postdialysis). 2. On three times weekly hemodialysis for at least 8 weeks, irrespective of eGFR values and stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD). 3. A singlepool Kt/Vurea of &gt;/=1.2 based on a historical value obtained within the prior month in order to ensure the adequacy of dialysis. If Kt/Vurea is not available, then an average of the last 2 values of urea reduction ratio (URR) of at least 65%. 4. rhEPO use: Using the same rhEPO (epoetins or darbepoetin) with total weekly doses that varied by no more than 50% during the prior 4 weeks (i.e., maximum vs. minimum total weekly doses &lt;/=50%). 5. Hgb concentrations 9.512.0 g/dL (inclusive). 6. Vitamin B12 above the lower limit of the reference range (may rescreen in two months). 7. Folate: &gt;/= 2.0 ng/mL (may rescreen in one month). 8. Ferritin: &gt;/=40 ng/mL with the absence of microcytic or hypochromic RBCs. 9. Transferrin saturation (TSAT): Within the reference range. 10. Iron replacement therapy: Stable maintenance dose of oral iron replacement therapy, if required, that will be maintained throughout the study. NOTE: IV iron replacement therapy is not allowed the two weeks prior to Screening through the end of the study (Week 6). 11. QTc: QTcB &lt;470 msec or QTcB &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch block obtained at Screening Visit (based on Central Reader's interpretation). 12. Females: Eligible to participate if she is of childbearing potential, and must agree to use one of the approved contraception methods from Screening until completion of the Followup Visit OR of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation of hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&gt;40MIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40pg/ml is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the approved contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. 13.
