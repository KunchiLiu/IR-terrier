	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 4, multicenter, open-label (blinded Pharmacodynamic PD results), randomized, 3-arm, parallel-design study of subjects with stable Coronary Artery Disease CAD. This study will compare the PD effect of prasugrel 10 mg QD (once-daily) maintenance dose with ticagrelor 90 mg BID (twice daily) maintenance dose in subjects with stable CAD who have previously received ticagrelor loading does (LD) and maintenance dose (MD)..</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female; age &gt;= 18 and &lt; 75 years Weight &gt;= 60 kg Receiving low dose ASA (75 mg to 150 mg daily) for at least 7 days at the time of Visit 1 and able to continue the same regimen throughout the study Stable CAD. CAD is defined as any of the following: History of a positive stress test Previous coronary revascularization including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stent, or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) Angiographic demonstration of CAD (at least 1 lesion &gt;= 50 percent) Presence of at least moderate plaque by computed tomography (CT) angiography Electron beam CT coronary artery calcification score &gt;= 100 Agatston units If female, may be enrolled if One of the following 3 criteria are met: Had a hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 months prior to signing the informed consent form (ICF) Postmenopausal for at least 1 year If of childbearing potential, will practice 1 of the following methods of birth control throughout the study: oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptives; intrauterine device; diaphragm plus spermicide; or female condom plus spermicide. Methods of contraception that are not acceptable are partner's use of condoms or partner's vasectomy Able and willing to provide written informed consent before entering the study Have a defined need for adenosine diphosphate (ADP)receptor inhibitor therapy, such as any of the following (or any other condition that in the Investigator's judgment would require such therapy): Within =&lt; 12 months of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event (unstable angina [UA], nonSTelevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], or STelevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) regardless of initial treatment (that is, invasive versus noninvasive) Subjects who underwent angioplasty within 12 months including baremetal stent and/or a drugeluting stent Had any stent placed in an unprotected left main coronary artery or in the last patent artery within the last 12 months Received thienopyridine therapy within 30 days of study entry Plan to undergo coronary revascularization at any time during the trial Presence or history of any of the following: ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; transient ischemic attack (TIA); intracranial neoplasm; arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm; intracranial hemorrhage; head trauma (within 3 months of study entry) History of refractory ventricular arrhythmias with an increased risk of bradycardic events (eg, subjects without a pacemaker who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block or bradycardicrelated syncope) History or evidence of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or above =&lt; 6 months before screening Severe hepatic impairment History of uric acid nephropathy Uncontrolled hypertension, or systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg at screening Severely impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/minute) or on dialysis At risk for bleeding Taking prohibited medications</criteria>
