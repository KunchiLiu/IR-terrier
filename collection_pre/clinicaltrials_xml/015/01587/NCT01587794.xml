	<brief_title>Topographic Changes of Retinal Layers After Resolution of Acute Retinal Detachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a sight-threatening condition that occurs when the neurosensory retina separates from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium and fluid accumulates within this potential space.Surgical reattachment of a detached retina is the mainstay of treatment. Experimental retinal detachment and reattachment models have demonstrated the recovery process of successfully reattached retina, including regrowth and reconfiguration of the photoreceptor inner and/or outer segments,reorganization of photoreceptor-RPE interface,increased synaptic terminals in the outer plexiform layer, inhibition of glial cell proliferation,and recovery of normal distribution of proteins. These microscopic changes are thought to be the reason for visual function recovery following retinal reattachment. Recent development in spectral domain optical coherence tomography, which provides faster imaging speed and higher resolution, allows more detailed retinal layer evaluation. Previous studies using spectral domain optical coherence tomography have revealed abnormalities of retinal microstructure in reattached retina. However, these studies mainly focused on the photoreceptor layer and/or external limiting membrane, although abnormalities of various retinal layers have been revealed in previous microscopic studies. In addition, qualitative rather than quantitative analysis was performed in most of the studies, and most importantly, all previous studies were observational and comparisons between the affected and normal control regions were not performed. The current study involves a series of recent-onset primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment that were managed with surgical retinal reattachment. The investigators quantified the thickness of each retinal layer based on spectral domain optical coherence tomography images and compared the thicknesses of reattached regions and undetached normal regions. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in thickness profiles of each retinal layer in reattached retina after acute RRD.</detailed_description>
