	<brief_summary>Design and Procedure: The design is a randomised controlled multi-centre pilot study. 18 community pharmacies located in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, were randomised to either a control or an intervention group. These pharmacies recruited eligible patients out of their clientele and invited them to take part in the study. Participants were visited at home by the pharmacist and home-based medication reviews were conducted. The survey form has been developed by the research team and comprised amongst others items to adherence, adverse effects, drug intake, storage and quality of life. Thereafter all data were analysed by the pharmacist with a newly developed document called "analysis guide" aiming at the detection of drug related problems. Pharmacists of the intervention group discussed the results with the family doctor of the patients and the patients and tried to solve the drug related problems. This procedure was not undertaken in the control group. Six months later a second medication review was carried out in both groups. Study hypothesis: Pharmaceutical care reduces the overall number of drug-related problems of elderly patients with diabetes and impairments in mobility. Aim: The purpose of this study is to show that pharmaceutical care reduces the overall number of drug-related problems of elderly diabetes-patients with impairments in mobility and leads to both an improved health status and an improved quality of life.</brief_summary>
