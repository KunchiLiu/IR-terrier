	<brief_title>Optimising Outpatient Care in Mild to Moderate Psoriasis (PSO-TOP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Topical Treatment Optimisation Programme (TTOP) has been developed by the sponsor together with Patient Boards and an Expert Advisory Board. This tool is created to address patients' non-adherence in topical therapy and the resulting underperformance of such treatments in controlling psoriatic disease. The study addresses the effect of the relationship between the patient and the health care professional, one of the important factors that can affect treatment adherence and therapeutic efficacy. The TTOP will be compared to standardised regular care (called 'non-TTOP'). It is intended to clinically show the importance of an optimised contact between the patient and health care professional.</detailed_description>
