	<brief_summary>Patients with schizophrenia are more likely to have metabolic syndrome compared to general population. The criterion for metabolic syndrome in Asian people including: elevated waist circumference (male ≥ 90cm, female ≥ 80cm), elevated triglycerides ≥ 150mg/dL, reduced HDL cholesterol: male &lt; 40mg/dL, female &lt; 50mg/dL, elevated blood pressure: ≥ 130/85 mmHg, elevated fasting glucose: ≥ 100mg/dL. Several factors have been found to be associated with metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia, e.g. age, antipsychotic drugs, smoking, family history of metabolic disorder, stress, and quality of life. However, little is known about the prevalence of and factors associated in Asian. This study aimed to: 1. Identify the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia. 2. Identify the factors associated with metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia.</brief_summary>

Identify the factors associated with metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia. Method This study is a cross-sectional study conducting at the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University. Eighty participants will be recruited with the inclusion criteria of having diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV-TR and aged 18 years or over. The exclusion criterion is having organic brain syndrome. Measurements PANSS CDSS WHOQOL-BREF-THAI</detailed_description>
