	<brief_summary>It has been shown that the stress that occurs during trauma, infection and/or shock depletes many of the body's resources such as Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) which may contribute to further complications. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of high doses of Vitamin C in critically ill patients.</brief_summary>
