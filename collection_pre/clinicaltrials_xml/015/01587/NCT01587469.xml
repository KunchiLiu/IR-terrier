	<brief_summary>This observational Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) diagnostics evaluation study is a longitudinal study of pulmonary TB suspects who are undergoing sputum evaluation for pulmonary TB. The sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF (Mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampin) assay performed on the first sputum collected for Xpert testing will be compared to gold standard conventional culture methods on two sputum specimens, in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected participants.</brief_summary>
