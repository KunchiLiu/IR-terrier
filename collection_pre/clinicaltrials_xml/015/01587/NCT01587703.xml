	<brief_summary>This study is divided into two parts; Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended dose for Part 2 based on the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles observed after oral administration of GSK525762 in the following subjects: NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer, and MYCN driven solid tumor subjects. Part 2 of the study will explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of the recommended dose from Part 1 in cohorts comprised of NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer subjects. Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in the Part 1 and approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. A sub-study will be opened in Part 1 to approximately 10-12 subjects in the United States to investigate the relative bioavailability of the besylate tablet compared to the amorphous free-base tablet at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dosing (RP2D), the effect of high-fat high-calorie meal on the bioavailability of the besylate tablet at the MTD or RP2D and the dose proportionality of two doses of GSK525762 administered as besylate tablet.</brief_summary>

If the subject is less than 18 years old, an Assent form and parental/guardian Consent form (replacing "you will" with "your child will" will be required). Diagnosis of one of the following: Part 1 Only: NUT Midline Carcinoma based on ectopic expression of NUT protein as determined by IHC and/or detection of NUT gene translocation as determined by FISH. Subjects may be treatment naïve or have had prior therapy; SCLC, CRC, NB, TNBC, ER positive BC, CRPC, NSCLC and any other solid tumor which has been confirmed by clinical testing to be MYCN amplified (defined as a MYCN gene copy number gain of &gt;=5).

Part 2 only: NUT Midline Carcinoma as diagnosed by the Central Laboratory. Subjects may be treatment naïve or have had prior therapy. SCLC, CRPC, TNBC and ER+BC . Subjects with solid tumors, with the exception of CRPC, must demonstrate measurable disease, per RECIST v1.1.

Reproductive /endocrine system: testosterone &lt;50 nanogram (ng)/dL (only for subject with CRPC) Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40 milli international unit/mL and estradiol less than 40 pg/mL (less than 140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method; Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods (described in the protocol) for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 7 months after the last dose of study medication; Negative serum pregnancy test &lt;=7 days prior to first study drug dose; Female subjects who are lactating must discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study treatment and must refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 5 halflives of GSK525762 or at least 28 days (whichever is longer) following the last dose of study treatment. Male subjects must agree to use one of the methods of contraception specified. This method must be used from the time of the first dose of study medication until least 16 weeks after the last dose of study medication. In addition, male subjects whose partners are or become pregnant while on study medication must continue to use condoms for 7 days after stopping study medications.
