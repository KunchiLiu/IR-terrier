	<brief_summary>There are a number of anti-epileptic drugs available for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. This study is a systematic review of the published literature on anti-epileptic drugs and is designed to compare the relative effectiveness and tolerability of a selection of them with retigabine. The drugs chosen for this comparison were lacosamide, pregabalin, tiagabine, zonisamide and eslicarbazepine. They were chosen because they belong to the newer generation of drugs for epilepsy (as does retigabine) and they have a similar license as well as having published data from studies that were conducted in similar patient populations with similar methods. GSK commissioned YHEC (York Health Economic Consortium) to carry out this review and analysis. YHEC identified relevant studies from international databases. These studies had compared one of the chosen anti-epileptic drugs with placebo. The results were pooled and combined in order to summarize the data for individual drugs as well to compare the results for different drugs with each other and with retigabine. Since none of the individual clinical studies compared one active drug with another, this systematic review is an indirect comparison of these drugs, using an established and recognised methodology which has well understood limitations.</brief_summary>
