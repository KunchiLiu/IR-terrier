	<brief_summary>This is a four-week Phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 in approximately 68 subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease who are not taking rhEPO and are not undergoing dialysis. The range of Hgb values for study eligibility is 8.5-11.0 g/dL. Eligible subjects will be randomized in equal proportions to receive once daily (QD) placebo or GSK1278863 0.5 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg in a double-blind fashion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>4 Week Correction Study in Subjects With Anemia Associated With Chronic Kidney Disease Who Are Not Undergoing Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a four-week Phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 in approximately 68 subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease who are not taking rhEPO and are not undergoing dialysis. The study consists of a screening phase of up to 2 weeks, a 4-week treatment phase and a 2-week follow-up phase. The range of Hgb values for study eligibility is 8.5-11.0 g/dL. Eligible subjects will be randomized in equal proportions to receive once daily (QD) placebo or GSK1278863 0.5 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg in a double-blind fashion. Study treatment will be stopped if Hgb values fall outside of the range pre-specified in the protocol. This study aims to estimate the relationship between dose of GSK1278863 and Hgb response for correcting anemia in non-dialysis subjects with CKD who are not taking rhEPO (NDD). In addition, the study will characterize the effect of GSK1278863 on various pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) markers, and will investigate the safety and tolerability of GSK1278863. An early interim analysis of the Hgb data is planned after approximately 20 subjects from cohort 1 have completed 3 weeks of treatment. Depending upon the interim findings, a second cohort of subjects may be added to investigate an additional GSK1278863 dose arm. Recruitment to the first cohort will continue during the interim analysis. A second interim analysis is planned after approximately 48 subjects from cohort 1 have completed 4 weeks treatment. The purpose of this interim is three-fold, to investigate whether a second cohort of subjects may be added, to facilitate early development of dose-response and PK/PD statistical models, and to generate interim results to facilitate design and dosing decisions for the next trial. Subject completion is defined as completion of all study phases including the follow-up phase.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age and weight: &gt;/= 18 years of age and &gt;/= 45 kg. 2. Not routinely undergoing dialysis, regardless of the modality (either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or dialysis planned during the time the subject would be enrolled in the study. 3. No current or prior rhEPO use within the past 7 weeks; e.g., epoetins (or their biosimilars), darbepoetin, Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta), peginesatide or their biosimilars.. 4. KDOQI CKD stages 3/4/5 defined by eGFR using the Modification of Diet for Renal Disease (MDRD). 5. Hgb: Hgb concentrations 8.511.0 g/dL (inclusive) as outlined in Section 4.2. 6. Vitamin B12: Above the lower limit of the reference range (may rescreen in 2 months). 7. Folate: &gt;/=2.0 ng/mL at Screening. May rescreen in a month. 8. Ferritin: &gt;/=40 ng/mL with the absence of microcytic or hypochromic RBCs. 9. TSAT within the reference range. 10. Iron replacement therapy: Stable maintenance dose of oral iron replacement therapy, if required, that will be maintained throughout the study. NOTE: IV iron replacement therapy is not allowed the two weeks prior to Screening through the end of the study (Week 6). 11. QTc: QTcB &lt;470 msec or QTcB &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch block obtained at Screening Visit, based on Central Reader's interpretation. 12. Females: Eligible to participate if she is of childbearing potential, and must agree to use approved contraception methods from Screening until completion of the Followup Visit OR of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation of hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&gt;40 MIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the approved contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most types of HRT, at least 2 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. 13. Males: Must agree to use approved contraceptive methods from the time of Screening until completion of the Followup Visit. 1. Dialysis: Planning to initiate dialysis during the study or who have a high potential for initiating dialysis during study participation. 2. Renal transplant: Renal transplant anticipated or scheduled within the study time period or subjects with a functioning renal transplant. 3. Total CPK: &gt;5x the upper limit of the reference range. 4. HIV: Positive HIV antibody. 5. History of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome within the prior 6 months. 6. History of stroke or TIAs. 7. Heart failure: Class III/IV heart failure, as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system. 8.
