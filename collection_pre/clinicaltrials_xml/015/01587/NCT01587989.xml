	<brief_summary>This multicenter study with a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase will evaluate the safety and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in combination with methotrexate versus RoActemra/Actemra monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate rheumatoid arthritis, with an inadequate response to methotrexate. Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks plus oral methotrexate 15-25 mg weekly for 12 weeks. Patients with a good/moderate EULAR response will then be randomized to receive either RoActemra/Actemra plus methotrexate or RoActemra/Actemra plus placebo for the following 12 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 6 months.</brief_summary>
