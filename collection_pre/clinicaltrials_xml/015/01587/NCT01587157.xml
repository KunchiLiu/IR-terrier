	<brief_summary>Capnography provides noninvasive monitoring of ventilation and can allow early recognition of altered respiration patterns and apnea. The aim of this prospective study was to compare the detection of apnea and the prediction of oxygen desaturation and hypoxemia by capnography versus clinical surveillance during procedural sedation for percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD).</brief_summary>
