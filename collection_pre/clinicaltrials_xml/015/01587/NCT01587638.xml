	<brief_summary>This study used an observational, retrospective cohort design to compare the presence and timing of new-onset diabetes (NOD) between hypertensive patients initiating therapy with carvedilol immediate-release (IR) and carvedilol controlled-release (CR) vs the following cardioselective beta blockers (BBs): atenolol, metoprolol succinate, and metoprolol tartrate (referred to hereafter as 'other BB'). The aim of the study was to investigate the likelihood of developing NOD among hypertensive patients initiating carvedilol therapy vs other BB therapy in a real world setting derived from data contained in a large United States (US) managed care database.</brief_summary>
