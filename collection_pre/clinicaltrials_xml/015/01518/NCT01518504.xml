	<brief_title>Effects of Thoracic Mobilization on Shoulder Range of Motion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many individuals who have a primary complaint of shoulder pain often demonstrate deficits in glenohumeral and scapulothoracic mobility. Typically individuals will have limitations in shoulder range of motion, specifically, flexion (elevation) as well as external and internal rotation. Although the glenohumeral joint is the primary joint for shoulder motion adjacent joints such as the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, scapulothoracic, and thoracic spine also contribute to maximal shoulder motion. Limited shoulder motion may be a result of joint hypomobility, muscle inhibition, or pain. Typically interventions such as stretching and joint mobilization/manipulation are directed at the glenohumeral joint to improve shoulder motion, but little is known about interventions targeting adjacent sites which may also improve shoulder range of motion. This study will evaluate the effect of thoracic spine joint manipulation on active and passive shoulder range of motion.</detailed_description>
