	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to test the effect of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in patients with multi-organ Bodily distress syndrome (BDS). BDS is a unifying diagnosis that encompasses a group of closely related conditions such as somatization disorder, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. The project consists of a three-armed randomized controlled trial of ACT treatment given as a supplement to standard treatment as either 9-session group therapy or as a 1-day workshop followed by an individual consultation, compared to standard treatment, which is one single advisory consultation. Primary outcome is patient-rated improvement measured by Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Secondary outcome is functional level (physical, mental and social) measured by the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS). The study includes 180 participants.</detailed_description>
