	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets of canagliflozin and metformin immediate release (IR) in comparison with the individual components of canagliflozin and metformin IR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Bioequivalence of 2 Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) Tablets of Canagliflozin and Metformin Immediate Release (IR) (150 mg/850 mg) With Respect to the Individual Components of Canagliflozin (1 x 300 mg) and Metformin IR Tablets (2 x 850 mg) in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff), single-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence of canagliflozin and metformin IR when administered orally (by mouth) as individual components (ie, separate tablets of canagliflozin and metformin IR) (Treatment A) and when administered as fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets (ie, canagliflozin and metformin IR contained in the same tablet) (Treatment B). Healthy volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive Treatment A followed by Treatment B or Treatment B followed by Treatment A with a period of approximately 15 days between treatments.</detailed_description>
