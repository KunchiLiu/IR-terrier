	<detailed_description>Brain Computer Interface (BCI) are used to restore control and communication in patient with severe disabilities such as Locked In Syndrome (LIS) patients. The aim of this study is to identify the most relevant recording technique for extraction of P300 ERPs in EEG signals. Three different electrodes (needle, standard ,silver) will be simultaneously compared in a prospective design in 10 healthy volunteers, as suggested by principal investigator.</detailed_description>
