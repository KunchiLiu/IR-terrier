	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to test the effect of the tricyclic antidepressant Imipramine in patients with longlasting health problems with no known medical explanation, defined as multi-organ Bodily distress syndrome (BDS). Pharmacological treatment of patients with BDS have never been tested, and Imipramine i low dosage (10-75 mg) has the potential of reducing both pain and other symptoms of bodily distress for patients with BDS. Control conditions are pill placebo. Study duration is 19 weeks for each of the 140 patients. End point is 13 weeks, i.e. after 10 weeks of 25-75 mg study drug.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to test the effect of Imipramine in patients with multi-organ Bodily distress syndrome (BDS). BDS is a unifying diagnosis that encompasses a group of closely related conditions such as somatization disorder, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. The project consists of a double-blinded placebo controlled trial of treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant Imipramine in dosages of 25-75 mg. Primary outcome is patient-rated improvement measured by Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Secondary outcome is functional level (physical, mental and social) measured by the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS). The study requires 140 participants and study duration is 19 weeks for each patient. End point is 13 weeks, i.e. after 10 weeks of 25-75 mg study drug.</detailed_description>

Simultaneous use of: antipsychotics oral anticoagulants diuretics sympathomimetics and CNSstimulating drugs (amphetaminelike drugs) all serotonergic drugs, e.g. SSRI, SNRI and TCA, the dietary supplement hypericum perforatum, nonselective, irreversible or selective, reversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, triptans, tramadol, pethidin and tryptophan the drugs cimetidine (H2antagonist), quinidine (antiarrythmics), clonidine (antihypertensive), fluconazol (antimycotics), clindamycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin (antibiotics), droperidol (anaesthetic), levodopa (antiparkinson), mefloquine (antimalaria), phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepin (antiepileptica) Bupropion (tobacco dependence), celecoxib (NSAID), cinacalcet (antiparathyroid drug), duloxetine (SNRI), flufenazin (antipsychotic), fluoxetin (SSRI), gefitinib (antineoplastic), moclobemid (MAO), paroxetine, Sertraline (SSRI), Terbinafine (antimycotics), Yohimbin (erectile dysfunction) samt fluvoxamin (SSRI), ciprofloxacin and enoxacin (microbiotic), because plasma concentration of Imipramine can increase with the simultaneous use of these potent CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 inhibitors</criteria>
