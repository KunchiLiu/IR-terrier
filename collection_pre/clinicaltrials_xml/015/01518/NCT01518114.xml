	<brief_summary>Exercise training (ET) is highly beneficial in heart failure patients and has been suggested to confer significant symptomatic and functional improvements in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the safety, feasibility of a structured ET program in symptomatic HCM patients.</brief_summary>
