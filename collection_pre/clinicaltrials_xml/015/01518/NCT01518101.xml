	<brief_summary>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics or analogs, which rely on the gastrointestinal hormones that are part of the incretin system for the treatment of T2DM, provide a therapeutic alternative to common oral antihyperglycemic agents (eg, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones). Although GLP-1 analogs and DPP-4 inhibitor medications are effective, there are differences between these products, including method of administration (injectable versus oral). Previous studies have shown that patients prefer additional oral agents over injectable agents because of fear of injections and the desire to avoid them. Patient preference is both clinically and financially important, as it can have long-term implications in terms of patients' motivation and insight into their disease state and its treatment, which might have a direct impact on the patient's compliance and treatment adherence. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the proportion of T2DM patients preferring oral anti-diabetic treatment with vildagliptin + metformin versus an injectable anti-diabetic treatment with liraglutide after 4 weeks of treatment with each medication.</brief_summary>
