	<brief_summary>There are many ways of performing arthrodesis in the foot and ankle. Dowel fusion is one of them. The in situ technique was first described by Ottolenghi et al. (1970) and was taken up by Baciu and Filibiu (1979). In the technique, they did take the dowel out before turning it. The healing process takes place between surfaces of spongious bone. They showed excellent results with early weight bearing and healing within 12.5 weeks. Stranks et al. (1994) combined the dowel technique with screw fixation and claimed 95 % healing rate within 12.5 weeks. Others have not found this technique satisfactory in rheumatoid arthritis patients (Belt et al. 2001). The results were not compatible to common fusion techniques. The reason may be the circular bone gap of at least 1 mm left by the saw blade. A new instrumentation and a new staple with a central wedge (ASTUS) avoid this gap and allow the dowel to be turned in situ without leaving in position. The staple is introduced into the joint line and will compress the dowel surfaces against the surrounding bone. Instruments are available to ensure the correct position and length of the dowel, and to rotate it in situ before the special wedge staple is introduced. Dr Kofoed, the surgeon designer of the ASTUS Staple, has communicated on his first series with 83 arthrodesis. The purpose of this study is now to collect and publish data from several centers, several users. The objective of this study is to obtain the percentage of healing 3 months after an implantation of the staple ASTUS.</brief_summary>
