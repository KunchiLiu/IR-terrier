	<brief_summary>Asparaginase is a cornerstone in the treatment of ALL, but its utility is limited by toxicities including hypersensitivity. Clinical allergy is associated with inactivation of asparaginase by antibodies (A-Abs), which can also neutralize asparaginase without any clinical signs of hypersensitivity (silent inactivation). GRASPA improves pharmacokinetics, tolerability and maintain circulating asparaginase activity due to the protective barrier of the erythrocyte membrane. This study is run to confirm the benefit/risk profile of GRASPA at 150 IU/kg in combination with the COOPRALL regimen in adults and children patients with relapsed ALL, with or without known hypersensitivity to L-asparaginase.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open, randomized international Phase 2/3 study will enrol patients with relapsed ALL. The co-primary endpoints were the duration of asparagine depletion &lt; 2µmol/L and the incidence of asparaginase hypersensitivity during induction. Key secondary endpoints are complete remission (CR), minimal residual disease (MRD), event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).The study was powered to detect 3-fold difference in the incidence of allergic reactions between treatments. patients will be randomized to GRASPA or to Reference L-asparaginase. Patients with history of hypersensitivity to previous L-asparaginase treatment will be treated with GRASPA (exploratory arm)</detailed_description>
