	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to investigate incremental cost effectiveness of Nifedipine CR and Amlodipine in combination therapy with Valsartan for the treatment of essential hypertensive patients. To investigate incremental cost effectiveness, primary variables are mean treatment cost and achievement rate to target blood pressure level at the end of double-blind treatment period.</brief_summary>
