	<brief_title>Reducing Radioisotope Dose: the Half-Dose CZT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to compare the image quality of the half radioisotope dose scans obtained using a CZT (cadmium zinc telluride) camera with scans acquired using a standard of care imaging protocol/radioisotope dose performed on a traditional (conventional) camera. The proposed strategy of a half dose/extended time protocol with the CZT camera should yield a similar count activity and consequently image quality equivalent to that detected by a conventional SPECT system.</detailed_description>
