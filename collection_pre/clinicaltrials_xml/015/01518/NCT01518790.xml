	<brief_title>Short Course, Single-dose PEG 3350 for Colonoscopy Prep in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: It is hoped that by determining acceptability, safety and efficacy of this widely used short course, single-dose bowel preparation regimen, pediatric gastroenterologist can have a standardized bowel preparation for colonoscopy that will be acceptable to pediatric patients and their parents. Research Design: This study is a prospective medication trial. It will utilize laboratory data to detect any electrolyte changes, a patient questionnaire to assess an acceptable duration, tolerance and side effects of the regimen. Efficacy of the cleanout will be assessed using a published standardized bowel preparation scale by the endoscopist at the completion of the colonoscopy. Methodology /Technical Approach (including the number of subjects to be studied.): We estimate that 50 patients aged 8-18 years old military dependents who are undergoing a colonoscopy by the Pediatric Gastroenterology service at WRAMC/WRNMMC will be enrolled in the study between 1 Sep 2010 and 31 Dec 2011.</detailed_description>
