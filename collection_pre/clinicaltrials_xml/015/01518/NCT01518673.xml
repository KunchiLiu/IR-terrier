	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing a computed tomography are exposed to a relatively high dose of X-rays. Pediatric patients are known to be very radiosensitive with respect to radiation induced cancer. Using the technique of scoring Î³-H2AX foci in peripheral blood lymphocytes the most important lesions to the genetic material DNA, double strand breaks induced by CT X-rays can be detected. The technique will be applied in a multicenter setting for evaluation of X-effects induced by a computed tomography examination in a population of pediatric patients. To this end a blood sample will be taken from the patients before and after the examination.</brief_summary>
