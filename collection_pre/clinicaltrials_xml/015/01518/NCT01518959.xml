	<brief_summary>Recent data have shown that the inadequate vitamin D status plays a role in the manifestation of the haematologic tumors and serum vitamin D level has a prognostic role also as it determines the tumor mortality. But data have not proved a causal relationship between the inadequate vitamin D status and the unfavourable outcomes so far. It is also still unknown, whether the normalization of vitamin D status in patient with vitamin D inadequacy is able to improve the prognosis and survival. In this study the investigators examine the role of the adequate vitamin D substitution in the improvement of the outcomes of haematologic disorders.</brief_summary>
