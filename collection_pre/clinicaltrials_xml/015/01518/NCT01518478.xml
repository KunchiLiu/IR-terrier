	<brief_summary>A new flu vaccine which is injected into the skin instead of into the muscle has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for vaccination of the general population including patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). This new vaccine has been shown to work as well as the vaccine which is injected into muscle when tested in people without atopic dermatitis. The primary endpoint of the study is to estimate the variance of the log fold change from baseline in HAI antibody titers for non-atopic controls and participants with atopic dermatitis without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-), following administration of a single dose of the seasonal 2011-2012 Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN) Influenza Vaccine Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, open-label, mechanistic study designed to determine the variance of the antibody response in non-atopic and ADEH- participants receiving a single dose of the 2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine administered per label. Twenty non-atopic and 20 ADEH- (mild to severe AD) adults aged 18 to 64 years will be enrolled. Enrollment will be closely monitored to ensure that there is a similar distribution of non-atopic and ADEH- participants by gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Eligible study participants will provide a pre-vaccination blood sample (Day 0) for assessment of baseline HAI antibody titers, cellular immune response, total IgE, and allergen sensitization, and will then receive a single injection of the 2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine administered per label. A subset of participants will also provide blood for microarray analysis at Baseline (Day 0) and will return to the clinic 3 and 7 days post-vaccination to provide additional blood for microarray analysis. All participants will return to the study site 28 days post-vaccination for a blood draw for HAI antibody titers and cellular immune response assays. Study participants will be followed for safety, including serious adverse events (SAEs), throughout the entire duration of the study and will be asked to record solicited AEs on a diary card (Days 0-7).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment. Who are males and females 18 to 64 years of age, inclusive, on the day of vaccination. Who are enrolled in the ADRN Registry study. Who have active, mild to severe AD without a history of EH or who are nonatopic as diagnosed using the ADRN Standard Diagnostic Criteria. Nonatopic status will be based on selfreported history and will not take total IgE or allergen sensitization results into account. Who are willing to sign the informed consent form prior to initiation of any study procedure. Participants who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for enrollment. Who are pregnant or lactating. Women of child bearing potential must avoid becoming pregnant (use of an effective method of contraception or abstinence) for the duration of their participation in the study. Who have a known allergy to any component of the Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine, including egg protein, or have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. Who have a known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency or who have had immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months. Who have received systemic steroid therapy at any dose or intraarticular administration of steroids within 3 months prior to the day of vaccination. Who have received a cumulative dose of inhaled and/or intranasally administered corticosteroids ≥ 880 mcg/day fluticasone equivalent within 3 months prior to the day of vaccination. Who have a chronic illness, including but not limited to, cardiac, renal, or autoimmune disorders, or diabetes, at a stage that could interfere with study conduct or completion, based on the opinion of the Investigator. Who have a neoplastic disease or any hematologic malignancy, (excluding uncomplicated nonmelanoma skin cancer and participants who have a history of neoplastic disease and have been disease free for at least five years). Who have participated in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or a medical procedure in the four weeks preceding the study vaccination or who plan to participate in another clinical trial during the present study period. Who have any skin disease other than AD that might compromise the stratum corneum barrier (e.g., bullous disease, psoriasis, cutaneous T cell lymphoma [also called Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary syndrome], dermatitis herpetiformis, HaileyHailey, or Darier's disease). Who have received blood or bloodderived products that might interfere with the assessment of immune response in the past 3 months prior to vaccination or who plan to receive such products during the study period. Who have received previous vaccination (Fluzone® or another vaccine) against influenza in the past 6 months prior to vaccination. Who have received any other vaccinations in the 4 weeks preceding study vaccination or who plan to receive any vaccination in the 4 weeks following study vaccination. Who have had thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorder in the 3 weeks preceding vaccination. Who have had a personal or family history of GuillainBarré Syndrome. Who have a first degree relative already enrolled in the study. Who are determined to be not eligible based on the opinion of the Investigator. Who require Class I or II topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors for longterm control of their eczema. Temporary Vaccination Should one of the conditions listed below occur, the Investigator will postpone vaccination until the condition is resolved. Signs and symptoms of an acute infectious respiratory illness. Febrile illness (temperature ≥ 37.5°C [or ≥ 99.5°F]) or moderate or severe acute illness/infection on the day of vaccination. Atopic dermatitis flare, a worsening of the AD participant's skin condition, requiring increased level of baseline treatment during the previous 7 days. Participant must not have applied Class I or II topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors to any part of the body in the 7 days prior to vaccination. Nonclass I or II topical corticosteroids must not have been applied to the deltoid region of the extremity to be vaccinated in the 7 days prior to vaccination. Who have taken antipyretics and/or analgesics (e.g. acetaminophen, ibuprofen) within 24 hours prior to the time of vaccination.</criteria>
