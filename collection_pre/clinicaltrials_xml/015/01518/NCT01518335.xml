	<brief_title>Use of Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy for Acute Ankle Sprains in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intention of this research project is to study a new treatment for severe ankle sprains.This new treatment is called Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy and involves injecting concentrated platelet's from a patient's own blood into the site of injury to aid healing. Platelets, aside from their clotting capabilities also serve a role in re-vascularization of tissue as well as collagen repair. PRP therapy has been used in sports medicine for treatment of chronic injuries but has yet to be proven effective in acute injury of a joint. The investigators are comparing treatment and placebo groups based on a subjective patient questionnaire and pain score administered on the day of injury and 2-3 days and 8-10 days follow up.</detailed_description>
