	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Laying-on-of-hands for Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a high risk of premature death in Africa, mainly due to insufficient medical services. SCD patients often visit emergency department and need hospitalization when they suffer from severe pain; however, they manage most of painful episodes at home. Appropriate pain management at home is, therefore, crucial to improve their clinical course and quality of life. Laying-on-of-hands may be a good candidate for home care management, because family member(s) can become a practitioner of laying-on-of-hands without difficulty and administer it to their loved one as an initial treatment whenever necessary. There are no reports concerning the effectiveness of laying-on-of-hands for the outcomes of SCD patients, as far as we have investigated.</detailed_description>
