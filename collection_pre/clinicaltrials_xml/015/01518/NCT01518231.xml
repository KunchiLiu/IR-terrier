	<brief_title>Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke is among the main causes of mortality and disability of elderly population which still lack of efficient therapy. Stem sell transplantation provides a functional improvement after cerebral ischemia in rat models. Our study will recruit 40 ischemic stroke patients which will be divided into 2 groups (20 patients each): treatment group and control group. The former will be implanted with peripheral blood stem cell through anterior cerebral artery or middle cerebral artery (determined by the section of infarction) and receive convention stroke therapy. The latter only receive convention stroke therapy. The investigators expect that transplantation of the peripheral hematopoietic stem cell is safe and efficient to neurological recovery.</detailed_description>
