	<brief_title>Safety Study of a Vaccine (DENV-1 PIV) to Prevent Dengue Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DENV infections can cause self-limited but incapacitating acute illness lasting four to seven days. The illness is characterized by fever, headache, severe pain in muscles, joints, pain behind the eyes, and a rash. DENV infection can be complicated by the development of hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or shock syndrome (DSS), which is manifested by plasma leakage and a bleeding diathesis or frank hemorrhage. DHF is fatal in at least 0.5% of pediatric cases but rarely in adults. People, particularly children, living in hyper-endemic areas who have antibodies from an earlier dengue infection with one serotype are at increased risk for DHF if subsequently infected by another dengue virus serotype. Currently, no specific anti-viral therapy exists. Therapy is largely supportive. Mosquito control has failed to prevent dengue transmission; therefore, prevention of dengue through vaccination is an important objective of the World Health Organization (WHO) and many national governments, including the United States.</detailed_description>
