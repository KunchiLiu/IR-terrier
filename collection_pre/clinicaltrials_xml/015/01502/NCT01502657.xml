	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Percutaneous Tracheostomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous tracheostomy is commonly performed in critical care units when ventilatory weaning fails or when prolonged mechanical ventilation is required. Numerous complications have been described since the widespread use of Percutaneous Tracheostomy (PCT). Bronchoscopy-guided percutaneous tracheostomy was developed in this context. However, bronchoscopy cannot identify vascular structures and the thyroid gland in the neck, and therefore cannot prevent complications related to organ lesions in the neck. Several studies have demonstrated the value of ultrasound guidance in the neck before performing PCT. No studies have demonstrated the feasibility and the safety of ultrasound guidance for PCT. Ultrasound could improve the understanding of neck anatomy, prevents vascular puncture, and helps guide insertion of the tracheostomy tube.</detailed_description>
