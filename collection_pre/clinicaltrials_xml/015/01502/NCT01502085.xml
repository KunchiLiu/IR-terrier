	<brief_title>Vorinostat,Lenalinomide and Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma Refractory to Previous Lenalinomide Containing Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>lenalidomide has been investigated in combination with both lenalidomide and bortezomib regimens. "Investigational" means that the drug is still being studied and that the study doctors are trying to find out more about it; such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood. It is currently being tested in a variety of cancer conditions. In this case it is considered experimental because the FDA has not approved this combination. Your will receive 25mg of lenalidomide on days 1-21 every 28 days. Vorinostat is a drug that interferes with the life sustaining functions of the tumor cells. It has already received regulatory approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of T-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the United States. The usage of vorinostat in Multiple Myeloma is experimental (investigational) and has not been approved by the FDA, but studies in combination with proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) and immunomodulatory (lenalidomide) agents are ongoing. You will receive either 400mg of vorinostat on days 1-7 and 15-21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone is a steroid that is known to cause cell death in multiple myeloma. Dexamethasone is FDA approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and many other disease states. You will receive either Dexamethasone 40mg for those less than 75 years of age or 20mg for those aged 75 years and above on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 every 28 days In this research study the investigators are looking to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vorinostat when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in treating relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, refractory to lenalidomide.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible to enroll in this study: International Staging System symptomatic multiple myeloma, as recently defined (Kyle et al., 2009) or DurieSalmon stage IIII multiple myeloma, after at least one (1) prior antimyeloma regimen. Refractory to lenalidomide (administered either with dexamethasone or in combination with other agents); refractory will be defined as no response (&lt;MR) or PD on or within 60 days of discontinuing a prior lenalidomidecontaining regimen. Measurable monoclonal protein by serum or urine; or FLC level ≥ 10mg/dL (with abnormal FLC ratio), or measurable extramedullary plasmacytomas: No prior HDAC inhibitor Age ≥ 18 years Performance status ECOG 03 Acceptable organ function as defined by: Bilirubin &lt;2 x upper limit of normal ALT and AST &lt;2.5 x upper limit of normal Serum creatinine &lt;3.0 mg/dL ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L Platelet count ≥50 x 109/L QTc interval ≤ 470ms Nonpregnant and nonlactating Life expectancy of more than six months Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local and institutional guidelines Females of Child Bearing Potential* (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test, with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 1014 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide for cycle 1 (prescription must be filled with 7 days) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO methods of acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method AND one additional effective method of birth control (contraception) AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy Testing. (See Appendix G: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods) *A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy (See Appendix G: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods) All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®. Subjects must adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements and receive outpatient treatment and laboratory monitoring at the institute that administers the drug. Subjects must agree to take entericcoated aspirin 81325 mg orally daily, or if history of prior thrombotic disease or allergy to aspirin, must be fully anticoagulated with warfarin (INR 23), Pradaxa® or be treated with fulldose, low molecular weight heparin, as if to treat deep venous thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism. Subjects must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria to be eligible to enroll in this study: Subjects with nonsecretory or hyposecretory multiple myeloma, defined as &lt;0.5 g/dL Mprotein in serum and &lt;200 mg/24 hr Bence Jones protein in urine and serum free light chain &lt;10mg/dL (&lt;100 mg/L) Any other uncontrolled medical condition or comorbidity that might interfere with subject's participation Pregnant or breast feeding females CrCl &lt;30 ml/min or renal failure requiring hemodialysis Prior history or malignancy other than multiple myeloma, unless patient has been disease free of the disease for ≥3 years.
