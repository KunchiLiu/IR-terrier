	<brief_title>Identifying the Needs of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans and Their Families: TBI and Co-Occurring Behavioral Health Issues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The focus of this project is on qualitative data collection to facilitate product development including assessment and treatment guidelines to improve non-VA community mental health care for OEF/OIF Veterans with TBI and co-occurring behavioral health issues within the state of Colorado. In addition to the development of assessment and treatment guidelines, other products developed through this study will include a training and accompanying toolkit, which may be used for annual educational training of mental health providers. As such, there are no hypotheses associated with this study. This statewide initiative may not only improve quality and access to non-VA community mental health care for persons with TBI and co-occurring behavioral health issues within Colorado, but also serve as a model for implementation across the country.</detailed_description>
