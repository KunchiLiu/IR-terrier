	<brief_summary>There has been little research on neointimal coverage and malapposition after BES implantation using OCT in human coronary artery. Furthermore, specific drug may possibly influence the vascular healing after stent implantation. Therefore, this study will investigate 1) neointimal coverage and malapposition on OCT after BES versus SES implantation and 2) relationship of specific drug treatment and neointimal coverage or late malapposition by the prospective, randomized study.</brief_summary>
