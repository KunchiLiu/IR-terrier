	<brief_title>Making Decisions About Depression Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the ability of decision aids to effectively translate a depression comparative effectiveness research (CER) review into practice, the investigators have developed a literacy-sensitive depression treatment decision aid, DEPRESSION MEDICATION CHOICE, which adapts the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)'s Effective Healthcare comparative effectiveness review and associated patient guide about antidepressant medicines to satisfy the needs of clinicians, patients, and other major stakeholders. The investigators will conduct a randomized study to estimate the effect of the decision aid on patient knowledge, patient involvement in decision making and decision-making quality, and on three and six-month measures of medication adherence and mental health, when compared with usual care.</detailed_description>
