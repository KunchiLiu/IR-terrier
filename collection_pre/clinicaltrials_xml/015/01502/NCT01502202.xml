	<brief_summary>Intercalated administration of Iressa® (gefitinib) on days 5-18 of chemotherapy cycle improve the efficacy of Pemetrexed/platinum regimen given as first-line treatment for never-smokers with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) lung adenocarcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intercalated Administration of PamCis With Gefitinib or Placebo as First Line Lung Adenocarcinoma in Never Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators believe this PFS curve crossing-over in both IPASS and First-SIGNAL study is mainly due to early progression of EGFR mutation-negative tumors after gefitinib alone. Taken together with the FASTACT trial results, this PFS curve crossing-over may well be averted if effective chemotherapy is given together with gefitinib in a most optimum timing and sequence. Apparently, timing of EGFR-TKI administration within chemotherapy cycles is very critical, as shown in OSI 9774 trial. In this placebo-controlled randomized phase II, Investigators propose to give gefitinib on days 5-18 of a 3-weekly chemotherapy cycle of pemetrexed/cisplatin to avoid any potential overlap of EGFR-TKI effects on chemotherapy or vice versa. Investigators would like to generate promising pilot data, which warrants a large phase III trial. Investigators hope to show that intercalated administration of Iressa® (gefitinib) and Pemetrexed/platinum regimen improves the outcome of never-smokers with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) lung adenocarcinoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of lung with or without BAC features; however, adenocarcinoma combined with other histology, such as small cell carcinoma or squamous carcinoma, is not allowed. 2. Stage IIIB (not amenable for radical locoregional therapy) or stage IV (metastatic) patients according to the 7th TNM staging system 3. Age 1875 4. Neversmoking defined as not more than 100 cigarettes during the lifetime 5. ECOG performance status of 02 6. Good organ function 7. The presence of CNS metastases is not considered as an exclusion criterion, provided that there is good control of the symptoms with corticosteroids 8. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of the study in keeping with the policy of the hospital. The only approved consent form is attached to this protocol 1. Patients with prior exposure to agents directed at the HER 2. Patients with prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic antitumour therapy for advanced disease. 3. Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract, or malabsorption syndrome, or inability to take oral medication, or have active peptic ulcer disease. 4. Known severe hypersensitivity to gefitinib or to any of the study drugs. 5. Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease 6. Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates, or St John's Wort 7. Prior invasive malignancies 3 years prior to study entry except adequately treated cutaneous basal cell carcinoma or uterine cervix in situ cancer 8. As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease 9. Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes it undesirable for the subject to participate in the study 10. Treatment with a nonapproved or investigational drug within 30 days before Day 1 of study treatment. 11. Pregnancy or breastfeeding (women of childbearing potential). 12. Sexually active males and females (of childbearing potential) unwilling to practice acceptable methods of birth control</criteria>
