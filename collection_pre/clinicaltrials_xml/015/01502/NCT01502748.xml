	<brief_summary>This investigation will address the safety and feasibility of distal, intra-arterial sampling through endovascular access, in acute stroke patients. Levels of Magnesium will be measured in the region of infarct in patients who had been treated with intravenous Magnesium therapy following an acute stroke. This study attempts to address whether the traditional intravenous means of neuroprotectant administration achieves adequate concentration of the therapeutic agent in the area of diseased tissue.</brief_summary>
