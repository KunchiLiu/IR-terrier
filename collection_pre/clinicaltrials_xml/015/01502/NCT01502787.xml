	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Nebivolol a) attenuates the angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced increase in oxidative stress, thereby attenuating Ang II-induced vasoconstriction; and b) attenuates sympathetic mediated vasoconstriction during exercise, thereby reducing functional skeletal muscle ischemia in hypertensive patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Nebivolol and Metoprolol With Exercise and Angiotensin II in Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 40 untreated, stage I hypertensive subjects, Investigators will measure sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography); total forearm blood flow (high-resolution ultrasonography); skeletal muscle oxygenation (Near Infrared spectroscopy); plasma F2-isoprostanes; cardiac output (non-invasive impedance plethysmography); and blood pressure at baseline and after a) rhythmic handgrip exercise at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction alone for 3 minutes, b) rhythmic handgrip at the same intensity of exercise plus lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to activate sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) for 2 minutes, and c) during intravenous infusion of Angiotensin II at the dose of 1, 2, and 3 ng/kg/min for 15 minutes at each dose. Each subject will then be randomized to receive 12 weeks of Nebivolol (Bystolic, 5-20 mg/day) or Metoprolol Succinate (Toprol XL, 100-300 mg/day), using a randomized crossover design. There will be a 2-week washout period between the two treatment periods. During drug treatment, blood pressure will be monitored every 4 weeks and the doses of Nebivolol and Metoprolol will be titrated to keep BP &lt;140/90 mmHg. SNA, total forearm blood flow, skeletal muscle blood flow, muscle oxygenation, cardiac output, and blood pressure responses to Nebivolol will be compared to responses during Metoprolol in the same subjects.</detailed_description>
