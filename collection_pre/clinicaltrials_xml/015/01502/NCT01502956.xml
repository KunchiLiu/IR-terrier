	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized, open-label, active-control trial is to compare the effectiveness of intra-detrusor botulinum toxin A (Botox A®, Allergan) versus sacral neuromodulation (InterStim®, Medtronic) for the treatment of refractory urge urinary incontinence. In addition, the study will evaluate select technical attributes of the interventions as well as the effect of these two interventions on other lower urinary tract and pelvic floor symptoms. Hypothesis: InterStim® therapy will result in a greater reduction in daily urge urinary incontinence episodes over the 6-month follow-up period as compared to Botox A® injection. A supplemental study investigates whether biological markers including those related to inflammation and connective tissue remodeling change following treatments with Botox A® and Interstim®.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation v. BoTulinum Toxin Assessment (ROSETTA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim: To compare the change from baseline in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes (UUIE) over 6 the six month follow-up period in women randomized to sacral neuromodulation (InterStim®) therapy, versus those randomized to intra-detrusor injection with 200 units of botulinum toxin A (Botox A®). Secondary Aims: - Long Term Efficacy: To compare the long-term (12 and 24 month) efficacy outcomes in women randomized to sacral neuromodulation(InterStim®) therapy, versus those randomized to intra-detrusor injection with 200 units of botulinum toxin A (Botox A®). Secondary efficacy outcomes, collected at 12 and 24 months as well as 6 months,include adequate control of their urge urinary incontinence, change in bothersome symptoms of urinary urge incontinence (UUI), severity of urge incontinence, urinary frequency, nocturia, subject satisfaction with therapy, quality of life measures and bowel and sexual function. - Cost Effectiveness: To compare utilization of medical resources for cost effectiveness analysis and cost-utility between treatment groups. - Treatment Safety and Burden: To assess safety profile and treatment burden of both interventions by comparing adverse event incidence between treatment arms, and also by obtaining estimates of incidence of treatment-specific safety and burden outcomes. Safety and burden outcomes for Botox A® injections include receipt of additional injections and intermittent catheterization due to voiding dysfunction/partial urinary retention. Safety and burden outcomes for InterStim® device include infection, pain, lead migration, reprogramming (and reasons for) and surgical revision (and reasons for).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Nonpregnant adult female at least 21 years old, with no plans to become pregnant during the course of the trial) and if of childbearing potential, with a negative pregnancy test, and if sexually active, must be using medically acceptable contraception. 6 urge urinary incontinence episodes on a 3day baseline bladder diary, with these urge incontinence episodes representing greater than 50% of the total incontinent episodes recorded. Willing and able to complete all study related items and interviews. Refractory urinary urge urinary incontinence: defined as (1) Persistent symptoms despite at least one or more conservative treatments (e.g. supervised behavioral therapy, supervised physical therapy); and (2)Persistent symptoms despite the use of a minimum of two anticholinergics, or unable to tolerate medication due to side effects, or has a contraindication to taking anticholinergic medication. Currently not on an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic medication (e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine, and/or fesoterodine) or be willing to stop medication for 3 weeks prior to completing baseline bladder diary and expected to remain off medications through duration of study. Demonstrates ability (or have caregiver demonstrate ability) to perform clean intermittent selfcatheterization. Grossly neurologically normal on exam and no gross systemic neurologic conditions believed to affect urinary function. Urodynamic assessment within the previous 18 months prior to enrollment or done after enrollment, prior to randomization. Neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson Disease, CVA within 6 months prior to enrollment, myasthenia gravis, CharcotMarieTooth disease, clinically significant peripheral neuropathy, and complete spinal cord injury. Untreated urinary tract infection (UTI). Any prior use of either study therapy for treatment of urinary urge incontinence (Botox A® or Interstim®). Current participation in any other conflicting interventional research study. PVR &gt;150 ml on 2 occasions within 6 months prior to enrollment (If the PVR value was obtained by ultrasound and was ≥150 ml, the PVR will be confirmed by catheterization which will be the gold standard) Subjects with knowledge of planned MRIs or diathermy, except those allowable per Medtronic guidelines. Current or prior bladder malignancy. Surgically altered detrusor muscle, such as augmentation cystoplasty. Subjects taking aminoglycosides. Currently pregnant or lactating. Subjects who are on ambulatory anticoagulant therapy, including aspirin, who are unable to discontinue treatment for 24 hours prior to bladder injection and staged InterStim® procedure. Serum creatinine level greater than twice the upper limit of normal within the previous year prior to enrollment. Surgical treatment for stress incontinence (sling, Burch or urethral injection) or pelvic organ prolapse recommended or planned at enrollment by study investigator(s). Prior stress incontinence or prolapsed surgery within the last 6 months prior to enrollment. Allergy to lidocaine or bupivacaine. Prior pelvic radiation. Uninvestigated hematuria. Greater than or equal to Stage III vaginal prolapse. Known allergy to Botox A®. Use of a vaginal pessary.</criteria>
