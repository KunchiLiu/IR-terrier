	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the dose-related efficacy, by evaluating morning (AM) lung function at the end of the dosing interval (AM pre-dose percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]) across 12 weeks of treatment, of three doses (50 mcg, 100 mcg, and 200 mcg) of Mometasone Furoate (MF) Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) twice a day (BID) compared with Placebo in children 5 to 11 years of age, inclusive, with persistent asthma. The primary hypothesis of this study is that at least one dose of MF MDI BID increases lung function, defined as a significant increase in percent predicted FEV1, when compared to Placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of asthma of at least 6 months duration. Using an Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), either alone or in combination with a longacting beta2 agonist (LABA), for at least 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit and must have been on a stable asthma regimen for at least 2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit, must not have used oral glucocorticosteroids within 30 days of the Screening Visit. Treated in the emergency room for a severe asthma exacerbation requiring systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment, or hospitalization for management of airway obstruction within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit. History of ventilator support for respiratory failure secondary to asthma. Upper or lower respiratory tract infection (viral or bacterial) within the 2 weeks prior to Screening and Baseline Visits. History of clinically significant renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic, hematologic, ophthalmologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or other significant medical illness or disorder which, in the judgment of the investigator, could interfere with the study or require treatment that might interfere with the study. Specific examples include but are not limited to insulindependent diabetes, hypertension, active hepatitis, cardiovascular disease including hypertension, or conditions that may interfere with respiratory function such as, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. Other conditions that are well controlled and stable will not prohibit participation if deemed appropriate per the investigator's judgment. Inability to correctly use an oral MDI or a DPI. Participation in this study at another investigational site. Participation in a different investigational study at any site during the same time frame of this study. Randomization into this study more than once. Direct association with either the administration of the this study or the study staff.</criteria>
