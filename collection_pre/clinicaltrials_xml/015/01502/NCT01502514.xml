	<brief_summary>The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1. Is the proposed treatment safe 2. Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with Heart Disease as assessed by a series of measurements indicating improvement, stability, or degradation of a patient's cardiovascular function and exercise capacity?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Adipose Derived Stem Cells for Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center patient-sponsored study designed to assess the safety and cardiovascular effects of Adipose-derived Stem Cell (ASC) implantation using a catheter delivery system in patients who have experienced myocardial infarction. A percutaneous transluminal endomyocardial injection catheter will be used for delivery of ASCs. The therapy is composed of cells isolated from a patient's own adipose tissue. Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells.</detailed_description>
