	<brief_title>Desensitization Protocol for Highly Sensitized Patients on the Waiting List for Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HLA sensitization is known to be the most important barrier to deceased donor kidney allocation. Therefore, the investigators need to develop better strategies for managing pre-sensitized patients using desensitization protocol. In this study the investigators will used two kinds of medication for the reduction of circulating antibodies (high dose IVIg, B cell depleting agents) to highly-sensitized patients who are on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney transplantation. After desensitization, the investigators will check that this treatment can increase their chances of receiving a kidney transplant.</detailed_description>
