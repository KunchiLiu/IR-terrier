Patients with the intent to undergo back surgery will be excluded. Patients with a history of recent or ongoing alcohol or other drug addiction disorders will be excluded. Patients with any history of substance abuse of opioids will be excluded. Patients whose diagnosis cannot be firmly established according to criteria described above would not be included. Patients whose medical and psychiatric comorbidities are not well controlled, or who are currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of the medical comorbidity, will be excluded.
