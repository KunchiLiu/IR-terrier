	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of intratumoral plasmid interleukin-12 DNA injection (pIL-12) with electroporation (EP) in malignant melanoma. Intratumoral pIL-12 EP is a gene therapy approach to directly induce a pro-inflammatory response within a tumor to initiate and/or enhance anti-tumor immunity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of pIL-12 Electroporation Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL will be injected intratumorally at a dose volume of ¼ of the calculated lesion volume and a dose volume per lesion of 0.1 mL for lesions of volume &lt; 0.4 cm3. Six pulses at field strengths of (E+) of 1500 V/cm and pulse width of 100 μs at 1-second intervals will be administered using the OMS to each previously injected tumor. Two treatment regimens will be explored: Regimen A: Treatment on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 6 weeks Regimen B: Treatment on Days 1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks. Lesions will be treated on either Regimen A or Regimen B. Subsequent cycles may be given at 6-week intervals, for up to 9 treatment cycles in total.</detailed_description>
