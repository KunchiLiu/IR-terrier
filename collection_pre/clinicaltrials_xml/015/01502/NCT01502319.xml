	<brief_summary>The Consortium's overall mission can be summarized as follows; each function is developed with the goal of clear military relevance: 1. Produce new scientific knowledge about suicidal behavior in the military that improves mental health outcomes for the investigators men and women in uniform. 2. Use high quality research methods and analyses to address problems in policy and practice that have a direct impact on suicide-related and other mental health outcomes for military personnel. 3. Disseminate Consortium knowledge, information, and findings through a variety of methods appropriate for decision makers, practitioners, and others who are accountable for ensuring the mental health of military personnel. This includes the rapid response function so that queries from decision makers and others to the Consortium are answered with speed and efficiency. Technical assistance and support for decision makers and others is an integral aspect of this Consortium function. This aspect of the Consortium will warehouse knowledge about suicidal behavior in general (e.g., from civilian and international sources as well as from military sources), so that military issues can be informed in a comprehensive manner. 4. Train future leaders in military suicide research through experience within a multi-disciplinary setting for Ph.D. students and postdoctoral scholars interested in research questions on military suicide of both a basic and applied nature.</brief_summary>
