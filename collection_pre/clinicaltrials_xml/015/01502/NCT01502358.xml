	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new investigational dengue vaccine is safe, well-tolerated, and to see if an immune response against dengue disease will be generated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Safety and the Ability of a DNA Vaccine to Protect Against Dengue Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arguably the need for a tetravalent dengue vaccine that will effectively induce immunity against all four dengue serotypes has never been greater. Currently, several different approaches are being taken to develop a protective tetravalent dengue vaccine. These include live-attenuated vaccines derived by serial passage in tissue culture, live chimeric vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines and DNA vaccines. While live attenuated and live chimeric vaccines have shown promise in clinical trials, viral competition with suspected immune interference resulting in imbalanced immune responses and reactogenicity with the occurrence of dengue like symptoms remains a concern. It is imperative that any candidate vaccine produce solid immunity against each of the four dengue virus serotypes. Failure to do so may place the recipient of the vaccine at risk for developing severe dengue disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome) following exposure to the virus serotype to which there was incomplete protective immunity, resulting in antibody dependent enhancement due to the presence of non-neutralizing anti-dengue antibodies.</detailed_description>
