	<brief_summary>This study involves conducting formative research to develop a culturally appropriate secondary prevention intervention for HIV-positive Black young men who have sex with men (B-YMSM). The intervention draws upon the principles of Critical Consciousness Theory (CCT). The formative research includes reviewing data and findings from relevant ATN protocols (i.e., 070, 068, and 073) and existing health promotion interventions targeting young men of color (i.e., the Young Warriors program, Hermanos de Luna y Sol [HLS]) and conducting focus groups with up to 32 HIV- positive B-YMSM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intervention for HIV-Positive Black Young Men Who Have Sex With Men (YMSM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Focus groups will be conducted at two Adolescent Medicine Trials Unit (AMTU) sites and will guide the selection of the intervention content areas and the development of the intervention manual. The intervention aims to increase participation in health promoting behaviors and improve self-worth and self-concept among HIV-positive B-YMSM. Specifically, the intervention aims to address the following health promoting behaviors: 1) increasing engagement in HIV treatment; 2) improving medication adherence; 3) reducing sexual risk behaviors; 4) reducing substance use behaviors; and 5) increasing HIV status disclosure. Based on reviews of ATN 070 data and existing related interventions (ATN 068, ATN 073, Young Warriors, HLS), draft components of the intervention curriculum for B-YMSM will be developed. Four focus groups will then be convened (two per AMTU) with HIV-positive B-YMSM to a) obtain input on the draft intervention curriculum, b) refine intervention components, and c) examine psychosocial factors that may mediate or moderate the intervention effect. The focus groups will be implemented using a "Rapid Approach" which allows for a focus on key areas of inquiry by asking fewer questions and focusing on targeted responses of focus group participants. All focus groups will be digitally recorded and transcribed. The transcripts will be reviewed and data analyzed using a phenomenological approach; protocol team members and members of two Youth Advisory Boards (YABs), which will include youth who are existing members of ATN site CABs as well as youth recruited from other local agencies and organizations), will work on the analysis of the data.</detailed_description>
