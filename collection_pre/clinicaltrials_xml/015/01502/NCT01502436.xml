	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between attempted and/or completed suicide and reported experience of chronic pain among an adult veteran population. Specific aims include a) examining the experience of chronic pain between patients who have either attempted and/or completed suicide, non-suicide attempt mental health patients, and non-mental health chronic pain patients and b) determining possible differences in reported experiences of chronic pain based on mental and physical diagnoses, age, gender, ethnicity, occupation, and patient's recorded perceptions of depression and/or quality of life. As articulated in the Amendment approved on June 13, 2008, additional areas of interest include histories of neurological disease (e.g. traumatic brain injury) and/or mental health diagnoses. History of both neurologic disease and mental health diagnoses will also be identified by chart review (per approval obtained June 13, 2008). As such this study will also compare differences (e.g., mental health, neurological disease) between veterans who have history of a suicide attempt, completion, or a lifetime history of suicidality and matched control veterans without a history of suicide attempts, completions, or lifetime history of suicide. The relationship between suicidal behavior, attempted/completed suicide, and reported Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms among an adult veteran population is also of interest. Additionally, this data set will be used to complete a validation study regarding the Self-Directed Violence Classification System (SDVCS). Specifically, relevant information in subject chart notes regarding self-directed violence (SDV) will be used to categorize thoughts and behaviors according to the SDVCS.</brief_summary>
