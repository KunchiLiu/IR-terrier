	<brief_summary>PREFER II aims at developing psychological targeted theory- and evidence-based intervention components, which support older people with multiple illnesses in performing more physical activity. Many studies provide evidence for the importance of physical activity as a central mediator of health. This means that determinants of physical activity such as personal resources constitute an ideal target for interventions. Within PREFER II, particularly positive views on ageing, attitudes, self-efficacy, planning and self-monitoring will be targeted in the interventions. These factors are important both for motivating older people with multiple illnesses to change their health behaviors and to translate such motivation into behavior.</brief_summary>
