	<brief_summary>A study measuring utility of indwelling bladder catheter placement in orthopaedic surgical patients receiving spinal anesthesia.

Absence of indwelling bladder catheter may decrease urinary tract infection (UTI) incidence, increase patient satisfaction, and decrease cost burden without increasing postoperative urinary retention (POUR) incidence.</brief_summary>
