	<brief_title>Study to Compare the Bioavailability of Dutasteride Novel Formulation Form to the Soft Gel Capsule Form in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the bioavailability of 0.5mg dutasteride in a novel formulation compared to the currently marketed 0.5mg dutasteride soft gel capsule in fasted healthy male subjects. This will be an open-label, single dose, randomized, two-period crossover study in healthy male subjects. Subjects will receive a single oral dose 0.5mg novel dutasteride formulation and a single oral dose 0.5mg dutasteride soft gel capsule in a fasted state. Each dose of the study medication will be separated by a 28-day washout period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, laboratory data, and review of adverse events. The study will enrol approximately 35 healthy male subjects to ensure that 30 subjects complete the study. The study will be conducted in the USA.</detailed_description>
