	<brief_title>Treatment of Social Phobia With Cognitive Bias Modification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have shown that individuals with social phobia have attention biases, often focusing on aversive stimuli or avoiding aversive stimuli. Computerized training programs have been developed to implicitly direct the users attention towards a neutral, non-threatening stimuli. In this study, such a program will be provided to 128 participants that meet the diagnostic criteria for social phobia. It will be compared with a program that implicitly directs the users' attention towards threatening cues. Pre/post-measurements will be compared. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups, receiving one of the two variants of the cognitive bias modification program or a control training.</detailed_description>
