	<brief_title>Postprandial Lipid Metabolism in Familial Hypercholesterolaemia:Effects of Fish Oils</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of statin therapy in familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is known to reduce cardiovascular risk and is a first line recommendation, however, there is considerable residual risk predicted by the presence of fasting and post-prandial hypertriglyceridaemia. This study will examine the effect of oral n-3 fatty acid ethyl esters supplementation (4g/day, Omacor) on postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia and post-prandial arterial function when administrated to FH patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to their residual fasting hypertriglyceridaemia.</detailed_description>
