	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to identify and characterize subpopulations of cells with invasive capacity in colorectal cancer from primary tumor, blood and metastatic samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Invasiveness and Chemoresistance of Cancer Stem Cells in Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives include: - Determine the intrinsic properties essential for the dissemination and chemoresistance of these cells capable of initiating tumors - Identify a "molecular signature" for potential invasiveness and chemoresistance of cells initiating metastases. - Describe the evolution of patients during 24 months of follow up and correlations with observed cellular profiles. - Enrich the tumor bank of the institution.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must have given his/her informed and signed consent The patient must be insured or beneficiary of a health insurance plan Patient with adenocarcinomatype colorectal cancer: stage III at diagnosis, surgical resection of the primary tumor proposed. stage IV at diagnosis, surgical resection of the primary tumor and possibly of metastases proposed. Stage IV who have already undergone surgical excision of the primary tumor, and for whom metastasectomy is now proposed. The patient is participating in another study The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study The patient is under judicial protection, under tutorship or curatorship The patient refuses to sign the consent It is impossible to correctly inform the patient Patients for whom surgical resection of the primary tumor is not considered as an option PStage IV at diagnosis, but metastasectomy is not considered as an option Patients with positive HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C serology</criteria>
