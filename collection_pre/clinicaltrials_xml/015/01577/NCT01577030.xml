	<brief_summary>Elevated systolic blood pressure is by far the largest single contributor to cardiovascular risks in middle-aged and older adults. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary modifications, are the first line approach for treating and preventing hypertension. The general aim of the proposed study is to address the efficacy of conventional dairy products as part of the normal routine diet for lowing arterial blood pressure in middle-aged and older adults with elevated blood pressure. The investigators hypothesize that the dietary intervention including dairy products will induce significant decreases in arterial blood pressure in this population. A secondary aim will be to test the hypothesis that these reductions in systolic blood pressure will be associated with increases in arterial stiffness/compliance and endothelial vasodilatory function.</brief_summary>
