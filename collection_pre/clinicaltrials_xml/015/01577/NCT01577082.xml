	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show the superiority of CHF 1535 (BDP/FF) pMDI over BDP HFA pMDI in terms of lung function considering change from baseline to the entire treatment period in average pre-dose morning PEF in adult asthmatic patients not adequately controlled on high doses of ICS or on medium dose of ICS+LABA.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main Male or female patients aged &gt; 18 years. Patients with persistent asthma not optimally controlled (GINA 2010) on high doses of ICS or medium dose of ICS+LABA at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Patients with FEV1 &gt;= 40% and &lt; 80% of predicted for the patient normal value and at least 0.9 L. Patients with a documented positive response to the reversibility test, defined as ΔFEV1 &gt;= 12% and &gt;= 200 mL over baseline, within 30 minutes after administration of 400 μg of salbutamol pMDI. At screening and at the end of the runin period, patients with not adequately controlled asthma according to GINA 2010 and with score at the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)&gt; 0.75 Main History of near fatal asthma or of a past hospitalisation for asthma in Intensive Care Unit or of frequent exacerbations (3 or more asthma exacerbations/ year). Hospitalisation, Emergency Room admission or use of systemic steroids (more than 3 days) for asthma exacerbation in the 4 weeks prior to screening visit and during the runin period. Symptomatic infection of the lower airways in the 4 weeks before the screening visit. Current or exsmokers with total cumulative exposure equal or more than 5 packyears and /or having stopped smoking one year or less prior to screening visit. Patients with a clinically significant abnormality at 12lead ECG or presenting a QTcB interval value in ECG &gt; 450 msec in males or &gt; 470 msec in females).</criteria>
