	<brief_summary>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (respiratory hypersensitivity), airway inflammation, and intermittent airway obstruction. One of the characteristics of the disease is an inflammatory reaction of the immune system caused by cytokine production. A substantial number of asthma patients do not satisfactorily respond to steroid therapy and consequently have an unmet medical need for novel targeted therapies with improved specificity, tolerability, and compliance. Novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by targeting early disease-causing mechanisms are a promising approach for the treatment of asthma. The transcription factor GATA-3 plays a key role in mediating the asthmatic immune response and has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the production of cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The active drug substance of the investigational medicinal product SB010 is hgd40. SB010 belongs to a new class of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, the 10-23 DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)zymes (antisense oligonucleotide). DNAzymes are catalytically active nucleic acids that cleave complementary RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. By cleaving GATA-3 mRNA, hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production and thereby reduces key features of allergic airway inflammation. DNAzymes are generated completely by chemical synthesis and can be produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) controlled conditions. The DNAzymes are not biological drugs, i.e. they are not generated by use of any living organism including cell culture or bacteria. The molecules are highly water-soluble and will be applied as solution directly in their synthesized form. The current study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing single doses of inhaled SB010 in male patients with asthma who have airway hyperresponsiveness(demonstrated by methacholine bronchial challenge test).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult male Caucasian patients aged 1845 years (both included). Clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate, stable, persistent or intermittent asthma (according to GINA guidelines revised version 2010) for at least 6 months prior to screening. Positive skin reactivity at screening or within the last 12 months to at least one allergen out of a variety of seasonal or nonseasonal specific allergens (e.g. pollen, animal epithelia, dust mite). Patients not on concomitant treatments, except for shortacting betaagonists and inhaled and topical corticosteroids on a stable dose, or able to change current asthma therapy, to discontinue prescribed anticholinergics, leukotriene receptor inhibitors, and longacting beta 2agonists after signature of informed consent as per required washout periods. Screening forced expiratory volume (FEV1) value of &gt;60% of the predicted normal value after a washout of at least 8 hours for shortacting beta 2agonists, and 72 hours for longacting beta 2agonists, whatever is applicable. Predicted normal values to be used for calculation purposes are to be based on European Community for Steel and Coal predicted values. Patients must demonstrate a PC 20 response to methacholine concentrations of ≤4 mg/mL at screening. (PC 20 = Concentration of the agonist in the inhaled substance leading to a fall in FEV1 of 20%). Predose FEV1 value not below 20% of the reference absolute FEV1 value measured at screening [i.e. 0.8 x FEV1 (screening) ≥FEV1 predose]. Patient has been informed both verbally and in writing about the objectives of the clinical trial, the methods, the anticipated benefits and potential risks and the discomfort to which he may be exposed, and has given written consent to participation in the trial prior to trial start and any trialrelated procedure. Except for asthma or atopic diseases like allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis assessed as healthy based on a screening examination including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG assessment, pulmonary function testing, and clinical laboratory results. Body weight according to a Body Mass Index ≥18.0 and ≤29.0 kg/m², and a body weight ≥60 and ≤90 kg. Nonsmokers or exsmokers who had stopped smoking for at least 5 years prior to start of the clinical study. No history of smoking more than 10 packyears. Ability to inhale in an appropriate manner (patients will be trained to inhale from the AKITA2 APIXNEB® device with a placebo medication at the screening visit). The patient must agree: to use two methods of contraception in combination with his female partner, if she is of childbearing potential; this combination of contraceptive methods must be used from screening until at least 6 months after the last dose of Investigational Medicinal Product. At least one of the contraception methods must be a barrier contraception method. Contraceptive methods allowed include the following: condoms, diaphragm in combination with a spermicide, intrauterine device as well as for female partners oral contraception, contraception implants, OR not to be sexually active at screening and accept using doublebarrier contraception should he become sexually active during or within 6 months after the last dose of Investigational Medicinal Product, OR to have been surgically sterilized prior to screening and accept to use a barrier method of contraception as well, OR to have a partner who is postmenopausal and has had her last natural menstruation at least 24 months prior to screening, OR to have a partner who has had a hysterectomy prior to screening, OR to have a partner who has been surgically sterilized prior to screening Presence of clinically significant diseases other than asthma or atopic diseases (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological, genitourinary, autoimmune, endocrine, metabolic, etc), which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the trial, or diseases which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to take part in it.
