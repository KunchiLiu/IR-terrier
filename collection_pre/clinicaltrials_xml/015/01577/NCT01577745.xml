	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of MEDI0639 in Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a first-time-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation (3+3) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, PK, and immunogenicity of MEDI0639 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exist. Up to 63 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 3 to 5 study centers in North America.</detailed_description>

Adequate organ and marrow function: Hemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelet Count ≥ 100,000/mm3 AST &amp; ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Cr Cl ≥ 50 mL/min (as determined by the CockcroftGault equation or by 24hour urine collection) Prior therapy against VEGF or VEGFRs including, but not limited to bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, motesanib (AMG706), or cediranib (AZD2171), is permitted so long as the agent does not have any known activity against DLL4 and the last dose received s at least 6 weeks prior to first dose of MEDI0639. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks Females of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile, have a sterile male partner, be premenarchal or at least 2 years postmenopausal, practice abstinence or otherwise must use 2 effective methods of contraception from the time of initiation of investigational product. Males, unless surgically sterile, must use 2 effective methods of contraception with a female partner and must agree to continue using such contraception for 90 days after the last dose of MEDI0639 Concurrent enrollment in another investigational clinical study Receipt of any investigational anticancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of MEDI0639 or in the case of monoclonal antibodies, 6 weeks prior to the first dose of MEDI0639 Concurrent or previous treatment with inhibitors of DLL4 Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment Known bleeding diathesis, esophageal varices, or angioplasty Pulmonary hemorrhage or gross hemoptysis within 12 months Known arterial or venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 2 years Concurrent use of systemic low molecular weight heparin or low dose warfarin Presence of brain metastases Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within 2 years Cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, unstable/severe angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, congestive heart failure (NYHA &gt; class II), within 2 years Tumors with squamous cell histology Major surgical procedure within 90 days Pregnancy or lactation Known HIV positive or Hepatitis A, B, or C infection</criteria>
