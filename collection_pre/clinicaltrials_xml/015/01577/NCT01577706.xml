	<brief_summary>An advanced technique for rapid magnetic resonance proton spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) will be employed in a drug challenge study in healthy volunteers to spatially map and measure acute changes in the brain chemicals GABA, glutamate and glutamine after administration of a drug. Three condition will be tested in a double-blind fashion, i)depressant, ii)stimulant, iii)placebo. It is hypothesized that unique and reproducible spatial and directional metabolic response patterns will be observed, unique to each condition within the brain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) is a powerful tool for assessing neurochemistry non-invasively in vivo. However, the primary shortcoming in most studies is the lack of spatial coverage afforded by the typical single-voxel design. Limits on participant tolerance and financial resources restrict single-voxel studies to an examination of one or two carefully chosen voxels per scan, thus inadequately addressing the question of focal vs. global pathophysiology. A secondary shortcoming is that most studies report on either GABA or glutamate-glutamine (Glu-Gln) due to the technically demanding spectral-editing techniques that must be implemented in order to resolve and quantify those metabolites with any accuracy. 1H MRS imaging (MRSI) can partially overcome these limitations by providing a global picture of brain chemistry rather than just the focal snapshot afforded by the single-voxel design. However, the scan time necessary for collecting enough data for adequate spatial resolution and signal-to-noise, particularly if also using specialized spectral-editing techniques, is still too lengthy. We recently developed a method that combines Spectroscopic Imaging with the MEGAPRESS-based difference-editing acquisition for optimal GABA detection as well as for optimal detection of Glu and Gln. This MEGACSI sequence will permit us to obtain the maximum amount of neurochemical information in a clinically sound scan time, while using the current state-of-the-art MRS editing methods for optimal detection of GABA, Glu, and Gln.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants will be male volunteers between the ages of 2145 Nonsmoking participants are preferred, but will admit those who smoke less than 5 cigarettes per day Participants must be able to read screening materials including consent form and give informed consent Participants cannot meet DSMIV criteria for lifetime and/or current mood, anxiety, psychotic, and alcohol/drug use disorders as identified by the SCID Participants cannot be taking any prescription medication (except oral contraceptives, certain shortterm antifungal agents, and some topical creams for dermal conditions) or nutritional supplements Participants cannot be taking any psychotropic medications Participants cannot have a history of major head trauma resulting in cognitive impairment, seizure, or other neurological disorders. Participants cannot have any conditions that are contraindicated for MRI Participants cannot have a family history of alcoholism Participants cannot have any abnormal blood chemistries/urinalysis results or any other medical condition that may affect drug disposition (e.g., Hepatitis C) Participants cannot have current or past cardiac problems, and they also cannot have a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia Participants who, in the investigators' judgment, will not likely be able to comply with the study protocol. Participants cannot have any clinically significant findings in the structural anatomic brain scans (per the MRI report read by a boardcertified radiologist).</criteria>
