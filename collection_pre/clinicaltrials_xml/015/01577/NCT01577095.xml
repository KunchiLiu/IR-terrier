	<brief_summary>Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of rosiglitazone (TZD) and electroacupuncture (EA) combined therapy on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A randomized single-blind placebo controlled clinical trial was used. Methods: A total of 31 newly diagnostic type 2 diabetic patients, who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were recruited and received various allocated interventions. They were randomly assigned into two groups, the control group (TZD, N=15) and the experimental group (TZD + EA, N=16). Changes in their plasma free fatty acid (FFA), glucose and insulin levels together with their homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) indices were statistically assessed between before and after treatment. Hypoglycemic activity (%) was also compared between these two groups. Expecting Results: This study will compare the hypoglycemic activity and the ability of improving insulin resistance between the TZD and TZD+EA group. Also, the lowering effect of the plasma FFA concentration will be investigated.</brief_summary>
