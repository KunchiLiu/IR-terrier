	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic effects of concomitant ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) on paclitaxel by investigating the pharmacokinetics (PK) of each in participants with advanced malignant solid tumors. Part A of this study will investigate the potential of concomitant ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) to affect the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. Part B of this study will investigate the pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) as monotherapy.</brief_summary>
