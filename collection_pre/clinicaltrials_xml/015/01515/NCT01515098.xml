	<brief_summary>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of blueberry consumption on cognitive decline and body composition in humans. Hypothesis 1: Adults with mild cognitive decline who consume blueberries will experience an improvement in cognitive abilities as measured by a standardized battery of tests, relative to those who consume a placebo. Hypothesis 2: Adults with mild cognitive decline who consume blueberries will evidence an increase in processing speed and an improvement in memory abilities as measured in an electrophysiological paradigm and compared to those who consume a placebo. Hypothesis 3: Daily intake of 35 g freeze-dried blueberries will improve body composition (fat mass vs. lean mass). Hypothesis 4: Daily intake of 35 g freeze-dried blueberries will decrease oxidative stress and inflammatory markers.</brief_summary>
