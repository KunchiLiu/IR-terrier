	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether application of lower limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) after determination of brain death improves donor stability, organ quality, organ yield, and early post transplant clinical outcomes. Neurological death donors will be stratified into standard and extended criteria donors (SCD/ECD) and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to RIPC or No intervention. The primary outcome is the number of organs recovered per donor. Secondary outcomes include donor hemodynamic state, donor organ-specific function parameters, pulsatile perfusion parameters, number of organs transplanted per donor, recipient hospital free survival and delayed graft function of kidneys. The sample size is powered to detect a difference of 0.44 organs recovered.</brief_summary>
