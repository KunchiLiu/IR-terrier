	<brief_title>Length of Stay and Complications in High-risk Patients Receiving Fast-track Total Hip (THA) or Knee- Alloplasty (TKA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative risk assessment is well established and repeatedly demonstrated to be related to adverse postoperative outcomes regarding all organ functions. However, all evidence is based upon conventional care programs and none has been done on fast-track surgery, neither in total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study series is therefore to evaluate the importance of conventional risk factors in an optimised fast-track TKA and THA set-up. These studies will be performed in the Lundbeck Foundation Center for fast-track THA and TKA, based on an established database, but with additional detailed risk information to be included in studies of certain types co-morbidity. The Lundbeck Foundation Center Database prospectively registers patient characteristics and co-morbidity in all patients receiving hip and knee arthroplasty. This is done using a questionaire and with dedicated staff available to help in case of doubt regarding specific questions. Additional information is collected by scrutinizing the patients medical charts. Completeness of data has been shown to be about 95%.</detailed_description>
