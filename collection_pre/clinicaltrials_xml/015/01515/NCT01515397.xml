	<brief_summary>The aim of volume replacement is to compensate a reduction in the intravascular volume e.g. during surgery and to counteract hypovolemia in order to maintain hemodynamics and vital functions. To achieve this, different plasma substitutes are available: Albumin, dextran, hydroxyethylstarches and gelatine. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that acid-base alterations during elective abdominal surgery can be reduced by the use of a new gelatine solution.</brief_summary>
