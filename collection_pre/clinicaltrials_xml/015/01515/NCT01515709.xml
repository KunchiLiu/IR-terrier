	<brief_summary>Patients with Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD) often develop muscle problems, particularly in their legs which makes them more limited in what they can do. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a simple test of standing balance, usual walking speed and ability to stand from a chair. The SPPB may be a useful measure to predict leg function. This study aims to evaluate whether the SPPB is comparable with current exercise tests used in COPD patients, and whether it is useful in predicting disability, death and health resource usage over time.</brief_summary>
