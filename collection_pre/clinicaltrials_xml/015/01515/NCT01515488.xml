	<brief_summary>An audio-assisted self-triage kiosk in the Pediatric Emergency Department (ED) is expected to significantly reduce triage times, without any sacrifice of the quality of information that would be obtained by nurse-initiated triage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kiosk-Model Self-Triage System in the Pediatric Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the rapid evolution of consumer based information technology patients have the opportunity to become collaborative partners in their care. In addition, by bridging information gaps and improving workflow efficiency, continuity of care is optimized and the potential risk for error is reduced. Triage time for kiosk self-triage and nurse-initiated triage will be compared in terms of 1) triage time; 2) accuracy of medical history obtained; and 3) patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
