	<brief_title>Docetaxel+Oxaliplatin+S-1 (DOS) Regimen as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm will be treated for 3 cycles (1 cycle is 21 days) before surgery and treated for a year with TS-1 Patients in the adjuvant chemotherapy arm will get a surgery and treated for a year with TS-1. All patients will be followed during and after the study treatment until death or progression, whichever comes first.</detailed_description>
