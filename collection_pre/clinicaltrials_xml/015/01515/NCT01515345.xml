	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a routine individualized antiplatelet therapy after coronary stent implantation by evaluating "on-treatment" platelet reactivity with Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA, Multiplate® Analyzer).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualizing Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention - The IDEAL-PCI Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depending on the clinical presentation patients are treated according to standard operating procedures in our department. The earliest, 12 hours after an initial clopidogrel-loading dose (600mg)"on-treatment" platelet reactivity will be determined by Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA, Multiplate® Analyzer), a point of care assay. In case of high residual platelet reactivity (i.e. ≥ 50U), patients are switched according to a therapeutic algorithm to either prasugrel (Efient®), or in case of contraindication (i.e. stroke) to ticagrelor (Brilique®), or in case of contraindication (intracranial hemorrhage) reloaded with clopidogrel.</detailed_description>
