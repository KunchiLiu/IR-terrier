	<brief_summary>Despite the availability of several classes of very effective drugs available to treat heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), there remains a large unmet medical need for new, effective and well tolerated therapies. There are a number of therapies given on a chronic basis to reduce long term risk, such as statins, fibrates, niacin, omega 3 fatty acids, resins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors and antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, but subjects with heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia remain at high risk for cardiovascular events. There is still a need for acute therapies that can lead to rapid pacification of unstable plaque in order to reduce the risk of these events. This study will assess the effects of CER-001 , a recombinant human Apo-A-1 based HDL mimetic, on indices of atherosclerotic plaque progression and regression as assessed by 3Tesla MRI (3TMRI)and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) evaluations in patients with HeFH.</brief_summary>
