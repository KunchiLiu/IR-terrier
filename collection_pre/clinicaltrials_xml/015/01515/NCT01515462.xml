	<brief_title>Gene Therapy for Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the WAS gene which encodes the WAS protein (WASP), a cytoskeletal regulator which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells. We expect to treat 8 patients with genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells that were collected from bone marrow and/or mobilized from peripheral blood, and transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding for WAS. The patients are selected according to disease severity (genetic mutation, WASP expression and clinical score), absence of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling or adequate unrelated donor, age and clinical features. A conditioning regimen based on low doses of iv busulfan (non-myeloablative), Fludarabine and anti-CD20 antibody will be administered to the patients to make space in the bone marrow for gene corrected stem cells, deplete the lymphoid compartment of potentially autoreactive lymphocytes and prevent lymphoproliferative disorder. Patients with autoimmune manifestations could also receive ATG Thymoglobuline to target auto-reactive memory T lymphocytes. This reduced intensity conditioning schedule will provide less toxicity than current preparatory regimens, used in standard allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation. The treated patients will be followed for 3 years and thereafter monitored for efficacy and safety for additional 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of WAS defined by genetic mutation and at least one of the following criteria: Severe WAS mutation Absence of WASP expression Severe clinical score (Zhu clinical score â‰¥ 3 2. No HLAidentical sibling donor 3. Negative search for a matched unrelated donor (10/10) or an adequate unrelated cord blood donor (56/6) within 46 months Patients of &gt; 5 years of age who are not candidate to unrelated allogeneic transplant based on clinical conditions. 4. Parental/guardian/patient signed informed consent. 1. Patients positive for HIVinfection. 2. Patients affected by neoplasia. 3. Patients with cytogenetic alterations typical of MDS/AML. 4. Patients with endorgan functions or any other severe disease which, in the judgement of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. 5. Patients who underwent an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the previous 6 months. 6. Patients who underwent an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with evidence of residual cells of donor origin.</criteria>
