	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of coronary stenting with the Cilotax stent compared to the Xience Prime stent in the treatment of diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Cilotax Stent and Everolimus -Eluting Stent With Diabetes Mellitus (ESSENCE-DM III)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized multi-center trial of 300 patients will be enrolled at 7 centers in Korea. Following angiography, diabetic patients with significant diameter stenosis &gt;50% by visual estimation have documented myocardial ischemia or symptoms of angina, and eligible for stenting without any exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to: a) Cilotax stent vs. b) Xience Prime stent. All patients will be followed for at least 1 year. Angiographic follow-up at 9-months is routinely recommended.</detailed_description>
