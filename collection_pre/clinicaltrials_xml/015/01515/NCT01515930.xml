	<brief_title>Computerized Intervention of Parental Involvement in Diabetes Care of Their Child</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study includes a development phase (Phase 1: development of the intervention followed by feasibility testing with 10 youth and 10 parents) and a pilot validation phase [Phase 2: pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT)] using a sample of 90 African American youth transitioning to independent diabetes care and their parents. In this phase, families will be randomly assigned to one of three study arms: parent motivation for monitoring and youth motivation for diabetes care (arm 1), parent motivation for monitoring and youth information (arm 2) or parent and youth information (arm 3). In phase 1 (development), youth and their caregivers will complete a one-time research visit where they use the program and provide feedback via a semi-structured interview regarding the usefulness of the content, its user-friendliness and make suggestions for changes to enhance acceptability. In phase 2 ( RCT), families will complete three intervention plus data collection visits and one additional data collection only visit. Research visits will be scheduled to coincide with appointments in the diabetes clinic to maximize convenience for families.</detailed_description>
