	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a clinical syndrome characterized by repetitive closure of the airway and frequent awakenings during sleep. Repeated episodes of hypoxia, decrease in intrathoracic pressure, increased venous return and venous stasis, damage to vascular wall may ensue. An increased tendency for coagulation has also been reported in OSA. Venous stasis, vascular endothelial activation and hypercoagulability are also known risk factors for thromboembolism. All of these pathophysiologic changes in OSA may predispose patients for the development of pulmonary embolism (PE) however there is limited data about role of thromboembolic events in OSA.</brief_summary>
