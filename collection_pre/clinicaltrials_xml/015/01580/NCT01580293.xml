	<brief_summary>Haemophilia A is an inherited disorder in which one of the proteins, Factor VIII, needed to form blood clots is missing or not present in sufficient levels. In a person with haemophilia A, the clotting process is slowed and the person experiences bleeds that can result in serious problems and potential disability. The current standard treatment for severe haemophilia A is regularly scheduled infusion of FVIII to keep levels high enough to prevent bleeding. Due to the short half-life of FVIII, prophylaxis may require treatment as often as every other day. In this trial safety and efficacy of a long-acting recombinant factor VIII molecule is evaluated in subjects with severe Hemophilia A. 120-140 patients will receive open label treatment with long-acting rFVIII either on-demand to treat bleeds or prophylactically for 36 weeks in the main trial plus an optional extension to continue treatment for at least 100 total exposure days (ED). Patients on prophylactic treatment will receive study drug at dosing intervals between once and twice a week depending on their observed bleeding. Patients will attend the treatment centre for routine blood samples and be required to keep an electronic diary. Male patients aged 12-65, with severe hemophilia A, previously treated with FVIII for at least 50 exposure days may be eligible for this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Investigating Safety and Efficacy of Treatment With BAY94-9027 in Severe Hemophilia A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects in prophylactic treatment arms will undergo clinical evaluation at 10 weeks. Those with adequate control of bleeding will undergo randomization to every 5 or 7 day infusion. Those with continued bleeding will remain in treatment arm and have an increase in dose. Part B-major surgery - optional sub study included to collect information on efficacy of BAY94-9027 in major surgical setting. Due to rarity of surgery in this population, enrollment to this sub-study may be independent of participation in main study.</detailed_description>
