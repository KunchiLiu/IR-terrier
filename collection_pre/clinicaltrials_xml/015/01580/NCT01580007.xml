	<brief_summary>Vitamin D exerts its effects via the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) present in activated macrophages and induces expression and release of the cathelicidin, LL-37, a human antimicrobial peptide involved in killing of MTB. We aimed to investigate whether treatment of newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients for 2 months with adjunctive PBA and vitamin D (Cholecalciferol) in combination with standard DOTS therapy (i) can improve response to standard short course TB therapy towards a rapid recovery; (ii) can induce expression of LL-37 in macrophages; (iii) can enhance killing capacity of macrophages isolated from TB patients infected in vitro with MTB; and (iv) does not evoke any adverse effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Phenylbutyrate and Vitamin D in Tuberculosis (TB)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial on clinical efficacy of phenylbutyrate and vitamin D3 therapy daily for 2 months in newly diagnosed sputum smear positive pulmonary TB patients. The clinical trial will take place in the National Institute of the Diseases of the Chest and Hospital (NIDCH) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our specific aims are: Objective 1: To determine the optimal oral dose of PBA required for induction of antimicrobial peptide in macrophages from healthy adults. Objective 2 The second aim of this study is to determine whether adjunctive sodium phenylbutyrate and vitamin D treatment (for 2 months) of newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients: 1. Can improve response to standard short course TB therapy towards a rapid recovery (clinical, radiological, mycobacterial). 2. Can induce expression of LL-37 in macrophages (immunological). 3. Can enhance killing capacity of macrophages from TB patients infected in vitro with MTB (functional measures of treatment outcome). Study Design: The study will be a randomized, double blind (Subject, Caregiver, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor), placebo control trial for 2 months. It will also be a safety and efficacy phase III study. The study will have a 4x4 factorial design with 4-cell interventions. Enrolled patients will be randomized into the following four treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: Group 1: PBA Group 2: Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) Group 3: PBA plus vitamin D3 Group 4: Placebo</detailed_description>
