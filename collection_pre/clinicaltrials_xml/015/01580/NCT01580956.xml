	<brief_summary>Variable PSV is a new ventilatory mode which delivered a pressure support "variable" from 0 to 100% variation of the set PSV level.This study aimed to compare the ventilatory behavior, sleep quality and gas exchange between VARIABLE (or Noisy)-PSV and "standard" (or fixed)-PSV during the weaning phase of critically ill patients who required mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"VARIABLE-PSV" Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patients will be enrolled. They will be ventilated withVARIABLE-PSV and STANDARD-PSV: for 24 h each in a randomized crossover order. The ventilatory parameters, ventilator/patient asynchrony, gas exchange effects, sleep quality and ventilatory comfort produced by the two ventilation modes will be compared. Before randomisation, a sequence of VARIABLE-PSV will be performed with different level of variation setting to better define the future behavior of the patient under this mode during the 24 h of Variable-PSV.</detailed_description>
