	<brief_title>Comparison of Early Versus Delay Reconstruction in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most commonly injured ligaments of the knee. This study was conducted to determine whether the outcome of treatment is superior in early surgical reconstruction compared with optional delay reconstruction.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>a. patients with confirmed anterior cruciate ligament tearing One of the following associated injuries to the index knee as visualized on MRI and/or arthroscopy: 1. An unstable longitudinal meniscus tear that requires repair and where the following postoperative treatment (i.e. bracing and limited ROM) interferes with the rehabilitation protocol 2. Bicompartmental extensive meniscus resections 3. A cartilage injury representing a full thickness loss down to bone 4. A total rupture of MCL/LCL as visualized on MRI</criteria>
