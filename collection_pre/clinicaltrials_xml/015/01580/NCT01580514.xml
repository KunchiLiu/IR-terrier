	<brief_summary>Experimental evidence suggests exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor analogue, has significant cardiovascular protective effects in various conditions. The investigators examined whether conventional use of exenatide at the time of primary percutaneous coronary intervention would reduce the infarct size in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this proof-of-concept trial, we assessed the effects of acute-phase adjunctive exenatide therapy in patients with STEMI. Infarct size after STEMI was evaluated by both cardiac magnetic resonance image and cardiac biomarkers compared with standard treatment. LV function was assessed by conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography. During 6-month follow up, the safety/tolerability of exenatide and clinical outcomes were also assessed.</detailed_description>
