	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a sizable myocardial infarction (heart attack) results in negative changes to renal structure and function (i.e. has a negative impact on the kidneys). To determine if the renal response to a myocardial infarction is a predictor of the patients future health.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Acute MI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic heart and kidney disease are increasingly common in Western society. Both conditions are associated with frequent hospitalisation and increased mortality. Furthermore, there are mechanistic reasons why one condition may beget the other; the so-called "cardiorenal syndrome". The investigators therefore wish to determine if a sizable myocardial infarction (heart attack) results in negative changes to renal structure and function (i.e. has a negative impact on the kidneys). The investigators also wish to determine if the renal response to a myocardial infarction is a predictor of the patients future health. To do this the investigators will measure markers of kidney function at the time of the heart attach, at discharge, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months and correlate this with the patients clinical condition.</detailed_description>
