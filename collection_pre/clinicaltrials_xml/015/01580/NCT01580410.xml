	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving oxaliplatin or mitomycin C directly into the abdomen after surgery works in treating patients with tumors of the appendix. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin and mitomycin C, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Heating a chemotherapy solution and infusing it directly into the abdomen may kill more tumor cells. Giving these treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery and Oxaliplatin or Mitomycin C in Treating Patients With Tumors of the Appendix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the toxicity profiles within 4 weeks of surgery of oxaliplatin and mitomycin C delivered via Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in patients with peritoneal surface malignancies from primary appendiceal tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the time to progression in patients treated with oxaliplatin vs. mitomycin C delivered via Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for surface malignancies from primary appendiceal tumors. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo surgical cytoreduction and receive mitomycin C by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Arm II: Patients undergo surgical cytoreduction and receive oxaliplatin by HIPEC. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months.</detailed_description>
