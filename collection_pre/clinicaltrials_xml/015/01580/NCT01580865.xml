	<brief_summary>Prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, trial to compare tacrolimus with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for induces complete remission in lupus nephritis patients. The study duration is one year. Research hypothesis - The proportion of patients who have achieved complete remission between regimen of tacrolimus plus prednisolone is greater than MMF plus prednisolone as an induction therapy in lupus nephritis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients with a pathological diagnosis of active lupus nephritis whom are currently followed up or referred to outpatient department (OPD) of 7 participating medical centers in Thailand. Patients who come to attend will be selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Outcome measurements - The patients will be follow-up for 1 year and will be evaluated for clinical manifestations and laboratory investigations of lupus nephritis and any adverse effects of therapy on each visit. - Blood pressure and laboratory assessments, including complete blood cell count, urinalysis, urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR), and kidney and liver function, will be performed at each visit for 24 weeks and at the end of study (48 weeks). - Serum anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies and serum C3 will be measured every 8 weeks after treatment until 24 weeks and at the end of study (48 weeks). - A fasting lipid profile will be also measured every 8 weeks until 24 weeks and at the end of study (48 weeks). - Renal and extrarenal disease activity of SLE was measured using the SLEDAI2K. The SLEDAI2K will be evaluated at the time of entry into the study and every 8 weeks after treatment until 24 weeks and at the end of study (48 weeks). - SLICC damage index, SF-36, EQ5D, and SLEQOL will be evaluated at the time of entry, at 24 weeks, and at the end of the study. - Patients' serum and urine (blood 3ml and urine 50 ml) will be collected at baseline, 2nd week, 4th week, 12th week, and 48th week for further analysis of biomarkers in the future.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient who had biopsyproven lupus nephritis class III, IV or V according to the International Society of Nephrology (ISN)/Renal Pathology Society (RPS) 2003 classification (ISN/RPS2003) within 16 weeks of randomization and had ANA or antidsDNA positive. Laboratory tests documented the presence of active nephritis, defined as proteinuria (protein excretion &gt;1 g/24 h or spot UPCR &gt; 1 for at least two samples) or increased serum creatinine level (&gt;0.3 mg/dL of baseline but less than 2.0 mg/dl) with active urinary sediment (any of &gt;5 red blood cells/highpower field, &gt;5 white blood cells/highpower field, or red blood cell casts in the absence of infection or other causes). Willingness to participate in the study, and be able to read and provide informed consent. Severe extrarenal manifestations that may require highdose steroids or other immunomodulating treatments. The definition of severe extrarenal diseases in this investigation are defined by Active central nervous system deemed to be severe or progressive and/ or associated with significant cognitive impairment leading to inability to provide informed consent and/ or comply with the protocol. Any condition, including clinical findings or the laboratory results, which the investigators consider the patients have high disease activity and need high dose steroid and immunosuppressive drugs or other therapy depending on investigator opinion. Severe myocarditis with congestive heart failure or renal failure. Previous therapy with calcineurin inhibitor or MMF or CYC within the previous 4 months before randomization. Allergy with macrolide antibiotics. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥100mmHg) at screening day. Severely deteriorated renal function or rapid progressive crescentic Glomerulonephritis. Severe myocarditis or cardiomyopathy which may or may not be related to SLE Patients who have thrombotic microangiopathy who require treatment with plasmapheresis or IVIG. Severe infection or active TB. Active hepatitis and evidence of chronic liver disease. HIV infection. Diabetes mellitus. Women who were pregnant or unwilling to use contraception. Patients who response to steroid (complete remission) during the run in period (4 weeks). Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to MMF, mycophenolic acid (MPA), tacrolimus, corticosteroids or any components of these drug products.</criteria>
