	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Three Different Latanoprost 0,005% Eyedrops in Subjects Affected by Primary Open Angle Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, single blinded study of the duration of 3 months, involving subjects affected by POAG or OH under therapy with different Latanoprost drugs (Galaxia, Iopize or Latanoprost Rathiopharm). A total of 120 patients affected by POAG or OH newly diagnosed or already under topical therapy. will be recruited. After a recruitment visit to assest eligibility of each subject, a "run-in" therapy composed of timolol 0,5% 2 drops per day will be prescribed for 4 weeks. Then a baseline visit will be performed to evaluate IOP values and adverse effects in each subject. All subjects elegible for a therapy with a single dose of Latanoprost will be randomized into 3 arms. After 4 weeks of therapy a second visit will be made to assest IOP changes and safety. Therapy will be continued for another 4 weeks, and after that, a final visit will be made.</detailed_description>
