	<brief_title>Effect of Post-discharge Phone Calls on Patient Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, discharge from hospital in many institutions is a confusing process for patients filled with uncertainty and potential for harm. For instance, 1 in 5 discharges results in a post discharge adverse event, many of which are related to medication errors. These may lead to serious harm and possibly require readmission to hospital. Telephone follow-up calls after discharge has been studied in small single-center trials and as a part of a coordinated, multi-layered discharge process but its direct effectiveness is not known. Understanding the impact of this simple intervention on patient outcomes is an important step towards improving patients' discharge from hospital.</detailed_description>
