	<brief_summary>The primary objective of step 1 is the rate of adverse events of minocycline and bevacizumab during reirradiation and of step 2 is the response rate to bevacizumab, reirradiation, and minocycline. The secondary objectives are the response rate, PFS-3, PFS-6, and effects on quality of life and cognition from repeat radiation and bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repeat Radiation, Minocycline and Bevacizumab in Patients With Recurrent Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After providing informed consent, patients will undergo screening for eligibility to participate in the study. Screening will start within 21 days prior to dosing. Subjects will have an MRI within 21 days of starting radiation. QOL and cognition measures will be performed within 21 days of starting radiation. Radiation will be given with parameters determined on an individual basis by the radiation oncologist. Bevacizumab will be continued at 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Minocycline will be given twice a day starting at 100mg PO BID. MRI, QOL, and cognitive tests will be obtained 1, 3 and 6 months after the end of radiation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female patients ≥18 years old with a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks 2. Radiographically proven recurrent (≥ first relapse), intracranial glioma 3. Previous treatment with external beam radiation 4. Radiographic progression on current or prior bevacizumab treatment 5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of initiation of dosing and must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control while on study drug and for 3 months after the last dose. Women of nonchildbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥1 year. Men of childbearing potential must also agree to use an acceptable method of birth control while on study drug, and for 3 months after the last dose. 6. Karnofsky performance status of ≥50 7. Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function (absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 x 109/L, Hgb &gt;9 g/dL, platelet count ≥50 x 109/L, AST/ALT ≤2.5x ULN, creatinine ≤1.5x ULN) 8. Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedures and to comply with all study requirements 9. Systolic blood pressure ≤ 160 mg Hg or diastolic pressure ≤ 90 mg Hg within 14 days prior to study registration 10. Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT INR) &lt; 1.4 for patients not on warfarin confirmed by testing within 14 days prior to study registration 11. Patients on fulldose anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin or LMW heparin) must have no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding, and must be on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or on a stable dose of low molecular weight heparin 1. Use of an investigational drug within 14 days or within 5 halflives of teh investigational drug, whichever is shorter 2. Progression within 3 months of previous radiation by RANO criteria 3. History of Grade 2 (CTCAE v4) or greater acute intracranial hemorrhage 4. A concurrent active cancer that requires nonsurgical therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation, adjuvant therapy). 5. Patients with serious illnesses, uncontrolled infection, medical conditions, or other medical history including abnormal laboratory results, which in the investigator's opinion would be likely to interfere with a patient's participation in the study, or with the interpretation of the results 6. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding 7. Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure in the last 6 months, transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, New York Heart Association grade II or higher congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within 12 months prior to registration, evidence of recent myocardial infarction by EKG performed within 14 days of registration, serious or inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia, significant vascular and peripheral vascular disease, evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy 8. History of stroke, cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack within 6 months 9. Serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture or history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, intraabdominal abscess major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to registration, with the exception of the craniotomy for tumor resection 10. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration 11. Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma, that in the opinion of the treating physician may put the patient at high risk for radiation toxicity</criteria>
