	<brief_summary>The objective of this work was to compare the effects of two balance training programs, one Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system, on the balance, functionality and cognition of patients with Parkinson´s disease. It was a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Brazil Parkinson Association and Center of Research of the courses of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of São Paulo University. 32 patients with Parkinson´s disease on stages 1 and 2,5 of Hoehn e Yahr participated of this work. Patients were randomized in control and experimental group, 16 each one. The study was finished at december 2011.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this work was to compare the effects of two balance training programs, one Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system, on the balance, functionality and cognition of patients with Parkinson´s disease. It was a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Brazil Parkinson Association and Center of Research of the courses of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of São Paulo University. 32 patients with Parkinson´s disease on stages 1 and 2,5 of Hoehn e Yahr participated of this work. Patients were randomized in control and experimental group, 16 each one. Both groups performed 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session was composed of a 30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strengthen and axial mobility exercises. After this, both groups performed more 30 minutes of balance training: the control group performed balance exercises without external cues, visual or auditory feedbacks or cognitive stimulations; the experimental group performed the balance training with 10 Wii Fit games which stimulated motor and cognitive functions. The main outcome measures were: (1) Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); (2) Berg Balance Scale (BBS); (3) Unipedal Stance Test (UST) and (4) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The statistical analysis was done by repeated measures ANOVA in order to assess the possible differences among the analyzed variables. Both groups showed improvement in the section II of UPDRS, BBS, UST and MoCA. Patients with Parkinson´s disease showed balance and cognitive improvement with positive repercussion on daily living activities after 14 sessions of balance training without additional advantages to the virtual training.</detailed_description>
