	<brief_summary>The purpose of the National Breast Cancer Lymphedema Registry is to collect health information in order to study the lymphedema as a complication of breast cancer treatment. The investigators hope to learn whether early diagnosis will help to prevent lymphedema or, if it does occur, to reduce the severity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Historically, breast cancer-associated lymphedema has been relatively ignored, with mis-diagnosis, late diagnosis, and failure to treat. The condition has a measurable, substantial impact on patient function and perceived quality of life (QOL). Recent pilot studies suggest that interventions that are designed to facilitate early diagnosis and preventive strategies have a major impact on the incidence and severity of disease burden. This registry is designed to prospectively capture the relevant data to document the impact of preemptive diagnostic and treatment strategies.</detailed_description>
