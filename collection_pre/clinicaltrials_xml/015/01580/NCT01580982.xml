	<brief_summary>The mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to oncogene-targeted therapy can be determined from tumor tissue or tumor cell lines derived from available archival samples and/or from standard-of-care re-biopsy upon suspected tumor progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Analysis of Oncogenes and Resistance Mechanisms in Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To identify baseline and treatment-related somatic changes in the tumor tissue from patients with lung and other thoracic cancers. To estimate the proportion of patients that subsequent therapy is altered based on the information acquired from such biopsies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients undergoing investigation or treatment for thoracic cancers with oncogenetargeted therapies 2. Aged 18 years or older 3. Either a) have suspected tumor progression or other condition that dictates a standardofcare palliative, therapeutic, or diagnostic intervention including but not limited to procedures such as bronchoscopic biopsy, computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound (US)guided biopsy, thoracentesis, video assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pleurodesis, lobectomy, adrenalectomy or pleural catheter placement, providing tumor specimen appropriate molecular analysis or b) have previously had biopsy/surgical intervention with tumor tissue at University of Colorado or an outside institution available for medullar analysis. 4. Patients must have the ability to understand and willingness to sign an informed consent document.</criteria>
