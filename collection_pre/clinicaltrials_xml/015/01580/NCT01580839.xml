	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis being tested in this trial is that ischaemic stroke patients selected with significant penumbral mismatch (according to imaging criteria) at 4.5 (or 3 hours depending on local guidelines) - 9 hours post onset of stroke or after 'wake up stroke' (WUS) will have improved clinical outcomes when given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) compared to placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients presenting with hemispheric acute ischaemic stroke Patient, family member or legally responsible person depending on local ethics requirements has given informed consent Patient's age is ≥18 years (or as per local requirements) Treatment onset can commence within 4.5 9 hours after stroke onset according to registered product information, or within 3 9 hours according to locally accepted guidelines. Patients who wake with stroke may be included if neurological and other exclusion criteria are satisfied. These 'wake up' strokes are defined as having no symptoms at sleep onset, but stroke symptoms on waking. The time of stroke onset is to be taken as the midpoint between sleep onset (or last known to be normal) and time of waking. The maximum time window for randomisation is then 9 hours from the midpoint as described. Significant neurological deficit (eg. NIHSS score of ≥ 4 26) with clinical signs of hemispheric infarction. Penumbral mismatch A "hypoperfusion to core" volume ratio of greater than 1.2, and an absolute difference greater than 10ml (using a Magnetic Resonance (MR) or Computed Tomography (CT) Tmax &gt; 6 second delay), between perfusion lesion and MRDWI or Computed TomographyCerebral Blood Flow (CTCBF) core lesion. An infarct core lesion of less than or equal to 70ml using MRDWI or CTCBF Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) identified by CT or MRI Rapidly improving symptoms, particularly if in the judgment of the managing clinician that the improvement is likely to result in the patient having an NIHSS score of &lt; 4 at randomization Prestroke MRS score of ≥ 2 (indicating previous disability) Contra indication to imaging with contrast agents Infarct core &gt;1/3 Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) territory qualitatively Participation in any investigational study in the previous 30 days Any terminal illness such that patient would not be expected to survive more than 1 year Any condition that could impose hazards to the patient if study therapy is initiated or affect the participation of the patient in the study (this applies to patients with severe microangiopathy such as haemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). The judgment is left to the discretion of the Investigator. Pregnant women (clinically evident) Previous stroke within last three months Recent past history or clinical presentation of ICH, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), arteriovenous (AV) malformation, aneurysm, or cerebral neoplasm. At the discretion of each Investigator. Current use of oral anticoagulants and a prolonged prothrombin time (INR &gt; 1.6) Use of heparin, except for low dose subcutaneous heparin, in the previous 48 hours and a prolonged activated thromboplastin time exceeding the upper limit of the local laboratory normal range. Use of glycoprotein IIb IIIa inhibitors within the past 72 hours. Use of single or dual agent oral platelet inhibitors (clopidogrel and/or lowdose aspirin) prior to study entry is permitted. Clinically significant hypoglycaemia. Uncontrolled hypertension defined by a blood pressure &gt; 185 mmHg systolic or &gt;110 mmHg diastolic on at least 2 separate occasions at least 10 minutes apart, or requiring aggressive treatment to reduce the blood pressure to within these limits. The definition of "aggressive treatment" is left to the discretion of the responsible Investigator. Hereditary or acquired haemorrhagic diathesis Gastrointestinal or urinary bleeding within the preceding 21 days Major surgery within the preceding 14 days which poses risk in the opinion of the investigator. Exposure to a thrombolytic agent within the previous 72 hours</criteria>
