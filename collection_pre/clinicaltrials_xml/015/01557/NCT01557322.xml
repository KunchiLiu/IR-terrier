	<brief_summary>1. To assess the baseline (i.e. RA therapy initiation) characteristics in a real-world setting across two moderate RA cohorts: a Test Group of patients newly exposed to etanercept (Enbrel) therapy and a Control Group of patients with similar disease characteristics newly exposed to other, non-biologic therapies. 2. To assess the change over time (from baseline to the most recent follow-up) in the characteristics described at baseline in 2 British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register (BSRBR) cohorts (i.e. moderate RA patients treated with Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) alone versus moderate RA patients treated with Enbrel).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The Test Group will be patients with rheumatoid arthritis, newly starting therapy with etanercept (Enbrel). Inclusion criteria for the exposed cohort subjects are: Patients aged 18 years and over at the time of diagnosis; Patients from the BSRBR with moderate RA as defined by a DAS28 (&gt;3.2 and ≤5.1); Patients who have given informed consent for long term followup and access to all medical records; Patients initiating (i.e. at leats one treatment) treatment with etanercept (Enbrel) for RA. The Control Group: Patients aged 18 years and over a the time of diagnosis; Patients from the BSRBR with moderate RA as defined by a DAS28 (&gt;3.2 and ≤5.1); Patients who have given informed consent for long term followup and access to all medical records; Patients are receiving at least one traditional DMARD and have never been prescribed a biologic agent; Per BSRBR registry since data is retropsectively being analyzed</criteria>
