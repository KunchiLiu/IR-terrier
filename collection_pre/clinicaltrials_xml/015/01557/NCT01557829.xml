	<brief_summary>This study randomizes degenerative spondylolisthesis and/or degenerative disc patients into two groups: one to receive a new ceramic implant and a control group with a more traditional PEEK plastic implant. The procedure uses a single oblique cage in each group. The study will measure and compare pain and disability improvement with the two implanted devices over a period of two years. The fusion status will also be judged with plane x-rays and one CT scan.</brief_summary>
