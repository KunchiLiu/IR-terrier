	<brief_summary>Previous cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that blood pressure (BP) measurements at home (HBP) in the morning offer stronger predictive power for micro- and macrovascular complications in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes than casual/clinic blood pressure measurements (CBP) (Kamoi K et al, 2002-2003). Further, a prospective, longitudinal study for 6 years in patients with type 2 diabetes also demonstrated that control of wakening-up HBP provides the stronger predictive power for the outcomes than that of CBP did (Kamoi et al, 2010). However, it is not clear to show which of BP measurement provides the stronger predictive power for outcomes by comparing cumulative events over a longer time than 6 years. Therefore, the investigators examined which of HBP or CBP provides the stronger predictive power for outcomes in addition of renal anemia reported previously over 10 years in the patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
