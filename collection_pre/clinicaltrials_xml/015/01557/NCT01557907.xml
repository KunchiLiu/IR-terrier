	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to investigate if intradermal (in the skin) basal and bolus insulin delivery of a fast acting insulin analog (NovoRapid) as needed to adequately control the blood glucose for a subject with Type 1 Diabetes can be maintained for a period of up to three days and if intradermal delivery of insulin has advantages over standard subcutaneous (under the skin) delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-day (3) In-patient Evaluation of Intradermal Versus Subcutaneous Basal and Bolus Insulin Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The is a single center, open-label, 2 period crossover study randomized by route (intradermal versus subcutaneous) in patients with Type 1 diabetes. Subjects will receive their insulin, basal and bolus dosages, via intradermal (ID) and subcutaneous (SC) infusion sets over a three day period. Each subject will participate in 3 visits: a Screening Visit (V1), followed by 2 experimental intervention days (V2 and V3) to be started 2 - 21 days after screening visit. The minimum/maximum interval between study days shall be 5 to 28 days. Each subject will remain in the clinic for approximately 3 days during the experimental interventions. A final exam will be performed at the end of Visit 3. After successful screening and enrollment subjects are admitted to the clinic. Their insulin pump and infusion set is replaced by the investigational system, a commercially available insulin pump and either the intradermal infusion set (Research Catheter Set, BD) or the subcutaneous infusion set (Quick Set, Medtronic)to include an in-line pressure transducer/recorder and insulin NovoRapid. The initial pump infusion rate is established based on the patient's known basal infusion rate and the meal bolus insulin is estimated based on the patient's known insulin sensitivity. An intravenous (in the vein) catheter line is established, blood glucose is measured at least every 2 hours overnight and insulin corrections can be implemented, if deemed necessary. The overnight and pre-prandial (before meal) target range is 70-160 mg/dl, although the procedure will continue as planned if the patient is outside the range. It should be the goal not to give any IV glucose or insulin at all, and not to change basal insulin settings for at least 2 hours before the meal. The breakfast meal will be a high GI (60g carbohydrates) solid meal, to be consumed within 15 minutes and followed for a period of 6 hours of blood sampling for glucose and insulin levels. Lunch will be served as standardized mixed meal, and followed for a period of 4-6 hours. This procedure is repeated on days 2 and 3 whereas the breakfast and lunch meal as well as the insulin dose to cover the meal are the same. A light evening dinner is served every day, composition and insulin dose to be recorded. On day three after the 4 hour period following lunch the catheter will be removed, catheter and site assessments will be documented and an ultrasound observation of the infusion site (skin thickness and SC) versus an adjacent control site will be performed within 10 min after removal of the infusion set. Glucose rescue, if necessary, will be administered orally (juice, 200 mL). Insulin correction boli should be delivered via the investigational infusion set.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Male and Female patients will be included in the trial only if they fulfill all the inclusion criteria mentioned below: Understood and signed informed consent obtained before any trialrelated activities (trialrelated activities are any procedures that would not have been performed during normal management of the patient) Type 1 Diabetes mellitus, according to clinical judgment / ADA / WHOdefinition (Diabetes Care 2003; 26: 520) for at least 1 year. Usage of insulin pump therapy (CSII) with carb counting for at least six months Age in the range of ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years Body mass index (BMI) ≤ 32 kg/m² HbA1c ≤ 8.0% at screening Using ≤ than 60 U of insulin on a typical day (preferably) Able and willing to adhere to the study procedures for the entire trial period Negative test results for hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen and HIV at screening. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients will not be permitted to enter the trial, if they fulfill any of the exclusion criteria mentioned below: Previous participation in this trial or participation in a clinical trial within 3 months prior to screening examination Any symptoms suggestive of, or a diagnosis or treatment for gastroparesis Abnormalities in renal function (e.g. serum creatinine &gt; 120 µmmol/L for male, &gt;100 µmmol/L for female subjects or judged by the investigator that would pose a problem of clearance of injected insulin Proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy that has required acute treatment within the last six months Acute and severe illness apart from diabetes mellitus as judged by the investigator Abnormalities in the laboratory parameters if judged as clinically significant by the investigator. In particular, patients with GOT/GPT &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), thrombocyte count &lt;100/nL, INR &gt;1.3, PTT &gt;50 sec. Clinically significant abnormalities in the ECG Recurrent major hypoglycemia or hypoglycemic unawareness as judged by the investigator Lipodystrophy which in the judgment of the investigator would pose a problem in terms of variability of absorption of injected insulin Use of systemic corticoids for the last three month prior screening examination or treatment with medication known to interfere with glucose metabolism such as nonselective ßblockers, or mono amine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, ACEinhibitors or thiazides, unless such medical treatment has existed for at least three months and is not changing, prior to screening examination Any disease requiring use of anticoagulants Impaired hepatic or renal functions as judged by the investigator Cardiac problems as judged by the investigator Uncontrolled hypertension (treated or untreated) RRsyst. &gt;140 mmHg, RRdiast. &gt; 90 mmHg Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate understanding or cooperation Current addiction to alcohol or substances of abuse as determined by the investigator Allergy to plaster/adhesive Any other condition that the investigator feels would interfere with trial participation or evaluation of results.
