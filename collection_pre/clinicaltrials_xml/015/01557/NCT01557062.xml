	<brief_summary>Objectives: To assess the effect of passive body heating on the sleep pattern of patients with fibromyalgia. Methods: Six menopausal women diagnosed with fibromyalgia according to criteria determined by the American College of Rheumatology were included. All women underwent passive immersion in a warm bath at 36±1 °C, for 15 sessions of 30 minutes each over 3 weeks. Their sleep pattern was assessed by polysomnography at the following conditions: pre-intervention (baseline), on the first day of intervention (acute), on the last day of intervention (chronic) and 3 weeks after the end of interventions (follow-up). Core body temperature was evaluated by a thermistor pill at the above-mentioned conditions. The impact on fibromyalgia was assessed through of a specific questionnaire called fibromyalgia impact questionnaire.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients were attended at the Psychobiology and Exercise Studies Centre 5 times a week for 3 weeks between 6:00pm and 8:00pm for passive body-heating interventions for 30 min each session. The patients were accompanied by a researcher to a therapeutic water bath (Barritz Hydrotherapy Appliance, Germany) and were comfortably positioned in a supine position with their necks supported by an inflatable floating pillow to keep the body relaxed and safe during the intervention. The room temperature at the laboratory was maintained at 23±1 ºC, and the water temperature was 36±1ºC.</detailed_description>
