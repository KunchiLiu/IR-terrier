	<brief_summary>Intake of vegetables and fruits in preschool children is less than recommended amounts. Although offering a variety of foods has been shown to increase intake, this effect has not been well studied for low-energy-dense foods. The purpose of this study was to test whether increasing the variety of vegetables and fruits served to preschool children affected the amount eaten. The hypotheses were that increasing the variety of vegetables and fruits would increase both the amount selected and the amount eaten.</brief_summary>
