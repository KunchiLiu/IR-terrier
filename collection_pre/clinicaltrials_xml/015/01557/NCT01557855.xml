	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to collect data on the commercial use of CORUS® (validated quantitative in vitro diagnostic test) Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) blood test to evaluate the clinical referral patterns of Primary Care Physicians after receipt of their patients' CORUS Score, and to better understand patient management patterns for clinicians ordering the test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of a Novel Gene Expression Test for Diagnosis of Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective of the study is to assess whether the score provided by the CORUS® CAD test has an effect on the Primary Care Physician's patient management and referral patterns once received: 1. no further cardiac testing or treatment 2. medical therapy for angina or non-cardiac chest pain 3. Referral to a cardiologist for stress testing with or without imaging, CT angiography, or invasive cardiac catheterization. Since it takes approximately two days for the physician to receive the result of the CORUS CAD, initial diagnostic testing will reflect local standard of care</detailed_description>
