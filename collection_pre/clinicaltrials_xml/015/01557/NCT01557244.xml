	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to find out if the medicine fesoterodine is a useful treatment in children with bladder muscle overactivity caused by a neurological condition. Children will be aged 6 to 17 years old. This is done by finding out how well it works, what the body does to fesoterodine, what side effects are experienced and the safety of fesoterodine. It will be compared with the medicine oxybutynin, which is already available for treating the condition.</brief_summary>
