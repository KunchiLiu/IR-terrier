	<brief_summary>Objectives: This study aims to characterize severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in the emergency department through the acquisition of ultrasound images. A wide range of SSTIs will be imaged and recorded, leading to a registry of these infections. The registry will show whether ED (emergency department) sonographers can accurately characterize these infections, as compared to the final hospital diagnosis. The registry will also provide data for a case-control study comparing ultrasonographic characteristics of necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections (NSTIs) to those of non-necrotizing SSTIs. Research procedures: In this study, the investigators will approach patients who present to the Emergency Department with a possible skin and/or tissue infection. Study subjects must be ED patients requiring admission to the hospital for the primary problem of an SSTI due to the need for follow-up. If the patient consents to participating in the study, the investigator will obtain and record an ultrasound image of the infected area. An ultrasound image of an uninfected area of skin will also be recorded for comparison. Patient information regarding personal history, physical examination, blood tests and x-rays will also be gathered from participants.</brief_summary>
