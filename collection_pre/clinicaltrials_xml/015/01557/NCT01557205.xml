	<brief_summary>The investigators will obtain human skin specimen (sized approximately 1 cm x 1 cm) for dermatological surgical patients in National Taiwan University Hospital, after informed consent was obtained. Human skin keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and melanocytes will be cultured from the human skin specimen. The three dimensional images of these cultured cells will be observed by a ultra-high resolution 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography.</brief_summary>
