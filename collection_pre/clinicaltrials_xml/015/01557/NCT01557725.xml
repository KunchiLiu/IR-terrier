	<brief_summary>There are many different views regarding ideal duration and type of thromboprophylaxis after hip or knee surgery. An important factor in Fast-track surgery is early mobilization, which in itself is thought to prevent clotting. The investigators hypothesize that there is no increase with regards to thrombosis in patients receiving fast-track surgery with early mobilization and chemical thrombosis prophylaxis only during hospitalization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frequency of Vascular Events With Short-term Thromboprophylaxis in Fast-track Hip and Knee-arthroplasty.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major orthopaedic surgery is related to development of thrombosis. It is well known that pharmacological prophylaxis reduces the risk of thrombosis after surgery but there are still doubt about the best type of prophylaxis and duration of treatment. The American College of Chest Physicians recommend thromboprophylaxis with either Low molecular weight heparin, factor Xa-inhibitors or Vitamin-K-antagonists for up til 10 days after total knee replacement (TKR) and 35 days after total hip replacement(THR). However whether these recommendations are applicable in fast-track patients receiving early mobilisation is uncertain. Studies on fast-track patients receiving early mobilisation and thrombosis prophylaxis only during hospitalisation showed very small incidence of symptomatic thromboembolic events. Therefore we conduct a quality-cohort-study on all patients receiving fast-track TKR/THR with short-term anti-thrombotic treatment, in order to investigate frequency of symptomatical deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, acute myocardial infarction and stroke.</detailed_description>
