	<brief_summary>Retinoblastoma treatment has become more and more focused in the last years. New treatments developed by Dr. Kaneko from Japan in 1995 are now being tested in clinical trials. Intra-arterial chemotherapy with Melphalan has shown success in some patients but with limited response when there is marked vitreal seeding. For these cases Intravitreal injections of Melphalan have been successful in Japan. In this study the same chemotherapy (melphalan) will be administered intravitreally (directly through the eye wall) and the response (short and long term) will be monitored.</brief_summary>
