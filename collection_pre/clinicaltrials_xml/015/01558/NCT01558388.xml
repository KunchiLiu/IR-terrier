	<brief_summary>Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal condition involving a reduction in the amount of Lactobacilli, the normal bacteria colonizing the vagina, and an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. The presence of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. After a course of antibiotic treatment, recurrence of bacterial vaginosis has been reported in 10-70% of cases. This study aims to verify if administration of vaginal Lactobacilli may reduce the occurrence rate after antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.</brief_summary>
