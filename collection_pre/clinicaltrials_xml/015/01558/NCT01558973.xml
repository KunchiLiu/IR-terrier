	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore whether frontal brain activation in response to stress varies as a function of the presence or extent of early trauma and whether or not this effect is greater in women compared to men. To examine the effect of stress on thinking and remembering. To examine the separate and interactive effects of stress, addiction, withdrawal, and genetics; and to examine fMRI brain activation associated with stressful, reward-related-cue and neutral/relaxing audiotaped scripts,visual images and emotional video clips in addicted individuals and in healthy controls.</brief_summary>
