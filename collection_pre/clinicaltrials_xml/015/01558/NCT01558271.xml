	<brief_title>A Study of LY2189265 in Japanese Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rescue therapy (defined as alternative antihyperglycemic medication use or dose modification of oral antihyperglycemic medication [OAM]) may have been initiated during the planned treatment period if the participant discontinued study drug or met prespecified thresholds for severe, persistent hyperglycemia. Efficacy data, as well as data for hypoglycemic episodes from participants who permanently discontinued study treatment but switched to another diabetes medication and remained in the study, were censored from the point of initiating new treatment onwards.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants who have had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus before screening. Participants who have been Oral Antihyperglycemic Medication (OAM)naïve (diet and exercise only) or been taking OAM monotherapy except for thiazolidinedione (TZD) and are willing to discontinue this medication. Participants taking OAM monotherapy must complete 8week washout period prior to randomization. Participants who are OAM naïve with a screening glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 7.0% to 10.0% and randomization HbA1c value of 7.0% to 10.0%, or who are taking OAM monotherapy with screening HbA1c value of 6.5% to 9.0% and randomization HbA1c value of 7.0% to 10.0%. Participants who have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m^2) to 35.0 kg/m^2. Participants who have a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Participants who have previously been treated with any other glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) analog. Participants who have been receiving more than half of the maximum dose of sulfonylureas at screening. Participants who have been currently taking insulin or TZD, or have had previous insulin or TZD treatment within 3 months before screening. Participants who have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, a history of chronic pancreatitis or acute pancreatitis at screening, as determined by the investigator. Participants who have a serum amylase concentration ≥3 times the upper limit of the reference range and/or a serum lipase concentration ≥2 times the upper limit of the reference range, as determined by the central laboratory at screening. Participants who have self or family history of medullary Ccell hyperplasia, focal hyperplasia, or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).</criteria>
