	<brief_summary>The Parkinson's Genetic Research Study (PaGeR), headed by Dr. Cyrus Zabetian, is searching for genes that increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. The study is a joint effort by neurologists and researchers across the United States and is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The coordinating center for PaGeR is located at the University of Washington and the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PaGeR is focusing on families in which two or more people have been diagnosed with PD. Past research suggests that such "multiplex" families might hold the key to the discovery of new PD genes. To take part in PaGeR, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire and to undergo an interview, a neurological exam, a short memory test, and a blood draw. Enrollment in the study usually takes between one and two hours. There is no cost to participate, and all study information is kept strictly confidential. There are a number of designated sites across the country where families can enroll. However, for family members who are unable to travel to one of these sites, other arrangements can be made.</detailed_description>
