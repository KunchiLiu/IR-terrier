	<brief_summary>Younger women with breast cancer experience substantially greater distress and depressive symptoms than older women. These symptoms can hamper recovery and healthy behaviors that can reduce the risk of recurrence and/or other chronic diseases. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness meditation-based intervention for this at-risk group of women. The investigators hypothesize that a structured program of mindfulness meditation will lead to significant improvements in psychological well-being (i.e., depression, stress), with corresponding improvements in health behaviors and biomarkers of cancer risk, in women diagnosed with breast cancer, prior to age 50. The investigators will also examine mechanisms for intervention effects, including increased mindfulness and ability to relax.</brief_summary>
