	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer patients diagnosed with a biochemical recurrence and limited metastases are conventionally treated with androgen deprivation therapy. However, in patients with limited metastatic load, the time to progression might be. Subsequently, active surveillance of these patients until progression might defer the start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for several months to years. As an alternative, salvage treatment of the limited number of metastases with either surgery or radiotherapy might postpone the start of ADT even longer. The current trial hypothesizes that ADT might be deferred longer following salvage treatment as compared to active surveillance.</brief_summary>
