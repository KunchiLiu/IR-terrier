	<detailed_description>The objective of this investigation is to develop a method to distinguish children who are acutely infected with GAS from those who are carriers. If the carrier state can be differentiated from acute infection we will be able to avoid unnecessary treatment of children with pharyngitis or other respiratory symptoms from whom GAS are recovered but who are not truly infected with GAS. This will facilitate the primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever globally without enhancing antimicrobial resistance. The specific aim of this study is to identify 30 children with acute pharyngitis due to Group A streptococcus (GAS) and 30 children who are pharyngeal carriers of GAS. Thirty percent of children 4 to 16 years of age with acute pharyngitis occurring between October and May will have a positive culture or rapid antigen detection test for GAS. Approximately 10-15% of these children with pharyngitis and a positive culture or rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for GAS will be carriers.</detailed_description>
