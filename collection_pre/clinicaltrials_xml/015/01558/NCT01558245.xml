	<brief_title>Tissue Kallikrein Preventing the Restenosis After Stenting of Symptomatic MCA Atherosclerotic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A series of studies have confirmed the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), including kallikrein, kininogen and kinin, plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation secondary to acute and chronic ischemic brain injury. Some researchers found that hTK gene delivery can inhibit the formation of neointimal induced by the common carotid artery ligation in mice. Further study revealed hTK gene transfection in VSMC lead to increased secretion of TK and inhibition of VSMC proliferation. In addition, it was also observed that the serum TK levels were coincident with the carotid artery stenosis. The more severe the stenosis is, the higher the serum TK level is, and the serum TK decreased after carotid artery angioplasty and stent placement. These results suggest that KKS play an important regulatory role in vascular remodeling and TK may exert a beneficial influence in the process of ISR</detailed_description>
