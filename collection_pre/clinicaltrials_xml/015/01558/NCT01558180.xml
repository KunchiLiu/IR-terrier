	<brief_summary>The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing a telephone based intervention (TCM) to usual care (UC). TCM will feature a registered nurse providing a series of phone calls to assist caregivers in learning and modifying behavioral strategies that may help young children with autism to sleep better. Objective (activity monitors) and subjective (rating scales) data will be collected by an independent research assistant at the end of the project. The investigators hypothesize that TCM improves sleep duration and decreases sleep problems relative to a usual care control condition (UC).</brief_summary>
