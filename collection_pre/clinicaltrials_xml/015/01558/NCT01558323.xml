	<criteria>Individuals with renal impairment only Estimated Creatinine Clearance (CLcr) by the CockroftGault equation ≤80mL/min; Mild renal impairment defined as CLcr 5080 mL/min Moderate renal impairment defined as CLcr 3050 mL/min Severe renal impairment defined as CLcr &lt;30 mL/min Healthy subjects only • Estimated CLcr by the CockroftGault equation &gt;80mL/min All Individuals A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history of a prolonged QTinterval syndrome. Female subjects must be of non child bearing potential or use an effective method of contraception. Individuals with renal impairment Renal transplant at any time. Subjects undergoing any method of dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis) within the last 3 months. History of clinically significant chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection active and requiring antibiotic treatment within the past 30 days. Any medication that is contraindicated in moderate or severe renally impaired population Healthy subjects History or presence of impaired renal function as indicated by clinically significantly abnormal creatinine or BUN and/or urea values, or abnormal urinary constituents (e.g., albuminuria) Evidence of urinary obstruction or difficulty in voiding at screening History or presence of hepatitis B or C and/or positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result at screening.
