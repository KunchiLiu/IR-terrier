	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies mechanical stimulation in preventing bone density loss in patients undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Mechanical stimulation may limit, prevent, or reverse bone loss, increase muscle and cardiac performance, and improve overall health</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanical Stimulation in Preventing Bone Density Loss in Patients Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of a mechanical stimulation regimen in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the data collection tools to prepare for a larger phase II trial. OUTLINE: Patients undergo mechanical stimulation over 20 minutes once daily (QD) beginning on date of hospital admission and continuing through day 100 post-HCT, except for day 0 (date of transplant).</detailed_description>
