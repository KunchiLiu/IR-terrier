	<brief_summary>Part I is a 3-period, active comparator-controlled, fixed sequence study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MK-7145 compared to furosemide in participants with moderate-to-severe renal insufficiency (RI) without heart failure (HF). Primary hypothesis for Part I is that at least one well-tolerated dose of MK-7145 will produce a greater 24hr urinary excretion of sodium (UNa) on the 1st day of MK-7145 dosing than 80 mg furosemide (on the 1st day of furosemide dosing) in participants with moderate-to-severe RI. If MK-7145 is safe at natriuretic doses in RI in Part I of this study, MK-7145 will be investigated in participants with heart failure (HF) and RI (Part II). Part II is 4 period, fixed sequence, active comparator controlled (in Period 1), titration (in Periods 2, 3 and 4) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a titration regimen of MK-7145 compared to an optimized stable maintenance regimen of furosemide or torsemide in participants with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II and III heart failure and moderate or severe renal insufficiency. The primary hypothesis for Part II is that at least one dose of MK-7145, titrated according to a fixed dose titration regimen, will be associated with a reduction in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) compared to furosemide or torsemide (at 24 hours post morning dose on the last dosing day of each period) in participants with NYHA class II/III HF with moderate or severe RI.</brief_summary>
