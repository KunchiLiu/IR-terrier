	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to compare results for the detection of circulating melanoma cells (CMC) using CellSearch versus EPISPOT (EPithelial ImmunoSPOT) techniques between a group of patients with metastatic melanoma and a group of hospitalized control patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Circulating Tumor Cells and Melanoma: Comparing the EPISPOT and CellSearch Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study include: A. To compare the following elements between the two patient groups: - the number of CMCs per ml of blood as determined by EPISPOT - the number of CMCs per ml of blood as determined by CellSearch - the percentage of patients with at least 2 CMCs per ml of blood according to the two techniques - the % of CMCs expressing KI67 - the % of CMCs expressions S100 (only the EPISPOT technique) B. To compare the EPISPOT and CellSearch techniques is terms of the following: - the number of CMCs detected per ml blood - the number of CMCs expressing antigen KI67 C. To re-evaluate the 2-CMC per ml blood threshold</detailed_description>
