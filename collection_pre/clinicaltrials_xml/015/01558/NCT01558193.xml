	<brief_summary>There is a series of well designed studies that have reported, in those with a history of anti-social behavior, that supplementation with vitamins / minerals, omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA), or both, reduces the incidence of aggressive behavior. Although there is evidence that all these nutrients have a role, to date the relative contribution of fatty acids and vitamins / minerals has not been considered: for example the possibility of a synergistic interaction has not yet been examined. In addition the topic has to date been studied under real-life condition, such as a prison, making the topic difficult to study. The major aim of the present study was to develop a paradigm that would allow the study of the topic in a sample from the general population without a history of anti-social behavior. Subjects received either a vitamin/mineral supplement, a fatty acid supplement, both or neither for three months, Measures of impulsivity and aggression were assessed before and after supplementation. Although in the past measures of actual behaviour have proved to be sensitive to supplementation, questionnaire measures have not. The second major objective was therefore to consider whether such phenomena can be studied in a sample without a history of anti-social behavior, using standardized, sensitive laboratory based measures and to compare these with questionnaire measures.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: To consider whether aggression and impulsivity respond to multi-vitamins / minerals or fatty acid supplementation and whether there is a synergistic interaction? In a between subjects design four groups will be contrasted. Those who for three months: 1. Receive two placebos 2. Receive multi-vitamin / mineral plus a placebo 3. Receive fatty acids plus placebo 4. Receive multi-vitamin / mineral plus fatty acids.</detailed_description>
