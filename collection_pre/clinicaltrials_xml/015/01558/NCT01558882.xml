	<brief_summary>The mobilization of natural killer cells (uNK) triggers and coordinates all stages of embryo implantation. They are at the origin of the local secretion of cytokines, growth factors, chemokines affecting vascular development and the local immunotrophisme for the conceptus. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the expression of endometrial uNK cells before and after tubal obstruction by Essure devices. Endoluminal and endometrial levels of various cytokines and growth factors will also be studied.</brief_summary>
