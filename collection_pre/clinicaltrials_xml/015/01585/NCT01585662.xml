	<brief_summary>EUS-guided pseudocyst drainage has been used world widely. Now, most endoscopists tend to place several stents to drain the content of cyst into GI tract. In the investigators experience, a modified naso-pancreatic tube drainage was more safer, easier and cheaper than placement of stents. Moreover, none of pseudocysts(total 19) drained by this modified naso-pancreatic tube drainage method were found recurrent with a follow up period from 3 months-34 months. So, the investigators designed this prospective random comparing study to confirm the result.</brief_summary>
