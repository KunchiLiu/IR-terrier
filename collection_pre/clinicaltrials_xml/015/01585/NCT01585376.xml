	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and find biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies genes in samples from younger patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Genes in Samples From Younger Patients With Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To obtain a larger cohort of rhabdomyosarcoma samples (alveolar and embryonal) to establish a more accurate estimate of the frequency of particular genetic lesions. - To provide the statistical power to establish an unambiguous connection between focal genetic lesions, histological subtype, and outcome for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma. OUTLINE: DNA samples are analyzed in solid and liquid phase for exons of all genes mutated from previous discovery. DNA is then eluted and sequenced by illumina platform.</detailed_description>
