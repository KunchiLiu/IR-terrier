	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the suitability and practicality of a coaching and support intervention in helping patients to use daily strategies for managing breathlessness. Also, the investigators will try to understand how useful it is in helping patients to reduce intensity of breathlessness and its impact their quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Management Intervention for Breathlessness in Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer is common worldwide and is a leading cause of death. Breathlessness (dyspnea or shortness of breath) is a highly prevalent clinical problem in lung cancer, developing early in 25-50% of patients due to advanced stage at presentation. It persists in 60% of survivors' post-lung resection and worsens with progressive disease with rates as high as 90% reported in the final months of life. Breathlessness is associated with a high degree of unpleasantness, negatively impacts on daily functioning, and multiple domains of quality of life, triggers fear and anxiety in patients and their family, and contributes to symptom specific and psychological distress. It is also costly to the health system as it contributes to urgent care use and hospitalization. The purpose of this pilot trial is to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of a self-management intervention for breathlessness in lung cancer.</detailed_description>
