	<brief_summary>The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of hLL1-DOX, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) regimen (in terms of a dose and its associated dosing schedule). The secondary objectives are to obtain information on efficacy, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity, and to determine the optimal dose for subsequent studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of hLL1-DOX in Relapsed NHL and CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive hLL1-DOX at one of 4 dose levels administered on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of 21-day treatment cycles which are continued in the absence of progression or unacceptable toxicity up to a total of 8 cycles. After treatment, follow-up will be done at 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-treatment and will continue to be done every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
