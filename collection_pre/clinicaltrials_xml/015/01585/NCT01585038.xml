	<brief_title>Efavirenz Versus Rilpivirine on Vascular Function, Inflammation, and Oxidative Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center study comparing the effects of efavirenz (EFV) versus rilpivirine (RPV) on endothelial function in a total of 40 HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers (20 in each arm) at the Indiana University Medical Center. Enrolled subjects will have their brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a measure of endothelial function, and other cardiovascular, inflammatory, and oxidative stress parameters measured at baseline and again after 4 weeks of study treatment.</detailed_description>
