	<brief_title>Anfibatide Phase Ib-IIa Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. This study is a phase Ib-IIa exploratory study to observe the safety of Antiplatelet Thrombolysin for Injection for the treatment of non-ST segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients and preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of different doses, providing the theoretical basis of the phase II and III clinical study protocol. 2. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of different doses.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Aged 1870 years; 2. Laboratory tests show increase of the markers of myocardial damage (CKMB,CTnI), or reduction after increase, with at least one values exceeding the 99th percentile of the upper limit of the reference value; 3. Ischemia symptoms (ischemic chest pain lasts for over 15 minutes, little release after taking nitroglycerin sublingually) or a new myocardial ischemia on electrocardiogram(ECG), i.e. a new STT variation (a new or transient depression of ST segment by over 0.1mV, or Twave inversion≥0.2mV); 4. Patients receive PCI after coronary angiography; 5. Patients, or their family or guardian give signed informed consent forms. 1. Patients with severe unstable hemodynamics who should receive urgent PCI; 2. Patients with untreated hypertension (SBP&gt;180 mmHg or DBP &gt;110mmHg) and hypotension shock (SBP&lt;90mmHg/80mmHg for over 30min); 3. Investigator considers patients need to use GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists during the study period; 4.

Patients with heart function in decompensatory phase (Killip grade 34) or cardiac shock; 6. Patients with malignant arrhythmia, e.g. the thirddegree atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation ventricular; 7. Patients with severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, with serum aspartate transaminase(AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) exceeding 1.5 times the upper limit of reference values, creatinine clearance ＜30ml/min or serum creatinine ≥200μmol/L or 2.5mg/dl; 8. Patients who have received PCI in the past six months; 9. Patients who have received coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) previously; 10. Patients who have received invasive operation in the past 3 months; 11. Patients who have suffered from ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the past 6 months, or patients with past history of hemorrhagic stroke; 12. Patients who need a longterm treatment of oral anticoagulants (such as warfarin); 13. Patients with active peptic ulcer, or other diseases of hemorrhagic tendency; 14. Patients with disease of coagulation disorder; 15. Hematology test shows platelet count ＜100,000mm3,or hemoglobin＜100g/L; 16. Women in pregnant or lactation period, or women of childbearing age do not take efficient contraception measures; 17. Patients with an allergic constitution; 18. Patients who is participating in other clinical trials; 19. Patients who do not give a signed informed consent forms; 20. Patients who are not suitable to enroll in the trial according to the investigator's judgement.</criteria>
