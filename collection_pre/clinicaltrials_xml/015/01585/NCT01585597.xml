	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether reducing a patients body temperature (mild hypothermia of 33 degrees Centigrade) will significantly reduce the risk of brain injury (notably reperfusion injury and hemorrhagic conversion) in patients that have suffered a significant interruption of blood flow to an area of brain (occlusion of large proximal cerebral artery) and have undergone successful removal of that interruption (revascularization).</brief_summary>
