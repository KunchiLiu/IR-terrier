Male subject must not donate sperm starting at Screening and throughout the study period and for at least 28 days [or 5 five half lives of the study drug whichever is longer] after final study drug administration. Highly effective contraception is defined as: Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.
