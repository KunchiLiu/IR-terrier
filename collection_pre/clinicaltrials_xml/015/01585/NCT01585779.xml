	<brief_title>Contour 3D®/TriAd® Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring Post-Market Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of the TV repair procedure is to relieve patients from TV insufficiency or reduce TV stenosis. This study will evaluate the hemodynamic efficacy of the Contour 3D® and Tri-Ad® ring and characterize the effect of the TV repair through assessment of right atrial size and right ventricular function. Additionally, this study will characterize the patient population for which a Contour 3D® or Tri-Ad® ring is chosen to repair TV insufficiency. Health status and adverse events (AE) will be assessed.</detailed_description>
