	<brief_title>Saw Palmetto: Symptom Management for Men During Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) affect from 75-80% of men undergoing radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of an inexpensive, non-toxic herbal supplement, Saw Palmetto, in treating these distressing symptoms. This trial will use a two group randomized design: either placebo or 1 of 3 doses of Saw Palmetto (320, 640, 960mg/day) to determine the maximum therapeutic dose (MTD), and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy. Within the Saw Palmetto arm, men will be allocated to 1 of the 3 the doses using the Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method and will continue with the same dose for the 12 week protocol. Safety data will consist of the Common Terminology for Adverse Events criteria for nausea, gastritis, and anorexia. Efficacy of the MTD will be evaluated by weekly symptom data and voiding diary. A pill diary will be used to ensure intervention fidelity. This study has the potential to reduce the incidence of LUTS for men during RT for cancer of the prostate and ultimately improve their quality of life during the acute phase of treatment.</detailed_description>
