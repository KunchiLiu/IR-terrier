	<brief_summary>Studies showed that infusion or injection of drugs and fluids results in introduction of microparticles into the bloodstream. These microparticles may cause organ damage and stimulate the immune system thus aggravating the underlying disease. Given that critically ill patients are characteristically suffering from a high disease severity and receive large amounts of fluids and drugs, they may be at particular risk of harm by these microparticles. In-line microfilters have been shown to clear microparticles from intravenous drugs and solutions. The investigators hypothesize that use of in-line microfilters reduce the days with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in adult critically ill patients.</brief_summary>
