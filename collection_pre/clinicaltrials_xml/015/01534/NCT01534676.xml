	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of transfusion of fresh and stored blood on patients. The investigators hope to test: - whether a similar effect (older stored blood is associated with worse outcomes) is seen in chronically transfused patients with hemoglobinopathies. This patient population will also allow the investigators to test whether iron- chelation therapy is beneficial in this setting. - whether washing or cryopreserving the red blood cells has any effect on this outcome. These findings may explain the immunomodulatory effects of older stored blood in patients and will help us develop safer transfusion products for patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Transfusion of Older Stored Red Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiologic studies suggest that older stored blood is associated with worse outcomes in certain hospitalized patients. Storage of red cells is associated with a storage lesion and the survival of transfused red cells decreases with increasing storage time, thus older blood is associated with an increased acute delivery of hemoglobin-iron to the reticuloendothelial system. The investigators have preliminary data in healthy human volunteers suggesting that delivery of a significant iron load to the reticuloendothelial system from aged red cells leads to the elaboration of a potentially toxic form of iron known as non-transferrin-bound iron.</detailed_description>
