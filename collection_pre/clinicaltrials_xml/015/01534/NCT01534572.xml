	<brief_summary>There is a constant exchange between the gut epithelium and lumen, including microbial interplay. The aim of this study was to investigate dietary test products on inflammatory proliferation markers in the gut, and thereby if the products had positive effects in the gut as well as in other parts of the body. The hypothesis was that the test products would reduce the inflammatory and proliferation activity of the gut epithelium by fermentation of normal food products and by converting dietary phenolic compounds into anti-inflammatory substances.</brief_summary>
