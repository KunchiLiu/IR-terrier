	<brief_summary>Casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) has anti-inflammatory properties in experimental rodent colitis and using human in vitro inflammation models. Its use as a food ingredient has proven safe and with no influence on dietary intake. We hypothesize that orally administered CGMP has a beneficial effect comparable to that of mesalazine in active distal ulcerative colitis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>GCMP has mainly been used as food additive in patients with specific dietary needs, i.e. in infant formulas, adipositas, or in patient with phenylketonuria. Due to its antiinflammatory properties we hypothesize that it may be used alone or along with conventional therapy in inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis.</detailed_description>
