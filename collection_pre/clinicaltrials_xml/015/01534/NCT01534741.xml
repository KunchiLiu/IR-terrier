	<brief_summary>Study design: Open, randomized, cross-over, monocentric, controlled, prospective Applied Medical Devices: FX CorDiax 60 (high-flux), FX 60 (high-flux) Patients: 30 adult chronic hemodialysis patients Treatment: Each patient will be treated by post-dilution online hemodiafiltration once with each dialyzer type. Study objectives: Intraindividual comparison of removal rate of urea, phosphate, ß2-microglobulin (ß2-m), myoglobin, prolactin, alpha1-microglobulin and alpha1-acidglycoprotein and of the albumin loss with different dialyzer membranes during post-dilution online hemodiafiltration. Primary variable: Removal rate of myoglobin Secondary variable: Removal rate of urea, phosphate, ß2-microglobulin (ß2-m), prolactin, alpha1-microglobulin and alpha1-acidglycoprotein Safety variable: Hematocrit, albumin loss Sample Size: 30 subjects</brief_summary>
