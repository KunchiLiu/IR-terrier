	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-interventional and open-label registry. The purpose of the registry is to document the long-term safety and effectiveness of renal denervation in a real world patient population with hypertension and gathering data for other diseases characterized by elevated sympathetic drive, such as diabetes mellitus type 2, renal insufficiency, etc. The Global Symplicity Registry will consecutively enroll 3000 patients who undergo the renal denervation procedure, from over 200 sites worldwide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Global SYMPLICITY Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This registry will collect data prospectively on patients that receive renal denervation and treatment will be applied according to the 'Intended Use' in the IFU. The treatment will be performed according to routine hospital practice and no additional tests are required specific to the registry. This registry will serve as a tool to collect clinical data in order to expand the knowledge base of safety, effectiveness and functionality of the Medtronic renal denervation system in a real world patient population. The key measures collected for the patients will be inclusive of, but are not limited to, blood pressure measurements, change in medications, eGFR changes (based on the MDRD formula) and clinical data pertaining to hypertension and individual disease state(s) characterized by elevated sympathetic drive. The inclusion criteria for the registry includes: - Age ≥ 18 years or minimum age as required by local regulations - The patient is an acceptable candidate for renal denervation based upon the Instructions For Use for the Medtronic renal denervation system. The procedure must be performed with an initial use, market-released Medtronic renal denervation catheter. - The patient or legal representative has been informed of the nature of the registry has consented to participate and authorized the collection and release of this medical information by signing a consent form ("Patient Informed Consent Form" or "Patient Data Release Authorization Form")</detailed_description>
