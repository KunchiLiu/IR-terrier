	<brief_summary>Objectives The CATCH trial (CArdiac cT in the treatment of acute CHest pain) is a prospective randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the clinical value of cardiac multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) as a first-line diagnostic strategy in patients with acute chest pain, compared to a conventional functional-based testing strategy. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted with acute chest pain of suspected cardiac origin, but normal electrocardiogram and biomarkers were randomized to evaluation with 320-MDCT coronary angiography (CT-guided group) or with standard bicycle exercise test and/or myocardial perfusion imaging - MPI (Control group). After one year, patients will be followed-up, with registration of clinical endpoints such as Cardiac death, myocardial infarction, need for revascularisation, admittance for heart related problems, sustained chest pain, live quality score, use of medication.</brief_summary>
