	<brief_summary>The investigators will be assessing the effect of Aged Garlic Extract on the coronary arteries. The investigators will enroll patients in a double blind study, where half the patients will receive placebo, and have the patients undergo a series of tests of plaque (CT scan of the heart, carotid ultrasound) and follow the patients on the drug or placebo and then repeat the tests and blood work at the end of one year. The investigators will assess if being on aged garlic extract adds any benefit to plaque in the coronary or neck arteries. The investigators will also assess the effect of aged garlic extract on markers of inflammation. Patients will receive free drug, free testing and be compensated, and learn more about their heart and neck arteries. if successful, more patients can use this drug to benefit their health. The harms include the radiation from the CT scan and the medication, which has mild side effects.</brief_summary>

The harms include the radiation from the CT scan and the medication, which has mild side effects. The study will perform advanced CT angiography at baseline and follow up along with carotid intimal media thickness testing, to see if plaque is slowed down by Aged Garlic Extract</detailed_description>
