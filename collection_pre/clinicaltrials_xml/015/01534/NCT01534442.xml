	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the role of transmission of vagal cholinerg for the GLP-1 potentiation of the glucose stimulated insulin secretion and the cephalic insulin response by using atropin administration. The hypothesis is that a great deal of the effects of GLP-1 is mediated via the nervous system and for this reason the investigators will research individuals with an intact nervous supply with and without atropin administration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>GLP-1 is a importent enterogastron and incretin hormone. Rapid degradation of GLP-1 by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) suggests that GLP-1 may act locally (through vagal afferents) before being degraded. We aimed to clarify the role of vagal innervation on the incretin effect.</detailed_description>
