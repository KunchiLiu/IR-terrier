	<brief_summary>The investigators are assessing the platelet function analysis of those who sustained significant head trauma while on aspirin or plavix and to assess if any qualitative difference is obtained if platelets are administered.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Function Analysis in Head Trauma: ASA/Plavix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The platelet function analyzer VerifyNow® P2Y12 uses ADP as agonists to induce platelet activation and ascertain the level of platelet function impaired by these medications. VerifyNow® Aspirin Assay utilizes arachidonic acid as the agonist to measure platelet function specifically along this pathway. Our research question for this study is as follows: Does the administration of desmopressin (DDAVP) and/or the transfusion of platelets in patients with head trauma reverse the platelet inhibition caused by Aspirin and/or Plavix? The investigators hypothesize that with the administration of platelets and/or DDAVP that there is a reversal of the inhibition.</detailed_description>
