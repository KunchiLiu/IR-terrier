	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial is studying how well aprepitant works in preventing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer. Antiemetic drugs, such as aprepitant may help lessen or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aprepitant in Preventing Nausea and Vomiting in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Discern the gastrointestinal toxicities associated with 5-FU (fluorouracil)/Gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) chemotherapy when combined with upper abdominal radiation therapy. II. Determine if the addition of prophylactic Aprepitant/5HT-3/Dexamethasone therapy to standard chemoradiation for patients with pancreatic cancer results in less nausea and vomiting when compared to historical controls. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the impact of prophylactic Aprepitant/5HT-3/Dexamethasone therapy on the impact of emesis on daily living, as measured using the MASCC Antiemesis (MAT) tool. OUTLINE: CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily on days 1-5 for 5.5 weeks. Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once weekly and either fluorouracil IV continuously or capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily on days 1-5. PROPHYLACTIC THERAPY: Beginning 1 hour before chemoradiotherapy, patients receive aprepitant PO on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 5.5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Two to four weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic therapy, patients without disease progression or a declining performance status receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
