	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a loading dose of two different statins on platelet reactivity (atorvastatin, metabolized by CYP3A4, and rosuvastatin, which is rather independent of this enzyme)in patients at least 5 days in therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (with or without an undergoing treatment with statins) undergoing PCI for coronary disease with chronic stable angina and/or evidence of inducible myocardial ischemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An initial assessment of platelet reactivity in response to the TRAP (thrombin receptor agonist), ADP and arachidonic acid (respectively, indicative of the response to clopidogrel and aspirin) will be performed with impedance aggregometry (MultiplateÂ® analyzer system). Patients with a increased residual platelet reactivity to ADP test (AUC &gt; 47) will receive a different antiplatelet therapy and will then be excluded from the study, the other will be randomized to 3 groups of treatment.</detailed_description>
