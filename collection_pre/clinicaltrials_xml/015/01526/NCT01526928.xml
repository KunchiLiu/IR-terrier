	<brief_summary>Rociletinib is a novel, potent, small molecule irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that selectively targets mutant forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while sparing wild-type (WT) EGFR. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profile of oral rociletinib; to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral rociletinib; to assess the safety and efficacy of rociletinib in previously treated NSCLC patients known to have the T790M EGFR mutation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Rociletinib (CO-1686) in Previously Treated Mutant Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remains the most common cancer worldwide with non-small cell lung cancer accounting for 85% of cases. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay of patients with NSCLC; however, survival rates remain low and toxicity is significant. Molecularly targeted therapies have proven to be superior to chemotherapy for NSCLC patients whose tumors have mutations in EGFR. Recent studies have established tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as the gold standard for treating EGFR-mutation-positive NCSLC. However, patients on TKIs eventually progress, and in approximately 50% of cases, progression is due to development of an additional mutation called T790M. There are currently no approved therapies for patients who progress on TKIs. Rociletinib may provide an effective therapy for a patient population with few alternative treatment options. Nonclinical data demonstrate that rociletinib inhibits T790M. It is anticipated that rociletinib may promote cell death in tumor cells with the T790M mutation, thus providing possible therapeutic benefit in patients who have developed T790M-mediated resistance to first generation TKIs. This is a two-part, open-label study of oral rociletinib administered daily in previously treated NSCLC patients who have documented evidence of an activating mutation in the EGFR gene and have failed treatment with an EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib. This study will include 2 parts: Phase 1 (completed enrolment): Dose-escalation Period with 21-day cycles; optional Treatment Extension Period starting on Day 22 Phase 2 (currently enrolling): Evaluation of activity and safety in patients with the T790M EGFR mutation who have: Cohort A - Progressed on EGFR directed therapy (irrespective of the number and order of previous lines of NSCLC therapy) or Cohort B - Progression on the first single agent EGFR directed therapy received and also had no more than one previous line of chemotherapy</detailed_description>

Nonstudy related surgical procedures less than or equal to 7 days prior to administration of rociletinib 10. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding 11. Refusal to use adequate contraception for fertile patients (females and males) for 12 weeks after the last dose of rociletinib 12. Presence of any serious or unstable concomitant systemic disorder incompatible with the clinical study 13. Any other reason the investigator considers the patient should not participate in the study</criteria>
