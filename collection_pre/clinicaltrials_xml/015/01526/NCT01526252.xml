	<brief_summary>The SCAR study uses a software program entitled QLAB, a proprietory program, developed by Philips Healthcare (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA). Literature on two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging (2DSTE) is growing, but data relevant to the population in the SCAR study is minimal. Accumulation of data relevant for a population of subjects will provide a set of normal values for interpretation of 2DSTE and minimize any influences from differences in data produced from different companies. This data may also assist other researchers investigate other cardiac diseases and abnormalities.</brief_summary>
