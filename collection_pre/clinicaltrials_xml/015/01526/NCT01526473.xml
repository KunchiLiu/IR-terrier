	<brief_summary>HER2 is a protein that is over expressed in 20-30% of breast cancers. It is also found associated with lung, gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Although there are existing therapies that can target HER2, most patients will eventually experience progression of their disease even though their cancer continues to express HER2. Therefore, new approaches are needed for treating tumors that express HER2. This clinical trial will use an investigational cancer vaccine called HER2 VRP or AVX901. The vaccine is based on a virus called Venezuelan equine encephalitis but it has been changed so it cannot cause active infection. Instead, the virus has been changed so it tells the immune system to attack cancer cells which make HER2. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of immunization with HER2 VRP in patients with advanced or metastatic malignancies that express HER2, and to test whether immunization will causes a strong immune system attack against the cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study To Evaluate The Antitumor Activity And Safety Of AVX901</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastatic breast cancer continues to account for more than 400,000 deaths yearly with HER2 positive breast cancers representing approximately one third of cases. Despite the efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer, progression of metastatic disease is inevitable. Lapatinib, when combined with capecitabine, improves time to progression in those with trastuzumab resistant disease, but lapatinib resistance also develops in the majority of these patients. HER2 overexpression is also reported in lung, gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, all of which are also in need of improved treatment options. Because HER2 continues to be expressed in patients with refractory disease, using an immune-targeting approach against HER2 remains a promising strategy. A number of clinical trials have confirmed the ability of vaccines to activate T cell and antibody responses against HER2. We propose using a propagation-defective, single-cycle, RNA replicon vector system that expresses HER2 as an antigen-specific cancer vaccine in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic malignancies expressing HER2. The vaccine was prepared from an attenuated strain of an alphavirus in which 3 of the 7 viral genes were removed and replaced with a HER2 gene to create a self-amplifying RNA (replicon) that expresses large amounts of HER2. The HER2 gene used includes the extracellular domain (ECD) and transmembrane (TM) regions of HER2 but not the ICD region. The HER2 ECDTM replicon is packaged into virus-like replicon particles (VRP) by providing the alphavirus structural proteins from separate RNA molecules. When VRP are used for immunization, the VRP infect individual cells and the replicon expresses HER2 which then induces an immune response. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of immunization with HER2 ECDTM VRP in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-expressing malignancies. The study will also monitor immune responses to HER2. Preliminary data on tumor response rate will also be collected.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria One of the following subgroups of patients with HER2 overexpression as follows: (i) Histologicallyconfirmed breast cancer that is metastatic or locally recurrent (7th Edition of the AJCC TNM System) and measurable and/or evaluable or nonmeasurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria with HER2/neu overexpression by immunohistochemistry (2+,3+) or FISH+ and progressive disease despite having received at least 1 prior FDA approved HER2 targeted (e.g. trastuzumab, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, TDM1, or lapatinib) (determined by their physician).* *Prior therapy has at least one of the following stipulations: Patients may have received neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with prior trastuzumab or lapatinib treatment Patients have received a a trastuzumab, trastuzumab + pertuzumab, or TDM1based therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease for a minimum of 9 weeks duration. Patients may have received more than 1 trastuzumabbased combination therapy. Patients have received a lapatinibbased therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease for a minimum of 9 weeks duration. Patients may have received more than 1 lapatinibbased combination therapy. (ii) Histologicallyconfirmed gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma that is metastatic or locally recurrent (7th Edition of the AJCC TNM System) and measurable or nonmeasurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria with HER2/neu overexpression by immunohistochemistry (2+,3+) or FISH+ and progressive disease despite having received at least 1 prior HER2 targeted therapy for a minimum of 9 weeks duration) (determined by their physician). or with previously documented HER2 overexpressing disease not being currently treated on a HER2 targeted therapy. (iii) Other histologically confirmed metastatic (stage IV) or locally recurrent (stage III) (7th Edition of the AJCC TNM System) malignancy with HER2/neu overexpression by immunohistochemistry (2+,3+) or FISH+. Because there are no other malignancies with FDA approved HER2 targeting therapies, no prior HER2 directed therapy will be required for this subgroup. However, patients will have been required to have at least 1 line of therapy with a known survival benefit for their malignancy. Adults at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form; Written informed consent obtained from the patient prior to performing any studyrelated procedures, including screening visits. however, CT scans, bone scans, MUGA, Echocardiogram, EKG,and labs performed as standard of care prior to signing consent can be used to fulfill eligibility requirements if they were performed within 8 weeks of the first dose of AVX901 (for the MUGA or echocardiogram) and within 4 weeksof the first dose of study drug for the remainder of the studies Resolution of all toxic side effects of prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgical procedures to NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade â‰¤ 1 (with the exception of grade 2 alopecia, grade 2 neuropathy and grade 2 fatigue); Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 80% or ECOG status of 0 or 1 ; Adequate hematologic function: (WBC = 2500 mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 10 mg/dl, platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3); Adequate renal and hepatic function (Cr &lt; 2.0 mg/dl; bilirubin &lt; 2 X ULN; AST &lt; 2.5 x ULN, ALT &lt; 2.5 X ULN); Normal cardiac function defined as either a MUGA or ECHO with LVEF in normal institutional range (MUGA 50%; ECHO 55%); Female patients must be of non childbearing potential or use effective contraception, e.g., use of oral contraceptives with an additional barrier method (since the study drug may impair the effectiveness of oral contraceptives), double barrier methods (diaphragm with spermicidal gel or condoms with contraceptive foam), DepoProvera, partner vasectomy, total abstinence, and willing to continue the effective contraception method for 30 days after the last dose of AVX901; Ability to return to Duke University Medical Center for adequate followup as required by this protocol; Current therapy with endocrine agents (tamoxifen, raloxifene, torimifene and all aromatase inhibitors) and/or bisphosphonates and/or RANKligand inhibitors is permitted. Exclusion criteria Except for patients on the concurrent HER2 targeted therapy (cohort 2) cohort, patients may not receive cytotoxic chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies (other than RANKligand inhibitors being used for bone protection), HER2 targeted therapy such as lapatinib, or radiation therapy in the 3 weeks before the first injection, during the injection period or for at least 2 weeks after the last injection. Patients may have received prior radiation including for brain metastases. History of autoimmune disease such as, but not restricted to, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis.
