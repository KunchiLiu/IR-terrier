	<brief_title>Contrast-Enhanced Intraoperative Ultrasound During Liver Surgery for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasound (CE-IOUS) during surgery for colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is entered in clinical practice. However, its impact seems to decrease with the improvement of preoperative imaging. Therefore, if CE-IOUS should be selectively or routinely applied remains unclear: a profile of patients who may benefit of CE-IOUS application has to be disclosed. The aim of this study is to define reliable criteria for a selective use of CE-IOUS during surgery for CLM. IOUS is performed using 3-6 MHz convex probe, and a 7.5-10 MHz micro convex probe. Staging is completed by CE-IOUS using the standard 3-6 MHz convex probe and the dedicated 1.88-3.76 MHz harmonic frequency probe. In all patients, 2.4 mL of sulphur-hexafluoride microbubbles (SonoVueÂ®, Bracco, Milan, Italy) are injected through a peripheral vein by the anesthesiologist. Ultrasound guidance is used to drive the dissection plane as previously described. Reference standards are histology and imaging at 6 months after surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses are performed. Statistical significance is set at P=0.05.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>consecutively enrolled patients with CLM who underwent surgery and during this procedure received IOUS and CEIOUS. each patient had at least 6 months of postoperative followup. patients who after IOUS and CEIOUS had explorative laparotomy only were excluded from the analysis since there was no histological confirmation of the tumor and most of them were lost to surgical followup</criteria>
