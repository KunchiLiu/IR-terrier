	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Adjuvant Chemotherapy With Gemcitabine Versus mFolfirinox to Treat Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN/ Evaluation criteria Main criterion: efficacy The main criterion is the disease-free survival at 3 years. Disease-free survival is the time delay between the date of randomization and the date at which the 1st cancer-related event such as local relapse, distant metastasis, a second cancer or death from any cause is observed. Patients without event at the time of anlaysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up visit. Locoregional relapse is a disease relapse occurring at the site of primary resection, in the pancreas or in the associated regional lymph nodes. Metastatic relapse is the distant disease recurrence involving any possible sites of relapse (peritoneal, hepatic, pulmonary, and distant lymph nodes). Secondary criteria Overall and specific survival Overall survival is the time delay between the date of randomization and the patient's death, irrespective of its cause. Patients who are still living at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up visit. Specific survival is the time delay between the date of randomization and the patient's death due to the treated cancer or a treatment-related complication. Metastasis-free survival Metastasis-free survival is the time delay between the date of randomization and the date of the 1st distant event occurrence (peritoneal, hepatic, pulmonary, and lymph nodes). Loco-regional events will be discarded and patients still living without metastasis at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up examination objectively assessing this type of event. Tolerance Patients evaluable for toxicity must have received at least one course or injection of the treatment.</detailed_description>
