	<brief_title>Proclear 1-D Multifocal Nondispensing Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to compare the subjective and objective vision. of Proclear® 1-D Multifocal test lenses (MF) with +0.75D overcorrection of the distance lens power in the nondominant eye compared to the Air Optix® Aqua Multifocal (CIBA VISION) contact lenses in low, Medium and High Add presbyopic subjects (+1.25 to +2.50 inclusive).</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Presbyopia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Be between 40 and 65 years of age (inclusive) Require a reading addition of +1.25 to +2.50D (inclusive) Spherical distance CL or spectacle prescription between +3.00D and 5.00D(inclusive) Spectacle cylinder less than or equal to 0.75D in both eyes. Currently has a reading add correction in their spectacle or CL habitual correction (e.g. if myope, removes distance correction to read) Normal binocularity (no amblyopia, no strabismus, no habitually uncorrected anisometropia ≥ 2.00D) Have a minimum 2 weeks soft contact lens experience Be able to wear the study lens (e.g. good fit is attained and acceptable subjective comfort and vision for the duration of the study) Able to read, comprehend and sign an informed consent Willing to comply with the wear and study visit schedule Monocular bestcorrected distance visual acuity ≥ 20/25 in each eye No gas permeable contact lens wear for 1 month prior to the study To be eligible for the study, each candidate must not present with any of the following Any active corneal infection, injury, inflammation, or ocular abnormality Systemic or ocular allergies, which might interfere with contact lens wear Systemic disease, which might interfere with contact lens wear Ocular disease, which might interfere with contact lens wear Pregnant or lactating Strabismus/amblyopia Habitually uncorrected anisometropia greater than or equal to 2.00 D Subjects who have undergone corneal refractive surgery Subjects with keratoconus or other severe corneal irregularity contraindicating lens wear</criteria>
