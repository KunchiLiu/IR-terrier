	<brief_summary>Dietary fibre seems to have a relevant role in body weight management. In an acute study the investigators found that high viscous-high gelling pectin increased feelings of satiety. The objective of this study is to study the effects of 2 weeks of supplementation of high gelling-high viscous fibre or a high gelling-high viscous non-fibre control on energy intake. The investigators do this by measuring the difference in ad libitum energy intake after 15 days of pectin or 15 days of control supplements. The investigators will further measure differences in 24h feelings of satiety, fasting blood glucose and insulin, fermentation and composition of microbiota.</brief_summary>
