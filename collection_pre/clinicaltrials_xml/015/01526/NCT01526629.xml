	<brief_summary>With the expansion of Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) primary prevention indications, the number of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) implants has increased significantly in the recent years. This has resulted in an increase of the number of follow-up (FU) to be performed and a growing workload for centers. Remote FU system such as the Medtronic Carelink system allows to check remotely the proper functioning of self evaluating devices and give informations of some clinical events. The objective of this study is to define which patients with a remote follow-up need additional onsite visit and to assess to which extent remote FU can be an alternative to onsite visit.</brief_summary>
