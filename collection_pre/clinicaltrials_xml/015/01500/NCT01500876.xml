	<brief_summary>Eligible lung cancer patients: Undergo pre-treatment 4D-CT study for treatment planning External Beam Radiation: standard fractionation (2Gy per day) or stereotactic body radiation therapy Evaluation: Repeat 4D-CT study at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment Primary objectives: To assess pre-treatment global and focal lung strain and correlate with changes post-treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study Using Four-Dimensional CT Imaging for Primary Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, single center, trial to assess and quantify lung strain using 4D-CT treatment planning scans. Patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer will be planned using 4D-CT to assess lung and tumor motion. Standard radiation treatment plans will to delivered based on tumor stage. Patients will be reassessed both clinically and radiographically using 4D-CT imaging at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment. Following the initial imaging time points, standard surveillance will be employed with clinical assessment and imaging at 3 month intervals for the first 2 years post-treatment.</detailed_description>
