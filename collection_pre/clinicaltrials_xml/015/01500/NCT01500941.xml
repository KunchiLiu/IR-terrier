	<brief_summary>Probiotics are suggested to have beneficial effects in atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment and prevention but their precise role is not yet clear. The aim of this randomized double blinded active treatment vs placebo study was to evaluate clinical efficacy of intake of a combination of two probiotics (Lactobacillus salivarius LS01 and Bifidobacterium breve BR03) for the treatment of adult AD patients. The rationale for the use of probiotics in the treatment of atopic dermatitis would be due to some experimental hypotheses: 1. The use of these microbial agents at an early age seems to play an important role in inducing immunity T type 1 (Th1) and inhibit the development of a Th2 response IgE mediated 2. the normal intestinal flora (including probiotics) would play an important role in inducing immunological tolerance 3. the hygiene hypothesis that the reduced bacterial environment would favour a type 2 response T and the development of allergic diseases</brief_summary>
