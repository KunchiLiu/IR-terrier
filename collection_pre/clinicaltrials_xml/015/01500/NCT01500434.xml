	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PROMUS Element™ Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System for the treatment of patients with up to 2 de novo atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions. The lesions can be longer than average-sized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The PLATINUM Clinical Trial to Assess the PROMUS Element Stent System for Treatment of Long De Novo Coronary Artery Lesions (PLATINUM LL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The wide-spread use of drug-eluting stents (DES) has evolved as standard of care in de novo lesions. The proposed study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PROMUS Element for the treatment of de novo atherosclerotic lesions in native coronary arteries. The study design is consistent with the draft guidance for industry titled, "Coronary Drug-Eluting Stents - Nonclinical and Clinical Studies" (March 2008). During the trial, thienopyridines must be administered according to the 2007 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) guidelines, which recommended that clopidogrel (75 mg daily) or ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily) be prescribed after stent implantation for at least 6 months in all patients, and for at least 12 months in patients who are not at high risk of bleeding. For sites in the United States, the use of prasugrel is not allowed as part of the PLATINUM Clinical Trial. For sites in other countries, prasugrel may be prescribed according to its approved dosing in countries in which it is available. For patients taking aspirin daily a loading dose is recommended; for patients who have not been taking aspirin daily, aspirin must be administered as a loading dose. Patients continue to take aspirin indefinitely to reduce the risk of thrombosis. This PLATINUM Long Lesion study is a sub-trial associated with the PLATINUM Workhorse Randomized Controlled Trial, which is registered under NCT00823212.</detailed_description>

Target lesion must be in a major coronary artery or branch with visually estimated stenosis &gt;=50% and &lt;100% with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow &gt;1. Patient has clinical symptoms and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with acute MI Patient has had a known diagnosis of recent MI (ie, within 72 hours prior to index procedure) and has elevated enzymes at time of index procedure as follows. Patients are excluded if any of the following criteria are met at time of the index procedure. If CKMB &gt;2× upper limit of normal (ULN), the patient is excluded regardless of CK Total. If CKMB is 12× ULN, the patient is excluded if the CK Total is &gt;2× ULN. If CK Total/CK MB are not used and Troponin is, patients are excluded if the following criterion is met at time of index procedure. Troponin &gt;1× ULN with at least one of the following. Patient has ischemic symptoms and ECG changes indicative of ongoing ischemia (eg, &gt;1 mm ST segment elevation or depression in consecutive leads or new left bundle branch block [LBBB]); Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG; or Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Note: For patients with unstable angina or patients who have had a recent MI, CK Total/CK MB (or Troponin if CK Total/CK MB are not used) must be documented prior to enrolling/randomizing the patient.
