	<brief_summary>Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) often require blood pressure support of vasoactive drugs such as amines. Finger necrosis (so called "blue toe syndrome") is a well documented phenomena with incidence reaching as high as 60% in patients receiving vasopressin. Botulinum toxin is a known muscle relaxant used for a variety of medical application. Recently, several reports have demonstrated its effect in vasospastic disorders. It has also been in mice that when administered locally it has a local vasodilatory effect. The goal of this experiment is to compare the effect of Botulinum Toxin administered locally on amine induced finger necrosis.</brief_summary>
