	<criteria>Subject has symptomatic or asymptomatic moderate (2+) or severe (34+) mitral regurgitation. Subject has an ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 30%. Subject is of legal age (≥18 years old). Subject is planned to undergo surgical repair or replacement of the mitral valve for symptomatic or asymptomatic posterior leaflet mitral prolapse. Subject requires a complex mitral valve repair or has isolated anterior prolapse. Subject has mitral valve stenosis in which the annulus opening is &lt;10mm. Subject has valve disease other than mitral which requires surgical intervention. Subject requires a concomitant procedure. Subject has a preexisting prosthetic valve in any position. Subject had stenting or PCI within 6 months before the planned procedure, or is anticipated to require stenting or PCI within 6 months postprocedure. Subject has calcification of the mitral leaflets or annulus which in the medical opinion of the surgical investigator would limit repair and /or implantation of the investigational device. Subject has renal insufficiency or is on chronic dialysis. Subject has had a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the past 6 months. Subject has a history of endocarditis or has active endocarditis. Subject has a history of autoimmune disease. Subject has significant known carotid artery disease. Subject has an aortomitral angle of &lt;110 degrees. Subject has hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM's Disease).</criteria>
