	<brief_summary>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of short RNAs which have shown to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers. Data of miRNA expression in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is very limited and microarray based genome wide miRNA expression profiles of cSCC have not been investigated so far.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microarray Analysis of microRNA Expression Profiles in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with cutaneous SCC were enrolled in the present study. Tumor biopsies were taken from the center of the tumor. Adjacent healthy skin was biopsied as a control (intraindividual control). miRNA expression profiles of specimen were detected by microarray miRNA expression profiling. Microarray results were confirmed by TaqMan real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).</detailed_description>
