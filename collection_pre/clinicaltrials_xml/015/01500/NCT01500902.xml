	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if testing patients for endothelial dysfunction will help identify which patients are more likely at risk to have another heart attack in the future. Study participants will undergo mental stress testing while at the same time being connected to a device that measures endothelial function via the Endopat device. These same participants will also undergo a sleep study via the Watchpat device.</brief_summary>
