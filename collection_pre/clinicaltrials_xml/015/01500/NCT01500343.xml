	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Probiotic Saccharomyces Boulardii Use in Chronic Heart Failure Patients. Estudo PROICA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cardiointestinal syndrome has been described in heart failure patients, with morphologic and functional intestinal disorders, increased enteropathogenic bacteria concentration, bacterial translocation and inflammatory activation, thus contributing for clinical worsening and progression of the disease. In clinical practice, probiotics has been used in several different conditions, as inflammatory bowel diseases, acute and antibiotic-associated diarrhea, food allergies, and cancer, showing benefits in inflammation and reducing bacterial translocation. However, the use of probiotics in heart failure has never been described.</detailed_description>
