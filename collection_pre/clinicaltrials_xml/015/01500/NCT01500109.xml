	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to determine whether acetaminophen is an effective pain reliever for primary cleft palate repair in children and possesses opioid sparing effects. Additionally, the investigators will determine if patients who receive acetaminophen have less opioid related side-effects. The study will have three study groups based on whether the patient receives OfirmevÂ® and opioids (Fentanyl and Morphine), oral acetaminophen elixir and opioids (Fentanyl and Morphine), or opioids (Fentanyl and Morphine) alone. Total opioid (Fentanyl and Morphine) consumption will be tracked for the intraoperative period and 24 hours after surgery for all patients within the study and converted to morphine equivalents.</brief_summary>
