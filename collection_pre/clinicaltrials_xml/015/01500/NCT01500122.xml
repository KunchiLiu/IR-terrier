	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the study are: - To compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of RhuDex administered as two novel oral formulations - To identify the lead formulation and optimise the pharmacokinetic profile by modifying the quantitative composition of that formulation - Optional: To assess the intravenous pharmacokinetics of RhuDex following administration of an IV microtracer of [14C]RhuDex</brief_summary>
