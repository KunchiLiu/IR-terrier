	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, prospective, multi-center monitored trial recruiting patients with critical limb ischemia and with one or more lesions in the arteries below the knee. The immediate and long-term (up to 12 months) outcome of the PROMUS ELEMENT Everolimus-Eluting Stent System (Boston Scientific) and the PROMUS ELEMENT PLUS Everolimus-Eluting Stent System (Boston Scientific) will be evaluated. In 2 Belgian centers, 3 German centers and 1 New Zealand center a total of 70 patients will be recruited. Primary endpoint is primary patency at 12 months, defined as absence of restenosis (≥50% stenosis) or occlusion within the originally treated lesion based on angiography.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>General Patient presenting with rest pain or minor tissue loss (Rutherford class 4 or 5) Patient is willing to comply with specified follow‐up evaluations at the specified times Patient is &gt;18 years old Patient understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent, prior to enrolment in the study Patient has a projected life‐expectancy of at least 12 months The treating physician consider the patient eligible for below‐the‐knee treatment with the PROMUS ELEMENT Stent (Boston Scientific) and PROMUS ELEMENT PLUS Stent (Boston Scientific) Male, infertile female, or female of child bearing potential practicing an acceptable method of birth control with a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study procedure Angiographic Single or multiple lesions with minimally 70% stenosis in one or more infrapopliteal arteries, including the tibiofibular trunk A maximum of two focal target lesions in one or more infrapopliteal vessels Length of lesion is maximally 40 mm, allowing maximally 2 planned stents to be implanted Target vessel diameter visually estimated to be &gt;2.5mm and &lt;4.0mm Guidewire and delivery system successfully traversed lesion General Patient refusing treatment Previously implanted stent in the artery to be treated Failed PTA of target lesion/vessel less than 3 months prior to study procedure The reference segment diameter is not suitable for the available stent design Untreated flow‐limiting inflow lesions Perioperative unsuccessful ipsilateral percutaneous vascular procedure to treat inflow disease just prior to enrollment Any previous surgery in the target vessel (including prior ipsilateral crural bypass) Aneurysm in the target vessel Patient presents with renal failure, evidenced by a serum creatinine level &gt;2.0mg/dL Patient presents with platelet levels above or below normal range Non‐atherosclerothic disease resulting in occlusion (e.g. embolism, Buerger's disease, vasculitis) Severe medical comorbidities (untreated CAD/CHF, severe COPD, metastatic malignancy, dementia, etc) or other medical condition that would preclude compliance with the study protocol or 1‐year life expectancy Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study limb or non‐study limb Septicemia or bacteremia Any previously known coagulation disorder, including hypercoagulability Contraindication to anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy Known allergies to stent or stent components Known allergy to contrast media that cannot be adequately pre‐medicated prior to the study procedure Patient with known hypersensitivity to heparin, including those patients who have had a previous incidence of heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II Currently participating in another clinical research trial Angiographic evidence of intra‐arterial thrombus or atheroembolism from inflow treatment Target lesion access not performed by transfemoral approach.</criteria>
