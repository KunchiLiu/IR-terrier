	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, active-controlled study of rolapitant in subjects receiving MEC. Rolapitant or placebo will be administered prior to the initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1 with granisetron and dexamethasone. Subjects will record all events of emesis and the use of rescue medication for established nausea and/or vomiting, and will indicate the severity of nausea they experienced in each of the previous 24 hours in the Nausea and Vomiting (NV) Subject Diary prior to the MEC administration through Day 6 in Cycle 1. Health-related quality of life will be measured by the FLIE Questionnaire on Day 6 of Cycle 1. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examination, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values. All subjects are expected to complete Cycle 1 and will have the option of participating in up to five additional cycles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph 3 Safety/Efficacy Study of Rolapitant for Prevention of CINV in Subjects Receiving Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, active-controlled study of rolapitant in subjects receiving MEC. Rolapitant or placebo will be administered orally 1-2 hours prior to the initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1. Granisetron (2 mg PO) and dexamethasone (20 mg PO) will be administered approximately 30 minutes before initiation of chemotherapy. Subjects will continue to receive granisetron (2 mg daily) on Days 2 and 3. Subjects will record all events of emesis and the use of rescue medication for established nausea and/or vomiting, and will indicate the severity of nausea they experienced in each of the previous 24 hours in the Nausea and Vomiting (NV) Subject Diary prior to the MEC administration through Day 6 in Cycle 1. Health-related quality of life will be measured by the FLIE Questionnaire on Day 6 of Cycle 1. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values including BUN and creatinine. All subjects are expected to complete Cycle 1 and will have the option of participating in up to five additional cycles. Blood samples may be collected and stored in this study and may be analyzed for future biomarker research related to safety and efficacy.</detailed_description>
