	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this randomised clinical trial (RCT) is to compare, in terms of disability and pain, an intervention targeting the opening of intervertebral foramens to a conventional physiotherapy intervention, in patients presenting acute or subacute cervical radiculopathies. Based on biomechanical principles, the investigators hypothesis is that the intervention targeting the opening of intervertebral foramens will be significantly more effective in reducing pain and disability than the conventional physiotherapy intervention. This study is double-blind RCT that will allow the comparison of patients with a cervical radiculopathy randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will receive a 4-week rehabilitation program targeting the opening of intervertebral foramen, and the second group will receive a 4-week conventional rehabilitation program. Thirty-six subjects will be recruited from participating medical and physiotherapy clinics in the Quebec City area (Canada) and will be evaluated at baseline, at the end of the program and four weeks following the end of the program. The primary outcome measure will be the validated Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire and other secondary measures will include the QuickDASH questionnaire, a numerical pain rating scale, cervicothoracic mobility and patients' perceived global rating of change.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Mobilizations and Exercises Targeting the Opening of Intervertebral Foramens Following Cervical Radiculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical radiculopathy is a common form of neck pain and has been shown to lead to severe disability. Clinical rehabilitation approaches for cervical radiculopathies commonly include exercise and manual therapy interventions targeting the opening of intervertebral foramen but evidence regarding their effectiveness is scarce. This double-blind randomised clinical trial will allow the comparison, in terms of pain and disability, of patients presenting a cervical radiculopathy which will have been randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups: the first group (n = 18) will receive a 4-week rehabilitation program targeting the opening of intervertebral foramen, the second group (n = 18) will receive a 4-week conventional rehabilitation program. Participants will be evaluated on three separate occasions: at baseline (week 0), at the end of the 4-week program (week 4), and four weeks following the end of the program (week 8).</detailed_description>
