	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Daily Pulse Lavage Therapy in Chronic Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulse lavage irrigation is an effective method of cleaning both acute and chronic wounds. The major drawback to pulse irrigation is that it is extremely messy and can easily contaminate the patient's surroundings, putting other patients and the person operating the device at risk. In order to obtain the benefits of pulse lavage, we have created a device that will contain the water spray from the lavage and protect both the patient and their surroundings. Due to the fact that frequent (multiple times daily) pulse lavage therapy has not been possible previously, it is unknown how effectively serial pulse lavage irrigation reduces bacterial counts. This study evaluates the effectiveness of serial pulse lavage therapy in decreasing bacterial counts in chronic wounds.</detailed_description>
