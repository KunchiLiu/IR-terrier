	<brief_summary>Present trial is the third study that in combination with two completed studies (one being a trial in hepatic resection surgery also comparing TachoSil® and Surgicel® Original) targeted toward providing clinical safety and efficacy data to support extending the current label of TachoSil® to a general hemostasis indication across several surgical procedures and organ systems in the USA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of TachoSil® Versus Surgicel® Original for the Secondary Hemostatic Treatment of Needle Hole Bleeding in Vascular Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TachoSil®. TachoSil® was used to treat people undergoing scheduled subacute vascular surgery. This study looked at how well TachoSil® patches stopped bleeding at the surgical site compared to Surgicel® Original patches. The study enrolled 150 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two open label treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio: - TachoSil® - Surgicel® Original This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was approximately 6 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including safety follow-up visits at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main Planned elective and subacute procedures with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft including at least one expected endtoside anastomosis of a PTFE graft to the femoral artery (e.g. femoralfemoral crossover, aorto(bi)femoral, axillo(bi)femoral, femoropopliteal, femorocrural bypass grafting), a PTFE patch angioplasty of the femoral artery, or an endtoside anastomosis of a PTFE graft to an upper extremity artery in connection with arteriovenous bypass grafting for dialysis access. The evaluation site for the planned femoral anastomosis must be a de novo site. The participant must be heparinized during surgery. Intraoperatively (before randomization) The participant has a need for secondary hemostatic treatment Verification of the evaluation site being a de novo site Verification of the surgical procedure performed as being either an endtoside or PTFE patch angioplasty. Main Thrombolytic therapy administered within 12 hours before surgery (e.g. the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) Alteplase). Liver cirrhosis. Intraoperatively (before randomization) Severe bleeding at the anastomosis of the arterial bypass using PTFE graft prosthesis or the PTFE patch angioplasty No bleeding (dry surgical field) at the targeted application area Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) Application of topical hemostatic material including fibrin sealant/glue on the evaluation site.</criteria>
