	<brief_summary>Conventional luteal phase support after human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) triggering in women undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) provides adequate pregnancy rates and live birth rates, but Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) still occurs in 1-3% of the patients. If gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) are used instead of hCG, OHSS does not occur, but clinical results are somehow diminished. By testing different luteal support protocols on women undergoing GnRHa triggering, the investigators aim to find out which protocol resembles the most the gene expression profile observed after hCG triggering and conventional luteal phase support, in order to choose it as the most adequate in terms of endometrium receptivity and safety (OHSS incidence).</brief_summary>
