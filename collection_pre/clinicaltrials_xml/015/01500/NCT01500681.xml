	<brief_summary>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that is associated with autoantibodies to aquaporin-4. Treatment options for prevention of clinical relapses of NMO include immunosuppressive medications. Plasma exchange (PLEX) is commonly used as a rescue therapy for NMO relapses but ongoing, regular PLEX procedures (maintenance PLEX) is sometimes used to prevent relapses. This observational registry will record feasibility, tolerability, safety, and preliminary efficacy data regarding maintenance PLEX for NMO.</brief_summary>
