To determine the distribution of candidate primary patient‚Äêreported outcome measures, including time to resumption of sexual activity, global satisfaction with sex life, sexual function and anxiety in this particular population. III. To establish the prevalence of patient recall of the intervention to determine the most effective time at which to deliver the intervention. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive standard counseling at both the pre-operative and 2-4 week post-operative visit. ARM II: Patients receive standard counseling at the pre-operative visit and the scripted sexual health intervention at the 2-4 week post-operative visit. ARM III: Patients receive standard counseling and the scripted sexual health intervention at the pre-operative visit and standard counseling at the 2-4 week post-operative visit.
