	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2 study. The study will evaluate the tolerability, safety and activity of AMG 337 in Asian subjects who have advanced solid tumors (Phase 1) or subjects with MET amplified tumors with a focus on gastric/gastroesophageal junction/esophageal adenocarcinoma (Phase 2).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Study Evaluating AMG 337 in Asian Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, single arm, open-label study to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AMG 337 in solid tumors. In the Phase 1, approximately 3 to 45 subjects enrolled in a 3+3+3 dose escalation scheme evaluating two dose levels. In the Phase 2, approximately 140 subjects will be enrolled to either Cohort 1 (subjects with MET amplified /gastroesophageal junction/esophageal (G/GEJ/E) adenocarcinoma with measurable tumor) or Cohort 2 (subjects with MET amplified solid tumors with measurable tumor and subjects with MET amplified G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma with non-measurable tumor). All subjects will self-administer AMG 337 daily until disease progression or other protocol specified end of treatment criteria are met. Tumor assessment by RECIST 1.1 will be followed during study treatment. Tumor tissue, biomarkers, pharmacokinetics and Patient Reported Outcomes will be assessed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Able to self administer daily AMG 337 as a whole capsule Male or female 20 years of age or over Phase 1: Subjects must have a pathologically confirmed, advanced solid tumor for which the subjects have received prior therapy for advanced disease, for which no standard therapy exists, or the subject refuses standard therapy. Phase 2: Subjects must have a pathologically confirmed, advanced G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma (cohort 1) or other solid tumor (cohort 2) for which the subjects have received prior therapy for advanced disease, or for which no standard therapy exists, or the subject refuses standard therapy. Tumor MET amplified by protocolspecified centralized testing (phase 2 only). Phase 1: Measurable or nonmeasurable disease per RECIST v1.1 Phase 2: Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 guidelines. Cohort 2 may include subjects with advanced MET amplified G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma with nonmeasurable tumor per RECIST v1.1. (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2 Other protocol defined inclusion criteria may apply. Known central nervous system metastases. Subject is a candidate for curative surgery or definitive chemoradiation. Peripheral edema &gt; grade 1. Subjects who have persistent gastric outlet obstruction, complete dysphagia or are dependent upon jejunostomy for feeding. Significant gastrointestinal disorder(s) that in the opinion of the Investigator may influence drug absorption. Currently receiving any antitumor treatments, or less than 14 days prior to enrollment since ending antitumor treatment. Prior treatment with small molecule inhibitors of the MET pathway. Other protocol defined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
