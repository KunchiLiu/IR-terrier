	<brief_title>Nitrous Oxide for Pain Management of First Trimester Surgical Abortion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has important implications in the field of pain management for surgical abortion. While NO is administered in some outpatient clinics for surgical abortion, its effect on pain has not been systematically studied in a randomized controlled trial in women undergoing first trimester surgical abortion under local/oral analgesia. Expanding pain management options for women undergoing abortion confers significant public health benefits.</detailed_description>
