	<brief_summary>This study is intended to gather short (Pre-operative to 4-years) and mid-term (5-years) information regarding the performance and safety of the commercially available 36mm CERAMAXÂ® Ceramic on Ceramic Total Hip System from a cohort of new study subjects that were not previously involved in the IDE study for this device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ceramic-on-Ceramic (COC) 36mm Acetabular Bearing Insert Post Approval Study-New Subjects (COC36mmPAS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 10 (up to 5 original IDE + 5 new sites) A prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized, multicenter study. Subjects will be seen for a clinic visit pre-operatively at the time of consent, (-90 days to surgery) and then at post-operatively at 6 weeks (1-92 days), 1 year (275-455 days), 2 years (640-820 days) and 3 years (1005-1185days), 4 years (1370-1550 days), and a minimum of 5 years (1825- 2919 days). Data collected will include: Pre-operatively subject history and demographics; Operative and device details; and Post-operatively Harris HIp scores, Subject Hip Outcomes, and Adverse Events. In order to optimize mid-term follow-up compliance, site personnel are permitted to contact the study subject in the 3 and 4 year intervals by phone (in place of a clinic visit) to assess the current status of the hip.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females between 21 75 at the time of surgery. Individuals, who in the opinion of the investigator, are suitable candidates for primary total hip replacement using the devices specified in this protocol. Individuals with noninflammatory degenerative joint disease (NIDJD) or any of its composite diagnoses of osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, and posttraumatic arthritis. Individuals who are willing and able to provide informed patient consent for participation in the study; Individuals who are willing and able to return for followup as specified by the study protocol; and Individuals who are willing and able to complete the Subject Hip Outcomes questionnaire as specified by the study protocol. Skeletally immature patients (tibial and femoral epiphyses not closed) Evidence of active infections that may spread to other areas of the body (e.g.,osteomyelitis, pyogenic infection of the hip joint, overt infection, urinary tract infection, etc.) The presence of any known neoplastic (tumorcausing) or metastatic (spread of cancerous cells) disease Significant neurologic or musculoskeletal disorders or diseases that may adversely affect gait, weight bearing or postoperative recovery (e.g., muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis) Presence of highly communicable disease(s) that may limit followup (e.g., immunocompromised conditions, hepatitis, active tuberculosis, etc.) Any condition that may interfere with postoperative recovery (e.g., Paget's disease, Charcot's disease) Inadequate bone stock to support the device (e.g., severe osteopenia orosteoporosis) Poor skin coverage around the hip joint Use in patients with known allergies to the implant materials Marked atrophy (muscle and/or tissue loss) or deformity in the upper femur such as a birth defect affecting the leg bones. Inflammatory degenerative joint disease (like rheumatoid arthritis) Subject has participated in an IDE/IND clinical investigation, other than the COC28/COC36 IDE or PAS for their contralateral hip, with an investigational product in the last three months. Subject is currently involved in a personal injury litigation, medicallegal or worker's compensation claims. Subject is a known drug or alcohol abuser or has a psychological disorder that could affect their ability to comply with protocol procedures and/or subjectcompleted questionnaires. The Subject is a woman who is pregnant or lactating. The Subject has a medical condition with less than 2 years of life expectancy.</criteria>
