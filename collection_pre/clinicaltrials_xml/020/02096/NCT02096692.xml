	<brief_title>ProMRI Study of the Iforia ICD System (Phase C)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The following initial inclusion criteria must be met for a subject to be enrolled and considered for the MRIprocedure: Age greater than or equal to 18 years Able and willing to complete MRI testing Able to provide written informed consent Available for followup visit at the study site Implanted with an ICD System consisting only of an Iforia DRT and Linoxsmart S 65 / Linoxsmart SD 65/18 with Setrox S 53 atrial lead or Iforia VRT DX and Linoxsmart S DX 65/15 or Linoxsmart S DX 65/17. ICD implanted pectorally All ICD system components implanted, repositioned, or exchanged at least 5 weeks prior to enrollment Underlying rhythm identifiable during sensing test All pacing thresholds are measureable and are less than or equal to 2.0 V @ 0.4 ms (Criterion does not apply to atrial pacing threshold for subjects with an Iforia DRT that have AF and are permanently programmed to VVI and for subjects with an Iforia VRT DX) Ventricular sensing is measurable and &gt;6.5mV Absence of phrenic nerve stimulation at 5.0V and 1.0 ms Pacing impedance is between 200 and 1500 ohm Shock Impedance is between 30 and 90 ohm Able and willing to use the CardioMessenger II At the preMRI procedure, the following procedurerelated criteria must be met for the subject to undergo the MRI scan: Absence of phrenic nerve stimulation at 5.0V @ 1.0 ms |pacing threshold at PreMRI followup pacing threshold at baseline| â‰¤ 0.5 V (ICD Lead Only) All pacing thresholds are measureable and are less than or equal to 2.0 V @ 0.4 ms (Criterion does not apply to atrial pacing threshold for subjects with an Iforia DRT that have AF and are permanently programmed to VVI and for subjects with an Iforia VRT DX.) Ventricular sensing is measurable and &gt;6.5mV The ICD system has been implanted for at least six weeks. Subject did not have an ICD or lead explant, exchange or reposition in the previous 6 weeks. All lead pacing impedances are between 200 and 1500 ohm Shock impedance is between 30 and 90 ohm Battery status is at least 30% of capacity</criteria>
