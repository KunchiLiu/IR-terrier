	<brief_summary>The Ibuprofen - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) - Safety trial investigates tolerability and feasibility of "small molecule" (Ibuprofen) mediated Rho-inhibition as putative neuroprotective, plasticity-enhancing and neurorestaurative intervention. The primary safety analysis is based on the incidence of severe gastrointestinal bleedings. In addition, the feasibility of recruitment procedure, and oral administration of the compound within the multidisciplinary setting of acute intensive medical care will be explored. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of Ibuprofen under the condition of acute motor complete SCI will be investigated. Secondary endpoints will permit preliminary statements about effects on neuropathic pain, spasticity, and neurological function.</brief_summary>
