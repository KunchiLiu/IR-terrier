	<brief_title>Sevoflurane Versus Desflurane for Catheter-related Bladder Discomfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanism of catheter-related bladder discomfort is thought to be related to the muscarinic receptor. The volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane and desflurane are known to block the muscarinic receptor in different ways. We want to evaluate the efficacy of the sevoflurane and desflurane for the prevention of catheter-related bladder discomfort.</detailed_description>
