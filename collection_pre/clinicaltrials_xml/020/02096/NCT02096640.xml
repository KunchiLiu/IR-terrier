	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to examine if there are differences in postoperative inflammation following percutaneous dilatation tracheostomy versus surgical tracheostomy in intensive care unit patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Inflammation and Recovery After Tracheostomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Are there differences between the two arms in plasma concentrations of inflammatory mediators (TNF-alfa, interleukin 1, 6, 10) at 24 hrs following the start of the surgical procedure? Are there differences between the two arms in the incidence of postoperative complications (i.e. bleeding, incidence of stomal infections, tracheal tube dislocation, airway compromisation), postoperative pulmonary infection (during the stay in the ICU) and pulmonary function (FEV1, dynamic complicance, oxygen demand, time to weaning off the ventilator: all measured daily during the ICU-stay), postoperative mobilization (time to mobilization to sitting, standing and walking, respectively)?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients in whom a tracheostomy is indicated (i.e. anticipated need of mechanical ventilation for &gt;7 days or anticipated risk for complicated extubation, e.g. anatomical signs of a compromised airway, reduced level of consciousness. Adults over 18 years. Participants who are suitable for both surgery techniques. Children under 18 years, pregnancy and participants with anatomical defects that exclude them from percutaneous dilatation tracheostomy.</criteria>
