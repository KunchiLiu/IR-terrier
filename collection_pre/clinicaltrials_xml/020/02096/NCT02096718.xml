	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the influence of moderate to severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose afatinib in comparison to a control group with normal renal function. The assessment of safety and tolerability will be an additional objective of this trial and will be evaluated by descriptive statistics.</brief_summary>
