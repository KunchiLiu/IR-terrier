	<brief_summary>This study is intended to gather medium (5- to 7-years) and long-term (minimum 8- to 10-years) information regarding the performance and safety of the commercially available 36mm CERAMAXÂ® Ceramic on Ceramic (COC) Total Hip System from a cohort of study subjects that were previously enrolled in the IDE study. (COC = 36mm ceramic acetabular bearing insert component that articulates with a ceramic femoral head in the COC total hip replacement system)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up to five (5) sites will participate. These sites participated in the IDE study and will continue subject follow-up. Subjects from the original IDE study (COC 36mm investigational subjects only) will be seen for a clinic visit at the time of consent (First visit at approximately 5 to 7 years post-op or 1825- 2919 days), and at minimum 8 years (2920-3649 days) , and minimum 10 years (3650-4015 days). Harris Hip evaluation, radiographic evaluation, subject hip-outcomes, and adverse event information will be collected at each visit. If a subject is not willing or able to return for a clinical and radiographic follow-up for either the minimum 8 year evaluation or the minimum 10 year evaluation, then a telephone interview may be utilized for the purpose of determining device survivorship.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who were previously enrolled in the COC 36 IDE study; Individuals who are willing and able to provide informed patient consent for participation in the study; Individuals who are willing and able to return for followup as specified by the study protocol; and Individuals who are willing and able to complete the Subject Hip Outcomes questionnaire as specified by the study protocol. In the opinion of the Investigator, the individual does not qualify if there are any concerns with the ability to follow the protocol specified evaluations. Any component of the primary total hip was previously revised.</criteria>
