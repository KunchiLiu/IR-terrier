	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' Infanrix hexa vaccine when administered to healthy infants as primary vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, co-administered with Prevnar and Rotarix with a booster dose of GSK Biologicals' Infanrix and Hiberix vaccines at 15-18 months of age.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects' parent(s)/ LAR(s) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply, with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 6 and 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination. Born fullterm (i.e. after a gestation period of 37 weeks to less than 42 completed weeks [259 to 293 days]). Written informed consent obtained from parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Infants who have not received a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine or those who have received only 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine administered at least 30 days prior to enrolment. Child in care Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccines, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting from 30 days before the first vaccination until 30 days after Dose 3 (Epoch 001, primary vaccination) and from 30 days before the booster Dose 4 until 30 days after booster Dose 4 (Epoch 002, booster vaccination), i.e. the end of the study: Inactivated influenza and hepatitis A vaccines are allowed throughout the study. Routine administration(s) of vaccines are allowed from 30 days after the last dose of primary vaccination until 30 days before the booster dose and after postbooster blood sampling. Routine administration of measlesmumpsrubella vaccine, varicella, pneumococcal vaccines are allowed from 30 days after last dose of primary vaccine until 30 days before booster dose and from postbooster blood sampling, as well as according to the recommended immunization schedule in US. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). History of Hib, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcal, rotavirus, poliovirus and hepatitis B diseases. Previous vaccination against Hib, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcus, rotavirus and/or poliovirus; more than one previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines (including yeast). Hypersensitivity to latex. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurological disorders including seizures. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period. History of intussusception or of any uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose the infant to intussusception. History of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID). Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥38.0°C /100.4°F by any route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be rectal for Epoch 001 and axillary for Epoch 002. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.</criteria>
