	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of "sampling" of smoking cessation medications (nicotine patches and lozenges) among smokers seen in primary care settings. Half of study participants will be provided with samples of medication, to use however they wish; the other half will not be provided with these samples. All smokers will be advised to quit through routine contact with their physician. After the primary care contact, all participants will be contacted by phone for three brief follow-up interviews, which will involve answering questionnaires about their smoking habits.</brief_summary>
