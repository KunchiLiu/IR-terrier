	<brief_summary>Vancomycin is already used for decades in neonates. However, there are remaining questions concerning vancomycin disposition in this population. The purpose of this study is first of all to perform a paired analysis of serum vancomycin concentrations using an immunoassay versus a reference liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Secondly, we aim to determine vancomycin protein binding and its covariates in neonates.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exploration of vancomycin disposition in neonates: Objective 1: Paired analysis of (total) serum vancomycin concentrations in neonates using the currently available immunoassay (Cobas c702) versus a reference liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS). Objective 2: The determination of vancomycin protein binding and its covariates in neonates.</detailed_description>
