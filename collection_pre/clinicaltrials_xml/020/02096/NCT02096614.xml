	<brief_summary>Following pre-treatment with cyclophosphamide and/or fludarabine, MAGE-A4-specific TCR gene transduced T lymphocytes are transferred to the patients with MAGE-A4-expressing solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigator Initiated Phase 1 Study of TBI-1201</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following pre-treatment with cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with fludarabine, MAGE-A4-specific TCR gene transduced T lymphocytes are transferred to HLA-A*24:02 positive patients with solid tumors which are 1) unresectable, refractory to standard therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc), metastatic or recurrent, and 2) MAGE-A4-expressing. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and in vivo kinetics, and the secondary is to evaluate clinical effect.</detailed_description>
