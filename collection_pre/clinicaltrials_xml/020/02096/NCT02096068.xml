	<brief_summary>The drug Dexmedetomidine will be investigated in 72 patients (men and women) undergoing elective cardiac or abdominal surgery. The study medication will be administered perioperatively by intravenous infusion continuously (at the longest 48 h) to prevent/reduce the rate of Delirium and the incidence of postoperative cognitive deficit (POCD). A non-surgical control group of 15 ASA II/III- patients from Berlin and surrounding area is collected for measuring the learning experience during the cognitive testings. The participants are matched on age, education, and gender to the study patients. Cognitive testings are performed in patients of the study group (n= 72) and the control group (n= 15) to evaluate deficits in their cognitive areas (POCD (Postoperative cognitive deficit)) at three different time points up to three months.</brief_summary>
