	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators are attempting to determine whether intra- or extra-articular injections are more effective; the relative prevalence rate of intra-articular and extra-articular SI joint pain; and the accuracy of extra-articular injections using fluoroscopy as the reference standard. 124 consecutive patients with mechanical low back pain below L5, tenderness overlying the SI joint(s) and at least 3 positive provocative maneuvers will be randomized to receive SI joint injections by 2 different approaches. Group 1 will receive fluoroscopically-guided injections into the joint. Group 2 will receive landmark-guided injections into the tender area around the joint. In order to determine whether the injection in group 2 was intra-articular or extra-articular, an x-ray will be done after the injection to ascertain the location of contrast spread. The primary outcome measure will be pain relief at 1-month. Patients who obtain benefit at 1-month will be followed at 3-months, while those who fail to obtain benefit will exit the study to receive alternative care.</brief_summary>
