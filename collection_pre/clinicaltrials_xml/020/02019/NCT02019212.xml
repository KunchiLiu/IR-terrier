	<brief_title>Prognostic Value of Stress SPECT Myocardial Perfusion Imaging With Half Dose 99mTc-Tetrofosmin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to determine if myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using a new SPECT reconstruction software and a low dose (LD) of 99mTC-tetrofosmin will provide equal quality and prognostic value as a full dose (FD) of 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging methodology. The images of clinical patients from the Diagnostic Imaging Department will be assessed and compared for image quality and myocardial perfusion. The outcomes of participants that have had FD studies will be compared to those who have had LD studies. Consented participants will be contacted and will be asked to provide information on their cardiovascular health since the date of their LD or FD scan, such as non fatal myocardial infarction, death, congestive heart failure, admission to hospital with chest pain, further cardiac diagnostic testing, including angiography and early and late revascularization. The event information will be tabulated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months for the LD and FD studies. The study hypothesizes that there will be no difference in the quality and prognostic value between the LD and FD 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT MPI imaging protocols. The study hypothesizes that there will be no increase in repeat diagnostic testing and angiography with using the LD imaging protocol.</detailed_description>
