	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulation and Expression of VEGF and NO in Diabetic Foot Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty type 2 diabetic patients with foot ulceration and 13 age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to electrical stimulation (ES, n=10) or sham ES (placebo, n=10) groups. ES group received cathodal direct current for 1 h/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks (12 sessions). Blood sample was collected for VEGF and NO measurement in the first and last treatment sessions before and after intervention. Wound surface area (WSA) and skin temperature were measured at 1st, 6th, and 12th session.</detailed_description>
