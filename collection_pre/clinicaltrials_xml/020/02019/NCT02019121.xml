	<brief_summary>Investigators aim to retrospectively research patients undergoing renal transplants that received dexmedetomidine perioperatively to see if dexmedetomidine use protects renal function. Investigators hope to elucidate any association between renal transplant patients and perioperative dexmedetomidine administration, these include (but are not limited to) UOP, Cr/GFR, morbidity, mortality, in hospital complications and failure rate. Investigators will research both living and cadaveric renal transplants.</brief_summary>
