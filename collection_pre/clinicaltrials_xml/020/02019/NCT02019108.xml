	<brief_summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a costly health condition affecting more than 10% of Canadian adults. Excessive and unbalanced loads passing through the knee joint have been implicated in the progression of OA. Typical conservative treatment of OA has focused on increasing daily activity, without consideration for the underlying joint loading. This study aims to compare a 4-month walking program that aims to increase the angle of the foot (toe-out angle) during walking - a measure shown to reduce joint loading and OA disease progression - while increasing walking time/distance, with a standard walking program that aims to increase walking time/distance. It is predicted that the walking program focusing on increasing toe-out will provide greater reductions in self-reported knee pain and a greater reduction in unfavorable knee joint loading.</brief_summary>
