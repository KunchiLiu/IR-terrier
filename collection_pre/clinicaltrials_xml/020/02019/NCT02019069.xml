	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial studies how well liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 (CPX-351) works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-35, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPX-351 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and safety profile of the use of CPX-351 in older patients (age 60 and older) with: higher risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are refractory/relapsed after prior hypomethylating (HMA) therapy; subjects greater than 75 years old with higher risk MDS who are HMA relapsed/refractory who have progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)); AML with refractory/relapsed disease after prior HMA therapy for AML. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the duration of remission following induction therapy with CPX-351. II. Determine overall survival at 12 months. III. Determine the early induction mortality (at 60 days) following CPX-351 in this cohort following induction therapy. OUTLINE: INDUCTION: Patients receive liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients with reduced blast count not achieving a morphological leukemia free state (&lt; 5% blasts) receive a second course of induction therapy. Patients achieving a complete remission (CR) or a CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) at day 14 or after a second course of induction therapy proceed to consolidation therapy. SECOND INDUCTION: Patients receive liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. CONSOLIDATION: Beginning on day 28, patients receive liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Patients may receive a second course after 28-75 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability to understand and voluntarily give informed consent Age ≥ 60 Pathological diagnosis of AML (by WHO criteria) or higher risk MDS (includes int2 and high risk MDS by IPSS) along with one of the following: Patients with de novo or secondary MDS with progression/refractoriness after HMA treatment who have not transformed to AML Patients with MDS and prior HMA treatment for MDS who transform to AML Patients with AML who are refractory/relapsed after HMA therapy for their AML are eligible Life expectancy &gt; 1 month Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements Laboratory values fulfilling the following: Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dL. Note, patients with Gilbert's syndrome may have elevated bilirubin at baseline prior to diagnosis with AML or MDS. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome are included if their total bilirubin is ≤ 2 times their baseline total bilirubin. Serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &lt; 3 times ULN Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 45% by echocardiography (transthoracic echocardiography) or MUGA scan Patients with second malignancies may be eligible at discretion of PI given acute life threatening nature of untreated AML or higher risk MDS. Patients maintained on longterm nonchemotherapy treatment, e.g., hormonal therapy, are also eligible. Patients who have previously undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant will be excluded from this study Patients who have previously had &gt; 368 mg/m2 cumulative dose of daunorubicin or &gt; 368 mg/m2 daunorubicinequivalent anthracycline therapy (for example, from prior treatment of solid tumors). See appendix for anthracycline equivalence table. Acute promyelocytic leukemia [t(15;17)] Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness that would prevent obtaining informed consent Patients who have had conventional intensive cytotoxic induction chemotherapy for treatment of specifically MDS or AML are excluded. Patients who have not previously been treated with HMA therapy will be excluded Clinical evidence of active CNS leukemia Patients with evidence of uncontrolled current myocardial impairment (e.g. unstable ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled arrhythmia, symptomatic valvular dysfunction not controlled on medical therapy, uncontrolled hypertensive heart disease, and uncontrolled congestive heart failure) Active and uncontrolled infection. Patients with an active infection receiving treatment and hemodynamically stable for 48 hours may be entered into the study Known active uncontrolled HIV or hepatitis C infection Known hypersensitivity to cytarabine, daunorubicin or liposomal products Known history of Wilson's disease or other copperrelated disorders Other medical or psychiatric illness or organ dysfunction or laboratory abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's safety or interfere with data interpretation Laboratory abnormalities: Serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL Serum total bilirubin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL. Note, patients with Gilbert's syndrome may have elevated bilirubin at baseline prior to diagnosis with AML or MDS. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome are excluded if their total bilirubin is &gt; 2 times their baseline total bilirubin.
