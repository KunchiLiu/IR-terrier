	<brief_summary>This is a 1:1 ratio, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, global Phase 3 study of tedizolid phosphate (TR-701 FA) 200 mg intravenous (IV) once daily for 7 days versus linezolid (Zyvox®, Zyvoxid®, etc) 600 mg IV every 12 hours for 10 days for the treatment of ventilated participants with presumed gram-positive hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP). Participants with concurrent gram-positive bacteremia are to receive 14 days of active therapy in either treatment arm. Approximately 300 sites will participate. Ventilated participants with HABP/VABP caused by presumed gram-positive pathogen(s) at baseline, as determined by positive Gram stain, will be randomized 1:1 to study drug treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to determine the noninferiority (NI) in all-cause mortality (ACM) within 28 days after randomization of IV tedizolid phosphate compared with IV linezolid in the Intent to Treat (ITT) Analysis Set in ventilated participants with presumed gram-positive HABP or gram-positive VABP, collectively defined as ventilated nosocomial pneumonia (VNP).</detailed_description>
