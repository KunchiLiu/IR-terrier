	<brief_title>Effectiveness of App-based Relaxation for Patients With Chronic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To evaluate whether additional relaxation technique is more effective in the reduction of chronic neck pain compared to usual care alone. Study design: Open single-centered randomized two-armed pragmatic trial. Participants: 220 patients aged 18-65 years with chronic (&gt;12 weeks) neck pain and a mean pain score ≥ 4 on a Numeric Rating scale (NRS) in the last week before randomization who will be randomly allocated to two groups (relaxation, usual care alone as waiting list) Intervention: Participants apply either a daily 15-minute relaxation exercise guided by a smartphone application ("app"). or apply no additional intervention. The exercise should be applied daily, (minimally, five days per week) for 6 months. The app contains audios to guide autogenic training, muscle relaxation training and guided imagery. On a daily basis, participants can select one of the three exercises which they want to apply. Main outcome measure: The primary outcome is the mean pain intensity after 3 months measured by the daily pain intensity on the NRS.</detailed_description>
