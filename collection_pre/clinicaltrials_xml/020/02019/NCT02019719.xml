	<brief_summary>This study aims to characterize the relationship between dose of GSK1278863 and hemoglobin (Hgb) response in hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is anticipated that the data generated will enable selection of the starting dose(s) and optimize dose adjustment regimen(s) for Phase 3 clinical trials. This study will consist of a screening phase of 3-9 weeks, a 4-week treatment phase and a follow-up visit approximately 4 weeks after completing treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age (Informed concent): Japanese &gt;=20 years of age Gender (Screening 2 verification only): Female and male Females: must be of childbearing potential, and must agree to use one of the approved contraception methods from Screening 2 until completion of the Followup Visit. OR Of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone 23.0 116.3 million international units (MIU)/millilitre (mL) and estradiol &lt;= 10 picograms (pg)/mL is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the approved contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Males: must agree to use one of the approved contraceptive methods from the time of Screening 2 until completion of the Followup Visit. Corrected QT interval (QTc) (Screening 2 verification only): Bazett's Correction of QT Interval (QTcB) &lt;470 milliseconds (msec) or QTcB &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch block. There is no QTc inclusion criterion for a subject with a predominantly paced rhythm. Dialysis frequency: On hemodialysis (HD) three times weekly for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening 2 through Day 1. Dialysis adequacy (Screening 2 only): A singlepool Kt/Vurea of 1.2 based on a historical value obtained within the prior month in order to ensure the adequacy of dialysis. If Kt/Vurea is not available, then an average of the last 2 values of urea reduction ratio (URR) of at least 65%. Hemoglobin: Target stable Hgb between 9.512.0 g/dL at screening. Stable erythropoiesisstimulating agent (ESA) dose (Screening 2 only): Using the same ESA (epoetins or their biosimilar, or darbepoietin) with total weekly doses that varied by no more than 50% during the 4 weeks prior to Screening 2. Iron replacement therapy: Subjects may be on stable maintenance oral or intravenous (IV) (&lt;100 milligrams [mg]/week) iron supplementation. If subjects are on oral or IV iron, then doses must be stable for the 4 weeks prior to Screening 2, and Screening 2 through Week 4. Dialysis modality: Planned change from HD to peritoneal dialysis within the study time period. Renal transplant: Renal transplant anticipated or scheduled within the study time period. High ESA dose (Screening 2 verification only): As defined by an epoetin dose of &gt;=360 IU/kilograms (kg)/week IV or darbepoetin dose of &gt;=1.8 micrograms (μg)/kg/week IV within the prior 8 weeks through Screening 2. methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta (Screening 2 verification only): Use of methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta within the prior 8 weeks through Screening 2. Vitamin B12: At or below the lower limit of the reference range Folate: &lt;2.0 nanograms (ng)/mL (&lt;4.5 nanomoles [nmol]/liters [L]) Iron status: Ferritine &lt;100 ng/mL (&lt;100 μg/L) AND Transferrin saturation (TSAT) &lt;20% Myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome: Within the 8 weeks prior to Screening 2 through Day 1. Stroke or transient ischemic attack: Within the 8 weeks prior to Screening 2 through Day 1. Heart failure: Class III/IV heart failure, as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system or symptomatic right heart failure diagnosed prior to Screening 2 through Day 1. Hypertension: Defined using predialysis vitals of diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg or systolic blood pressure &gt;170 mmHg. Thrombotic disease: History of thrombotic disease (e.g., venous thrombosis such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or arterial thrombosis such as new onset or worsening limb ischemia requiring intervention), except vascular access thrombosis, within the 8 weeks prior to Screening 2 through Day 1 Eyes: History of proliferative retinopathy requiring treatment within the prior 12 months or macular edema requiring treatment.. Inflammatory disease: Active chronic inflammatory disease that could impact erythropoiesis (e.g., scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease) diagnosed prior to Screening 2 through Day 1. Hematological disease: Any hematological disease including those affecting platelets, white or red blood cells (e.g. sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, hematological malignancy, myeloma, hemolytic anemia and thalassemia), coagulation disorders (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome, Protein C or S deficiency), or any other cause of anemia other than renal disease diagnosed prior to Screening 2 through Day 1. Liver disease: Current liver disease, known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or evidence at Screening of abnormal liver function tests [alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt;2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN]; or other hepatic abnormalities that in the opinion of the investigator (subinvestigator) would preclude the subject from participation in the study. Major surgery: Major surgery (excluding vascular access surgery) within the prior 8 weeks, within the Screening 2 to Day 1 or planned during the study. Transfusion: Blood transfusion within the prior 8 weeks, within the Screening 2 to Day 1 or an anticipated need for blood transfusion during the study. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding: Evidence of actively bleeding peptic, duodenal, or esophageal ulcer disease OR clinically significant GI bleeding within the 8 weeks prior to Screening 2 through Day 1. Acute infection: Clinical evidence of acute infection or history of infection requiring IV antibiotic therapy within 8 weeks prior to Screening 2 through Day 1. Malignancy: Subjects with a history of malignancy within the prior 5 years, who receiving treatment for cancer, or who have a strong family history of cancer (e.g., familial cancer disorders); with the exception of squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been definitively treated prior to Screening 2 through Day 1. Severe allergic reactions: History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity to excipients in the investigational product Drugs and supplements: Use of any prescription or nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements that are prohibited from Screening 2 until the Followup Visit. Prior investigational product exposure: The Subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an experimental investigational product within the prior 30 days from Screening 2 through Day 1. Pregnancy or lactation: Pregnant females as determined by positive serum Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) test (Screening 2 only) OR women who are lactating at Screening 2 and/or Day 1 or during the trial. Other conditions: Any other condition, clinical or laboratory abnormality, or examination finding that the Investigator would consider inappropriate to participate in the study.</criteria>
