In case of indeterminate result, a retest is allowed if time permits; 2 results of indeterminate require exclusion of the subject Subject with known tuberculosis (TB) infection, at high risk of acquiring TB infection, or latent TB infection (LTB). If tested within the 6 months prior to Screening and the test was negative for TB, and there is no change in the subject's clinical status, nor social, family, or travel history, there is no need for an additional TB testing at Screening</criteria>
