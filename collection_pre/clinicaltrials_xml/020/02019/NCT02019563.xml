	<brief_title>MTA/FS Pulpotomy for Vital Primary Incisors: A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children. Caries of the primary maxillary incisors is common in young children; often necessitating either extraction or pulp therapy. The premature loss of primary maxillary incisors can adversely affect a child's dental occlusion, ability to properly size food boluses for swallowing, speech articulation, facial esthetics and psychosocial development. Pulp treatment of cariously exposed vital primary incisors may prevent premature tooth loss as well as eliminate pain. Currently, there is a paucity of outcome investigations with regard to pulp therapy in primary incisors.</detailed_description>
