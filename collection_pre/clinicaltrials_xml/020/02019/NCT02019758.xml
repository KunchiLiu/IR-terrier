	<brief_summary>Purpose: To determine whether oral viscous budesonide (OVB) or fluticasone metered dose inhaler (MDI) most effectively treats EoE by improving histologic findings and symptoms, which medication provides a more durable treatment response, and whether biomarkers can predict treatment response. Participants: A total of 122 16-80 year old patients with a new diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) who are referred for upper endoscopy. Procedures: This will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, clinical trial comparing OVB to fluticasone MDI for treatment of EoE. This overall study design will generate data for all three Aims</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Budesonide Versus Fluticasone for Treatment of Eosinophilic Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, clinical trial comparing oral viscous budesonide (OVB) to fluticasone metered dose inhaler (MDI) for treatment of EoE. A total of 122 subjects aged 16-80 years old will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of two active treatment arms: OVB + placebo inhaler or fluticasone MDI + placebo slurry. In the first arm, subjects will be treated with OVB at a dose of 1 mg twice daily, and they will also be instructed to use a placebo inhaler identical to the fluticasone MDI, with instructions to swallow 4 puffs twice daily. The OVB is a slurry equivalent to what is used clinically: 1 mg/4 mL aqueous budesonide mixed with 10 g of sucralose. Rather than asking the subjects to mix the slurry on their own and risk inconsistent formulations, the UNC investigational drug pharmacy (IDP) will provide pre-mixed OVB to all patients. The IDP will also provide placebo inhalers to all patients. The dose for OVB has been chosen because it is the most commonly studied dose, including one prior study led by this Principal Investigator, so we can accurately estimate response rates. In the second arm, subjects will be treated with fluticasone MDI at a dose of 880 mcg twice daily (4 puffs of a 220 mcg inhaler twice daily), and they will also be instructed to take 4 mL twice daily of a placebo slurry of sucralose identical in consistency and taste to the OVB. The UNC investigational drug pharmacy (IDP) will provide the fluticasone MDIs and pre-mixed placebo slurries to all patients. The dose for fluticasone MDI has been chosen because this is the most commonly used dose in adolescents and adults with EoE, so effect estimates are also available. For both arms, the slurry will be administered first, the MDI will be administered 15 minutes later, and patients will take nothing by mouth for an additional 30 minutes. Subjects will receive 8 weeks of treatment and will then be monitored for up to 52 weeks for recurrence of symptoms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria are as follows: Age: 16 80 years Subject is having a clinically indicated endoscopy for suspicious EoE and has been on BID PPI for at least 8 weeks OR New diagnosis of EoE as per consensus guidelines. Cases must have symptoms of dysphagia, persistent esophageal eosinophilia (â‰¥ 15 eosinophils in at least one highpower field) after 8 weeks of treatment with a twice daily protonpump inhibitor, and other competing causes of esophageal eosinophilia excluded. Exclusion criteria are as follows: Medical instability that precludes safely performing upper endoscopy Ongoing or recent symptoms of intestinal bleeding (throwing up blood, passing blood in the stool) Concomitant eosinophilic gastroenteritis Esophageal narrowing or stricturing that will not allow a standard 9 mm upper endoscopy scope to pass Cancer in the esophagus, stomach, or intestine Previous esophageal surgery Esophageal varices (dilated blood vessels in the esophagus) Current use of blood thinners like Plavix or Coumadin that are not stopped prior to endoscopy procedures Any corticosteroid exposure within the 4 weeks prior to their baseline endoscopic exam. Exclusionary corticosteroid exposure is defined as any swallowed topical steroids for EoE or systemic steroids for any condition within the four weeks prior to the baseline endoscopy. Corticosteroids used for asthma or intranasal corticosteroids are not an exclusion and are allowable. Pregnancy Inability to read or understand English</criteria>
