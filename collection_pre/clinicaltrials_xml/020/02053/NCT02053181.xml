	<criteria>Signed informed consent prior to any studymandated procedure. Nonpregnant females were to remain nonpregnant for 1 month after the end of the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and must have used a reliable method of contraception Subjects with severe CDAD; Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) must have been microbiologically proven, using a validated enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) and/or C. difficile toxin B (TcdB). The severity of CDAD was assessed according to the current European Union guidelines European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID). Received oral vancomycin or oral/intravenous (i.v.) metronidazole therapy for the treatment of CDAD. Ability to communicate well with the investigator in the local language, and to understand and comply with the requirements of the study. Known hypersensitivity to any excipients of the drug formulation. Clinical evidence of any relevant disease other than CDAD and/or existence of any surgical or medical condition that might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drug. Veins unsuitable for i.v. puncture on either arm (e.g., veins that are difficult to locate, access, or puncture; veins with a tendency to rupture during or after puncture). Subjects with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, glucosegalactose malabsorption, saccharaseisomaltase deficiency or previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus. Subjects who have a lifethreatening condition, which may be related to CDAD or other underlying illness. Any clinically relevant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality at screening. Subjects who were unable to swallow or have difficulty swallowing. Subjects with vomiting, ileus or not passing stool. Likelihood of death within 72 hours from any cause. Lifethreatening or fulminant CDAD (White blood cell count &gt; 30 × 10^9/L; temperature &gt; 40 °C; or septic shock, peritoneal signs or significant dehydration). History of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Loss of 250 mL or more of blood within 3 months prior to screening. Positive results from the hepatitis serology, except for vaccinated subjects, at screening. Positive results from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology at screening. Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity at screening. Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol.</criteria>
