	<brief_summary>As noted, multiple pathways, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Ras, Raf, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptors (VEGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) appear to be involved in cholangiocarcinoma tumor genesis. Overexpression of these proteins has been shown to be associated with tumor stage, prognosis, and response to therapy. However, therapies targeting a single pathway have shown no clear benefit. A number of Phase 2 trials have been completed, or are underway, studying agents targeted to EGFR or VEGF - both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. These have shown varying increases in response rate, but have not found marked increases in progression-free or overall survival. This suggests that inhibition of multiple pathways simultaneously may be needed. Regorafenib, is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting multiple tumor pathways, which has showed effectiveness as a single agent in multiple solid tumors. The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients receiving regorafenib after failing first-line chemotherapy. Patients with advanced and metastatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma) who had been treated with and failed first-line chemotherapy will be treated with regorafenib (160 mg) orally once daily 21 days (3 weeks) on and 7 days (1 week) off in the 28-day (4-week) cycle.</brief_summary>
