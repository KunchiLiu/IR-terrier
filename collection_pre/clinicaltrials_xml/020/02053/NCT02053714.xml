	<brief_summary>Persons with severe mental illness are at great risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Unfortunately, persons with mental illness and T2DM are less likely to receive recommended diabetes monitoring and are more likely to have poorly controlled diabetes, which leads to microvascular and macrovascular complications later in life. Evidence-based diabetes self-management education and support interventions have yet to be adapted for persons with mental illness and there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine their feasibility and efficacy. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a RCT of a diabetes self-management intervention for persons with severe mental illness and T2DM.</brief_summary>
