	<brief_title>Robot-assisted Training for Stroke Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study designed an assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical study. The participations followed the study protocol and were randomly divided into the control group and Walkbot group. The control group received conventional functional rehabilitation for 40 min/session, 2 sessions/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks, 40 sessions in all. Whereas the Walkbot group received conventional physical therapy (session I for 40 min/day) companied with Walkbot training (session II for 30 min/day) 5 days a week for 4 weeks, 40 session in all. After 4-week intervention all subjects received conventional physical therapy only, 40 min/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. During the test period, general rehabilitation and drug treatment can be done at the same time.</detailed_description>
