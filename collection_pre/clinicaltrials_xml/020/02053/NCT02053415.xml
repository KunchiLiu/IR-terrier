	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether 4 weeks daily intake of krill oil can change the omega-3 index (content of the long chained fatty acids EPA and DHA in relation to the total fatty acids) in the membrane in red blood cells. We investigate this at two different doses. Furthermore, the purpose of the study is also to examine the effect of the krill oil intake on plasma lipids (triacylglycerol, phospholipids and cholesterol), plasma fatty acid composition, as well as product tolerance in healthy, young individuals.</brief_summary>
