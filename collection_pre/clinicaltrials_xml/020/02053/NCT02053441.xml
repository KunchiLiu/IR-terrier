	<brief_summary>In this study will measure differences in how muscle responds to both exercise and protein supplements in healthy women aged 60-69. We are studying two different protein supplements- a standard Whey Protein and a Leucine enriched supplement. Each patient would receive either one of these.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modulation of Muscle Protein Synthesis With Diet and Exercise in Old Aged Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the factors that plays an important role in the loss of functional performance and, as such, the capacity to maintain a healthy, active lifestyle is the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass with ageing (i.e., sarcopenia). Indeed, sarcopenia is a more robust predictor of functional status and mortality in the elderly than chronological age or indeed, any other co-morbidity. Sarcopenia is an incipient process whereby lean muscle mass contributing up to ~50% of total body weight in young adults declines to ~25% when reaching the age of 75-80 y. Adequate nutritional intake, and in particular dietary protein, is important for offsetting age-related declines in muscle mass. The aim of this project is to seek the most effective nutrition with which to counteract sarcopenia, specifically in women.</detailed_description>
