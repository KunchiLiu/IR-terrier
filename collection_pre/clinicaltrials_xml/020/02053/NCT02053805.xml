	<brief_title>Prostate Cancer Screening Among Men With High Risk Genetic Predisposition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective diagnostic trial of screening for prostate cancer among men with genetic predisposition. The target population is males (40-70 year old) carrying a BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 germ line mutation. They will be identified via our Genetic counseling unit. All men after signing an informed consent will undergo the following tests: PSA, free to total PSA, MRI of prostate and prostate biopsy. The primary endpoint will be to estimate the prevalence, stage and grade of prostate cancer in this population. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the impact of these germ line mutations on benign prostatic hyperplasia. Furthermore, this study aims to create a bio-bank of tissue, urine and serum of this unique cohort for future investigations. Finally, this study will identify an inception cohort for future interventional studies of primary and secondary prevention.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male carrier of mutation in BRCA 1\2 or germline mutations in the MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2 , MSH6 or PMS2). WHO performance status 02 (Appendix 2) Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical situation potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule. Individuals that cannot undergo the MRI exam due to high creatinine level or claustrophobic will be disc loud from the MRI part. Informed written consent must be sought according to ICH/EU GCP, before subject registration. Previous cancer with a terminal prognosis of less than five years. Previous prostate cancer</criteria>
