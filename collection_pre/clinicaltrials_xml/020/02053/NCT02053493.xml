No chronic nitrate therapy or infrequent (≤ 1x week) use of intermittent sublingual nitroglycerin within last 3 months 7. Ambulatory (not wheelchair / scooter / walker / cane dependent) 8. HF is the primary factor limiting activity as indicated by answering # 2 to the following question: My ability to be active is most limited by: 1. Joint, foot, leg, hip or back pain 2. Shortness of breath and/or fatigue and/or chest pain 3. Unsteadiness or dizziness 4. Lifestyle, weather, or I just don't like to be active 9. Body size allows wearing of the accelerometer belt as confirmed by ability to comfortably fasten the test belt provided for the screening process (belt designed to fit persons with BMI 2040 Kg/m2 but belt may fit some persons outside this range) 10. Willingness to wear the accelerometer belt for the duration of the trial 11. Willingness to provide informed consent 1. Recent (&lt; 3 months) hospitalization for HF 2. Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dl 3.

Diastolic blood pressure &lt; 40 mmHg or &gt; 100 mmHg at consent 6. Resting HR &gt; 110 bpm at consent 7. Previous adverse reaction to nitrates necessitating withdrawal of therapy 8. Chronic therapy with phosphodiesterase type5 inhibitors (intermittent use of phosphodiesterase type5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction is allowable if the patient is willing to hold for the duration of the trial) 9.
