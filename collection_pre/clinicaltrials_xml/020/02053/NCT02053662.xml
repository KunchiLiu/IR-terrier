	<brief_summary>To develop a simple blood and urine test that we would perform before patients start their treatment to predict the risk that their bladder cancer might come back. To develop this test the investigators plan to analyze blood, urine and cancer tissue from bladder cancer patients and follow them closely during and after treatment. This will include looking for changes in proteins and genes that might play a role in bladder cancer biology. The investigators will then compare the information obtained from the studies of blood, urine and cancer tissue between patients that are cured and those whose cancer comes back. The knowledge about these differences between patients can then potentially be used to develop a blood or urine test to tell us who has a high risk for having bladder cancer come back.</brief_summary>
