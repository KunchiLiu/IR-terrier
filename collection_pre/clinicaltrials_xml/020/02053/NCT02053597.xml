	<brief_summary>Recently, there has been a rising trend of delaying childbearing and hence more women are diagnosed with breast cancer before completing their families. Given the continuous decline in recurrences and death secondary to breast cancer and the reassuring data on the safety of pregnancy following breast cancer more women are inquiring into the possibility of preserving fertility following chemotherapy. The challenge remains in using a regimen that is devoid of cyclophosphamide, but is as effective as the standard regimens that incorporate cyclophosphamide. The combination doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) (AP) followed by 12 weeks of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) (P) emerges as a treatment option with convincing results regarding its effectiveness in the early setting, and could be potentially associated with less ovarian toxicity being devoid of cyclophosphamide.</brief_summary>
