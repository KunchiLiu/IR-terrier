	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Preoperative Cognitive Training in Cardiac Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive outcomes remain poor after cardiac surgery. Data from the field of cognitive neuroscience suggests that cognitive training, which harnesses the brain's adaptive plasticity to improve, maintain, or restore function in a target area, can be used to strengthen brain resilience and improve cognitive outcomes following challenge. While its effectiveness has been demonstrated in older adults as well as in other (nonsurgical) patient populations, no training intervention like this has ever before been used in any surgical patient in the preoperative period. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of administering a 20-day cognitive training intervention (Cog-Train) to a widely inclusive sample of cardiac surgical patients before their surgery. Data obtained will be used to design a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) on Cog-Train's effectiveness in improving postoperative cognitive outcomes.</detailed_description>
