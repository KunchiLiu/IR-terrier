	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of alanyl-glutamine supplementation in the treatment of C. difficile infection. We hypothesize that alanyl-glutamine when given with standard antibiotic treatment for C. difficile infection will decrease diarrhea, mortality and recurrent disease.</brief_summary>
