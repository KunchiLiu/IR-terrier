	<brief_summary>Approximately 140 male and female healthy subjects will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive a 120 mg single dose of denosumab either as a 1.7 mL single injection of 70 mg/mL denosumab CP4 (Treatment A) or as a 1.7 mL single injection of 70 mg/mL denosumab CP2 (Treatment B). Subjects will be admitted to the research facility on day -1 and remain in the research facility through day 2. The subjects will return to the research facility on an outpatient basis. The PK, PD, and safety assessments will be conducted during the inpatient stay and at regular intervals during the 18-week treatment period.</brief_summary>

This includes medications such as, but not limited to: bisphosphonates, fluoride, hormone replacement therapy (ie, estrogen) or selective estrogen receptor modulator, such as ralaxofene, calcitonin, strontium, parathyroid hormone or derivatives, supplemental vitamin D [&gt;1000 IU/day], glucocorticosteroids, anabolic steroids, calcitriol, diuretics, over the counter medications, herbal supplements Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening or known diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg) (indicative of chronic hepatitis B) or detectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at screening (indicative of active hepatitis C screening is generally done by hepatitis C antibody [HepCAb], followed by hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR if HepCAb is positive) Known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during the study Prior denosumab administration Receiving or has received any investigational drug (or is currently using an investigational device) within 30 days before receiving study drug, or at least 10 times the respective elimination halflife (whichever period is longer) and for the duration of the study Women with a positive pregnancy test at screening or day1 Men and women of reproductive potential who are unwilling to practice a highly effective method of birth control while on study through 5 months after receiving the last dose of study drug. Highly effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence (men, women); vasectomy; or a condom with spermicide (men) in combination with either barrier methods, hormonal birth control or intrauterine device (women) Women who are lactating/breastfeeding or who plan to breastfeed while on study through 5 halflives after receiving the dose of study drug Women planning to become pregnant while on study through 5 months after receiving the dose of study drug Men with partners who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant while the subject is on study through 5 months after receiving the last dose of study drug Unwilling or unable to limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is prohibited 24 hours prior to screening, 24 hours prior to checkin on day 1, and throughout confinement. Alcohol is also limited to no more than 2 drinks per day during the outpatient period of the study through completion of day 127 (EOS).
