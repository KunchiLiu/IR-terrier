	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate two dosing protocols for tranexamic acid (TXA), an anti-fibrinolytic used to decrease blood loss in adult patients undergoing complex, reconstructive spinal fusion surgeries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After consent is obtained and the patient is enrolled in the trial, patients will be assigned de-identified, unique identification (ID) numbers. Randomization of these IDs to either low or high dose TXA will occur via a computer generated random assignment. Given the variations that may exist in surgical technique (e.g. performance of osteotomies), stratified randomization will be performed by attending surgeon. Based upon the randomization, the pharmacy will prepare TXA for one of two intravenous dosing protocols: 1. Low Dose (Standard of Care/Control): Loading Dose 10mg/kg given over 15 minutes, followed by 1mg/kg/hr via continuous infusion 2. High Dose (Study Group): Loading Dose 50mg/kg given over 15 minutes, followed by 5mg/kg/hr via continuous infusion. The surgeon, anesthesia team, and operating room staff will be blind to the concentration of TXA in the medications received. Treatments may be "unblinded" at the discretion of the surgeon and anesthesiologist, in cases of extreme blood loss. If additional anti-fibrinolytics are given, the change in dose will be recorded. Post-operative care will be the same as any other patient and data collection will be information contained in the patient's medical record that is part of routine, standard of care.</detailed_description>
