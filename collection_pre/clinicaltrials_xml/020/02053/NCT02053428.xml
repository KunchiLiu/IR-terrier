	<brief_summary>Percutaneous image-guided gastrostomy (PIG) is an increasingly popular technique of creating gastroenteric access through the anterior abdominal wall for nutrition and/ or compression. Large-bore mushroom-retained catheters via the pull technique and small-bore cope loop catheters via the push technique are both used at Interventional Radiology for PIG at our institution. To date, there is no guideline for PIG and no direct comparison of two PIG techniques. The proposed pilot study is to compare the two different types of PIG techniques in head and neck cancer patients who require prophylactic enteral feeding by PIG. The purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility of a large randomized clinical trial to compare these two PIG techniques.</brief_summary>
