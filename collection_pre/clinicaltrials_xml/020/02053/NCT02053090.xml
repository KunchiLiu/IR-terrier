	<brief_summary>This study is an acceptability and feasibility study of two adjunctive interventions: group education with stretching; and group acupuncture. The study population will be women with primary fibromyalgia who have not previously used acupuncture in the last 3 months. Both interventions will be 10 weeks in length and will be conducted at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University. The primary hypothesis is that both arms will be acceptable and feasible in the study population.</brief_summary>
