	<brief_title>A Multi-Site Clinical Evaluation of the ARIES Norovirus Assay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ARIES Norovirus Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of Norovirus GI/GII RNA from stool specimens obtained from symptomatic patients. The objective is to establish the diagnostic accuracy of the ARIES Norovirus assay through a multi-site, method comparison on prospectively collected leftover, stool specimens. Diagnostic accuracy will be expressed in terms of clinical sensitivity (or positive agreement) and specificity (or negative agreement)</detailed_description>
