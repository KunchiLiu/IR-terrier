	<brief_summary>The immune system of newborn infants is immature with low activity of both innate and acquired immune reactions. Early nutrition has an impact on early immune responses. Dietary fatty acids are one nutritional factor noted to play a role in immune function. The omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, ARA (Arachidonic acid) and the omega-3 fatty acid, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are found naturally in breastmilk and some infant formulas. The balance or relative amounts of ARA and DHA have been associated with immune response. Some commercial infant formula contains both ARA and DHA. However, the optimal balance of ARA and DHA has not been determined with respect to immune function. This study will assess two levels of ARA and the impact on immune response in healthy, term infants and whether genes that influence essential fatty acid metabolism alter the nutritional requirement of infants.</brief_summary>
