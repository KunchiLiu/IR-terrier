	<brief_summary>This Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 4-period crossover study is designed to determine the relative bioavailability of GDC-0941 administered as a single dose of the market image formulation at 3 different hardnesses (hardness 1, 2, and 3) and as a single dose of the Phase 2 formulation to healthy male and female volunteers. Participants will be randomly assigned to 4 possible treatment sequences, each comprising 4 periods (1 per formulation), and GDC-0941 will be administered based on the assigned sequence. The study is expected to last 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
