	<brief_summary>This is a sub-study of the OSKIRA-4 study, (D4300C0004, NCT01264770) to explore alternative and more sensitive modalities for measuring the beneficial effects of syk inhibition with fostamatinib in patients with active RA. This MRI sub-study was reported later than the main study due to recruitment delays at specialist imaging sites and so is registered and presented entirely separately to the main study results. This study will investigate the impact of treatment on joint activity and damage by assessing synovitis, osteitis, bone erosions and joint space narrowing.</brief_summary>
