	<brief_summary>Investigators at the Biomedical Imaging Research Institute (BIRI) at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center have developed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) method for imaging coronary arteries using slow-infusion, contrast-enhanced data acquisition. This method allows faster data acquisition and better spatial resolution. Specific aims of this study are to: 1. compare coronary artery imaging with and without contrast media on both healthy subjects and patients; 2. assess the accuracy of coronary MRI in detecting coronary artery disease as compared to conventional x-ray angiography Researchers hypothesize that contrast-enhanced MRI will improve the delineation of coronary arteries over non-contrast-enhanced MRI and that optimized, contrast-enhanced coronary MRI technique will accurately detect coronary artery disease (CAD) as compared to conventional x-ray angiography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast- Enhanced Whole-Heart Coronary MRA at 3.0T (Tesla)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study to compare image quality between contrast and non-contrast cardiac MR and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a cardiac MRI procedure in a patient population that includes both healthy volunteers and a study group of patients with known CAD who are scheduled for clinical coronary angiography within one month of signing informed consent. Both groups are eligible for a combination of imaging tests. Subjects may receive either a non-contrast MRI or a contrast-enhanced MRI depending upon their kidney function and study focus. Also based upon the focus of the study at the time of the scan and to improve image quality, a beta-blocker to lessen motion artifact in patients with higher heart rates may be administered or patients may be asked to undergo a stress test for comparison.This is a one-day research procedure. Studies are acquired from the approved Institutional Review Board #25881 Cedars-Sinai Biomedical Imaging Research Registry.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion: All subjects must be enrolled in the IRB approved CedarsSinai Biomedical Imaging Research Registry where data is collected for this analysis study. Male or female â‰¥ 18years of age Healthy Group No known CAD CAD GroupScheduled for clinical invasive coronary artery xray angiography within one month of study participation Exclusion: MR imaging is contraindicated in persons with mechanically, magnetically, or electrically activated implants, such as cardiac pacemakers, neurostimulators, and infusion pumps. Persons with ferromagnetic implants and ferromagnetic foreign bodies, such as intracranial, aneurysm clips, shrapnel and intraocular metal chips as these could become dislodged. Patients who are pregnant, nursing are implanted with intrauterine devices (IUD's) Persons who are in atrial fibrillation at the time of the MR scan as this could result in poor image quality due to interference with electrocardiographic gating necessary for image acquisition. Persons unable to tolerate MRI imaging secondary to an inability to lie supine or severe claustrophobia. Patient with renal failure (GFR&lt; 45) Allergy to animal dander or animalinstigated asthma Specific to Ablavar: Baseline ECG measurements and concomitant medications will be checked on subjects who are chosen to participate in the Ablavar study, based upon study needs. If the ECG measurements and/or medications indicate that the subject is at high risk for arrhythmia, the subject will be excluded from the Ablavar study, but can participate in the OptiMark/MultiHance contrast study or noncontrast study. Specific to betablocker administration: no contraindication to beta blockers. If the subject is found to have a contraindication to betablockers or declines the administration of betablockers the subject will be excluded from the betablocker portion but can still participate in a noncontrast or contrastenhanced scan without betablocker administration. Specific to Regadenoson: no contraindication to regadenoson administration. If the subject is found to have a contraindication to regadenoson the subject will be excluded from the regadenoson portion but can still participate in a noncontrast or contrastenhanced scan without regadenoson stress testing. Specific to Adenosine: no contraindication to adenosine administration.If the subject is found to have a contraindication to adenosine the subject will be excluded from the adenosine portion but can still participate in a noncontrast or contrastenhanced scan without adenosine stress testing.</criteria>
