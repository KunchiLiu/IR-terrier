	<brief_title>Fecal Calprotectin Levels, Quality of Life, and Workability in Patients Suffering From Ulcerative Colitis Under Adalimumab Therapy - AdaProQuo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-interventional, observational study in which Humira (adalimumab) is prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regards to dose, population and indication. The assignment of the patient to a adalimumab containing regimen has to be decided in advance and has to be current practice. The prescription of adalimumab is clearly separated from the decision to include the participant in this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and an immunosuppressant (AZA/6MP); or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies and are hence prescribed adalimumab for the treatment of moderate to severely active UC Patients who are able to complete patients questionnaires (e.g., WPAI:UC and sIBDQ questionnaire) Patients must fulfill national and international guidelines for the use of biologic therapies in UC (Chest Xray and InterferonGammaRelease Assay (IGRA) or tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD)skin test negative for tuberculosis). Patients who have been prescribed adalimumab in line with the European SmPC (Summary of Product Characteristics) Previous therapy with TNFalpha (Tumor necrosis factor alpha) blocker No signed written authorization to use data Contraindication to adalimumab therapy according to the SmPC Patients with a history of subtotal colectomy with ileorectostomy or colectomy with ileoanal pouch, Koch pouch, or ileostomy for UC or planned bowel surgery.
