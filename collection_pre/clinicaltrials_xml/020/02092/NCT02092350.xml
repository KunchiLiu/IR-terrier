	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination treatment with grazoprevir (MK-5172) + elbasvir (MK-8742) for cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic participants with chronic Genotype 1 (GT1) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The primary study hypothesis is that the proportion of HCV GT1-infected CKD participants within the Immediate Treatment and Intensive Pharmacokinetics (PK) groups achieving a sustained viral response 12 weeks after the end of all study treatment (SVR12) will be &gt;45%.</brief_summary>
