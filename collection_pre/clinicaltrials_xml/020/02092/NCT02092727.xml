	<brief_summary>The Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation among African American End Stage Renal Disease living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include patients with kidney disease, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of kidney disease is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, the investigators research suggests that racial disparities in access to kidney transplantation are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans are less likely to access each step in the transplant process. The long-term goal of the investigators Coalition is to use community- based participatory research approaches to develop, test, and disseminate sustainable, community interventions improve access to transplant for African American patients with kidney disease. The Reducing Disparities in Access to kidNey Transplantation (RaDIANT) community study proposes to use community-based participatory research methods to develop a multilevel intervention to reduce racial disparities in access to kidney transplantation. The long-term impact of this application will be to reduce racial disparities in the kidney disease community.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Dialysis facilities within GA were considered for this intervention due to data restrictions. The remaining facilities were selected in a stepwise selection process 1) The presence of a racial disparity in referral or 2) a crude referral risk less than six percent. The presence of a racial disparity was based on the crude referral risk difference and the standardized referral risk difference. The remaining facilities had a calculated 6month crude referral risk mean of 0.06 and all facilities with a crude referral risk less than the mean were selected for inclusion. The final pool of 134 facilities were randomized to either the intervention or control group using a one to one ratio. Exclusion: Facilities with a 6month population (from JuneDecember 2012) of less than 13 End Stage Renal Disease patients &lt;70 years of age within a facility were excluded.</criteria>
