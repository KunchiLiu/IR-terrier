	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess whether the application of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) enhances and prolongs the learning enhancement achieved by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS). For this, young and older healthy subjects will be tested with a well established learning paradigm. Results of this study may help to support the application of atDCS also in patients, e.g. with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.</brief_summary>
