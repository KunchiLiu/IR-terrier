	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of rTMS over primary motor cortex in patients suffering from malignant visceral pain. Thirty four patients were included in the study. They are divided randomly into 2 groups using closed envelop as real rTMS group and sham group. Real rTMS over the hand area of motor cortex (20 Hz, 10 trains with inter train interval 30 second with total pulses 2000, intensity 80% of motor threshold) every day for ten consecutive days (5 days/week) and the coil elevated and angled away from the head as sham stimulation. Patients were evaluated by verbal descriptor scale (VDS), visual analog scale (VAS), and Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) at the baseline, after 1st, 5th, 10th session, 15 day and 1 month after end of sessions. Serum human dynorphin (Dyn) level was measured at baseline, 5th and 10th session.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients within age group 1865 years with malignant visceral pain resistant to medical treatment for at least 2 months or associated with significant adverse effect from medication was involved in this study. We excluded patients with intracranial metallic devices or with pacemakers or any other device. We also excluded those with extensive myocardial ischemia, unstable angina and those known to have epilepsy.</criteria>
