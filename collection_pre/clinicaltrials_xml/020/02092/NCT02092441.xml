	<brief_title>Inhalation Intervention for Nausea in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to investigate if inhaling the scent of a typical medical alcohol prep pad will alleviate nausea as compared to a identically packaged normal saline prep pad for the Emergency Department patient with nausea. The study length will be 10 minutes long. The subjects will take several deep nasal inhalations at the 0, 2, 5 minute marks. Level of nausea will be recorded during these times and at 10 minutes. The investigators will also assess satisfaction of the intervention. As in previous post operative unit studies,the hypothesis is that there will a significant difference in levels of nausea between the alcohol pad group versus the normal saline pad group.</detailed_description>
