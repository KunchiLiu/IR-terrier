	<brief_summary>Acromegaly is frequently associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. We hypothesise that pituitary histopathology and plasma hyperprolactinaemia could have prognostic value in predicting the risk of glucose metabolic disturbances in acromegalic patients. The aim of this study is to examine glucose metabolic outcome in acromegalic patients with and without histologically verified prolactin and growth hormone (GH) co-secreting adenomas. The study population include 79 patients who have all undergone surgical treatment for acromegaly.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acromegaly is frequently associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. We hypothesise that pituitary histopathology and plasma hyperprolactinaemia could have prognostic value in predicting the risk of glucose metabolic disturbances in acromegalic patients. The aim of this study is to examine glucose metabolic outcome in acromegalic patients with and without histologically verified prolactin and growth hormone (GH) co-secreting adenomas. 79 patients who have all undergone surgical treatment for acromegaly are included. Clinical and biochemical baseline data are collected from medical records. Patients are divided into two groups based on histopathological evaluation of pituitary adenomas; 1. pure GH secreting adenomas or 2. GH and prolactin co-secreting adenomas.</detailed_description>
