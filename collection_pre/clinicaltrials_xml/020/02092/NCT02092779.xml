The regain of weight loss after hypochaloric diets has been ascribed to these HP disregulations. The aim of the study is to explore pituitary morphology and its association with pituitary function and metabolic phenotype in outpatient obese individuals evaluated in the period 2010-2013 at the Department of Experimental Medicine of the University of Rome La Sapienza, with features of HP disease in a cross-sectional .</brief_summary>
