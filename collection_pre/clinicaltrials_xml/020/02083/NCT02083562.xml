	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the association of biomarkers on day 7 of life with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very preterm infants. Additionally a short lung function test at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) will be performed to investigate whether certain capnographic indices are able to reflect the degree of lung disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a two-centre prospective cohort study in very preterm infants born below 32 0/7 weeks PMA and hospitalised in the neonatal intensive care units at the University Children's Hospital Basel and the Inselspital Berne during two years. After informed consent a sample of 0.5 mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) full blood will be taken on day 7 of life (+/- 2 days) during routine blood sampling. The biomarkers which are planned to measure include the C-terminal portion of the proendothelin-1 precursor (CT-proendothelin (proET)-1) and other plasma biomarkers of respiratory distress. At 36 weeks PMA, lung function testing will be performed during quiet unsedated sleep in supine position approximately 30 minutes post feeding. After placement of a facemask, tidal breathing will be recorded at the bedside using a commercially available ultrasonic flow meter (Spiroson, Exhalyzer D, Ecomedics, CH) according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards of infant lung function testing. Different capnographic indices will be calculated to investigate if they reflect the degree of lung disease at 36 weeks PMA.</detailed_description>
