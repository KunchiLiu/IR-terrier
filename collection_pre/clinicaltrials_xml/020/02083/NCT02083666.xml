	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability of SOBI002 in Healthy Volunteers Following Single and Repeated Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized within dose cohort single and repeated dose study with sequential dose escalation. Eligible volunteers will be divided into dose cohorts and for each cohort, a new panel of 8 volunteers will be randomized to receive either SOBI002 (n=6) or placebo (n=2). SOBI002 will either be administered subcutaneously or intravenously.</detailed_description>
