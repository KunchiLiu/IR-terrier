	<brief_summary>Two vaccines, ChAd63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP, are being tested to see if they will form a safe and effective vaccination strategy against malaria. The vaccines have been found to be well tolerated when tested in Gambian adults, young children and infants, who are at risk of severe malaria. Both vaccines will be given to participating infants at the same time as some EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) vaccines, and assess whether they are safe and still helpful in making the body's defense system respond.</brief_summary>

Weight for age zscores below 2 standard deviations of normal for age History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines, e.g. egg products, Kathon, neomycin, betapropiolactone. History of splenectomy Haemoglobin less than 10 g/dL at &gt; 4 weeks of age or less than 13.0 g/dl at &lt; 4 weeks of age.

History of vaccination with previous experimental malaria vaccines. Administration of any immunoglobulin less than two weeks before vaccination with the IMPs Current participation in another clinical trial, or within 12 weeks of this study. Any other finding which in the opinion of the PI or other delegated individual would increase the risk of an adverse outcome from participation in the trial.
