	<detailed_description>This study will use a pilot test format to examine the efficacy of a brief Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention developed by the investigator Dr. Douglas Smith called CHOICE (Compassionate Helpers Openly Inviting Client Empowerment)with youth referred for substance abuse assessments to substance abuse treatment agencies in Chicago and Urbana, IL. The study will have two arms: one group will receive the standard CHOICE Motivational Interview (MI) while the second group will receive the CHOICE Motivational Interview with a Normative Feedback component, called CHOICE+ (CHOICE Plus). The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in outcomes between those that receive the standard CHOICE and those that receive the CHOICE+ MI.</detailed_description>
