	<brief_title>Changes of Dendritic Cells in Acute Lung Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Change of circulating and tissular dendritic cells of patients with acute lung injury was still unclear, we used a flow cytometry-based assay to quantify circulating and tissular DCs and their HLA-DR surface expression at the time of diagnosis and during the first week of evolution in patients with acute lung injury, and healthy people as controls.</detailed_description>
