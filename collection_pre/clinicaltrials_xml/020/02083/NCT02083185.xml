	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study: 1. Male patients 18 years or older 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma 3. Candidate for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for the management of hormonesensitive prostate cancer with 1 of the following clinical disease states: 1) advanced localized disease not suitable for primary therapy, 2) evidence of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) biochemical or clinical relapse following primary surgery or radiation therapy of curative intent, or 3) newly diagnosed metastatic disease that is asymptomatic or not threatening to vital organs 4. Appropriate serum testosterone and serum PSA concentration at screening as specified in the protocol 5. A body mass index (BMI) â‰¥ 18.0 at screening and/or baseline 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at screening and/or baseline. 7. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, who agree to practice effective barrier contraception or agree to practice true abstinence. 8. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care 9. Suitable venous access for the studyrequired blood sampling, including PK and PD Sampling Exclusion Criteria Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the study: 1. In patients with advanced, localized M0N1 or M1 disease, the presence of clinically significant symptoms or threat to vital organs requiring immediate GnRH/CAB therapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy 2. Previously received ADT for more than 8 months total duration (if ADT was received for 8 months or less, then that ADT must have been completed at least 2 years prior to screening) 3. Visceral metastases (liver or lung) 4. Features of the patient's medical condition that may make ADT unnecessary or not indicated. 5. Scheduled for additional surgical or (salvage) radiation therapy within 6 months after baseline evaluations 6. History of surgical castration 7. Diagnosis of or treatment for another malignancy within the 2 years before the first dose of study drug, or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection 8. Abnormal screening and/or baseline laboratory values as specified in the protocol 9. History of any significant cardiac condition within 6 months before receiving the first dose of study drug 10. ECG abnormalities as specified in the protocol 11. Congenital long QT syndrome 12. Current use of Class IA (eg, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (eg, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications 13. Uncontrolled hypertension despite appropriate medical therapy. Patients may be rescreened after referral and further management of hypertension 14. Known, previously diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active chronic hepatitis B or C, lifethreatening illness unrelated to prostate cancer, or any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with participation in this study. Specific screening for chronic viral illness is at the discretion of the site and/or local institutional review board (IRB) 15. Treatment with any investigational products within 3 months before the first dose of study drug 16. A primary family member (spouse, parent, child, or sibling of the patient) is involved in the conduct of the study or is a study site employee 17. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of TAK385, including difficulty swallowing tablets 18. Use of any medication, or food products listed in the excluded medications and dietary products table within 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug. Patient must have no history of amiodarone use in the 6 months before the first dose of TAK385 19. Admission or evidence of alcohol or drug abuse or use of illicit drugs</criteria>
