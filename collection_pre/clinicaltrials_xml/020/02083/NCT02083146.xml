	<brief_summary>Now, adipose tissue is established as an active endocrine organ that controls systemic energy homeostasis by secretion of adipokines. Recently, members of the C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein (CTRP) family have been reported to share structural homology with adiponectin. To date, 15 CTRP family members have been found that might play major roles in metabolism and inflammation. The investigators tried to clarify the relationship between CTRP family and coronary artery disease (CAD) in Korean men and women.</brief_summary>
