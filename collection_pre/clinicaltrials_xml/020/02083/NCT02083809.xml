	<brief_summary>Currently, there is very little research to identify ways to decrease blood loss during D&amp;E (dilation and evacuation) procedures. The objective is to determine whether routine use of intravenous oxytocin will improve bleeding outcomes at the time of D&amp;E at 18-24-weeks gestation. To evaluate the hypothesis, investigators will perform a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The patient will be followed until discharged from the postoperative care unit during which time patient satisfaction, pain score and postoperative bleeding will be assessed.</brief_summary>
