	<detailed_description>The subject included the healthy patients who underwent orthognathic surgery and gave written the informed consent. The sample size was calculate from the amount of fentanyl use in orthognathic surgical case and difference more 30% was significant. Randomization was done by random number table to 2 groups. Both groups received standardized controlled hypotensive anesthesia and surgery. D group used dexmedetomidine as the hypotensive drug and N group use nitroglycerin. The main outcome were the amount of fentanyl use, time to eye opening, follow simple command, extubation, early postoperative pain, and early postoperative amount of pain killer. All recorded by anesthesiologist on data sheet. compare statistical analysis used compare mean by unpaired student t test.</detailed_description>
