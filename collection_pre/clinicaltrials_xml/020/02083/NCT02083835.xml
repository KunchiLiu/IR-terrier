	<brief_title>PAIN OUT: Improvement in Postoperative PAIN OUTcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAIN OUT offers a large registry as well as a system for benchmarking and feedback of outcome quality and decision support in acute pain conditions. It collects demographic, clinical and outcome data, using a validated assessment tool available in multiple languages. The registry part of the project aims at performing population-based research. Furthermore, its infrastructure allows for the conduct of prospective studies comparing the effectiveness of processes of care. The benchmark part of the project provides the medical community with a unique,l user-friendly system to improve treatment of patients with postoperative pain. A web-based information system, featuring three functions, was developed: 1. a feedback and benchmarking system which provides participating sites with continuously updating data and analyses about the quality of care they provide compared to other institutions and allows identification of best clinical practice. 2. a knowledge library which provides clinicians with easily accessible and regularly updated summaries of evidence-based recommendations tailored to specific post-operative situations 3. a clinical decision support system which retrieves on request cases from the registry similar to individual clinical decision situations</detailed_description>
