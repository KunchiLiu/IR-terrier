	<brief_summary>It has been shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (such as ketamine) potentiate analgesic drug's efficacy. Polyamines are allosteric modulators of NMDA receptors. In animal studies, polyamine-free diet has shown antinociceptive properties. This research aims at evaluating analgesic properties of polyamine-low diet after laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed in an ambulatory setting.</brief_summary>
