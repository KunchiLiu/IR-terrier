	<brief_summary>This study will assess the comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of two telemonitoring interventions in reducing blood pressure and recurrent stroke among 450 high-risk Black and Hispanic stroke patients. The primary hypothesis is that home blood pressure telemonitoring supplemented with individualized, culturally tailored telephone-based nurse case management will have greater effects on blood pressure reduction and stroke recurrence and, while it will be more costly, it will also be more cost-effective than home blood pressure telemonitoring alone. Results of this study will provide strong empirical evidence to inform clinical guidelines and practice, which may lead to reductions in stroke disparities in the United States.</brief_summary>
