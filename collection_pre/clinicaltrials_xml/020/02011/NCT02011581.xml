	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn more about how our body produces sugar, breaks down fat for fuel, and makes insulin (the major hormone that controls the production of blood sugar and fat breakdown) during a 24-hour day and how body fat and muscle are involved in these processes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diurnal Variability in the Regulation of Beta-cell Function and Insulin Sensitivity in Overweight People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are diurnal differences in postprandial beta-cell function and hepatic insulin sensitivity and the factors that influence these metabolic functions, including insulin signaling, adipose tissue and systemic inflammation, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(NAD) biosynthesis, and sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1)) in overweight human subjects.</detailed_description>
