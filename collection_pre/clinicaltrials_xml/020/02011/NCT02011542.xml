	<brief_summary>The overall objective is to determine whether Visbiome will improve 1) intestinal symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and 2) non-intestinal symptoms (fatigue, joint pain, insomnia, general stiffness and headache) associated with IBS. All of these symptoms are part of the Gulf War (GW) illness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Probiotic (Visbiome) for Gulf War Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: Aim # 1: Determine the efficacy of Visbiome on IBS symptoms in GW veterans. Hypothesis: Treatment with Visbiome compared to placebo will improve global and individual symptoms of IBS Aim #2 Determine the efficacy Visbiome in reducing non-intestinal symptoms of IBS (fatigue, joint pain, insomnia, general stiffness and headache). Hypothesis: Treatment with Visbiome compared to placebo will improve non-intestinal symptoms of IBS in GW veterans. Aim #3 Determine whether changes in gut flora and plasma cytokines correlate with treatment response in GW veterans.</detailed_description>
