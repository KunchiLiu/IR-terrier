	<brief_summary>This trial is studying Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) for measuring muscle health. The trial is studying people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), other neuromuscular diseases, and healthy volunteers to see if the EIM device can measure disease in muscle tissue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) in ALS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, 9-month study evaluating the effectiveness of electrical impedance myography (EIM) as a diagnostic and disease-tracking tool. In addition, the following will be studied: 1. Determine EIM device's ability to discriminate between ALS and "look-alike" non-fatal, motor-predominant syndromes; 2. Track EIM progression over time and determine the best summary EIM measure that could serve as an endpoint in future clinical trials and individual patient care; and, 3. Determine whether EIM progression is predictive of a combined outcome of survival and progression as measured by ALS Functional Rating Scale, Revised (ALSFRS-R), Hand-held Dynamometry (HHD) and Vital Capacity (VC) measures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Early ALS Sporadic or familial ALS (as defined by revised El Escorial criteria) Onset of weakness or spasticity due to ALS ≤ 36 months prior to the Screening/Baseline Visit. Slow vital capacity (SVC) ≥60% of predicted for gender, height, and age Early ALS The presence of unstable psychiatric disease, cognitive impairment, or dementia that would impair ability of the subject to provide informed consent, or a history of active substance abuse within the prior year. ALS Disease Mimics Diagnosis of one of the following: a. Pure Lower Motor Neuron Disease (LMND) mimics: i. Multifocal motor neuropathy ii. Autoimmune motor neuropathy iii. Cervical or lumbosacral radiculopathies with weakness involving more than one extremity or more than a single myotome if restricted to one extremity. iv. Multiple peripheral mononeuropathies with clinical weakness v. CharcotMarieTooth Disease vi. Any condition that produces generalized or localized weakness without concomitant sensory symptoms, including myasthenia gravis or myopathy, that the evaluating physician deems mimics ALS. b. Pure Upper Motor Neuron Disease (UMND) mimics: i. Cervical myelopathy ii. Multiple sclerosis iii. Hereditary spastic paraparesis ALS Disease Mimics Diagnosis of possible, probable, probablelaboratory supported, or definite ALS Presence of positive family history of ALS. The presence of unstable psychiatric disease, cognitive impairment, or dementia that would impair ability of the subject to provide informed consent, or a history of active substance abuse within the prior year. Healthy Volunteer Absence of a known neurological disorder. Healthy Volunteer History of ALS, myopathy, neuropathy, ALS mimic disorder or other neurodegenerative disease. Presence of positive family history of ALS. The presence of unstable psychiatric disease, cognitive impairment, or dementia that would impair ability of the subject to provide informed consent, or a history of active substance abuse within the prior year. *Please note that this is not a complete listing on all eligibility criteria.*</criteria>
