	<brief_summary>Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) is a common neuropathic disorder in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Study Design: Because micronutrient depletion has been associated with RLS in ESRD and because the vitamin biotin is dialyzable, the investigators examined the relationship between biotin status and RLS in ESRD. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of biotin deficiency in those with and without RLS (Study 1) and to determine the effect of biotin supplementation on RLS symptoms (Study 2) in patients receiving chronic dialysis due to ESRD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis therapy for a duration of at least 3 months. History of consumption of more than 300 micrograms daily of biotin Oral contraceptive therapy containing high amounts of estrogen because studies in rats provide evidence that high doses of steroid hormones reduce biotin status {Wang, 1997 #1634} Women of childbearing age because of concern that biotin deficiency may be teratogenic {Mock, 2009 #2568}.</criteria>
