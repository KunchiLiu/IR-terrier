	<brief_summary>Sinus pilonidal concern 26/100 000 young adults. It manifests after puberty, presenting as an acute abscess in approximately 50% of patients or as a discharging painful sinus. Patients may experience lengthy healing times resulting in considerable morbidity and disruption to a young adult's life. Eradication of pilonidal sinus is based on a wide surgical excision and at the end of the procedure, the wound is dressed with an alginate dressing (AlgosterilÂ®). The objective is to show a better efficiency of Sorbact TM (trademark) dressings compared to Alginates that are standardized dressings after pilonidal sinus excision during a period of 75 days. The main objective is to show a difference of 20% of wounds completely healed in 75 days between the two types of dressing: 50% of wounds healed with Algosteril TM compared to 70% of wounds healed with Sorbact TM.</brief_summary>
