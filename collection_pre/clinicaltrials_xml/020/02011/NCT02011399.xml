	<brief_summary>Sensorimotor (also know as mu) rhythm based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a tool for controlling electronic devices using only brain signals. The Mu rhythm is a naturally occuring wave produced by the brain. This research project will determine how to best train subjects to use the Mu rhythm for computer control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Computer Interfaces (Mu Rhythm Learning)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a method of BCI control, Mu rhythms are difficult to learn and involve extensive training. The investigators want to keep users motivated and determine the best way to provide effective training. Healthy users will be trained to control a computer by wearing an electrode cap that is connected to a computer. They will have their levels of motivation and interest measured while learning to use the Mu rhythm. Two different types of learning programs will be used to determine which is most effective for Mu rhythm training. This method will be used for device control by people with severe physical impairments, who may be able to communicate or carry out other desired tasks using a BCI.</detailed_description>
