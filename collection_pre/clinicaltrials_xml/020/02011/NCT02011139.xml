	<brief_summary>Depression is common in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and has a negative effect on the quality of life, functional ability, and mortality, with a prevalence rate as high as 20-25%. However, it is hard to use anti-depressant due to the safety issue, and there has been little data so far particularly in terms of randomized clinical trials. Here, we investigate the effect of cognitive-behavioral group therapy for enhancing mental health and quality of life in patients with ESRD.</brief_summary>
