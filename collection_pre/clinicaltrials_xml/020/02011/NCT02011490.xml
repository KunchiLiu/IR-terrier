	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg/kg intravenous (IV) dose of sugammadex in participants with moderate and severe renal insufficiency compared to that in participants with normal renal function. The study consists of two parts. In Part 1, participants with renal insufficiency and healthy participants will be administered study drug by IV bolus injection into a peripheral vein. In Part 2, participants with renal insufficiency and healthy participants will be administered study drug as an IV bolus into a peripheral vein, through an IV catheter connected to IV tubing with injection port. Subjects who participate in Part 1 of study may be enrolled in Part 2, which would reduce the overall number of participants enrolled for the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All Participants: Body Mass Index ≥18 to ≤40 kg/m^2 Females of childbearing potential must either be sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14 days prior to dosing and throughout the study or are using an acceptable birth control method Females of nonchildbearing potential must have undergone a sterilization procedure at least 6 months prior to dosing or are postmenopausal with amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior to dosing and have follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels consistent with postmenopausal status Male subjects must agree not to donate sperm from dosing until 90 days after dosing Participants with Moderate or Severe Renal Insufficiency: Health of participant is stable based on medical history, laboratory tests and other assessments Clinical diagnosis of impaired stable renal function, and a creatinine clearance (CLcr) of &lt;30 mL/min and not on hemodialysis for severe renal insufficiency participants, or 30 to &lt;50 mL/min for moderate renal insufficiency participants No clinically significant change in renal status for at least 1 month prior to dosing, and is not currently or has not previously been on hemodialysis Healthy Control Participants: Participant is medically healthy based on laboratory tests and other assessments Age of the individual healthy participants in Part 1 of the study is aimed to be within the range of the mean age ± approximately 15 years of all participants with renal impairment in Part 1 of the study combined; this approach will also be applied with respect to age of participants in Part 2 of the study CLcr ≥80 mL/min All Participants: Mentally or legally incapacitated, significant emotional problems at screening or expected during the conduct of the study or history of a clinically significant psychiatric disorder over the last 5 years History or presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, or neurological disease whose current condition is considered unstable History or presence of alcoholism and drug abuse within the past 6 months History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to the study medication or related compounds Female participants who are pregnant or lactating Positive results for the urine or saliva drug screen, or for the urine or breath alcohol screen Positive results at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) Regular user of any medication (including over the counter) that would significantly alter renal function (e.g., cimetidine) Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing, or donation of plasma within 7 days prior to dosing Participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to dosing No participant may be enrolled more than once within Part 1. Subjects who participate in Part 1 of study may be enrolled in Part 2, but participants within Part 2 are not to be enrolled more than once in Part 2 Healthy Control Participants: Participant has had a renal transplant or has had nephrectomy</criteria>
