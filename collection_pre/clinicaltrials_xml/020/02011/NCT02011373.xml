	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is the consensual attitude of choice in genital prolapse but incurs problems of tolerance of implanted material. As an alternative to stapling and suturing, which cause vaginal erosion, we present a fixation technique using a sterile synthetic liquid tissue glue: IFABONDâ„¢. A non-randomised prospective multicenter study will assess efficacy in terms of 12-month failure of prolapse correction.</brief_summary>
