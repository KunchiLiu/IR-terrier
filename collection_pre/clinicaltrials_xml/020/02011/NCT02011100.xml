	<brief_summary>Carnosine is a naturally occurring compound with a potential health benefits. In animal studies, carnosine supplementation reduces manifestation of chronic civilization diseases, regulates subclinical inflammation, protein glycation and lipid &amp; glucose metabolism. Our preliminary data showed the relationship between insulin resistance and carnosine content in human skeletal muscle. Based on these unique results we plan to perform intervention study aimed at identifying effects of carnosine on insulin sensitivity and secretion, which might reduce the development of T2D in obese. Similar metabolic effects of vitamin D3 were associated with expression of specific miRNAs. Circulating miRNAs related to carnosine action are unknown. The putative positive effects of carnosine on insulin sensitivity and secretion in obese patients might have a tremendous impact in prevention of type 2 diabetes. Identification of miRNAs associated with carnosine action could provide predictors of successful therapy.</brief_summary>
