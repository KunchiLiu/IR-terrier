	<brief_summary>this study has the aim to analize the correlation between three different methods of mesh fixation ( using absorbable or non absorbable sutures or fibrin biological glue) and recurrance and chronic pain ,in the Lichtenstein anterior inguinal erniorrhaphy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Absorbable Sutures , Non Absorbable Sutures or Biologic Fibrin Glue for Protesic Mesh Fixing in Lichtenstein Technique for Primitive Groin Hernia Repair: a Randomized Prospective Multicentric Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the last decades the rate of recurrence in the anterior inguinal erniorraphy has been drastically lowered with the introduction of the mesh , on the other hand the rate of chronic pain is reported to be high in many papers. The chronic pain influences the quality of life and what's more causes an increase in the social costs. the classical Lichtenstein inguinal anterior erniorrhaphy , wich is the technique suggested by the international guidelines, expected to fix the mesh with non absorbable sutures . The investigators would analyze the possible correlation between the method of mesh fixation and chronic pain keeping a lower rate of recurrence. That said the primary endpoint in this study is the rate of recurrence and the secondary endpoint is the rate of chronic pain after lichtenstein anterior inguinal erniorrhaphy in the three different methods of fixation of the mesh</detailed_description>
