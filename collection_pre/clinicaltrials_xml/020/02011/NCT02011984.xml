	<brief_summary>Non-randomized multicenter post-market study to confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of the CE-approved Camouflage-coated self-expandable RESISTANT Camouflage stent system for revascularization of de novo stenotic lesions in the superficial femoral artery in 100 compliant patients suitable for stent angioplasty. The CE-approved device will be used according to its intended use. Beyond the standard of care no further interventions are scheduled. Therefore, this trial is subject to the exception to the rule §23b of the German Medical Device Act (MPG), which includes the national implementation of EC directive 93/42/EEC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicentric Non-randomized Investigation of RESISTANT Camouflage Stent-system</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this non-randomized post-market clinical follow-up study is to confirm long-term safety and effectiveness of the CE-approved Camouflage-coated self expandable RESISTANT Camouflage stent system for revascularization of de novo stenotic lesions in superficial femoral artery in 120 compliant patients suitable for stent angioplasty. The primary end point is the target lesion revascularization after 12 months. Further follow-ups are scheduled at discharge, 30 days, 6 and 24 months.</detailed_description>
