	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to estimate the incidence and prevalence of Internal Rotation Deficit (IRD) defined by a measure of IRD 2 (Internal Rotation Deficit in position 2) strictly greater than 20 ° in a population of advanced-level handball players over a training season.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are : A- To estimate and compare the prevalence of Internal Rotation Deficit within groups B- To assess the association between the Internal Rotation Deficit and the appearance of a shoulder pain and/or discomfort when throwing C- To assess the association between Internal Rotation Deficit and the appearance of a shoulder pathology demonstrated by clinical examination by at least one abnormality in one of the following three tests: the arming apprehension test, the relocation test or the O'Brien test D- Assess changes in values of IRD 2, the ratio IRD 2/GRE 2, and the Total Range of Motion over the training season E- Evaluate the association between the values of IRD 2 and the appearance of shoulder pain or discomfort when throwing F- To evaluate the association between IRD 2 values and the appearance of a shoulder pathology (at least one anomaly in one of three tests: the arming apprehension test, the relocation test or the O'Brien test). G- To assess the association between values of the IRD 2/GRE 2 ratio and the appearance of shoulder pain or discomfort when throwing H- To assess the association between values of the IRD 2/GRE 2 ratio and the appearance of a shoulder pathology (at least one anomaly in one of three tests: the arming apprehension test, the relocation test or the O'Brien test). I- To estimate the optimal threshold value of the IRD 2/GRE 2 ratio that would define an Internal Rotation Deficit in a more relevant fashion as compred to the IRD 2 alone</detailed_description>
