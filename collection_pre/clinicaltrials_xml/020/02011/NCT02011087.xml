	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies bioelectrical impedance phase angle in predicting treatment outcome in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy. Diagnostic procedures, such as bioelectrical impedance analysis, may help predict a patient's response to treatment for small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioelectrical Impedance Phase Angle in Predicting Treatment Outcome in Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving First-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the association between phase angle (PA) measurement and progression-free survival (PFS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the association between PA measurement and treatment-related outcomes of treatment response, adverse treatment events, and overall survival (OS). II. To determine the feasibility of obtaining PA measurements at a single time point in patients undergoing evaluation in thoracic oncology clinics. OUTLINE: Patients undergo bioelectrical impedance phase angle measurement on day 1 of treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for two years.</detailed_description>
