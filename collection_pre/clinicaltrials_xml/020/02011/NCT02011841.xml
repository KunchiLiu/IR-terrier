	<brief_title>Rifaximin for the Secondary Prevention of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis Recurrence in Cirrhotic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Rifaximin is an antibiotic with a broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, both aerobes and anaerobes within the gastrointestinal tract. The main advantage of rifaximin is that it is poorly absorbable, which minimizes the antimicrobial resistance and adverse events and renders the drug safe in all patient populations. In addition, rifaximin has a better activity against gram-positive organisms than norfloxacin. - The appreciation of the potential role of enteric flora in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal diseases has broadened the clinical use of rifaximin, which is now used for hepatic encephalopathy, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and Clostridium difficile infection. Theoretically, by reducing the total number of the gut bacteria, rifaximin could also be used to achieve intestinal decontamination in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites, thus preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. - A small retrospective study concluded that rifaximin suppresses intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bacterial translocation in cirrhotic patients with ascites with no history of previous spontaneous bacterial peritonitis episodes. Prospective clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the role of rifaximin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence in cirrhotic patients.</detailed_description>
