	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate mechanical hypoalgesic effect of neural mobilization in asymptomatic subjects. We also compared neural gliding versus neural stretching to see which produced greater hypoalgesic effects in asymptomatic subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asymptomatic subjects will be randomly allocated into three groups: the neural glide group; the neural stretch group; and the placebo group. Each subject will receive one treatment session. Outcome measures included bilateral pressure pain threshold measured at the trigeminal, cervical, and tibialis anterior points, which will assess pre-treatment and immediately post-treatment by a blinded assessor. Three-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate changes in pressure pain threshold, with group (experimental or control) as the between-subjects variable and time (pre-, post-treatment) or side (dominant, nondominant) as the within-subjects variable.</detailed_description>

All patients recruited for the study complained of pain localized in the neck and/or head region. Initial screening was accomplished by telephone and eligible persons attended a evaluation appointment. development of systemic or degenerative diseases subjects with symptoms of depression according Beck's questionnaire pain in any area between the lower back and head in the last 9 months traumatic event in the past 12 months history of neck or face pain in the last 6 months</criteria>
