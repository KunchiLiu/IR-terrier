	<brief_title>A Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study in Subjects at High Risk of Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Undergoing Intraocular Lens Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OMS302 is a mydriatic/anti-inflammatory combination investigational drug product being developed for use during intraoperative lens replacement (ILR). This study evaluates the effect of OMS302 on the signs of Floppy Iris Syndrome in subjects with a history of tamsulosin exposure who are undergoing ILR.</detailed_description>

Indicate they understand and are able, willing, and likely to fully comply with study procedures and restrictions. 4. Are male and 18 years of age or older at the time of surgery. 5. Are to undergo unilateral primary ILR, under topical anesthesia, with insertion of an intraocular lens. 6. Have a bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/400 or better in the nonstudy eye. 7. Have an intraocular pressure (IOP) between 5 mm Hg and 22 mm Hg, inclusive, in the study eye. 8. Is currently and has been taking tamsulosin (Flomax®) for at least six months. 1. Hypersensitivity to phenylephrine, ketoprofen, bromfenac, or other NSAIDs, including aspirin. 2. Hypersensitivity to tetracaine, lidocaine, ophthalmic viscoelastic devices (such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or hyaluronic acid or latex.. 3. Presence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological, endocrine, neurological, psychiatric, respiratory or other medical condition that could increase the risk to the subject as determined by the Investigator. 4. Presence of any connective tissue disorder (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia). 5. Presence of systolic blood pressure of greater than 170 mmHg or less than 90 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure of greater than110 mmHg or less than 40 mmHg at the screening visit. 6. Use of phenylephrine in the study eye (other than for the screening ophthalmological examination) within seven days prior to the day of surgery. 7. Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors within 21 days prior to the day of surgery. 8. Use of pilocarpine in the study eye within seven days prior to the day of surgery. 9. Presence of narrowangle glaucoma or unstable glaucoma. 10. Glaucoma being treated with prostaglandins or prostaglandin analogues such as Xalatan®, Lumigan®, Travatan®, and Rescula®, or Alphagan® (brimonidine tartrate) in either eye during the seven days prior to screening and through Day 7 postoperatively. 11. Presence of pseudocapsular exfoliation in either eye. 12. History of iritis, or of any ocular trauma with iris damage in the study eye. 13. Presence of uncontrolled chronic ocular diseases in either eye that could affect pupil dilation. 14. Presence of active corneal pathology in either eye (except superficial punctate keratopathy in the nonstudy eye). 15. Presence of extraocular/intraocular inflammation in either eye. 16. Presence of active bacterial and/or viral infection in either eye. 17. Participating in any investigational drug or device trial within the 30 days prior to the day of surgery. 18. History of intraocular nonlaser surgery in the study eye within the three months prior to the day of surgery, or intraocular laser surgery in the study eye within 30 days prior to the day of surgery. 19. Presence of any condition that the Investigator believes would put the subject at risk or confound the interpretation of the study data. 20. Investigators, employees of the investigative site, and their immediate families. Immediate family is defined as the Investigator's or employees' current spouse, parent, natural or legally adopted child (including a stepchild living in the Investigator's household), grandparent, or grandchild. 21.
