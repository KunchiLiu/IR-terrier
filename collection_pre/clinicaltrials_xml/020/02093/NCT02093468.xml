	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MST-188 in subjects receiving catheter-directed rt-PA for acute lower limb ischemia and to evaluate whether treatment with MST-188 results in more rapid thrombolysis of the occlusion and more rapid tissue perfusion in the effected blood vessel.</brief_summary>
