	<brief_title>Assessing the Severity of Metabolic-related Liver Injuries in Aging HIV-monoinfected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a cross-sectional, multicentre study including 7 centres from 3 European countries (Belgium, France, Germany). The maximum duration of the study for each patient will be 4 months, consisting of: - a screening visit, - an inclusion visit to perform the biologic tests and exams necessary for the study, within 1 month after the screening visit, - a result delivery visit within 1 month after inclusion visit, to disclose results of previous investigations. Patients with one or two non invasive markers suggesting significant fibrosis (≥F2) will be invited for liver biopsy within the next 2 months. - a "liver biopsy" visit, within 2 months after visit 2, liver biopsy in selected and consented patients</detailed_description>
