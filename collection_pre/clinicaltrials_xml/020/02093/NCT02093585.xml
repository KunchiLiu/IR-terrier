	<brief_summary>Some but not all observational studies have found that current exposure to abacavir is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. This study aim to investigate possible adverse effect of abacavir on platelet reactivity, coagulation and endothelial activation in HIV-1 infected patients. The study is an open-labeled cross-over trial, where patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing abacavir switch treatment to a regimen containing tenofovir and vice versa for a period of 90 days.</brief_summary>
