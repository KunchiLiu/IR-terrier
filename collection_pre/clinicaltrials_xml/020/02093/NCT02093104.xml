	<brief_title>TACE Study-Liver Embolization Perfusion (VGH Radiology LIU)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood flow imaging for liver tumors is normally carried out using clinical Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems prior to going to the cath lab. This study aims to determine if measuring flow using a C-arm system and/or CT perfusion can be used to improve diagnosis and evaluation of liver tumors. The major difference between C-arm CT systems and clinical CT systems is the difference in imaging speed. We have developed a new approach that should allow us to overcome this speed limitation. The major difference between conventional CT versus CT perfusion is the obtaining of an extra series of images. CT perfusion results in an increase in the amount of radiation exposure during the CT scan that measures the blood flow of the targeted tumor; however, CT perfusion is much faster than conventional CT. Prospective participants are being invited to the study because part of the treatment towards the tumour therapy involves obtaining an angiogram.</detailed_description>
