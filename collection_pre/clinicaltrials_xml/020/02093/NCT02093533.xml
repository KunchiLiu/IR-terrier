	<brief_summary>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is the third or fourth leading cause of end stage renal disease among the primary glomerulonephritis. Hyperactivation of the alternative complement pathway and familial forms for all types of MPGN have been reported suggesting that genetic abnormalities may play a predisposing role to the disease. In recent case reports Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to C5 to prevent formation of the membrane attack complex ,is a safe and effective therapy.</brief_summary>
