	<brief_summary>Prospective cohort study evaluating the role of leptin receptors in the bariatric surgical population compared with non obese controls. Additionally serum levels of leptin, ghrelin, motilin and PYY will be compared amongst the different BMI classes and a quality of life questionnaire completed by all participants. The hypothesis is that obese individuals have lower leptin receptors in enterocytes which is partially responsible for the higher serum leptin levels without appropriate control of satiety.</brief_summary>
