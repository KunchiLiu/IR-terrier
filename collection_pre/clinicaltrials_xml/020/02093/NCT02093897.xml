	<brief_summary>This is an international, multicenter, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rVIII-SingleChain in pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A. A minimum of 25 previously treated subjects â‰¥ 6 to &lt; 12 years of age and at least 25 subjects &lt; 6 years of age who have undergone &gt; 50 exposure days (EDs) with a previous Factor VIII (FVIII) product are planned to be enrolled. Subjects will be assigned to either an on-demand or prophylaxis treatment regimen and will receive rVIII-SingleChain at a dose to be determined by the investigator. Hemostatic efficacy will be assessed by the subject/caregiver and the investigator who will assess overall efficacy by a 4-point scale.</brief_summary>
