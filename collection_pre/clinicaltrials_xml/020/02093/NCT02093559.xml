	<brief_summary>REBOOT is a pilot randomized trial of a repeated-dose brief intervention to reduce overdose and risk behaviors among naloxone recipients (REBOOT). It includes an established overdose education curriculum within an Informational-Motivation-Behavior (IMB) model. This study will test the feasibility of an efficacy trial of REBOOT vs treatment as usual (information and referrals) that will evaluate overdose events (non-fatal or death), drug use cessation, and overdose and HIV risk behaviors, among opioid-dependent persons who have previously overdosed and already received take-home naloxone (the opioid antagonist used to reverse overdose).</brief_summary>
