	<brief_summary>Almost all of antipsychotics can induce metabolic syndrome,Genetic factors play a key role in the development of metabolic syndrome,TCF7L2 and SLC30A8 are strongestly correlated with metabolic syndrome.Moreover,Antipsychotics have an effect on the expression of TCF7L2 and SLC30A8 genes.It indicates the variations of TCF7L2 and SLC30A8 play an important part in the development of antipsychotics-induced metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Mechanism of TCF7L2 and SLC30A8 on Antipsychotic-induced Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- In this study, we will determine the effect of olanzapine on the expression of TCF7L2 and SLC30A8. - The relationship of the polymorphism of TCF7L2 and SLC30A8 with antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients.</detailed_description>
