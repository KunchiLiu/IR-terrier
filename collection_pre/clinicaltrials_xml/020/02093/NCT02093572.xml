	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the disruption of the "normal" (three meals a day) eating pattern and prolonged overnight fasting caused by skipping breakfast: i) alters the expression of specific clock genes and clock gene targets involved in regulating adipose tissue lipolysis (breakdown or destruction); ii) increases basal adipose tissue lipolytic (breakdown) activity and plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations; iii) reduces skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity; and iv) increases daylong plasma glucose, FFA, and insulin concentrations. The investigator will do this by studying healthy, lean persons either randomized to consume either 3 standard meals per day or omit breakfast and consume 2 meals per day without changing daily calorie intake (skipping breakfast group).</brief_summary>
