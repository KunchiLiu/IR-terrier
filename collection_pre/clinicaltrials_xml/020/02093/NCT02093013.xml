	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to implement and evaluate an integrated care program for enhancing the care of patients with asthma in a region of Quebec province, Canada. The investigators will implement our intervention in a family medicine group practice setting and plan to deliver it to 150 experimental group subjects. The investigators will simultaneously study 300 control subjects who are receiving usual care in other regions of the province of Quebec. Our hypothesis is that the program will improve the quality of life of patients with asthma exposed to the program, asthma control, inhaled corticosteroid adherence, knowledge of asthma, and a number of variables that relate to the conceptual model selected as a framework for this study (the PRECEDE-PROCEED model of Green and Kreuter).</brief_summary>
