	<brief_summary>Physician manned rapid response vehicles are a limited resource in the prehospital handling of acute patients. In this study mobile videoconferencing between ambulances and the rapid response vehicles enables patient consultation at a distance. Video consultation between patient and the prehospital physician can take place when the patient is at home or in the ambulance. The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of video consultation between physician manned rapid response vehicles and patients receiving treatment by ambulance personnel on the number of patients receiving final treatment on-site in the pre-hospital setting</brief_summary>
