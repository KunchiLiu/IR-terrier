	<criteria>Have been diagnosed with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk (NRS â‰¥ 5) which has been refractory to conservative therapy for a minimum of 90 days. Be an appropriate candidate for the surgical procedures required in this study based on the clinical judgment of the implanting physician Be 22 years of age or older at the time of enrollment Be willing and capable of giving informed consent Be willing and able to comply with studyrelated requirements, procedures, and visits Have a medical condition or pain in other area(s), not intended to be treated with SCS, that could interfere with study procedures, accurate pain reporting, and/or confound evaluation of study endpoints, as determined by the Investigator Have evidence of an active disruptive psychological or psychiatric disorder or other known condition significant enough to impact perception of pain, compliance of intervention and/or ability to evaluate treatment outcome, as determined by a psychologist Have previous spinal cord stimulation trial or is already implanted with an active implantable device(s) (e.g. pacemaker, drug pump, implantable pulse generator) Have a current systemic infection, or local infection in close proximity to anticipated surgical field Pregnant or plan to get pregnant during the course of the study or not using adequate contraception.
