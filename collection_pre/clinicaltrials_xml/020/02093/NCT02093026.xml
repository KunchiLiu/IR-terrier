	<brief_summary>This study will assess the long-term safety and efficacy of repeat treatment courses of rituximab, in combination with methotrexate in a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) inadequate responder population of participants who were previously randomized into studies WA16291 (NCT02693210) or WA17043/U2644g (NCT00074438). The study permits multiple re-treatments until the protocol-defined end-of-treatment date (31 December 2011). Participants will then enter a safety follow-up (SFU) period of at least 48 weeks. This will provide at least 7 years follow-up data on all participants initially randomized into WA16291 or WA17043/U2644g. Approximately 600 participants will potentially be eligible to enter this open label extension study from their respective feeder studies.</brief_summary>
