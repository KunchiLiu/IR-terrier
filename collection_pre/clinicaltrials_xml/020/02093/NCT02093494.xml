	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open label study to evaluate the Initial Specimen Diversion Device (ISDD) in reducing the contamination rate in blood culture analysis. Blood culture data will be derived from inpatient and/or outpatient settings in a variety of hospital departments (e.g. ER, surgical, medical, etc.). Only samples that are collected via PIVC's may be included in this study. The ISDD will be compared to current laboratory practices for the collection of blood for culture purposes. Laboratory Standard Procedures (LSP) is defined as collection of venipuncture blood for culture without an initial diversion method to divert and sequester potential blood contaminants.</brief_summary>
