	<detailed_description>1. Type of study Nutritional intervention study, multicenter, randomized, blinded, parallel group included 25 women per group - Group 1: 3x109 cfu / day (n = 25) - Group 2: 6x109 cfu / day (n = 25) - Group 3: 9x109 cfu / day (n = 25) - Group 4: placebo (n = 25) 2. Statistical calculation of sample size. The calculation of sample size was calculated by the company SEPLIN Solutions Statistics. The primary endpoint was the bacterial count of in milk. The sample size obtained to observe a difference of 1 log10, with a power of 0.80 and a significance level of 0.05 was 20 volunteers per group. 3. Randomization Randomization was performed using a list of random numbers generated by computer. Subjects will be randomized in a strictly sequential. If a subject is removed from the test, the number that was assigned randomization not be reused again. 4. Overall design and outline of the study At visit 1 we require the informed consent of the patient. It will take the milk sample, we will review the implementation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Be randomized and explain the treatment guidelines to be followed, the data to be collected and medical appointments that must go (2 and 3 weeks). It will complete the pain assessment questionnaire (MQP) and nutrition survey. On visits 2, 3 and 4 corresponding to 1, 2 and 3 weeks of intervention will collect milk sample pain assessment survey and nutrition survey. Milk samples (5 mL) were collected aseptically in sterile tubes to be frozen immediately until analysis to be carried out within seven days. 5. Intervention duration The intervention will last three weeks.</detailed_description>
