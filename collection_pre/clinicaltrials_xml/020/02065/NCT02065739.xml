	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), study in healthy male participants. This study will consist of a screening phase (between 21 and 2 days prior to the first dose administration of JNJ-42165279), a 2-period (Period 1: Day 1 to Day 3 and Period 2: Day 4 to Day 10) open-label treatment phase, and a follow-up phase (within 7 to 14 days after the last dose of JNJ-42165279). A single 30-mg dose of JNJ-42165279 will be administered on Day 1 of Period 1. During Period 2, the administration of oral itraconazole 200 mg once a day will start on Day 4. A second single oral 30-mg dose of JNJ-42165279 will be administered on Day 8 together with the dose of 200 mg itraconazole. Sixteen healthy participants will be enrolled in this study. Safety assessments will include assessment of adverse events, supine vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory testing and physical examinations. The maximum study duration for each participant will be approximately 7 weeks.</detailed_description>
