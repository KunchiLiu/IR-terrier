	<brief_summary>Children with thalassemia may have high iron levels after receiving blood transfusions. These high iron levels can have damaging effects on the body, especially the heart. Conventionally only chelation therapy was given for prevention of iron buildup in the heart. However, current research has shown that another drug, amlodipine, also helps to slow down the deposition of iron in the heart. This study is designed to see if patients receiving amlodipine along with their regular chelation therapy have a slower rate of iron buildup in the heart when compared with patients who are receiving chelation only.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amlodipine for Myocardial Iron in Thalassemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Null Hypothesis There is no difference between the efficacy of chelation plus amlodipine therapy and chelation therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in thalassemia patients with iron overload and a constant transfusion need. Alternate Hypothesis Chelation plus amlodipine therapy is more efficacious than chelation therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in thalassemia patients with iron overload and a constant transfusion need. The aim of the investigators study is to determine if amlodipine, an L-type specific calcium channel blocker, in addition to the standard aggressive chelation therapy, can retard the deposition of iron in the myocardium of thalassemia patients with significant myocardial iron load with or without cardiomyopathy.</detailed_description>
