	<brief_summary>This is a study of the effects of weight loss and exercise training on glucose control as measured by the Hemoglobin A 1 C in individuals with recently diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes. Study outcomes are measured at 6 months. The primary outcome is the HBA1c at 6-months. Secondary outcomes include body weight, fitness, lipid profiles and HS-CRP, a measure of inflammation. The study hypothesis is that the program of weight loss and exercise will put &gt;50% of individuals into "remission" of their type 2 Diabetes as measured by a HBA1c of &lt; 6.5%.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a study of the effects of weight loss and exercise training on glucose control as measured by the Hemoglobin A 1 C in individuals with recently diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes.

The study hypothesis is that the program of weight loss and exercise will put &gt;50% of individuals into "remission" of their type 2 Diabetes as measured by a HBA1c of &lt; 6.5%. The study replicates the clinical situation where selected patients with new type 2 diabetes, who are motivated to try an intensive lifestyle intervention, might replicate our study intervention if we are able to show a high remission rate (e.g. &gt; 50%) for individuals in the study.</detailed_description>
