	<brief_summary>Regular consumption of a beverage containing Î²-cryptoxanthin (b-Cx) and plant sterols (Ps) has been shown to exert a synergic effect in reducing cardiovascular risk and bone remodeling markers (formation and resorption). The present project aims to assess the influence of technological treatment and genetic variability on the bioavailability and the health effects of the added components (Ps, b-Cx), in particular to their potential role in prevalent disorders.In vitro and in vivo studies will be carried out to this effect. In vitro and in vivo studies (human intervention study) will be performed and cardiovascular, bone turnover and inflammation markers will be evaluated. Additionally, an in vitro colonic fermentation model and cell cultures will be used to explore anticarcinogenic effects and potential cytotoxicity.</brief_summary>
