	<brief_summary>Groin hernia repair is a common procedure performed in approximately 2,000 patients per one million inhabitants. Severe chronic pain following groin hernia repair is seen in 2-5% of the patients indicating that a large number of patients each year suffer from debilitating reduction in health-related quality of life. This study examines the effect of ultra-sound guided blocks with local anesthesia in the groin in regard to pain relief and sleep quality. The hypothesis of the study is that a block will confer significant pain relief to patients with severe chronic pain following open groin hernia repair.</brief_summary>
