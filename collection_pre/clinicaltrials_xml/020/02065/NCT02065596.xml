	<brief_summary>This is a phase I/II study of patients with sickle cell disease. It aims to find out if people with sickle cell disease can be cured by changing their immune system before they have blood stem cell transplants. Doctors will give patients a new drug (fludarabine) to see if this drug changes patients immune system and reduces the patient's cells (host) from rejecting donor cells (graft) after the patient gets a Hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective 1. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) after treatment with fludarabine in adult patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Secondary Objective(s), in HSCT for SCD 1. To evaluate the rates of disease-free and overall survival in both MSD and alternate graft donor (MUD, haploidentical, or cord blood-derived) recipients 2. To evaluate fertility in matched sibling and alternate-donor graft recipients 3. To evaluate GVHD rates in MSD and Alternate Graft Donor recipients in SCD. 4. To evaluate cerebral, pulmonary, renal, and generalized vasculopathy before and after HSCT in SCD. 5. To evaluate hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis before and before HSCT in SCD. 6. Modulation of SCD Phenotype by Allogeneic Transplantation. Rigorous clinical follow-up will be performed, per routine care, to evaluate those consequences of SCD that will be modified by allogeneic transplantation in the short-term (4-12 weeks), in the medium-term (12-24 weeks) and in the long-term (&gt;24 weeks). Short-term changes would include disappearance of stress hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis; medium- and long-term changes would include effects on pain, fertility (TSH, LH), cognition (routine cognitive assessments), and end-organ damage (including urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios and tricuspid regurgitant jet velocities, as indicated). Procedures: The study will start with at least 10 and up to 25 patients. They will be given the lowest starting dose of fludarabine. This is done to make sure it is safe. Researchers will watch the patients during what is called the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period. Their safety will be monitored by a Safety Monitoring Committee, which is made up of people who run research studies. The study will not take new patients until the DLT period is done. If at least 3 of the 10 patients enrolled do not benefit, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be considered exceeded. After the DLT period is complete, patients will receive a stem cell transplant from a genetically matched donor. Patients will be continued to be monitored for a year after the transplant. To prepare for the transplant patients will have to undergo the following treatments: - an exchange transfusion - a stem cell graft infusion from either a: - perfectly matched sibling donor (called MSD), - perfectly matched but unrelated donor (called MUD), - a half-matched related donor (called Haploidentical), or - a cord blood donor - rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) - cytoxan (a type of chemotherapy) - Fludarabine (you get this medicine a few weeks before transplant and again, as part of the routine chemotherapy treatment). This is the main drug being studies in this research - total body irradiation (also called TBI) - tacrolimus, mycophenolate (MMF) and/or methotrexate (MTX). These drugs will weaken your immune system. They are given to lower your chances of getting GVHD and rejecting the donor cells. Patients will be in the study for approximately 14 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have one of the following inherited hemoglobin gene disorders: a. Hemoglobin SS b. Hemoglobin SC c. Hemoglobin SBetazeroThalassemia or d. Hemoglobin SBetaplus Thalassemia with an episode of multiorgan failure within 5 years of eligibility Low Risk (Red Light. Stop and consider therapy closely): Must have matched sibling donor grafts, failed conventional therapy as determined by the PI, and evidence for morbid disease (one of the following): a. 2 or more painful episode/year (requiring Emergency Department or inpatient care) x 2 years or b. 1 or more diagnoses of Acute Chest Syndrome within 5 years, or c. 2year mortality 510% or d. Baseline LDH&gt;600 IU or e. History of sepsis, with or without a WBC&gt;13.5, or f. On chronic transfusions Moderate Risk (Yellow Light. Reasonable to proceed, but with caution): May have alternate donor grafts (haploidentical or matched unrelated donor), if MSD is not available. Must have history of highlevel vasculopathy, as defined by at least one of the criteria below: a. Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio of &gt;300mg/g or eGFR 5090 ml/min x 2 evaluations within 3 months or b. History of overt clinical stroke, or progressive cerebral vasculopathy radiographically or c. 2 or more diagnoses of Acute Chest Syndrome within 5 years, or d. Excessively morbid disease manifest as VOCs at a rate of 2 or more per year x 2years or uncontolled retinal disease attributed to SCD. These patients can be considered for moderaterisk alternate donor transplants. The palliative nature of the transplant will be explicit in the consent. e. 2year mortality &gt;1015% f.

Patients must have adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function as defined below: Direct bilirubin within 2.5 X normal institutional limits ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine clearance &gt;21 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine clearance values below 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, the principal investigator may use discretion for appropriate fludarabine dose adjustment as noted. Contraception/Child Bearing The effects of Fludarabine, cytoxan, ATG, tacrolimus/sirolimus and MTX are cumulatively known to be deleterious to the health of the developing human fetus. For this reason, and because of teratogenic potential, all women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (double barrier method of birth control or abstinence) for the duration of study participation and for 12 months after completing treatment. Performance Status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 2 Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Red cell alloimmunization to a degree that precludes extended transfusion Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Subjects must not have evidence of impaired liver function due to iron overload, +/ hepatitis. Patients will be evaluated by liver consult if ferritin &gt;1500, history of hepatitis,or ALTis ≥3 X Upper limit of normal (ULN). Recommended evaluations could include liver biopsy if there is evidence for significant hepatic iron deposition or fibrosis/cirrhosis on T2* MRI of the liver. eGFR &lt;21 ml/min ≥2.0 literperminute pm home oxygen requirement An estimated Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ≤40% (echo or MUGA) Hepatic cirrhosis (Biopsy Proven) HIV positive, ineligible because of the increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated Red cell alloimmunization to a degree that precludes extended transfusion Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because the immunomodulatory treatment, preparative regimen, and antiGVH therapy contain agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Further, this treatment, if indicated, is for a chronic condition, and can be delayed until the pregnancy has been successfully concluded. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. Evidence of uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections (currently taking medication and progression of clinical symptoms) within 1 month prior to starting the conditioning regimen. Patients with fever or suspected minor infection should await resolution of symptoms before starting the conditioning regimen. Prior allogeneic marrow or stem cell transplantation.</criteria>
