	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic, Efficacy and Safety of BT524 in Patients With Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study is designed as a prospective, open-label, multicentre, phase I/III study investigating the 14 day single-dose pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy and safety of BT524 following intravenous administration in the treatment or prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with congenital afibrinogenemia or severe congenital hypofibrinogenemia.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Known congenital afibrinogenemia or severe congenital hypofibrinogenemia Plasma fibrinogen activity ≤ 0.5 g/l and antigen ≤ 0.5 g/l Male or female Age 6 to 75 years, with the first ten patients will be 18 years or older Presumed to be compliant with the study procedures and to terminate the study as scheduled Willing and able to be hospitalized for 3 days for the pharmacokinetic assessment (if applicable) Willing and able to be hospitalized if required in case of interventions (e.g., surgical procedures, major bleeds) Written informed consent by the patient, his/her parents or by the patient's legal / authorized representative as applicable Known congenital dysfibrinogenemia Known bleeding disorder other than congenital fibrinogen deficiency History of esophageal variceal bleeding Known presence or history of venous/arterial thrombosis or thromboembolic event in the preceding 6 months Known presence or history of fibrinogen inhibitory antibodies Known presence or history of hypersensitivity to human fibrinogen or human plasma proteins e.g., immunoglobulins, vaccines or hypersensitivity to any of the excipients Known positive serology for HIV1 and HIV2 Clinically relevant biochemical or hematological findings (except due to underlying disease or emergency bleeding) outside the normal range (at the investigator's discretion) Clinically relevant pathological findings in physical examination including electrocardiogram (ECG) Treatment with any fibrinogen concentrate and/or fibrinogencontaining product within 2 weeks prior to infusion of BT524 Concomitant medication interacting relevantly with the coagulation system (e.g., low molecular weight heparin, unfractioned heparin, factor Xa inhibitors, factor IIa inhibitors or PY12 inhibitors) within 2 weeks prior to infusion of BT524 Recent vaccination (within 3 weeks prior to infusion) Body weight below 22 kg End stage disease Abuse of drugs Unable to understand and follow the study requirements Participation in another interventional clinical study within 30 days before entering the study or during the study Pregnant/ nursing woman, or woman of childbearing potential not using reliable/ effective contraceptive method(s) during the study and at least one month after the last administration of study drug (e.g., oral/ injectable/ implantable/ insertable/ topical hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, female sterilization, partner's vasectomy or condoms) Any other condition that, to the investigator's judgment, could have an impact on patient's safety or the study results Elective surgery during the 14 day PK blood sampling period Acute infection Clinically relevant increase or decrease in body temperature Actively bleeding or anticipated bleeding (including female menorrhea) at the time point of or within 7 days prior to infusion of BT524 Surgery within 7 days prior to infusion of BT524 Immobilization within 7 days prior to infusion of BT524 Intake of alcohol or significantly increased intake of caffeine containing products within 24 hours prior to infusion of BT524 Blood donation or comparable blood loss within 60 days prior to infusion of BT524 Excessive physical exercise (extreme sports activities, sauna) within 72 hours prior to infusion of BT524</criteria>
