	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of filgotinib (formerly GLPG0634) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Participants will be enrolled in this open-label long-term follow-up study after they have completed one of the two core studies, GLPG0634-CL-203 (DARWIN1) or GLPG0634-CL-204 (DARWIN2), and will be evaluated for any side effects that may occur (long-term safety and tolerability) when taking filgotinib. During the course of the study, participants will also be examined for long-term effects of filgotinib administration on disease activity (efficacy), subjects' disability, fatigue, and quality of life.</brief_summary>
