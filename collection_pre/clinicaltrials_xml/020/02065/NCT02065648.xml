	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare non-contrast abdominal MR Angiogram (MRA) syngo NATIVE sequence performed on a 3T Verio Siemens magnet to a standard contrast-enhanced MRA performed as part of routine clinical care in patients with normal renal function to determine if the non-contrast NATIVE sequence is a viable alternative to contrast enhanced MRA in patients with renal insufficiency. There are no interventions--this is an observational study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If the NATIVE sequence proves to be a viable alternative to contrast enhanced MRA it will provide imaging physicians with the diagnostic tool to assess vascular disease in patients with renal insufficiency without placing them at risk for additional co-morbidities.</detailed_description>
