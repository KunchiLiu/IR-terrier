	<brief_summary>The aim of this study will be to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of a new robotic exoskeleton device in subjects with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) and in subjects with other neurological disease with an impairment of lower limbs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of Outdoor and Indoor Mobility in People With Spinal Cord Injury (ROBOtics Spinal Cord Injury EKSO).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, 30 participants with chronic spinal cord injury will undergo a 8-week training schedule for ambulation with the EKSO™ device. Ekso™ is a wearable bionic suit which enables individuals with any amount of lower extremity weakness to stand up and walk over ground with a natural, full weight bearing, reciprocal gait. Walking is achieved by the user's weight shifts to activate sensors in the device which initiate steps. Battery-powered motors drive the legs, replacing deficient neuromuscular function. Ekso provides functional based rehabilitation, over ground gait training, and upright, weight bearing exercise unlike any other. It has been designed for the needs of busy therapists treating a wide range of patients in a single day. The suit is strapped over the users´ clothing with easy adjustments to transition between patients in as little as five minutes. Before, during and after training sessions the subjects will perform standardised assessments and complete questionnaires to assess the functional and psychological effects of the exoskeleton.</detailed_description>
