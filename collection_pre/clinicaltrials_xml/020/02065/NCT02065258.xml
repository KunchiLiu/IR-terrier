	<brief_summary>Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by reversible obstruction, inflammation and hyperresponsiveness to different stimulus. Aerobic and breathing exercises have been demonstrated to benefit asthmatic patients; however, there is no evidence comparing the effectiveness of the treatments. Objective: To compare the effects of aerobic and breathing exercises on clinical control (primary outcome), psychosocial morbidity and daily life physical activity (secondary outcome) in patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. In addition, thoracoabdominal kinematics, heart rate variability and airway and systemic inflammation will be evaluated. The initial hypothesis will be that both exercises present improved clinical control of asthma. Methods: Forty-eight asthmatic adults will be randomly divided into 2 groups: aerobic (AG) and breathing exercises (BG). All treatments will be performed twice a week for 3 months, totalizing 24 sessions of 40 minutes each. Both groups will complete an educational program consisting of 2 classes at the beginning of the interventions. Before and after interventions, the following parameters will be quantified: clinical control, health related quality of life, levels of anxiety and depression, maximal exercise capacity, autonomic nervous imbalance, daily living physical activity, thoracoabdominal kinematics, inflammatory cells in the sputum, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) and systemic inflammatory cytokines. Asthma symptoms will be quantified monthly using diaries. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to analyze the data normality, and a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures with appropriate post hoc test (Student Newman Keuls) will be used to compare the inter and intra-groups differences</brief_summary>
