	<brief_title>Method Pilates X Pilates in Water Postural Alignment and Its Correlation With Respiratory Capacity With Hemiparesis Spastic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hemiparesis, which corresponds to muscle weakness in hemisphere contralateral to injury, is the most common disorder after stroke Brain. The most obvious implication is postural asymmetry, having direct relation to respiratory pressures are also reduced due to muscle weakness, thus altering the respiratory capacity of these individuals. The Pilates Method is gaining prominence in clinical and scientific areas, contributing to restoring good posture and vertical alignment of the body. Therefore, this study aims assess muscle electrical activity, respiratory capacity and functionality of spastic hemiparetic patients before and after application the Pilates Method, soil and therapy pool. A randomized study where 60 hemiparetic participate will be held with brachial predominance and 30 healthy subjects (Control Group), of both sexes, ages 40 to 70 years. Individuals with hemiparesis will be randomly assigned through a lottery and half held 10 consecutive sessions of Pilates in the soil and the rest will the same protocol adapted for therapy pool. The control group will be treated by the Pilates Method in the soil. The exercises will aim to lengthen musculature shortened due to postural pattern of pathology ; strengthen selected muscles that give support and postural musculature more important upper limb for activities of daily living. Participants will undergo postural assessment, activity EMG, muscle strength, respiratory capacity analysis and evaluation of the functionality of the upper limbs on the first day of treatment and after doing all sessions. The Student's t test will be used, with a significance level of 5 % to compare results obtained before and after treatment. After the tests, the Pearson correlation will also be made between the data obtained in soil and therapy pool. Thus, it is expected that Pilates can improve postural alignment and the breathable hemiparetic and the strengthening of specific muscles of the upper limbs assist in improving the functionality of them in their daily activities.</detailed_description>
