	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the painkilling efficacy of ASP8477 relative to mock (placebo) in patients that have been diagnosed with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia determined by the change in the average daily pain intensity in patients that initially respond favorably to treatment with ASP8477.</brief_summary>
