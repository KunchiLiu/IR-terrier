	<brief_summary>EZ Holdco Inc. has developed two devices for the measurement of gastric content pH. The devices, EZ-NG and EZ-pH, rapidly check gastric pH by aspirating gastric contents into the device through a nasogastric (NG) tube and causing a color change in the device. The color change is then compared to the reference indicator on the device to determine a pH value of the aspirate. Currently there is no bedside rapid way to check gastric pH that protects the clinician from being exposed to the aspirate. 1. Primary Objective To assess the accuracy of the pH measurement of gastric fluid on the devices by comparing the reading on the 2 devices to a standard clinically approved pH probe. 2. Secondary Objective To determine what percentage of time the EZ-NG - RightSpot pH indicator could have been used to determine proper placement of the NG tube when initially placed.</brief_summary>
