	<brief_summary>Before initiating the full randomized study, a Pilot Safety Phase will be performed. The randomized portion of this trial will be conducted after a full review of the safety data from the Pilot Phase by the Data safety monitoring board. Following the Pilot Phase of fifteen (15) subjects, up to thirty (30) subjects are scheduled to undergo infusion and meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluate at baseline. An additional twenty (20) subjects will be enrolled in a safety trial for antibiotic free cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Pilot Phase will be performed to test the safety of dose and volume escalation of cells administered via peripheral intravenous infusion. The randomized portion of the study will be conducted after a full review of the safety data from the Pilot Phase by the data safety monitoring board. PILOT STUDY At the pilot subjects one year phone call visit, all fifteen (15) pilot subjects will be provided with the option of having up to four additional infusions of allogeneic hMSCs. RANDOMIZATION STUDY This Phase I/II, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of allogenic human mesenchymal stem cells in patients with Frailty and to explore potential efficacy over 4 weeks. Approximately fifteen (15) subjects will be enrolled in the pilot phase and thirty (30) subjects will be enrolled in the randomized phase with Frailty will be enrolled. Subjects will then be enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 to an active arm or placebo. If a subject received placebo, in the randomized phase they may be eligible / have the option to receive one infusion of allogeneic hMSCs. An additional twenty (20) subjects will be enrolled in a safety trial for antibiotic free cells. Eligible subjects must have a diagnosis or symptoms of frailty as defined by the Canadian Study on Health &amp; Aging. Following informed consent before or at the screening visit, the diagnosis of FRAILTY will be confirmed by investigator review of medical history.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Provide written informed consent. Subjects age greater than or equal to 60 and less than or equal to 95 years at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form. Show signs of frailty apart from a concomitant condition as assessed by the Investigator with a frailty score of 4 to 7 using the Clinical Frailty Scale Female subjects with an Folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) equal to or &gt; 25.8 mIU/mL (milliinternational units / milliliter), if not currently on hormone replacement therapy. Score of less than or equal to 24 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Inability to perform any of the assessments required for endpoint analysis (report safety or tolerability concerns, perform pulmonary function tests, undergo blood draws, read and respond to questionnaires. Active listing (or expected future listing) for transplant of any organ. Clinically important abnormal screening laboratory values, including but not limited to: hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dl, white blood cell count &lt;3000/mm3, platelets&lt;80,000/mm3, international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 not due to a reversible cause (i.e. Coumadin), aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal, total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dl. Serious comorbid illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety or compliance of the patient or preclude successful completion of the study. Including, but not limited to: HIV, advanced liver or renal failure, class III/IV congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or cardiac revascularization within the last six months, or severe obstructive ventilatory defect. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety or compliance of the patient or preclude successful completion of the study. Be an organ transplant recipient. Have a clinical history of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., patients with prior malignancy must be disease free for 5 years), except curativelytreated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or cervical carcinoma if recurrence occurs. Have a nonpulmonary condition that limits lifespan to &lt; 1 year. Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 24 months. Be serum positive for HIV, hepatitis B Surface Antigen (BsAg) or Viremic hepatitis C. Be currently participating (or participated within the previous 30 days) in an investigational therapeutic or device trial. Be a female who is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential while not practicing effective contraceptive methods. Female patients must undergo a blood or urine pregnancy test at screening and within 36 hours prior to infusion. Have hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)</criteria>
