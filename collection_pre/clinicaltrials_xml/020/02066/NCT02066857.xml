	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to add to the body of knowledge on the treatment of minimally displaced distal radius fractures in patients over 60 years of age. The investigators believe that treating minimally displaced distal radius fractures in people over 60 with a removable splint and early range of motion will provide greater patient satisfaction, fewer complications, and earlier functional returns to pre-injury for these patients compared to those treated with a short arm cast which immobilizes the limb for at least four weeks, and has been shown to lead to longer recovery and possible residual stiffness. The investigators hope to provide sufficient evidence in directing treatment that will give the most efficacious and the most satisfactory return of prior function to patients. Since distal radius fractures in the elderly are common because of poorer bone quality, the elderly proportion of the population is increasing, and controlling health costs is of current concern, answering the question of which treatment produces the best results for all these concerns is of increasing importance now.</brief_summary>
