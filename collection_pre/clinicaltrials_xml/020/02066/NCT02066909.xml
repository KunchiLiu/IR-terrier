	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the safety and plasma concentrations of PF-06649751 in healthy volunteers following one or two times daily oral dosing of PF-06649751 for 14 days (Cohorts 1 - 4), 21 days (Cohort 5), or 28 days (Cohorts 6 - 8). Cohort 9 will dose Japanese healthy volunteers in a manner identical to Cohort 4 and is intended to bridge the safety/tolerability and PK data from the Western and Japanese populations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy males and/or female subjects of non childbearing potential between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive (healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests). Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). Cohort 9 only: Japanese subjects must have four biologic Japanese grandparents who were born in Japan. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing). Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
