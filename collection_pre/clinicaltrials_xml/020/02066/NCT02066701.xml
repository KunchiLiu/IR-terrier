	<criteria>Controls: No endoscopic evidence of Barrett's Esophagus, able to give informed consent, 18 years of age or older. Cases: At least 1 cm of visible columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia on histology confirmed by an expert GI pathologist (on biopsy), able to give informed consent, 18 years of age or older. Exclusion criteria: Controls: Patients with history of esophagectomy or mucosal ablation, gastrectomy, or known nonBarrett's esophageal pathology (e.g. eosinophilic esophagitis or achalasia), varices, esophagitis LA Grade B, C, D will be excluded. Patients with prior history of colon polyps or colon/esophageal/gastric/pancreatic carcinoma (unless had negative colonoscopy within 2 years to clear polyps). Cases: Patients with history of esophagectomy or mucosal ablation, gastrectomy, or known nonBarrett's esophageal pathology (e.g. eosinophilic esophagitis or achalasia), will be excluded. Patients with prior history of colon polyps or colon/gastric/pancreatic carcinoma (unless had negative colonoscopy within 2 years to clear polyps).</criteria>
