	<brief_summary>Local anesthesia used for incision and drainage of abscesses is known to be painful. We studied the analgesia provided by a lidocaine/tetracaine patch compared to injectable lidocaine during incision and drainage (I&amp;D) of skin abscesses. Local injection of lidocaine provided similar analgesia compared to the lidocaine/tetracaine patch during I&amp;D of skin abscesses in the Emergency Department. Pain at presentation and following the procedure was similar in both groups.</brief_summary>
