	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to see if Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) can be used safely and effectively to help treat dry eyes from ocular rosacea after chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Current treatment options for this disease are limited.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IPL and Meibomian Gland Expression to Treat Ocular Rosacea Ocular GVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ocular rosacea and meibomian gland disease are major contributors to keratoconjunctivitis sicca after chronic GVHD. Rosacea exacerbates the aqueous deficiency caused by damage to lacrimal and accessory lacrimal glands similar to cholestasis damage in the biliary system. Subjects who had inactive chronic GVHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and severe dry eye symptoms related to ocular rosacea were recruited and treated with 4 monthly sessions of IPL and meibomian gland expression. Their charts were reviewed prior to treatment to confirm quiescence of active systemic disease. Symptom scores were quantified with Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness questionnaire (SPEED2). Baseline complete eye exam was performed, and subjects received an eyes assessment score based on the Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) Assessment and Scoring Form. Symptoms, exam, and diagnostic data were obtained at baseline (month 0, month 1, month 2, month 3, month 4, month 5, month 6, month 9 and month 12). IPL treatment and meibomian gland expression was performed at baseline (month 0), month 1, month 2, and month 3.</detailed_description>
