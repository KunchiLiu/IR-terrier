	<brief_title>OctavaColon Cancer Blood Tests OctavaGold and OctavaSilver - Blood Tests for the Help in Diagnosis of Colon Cancer Clinical Study Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical objective of this study is to develop two antibody-based blood tests for additional information during colon cancer diagnosis - 1. Highly specific (OctavaGold) - provides additional information to doctors during evaluation of normal population. 2. Highly sensitive (OctavaSilver) - provides additional information to doctors during evaluation of high risk population. The study will be considered successful it can achieve at least one of the following sets of performances - 1. For the OctavaGold - 95% specificity with at least 50% sensitivity. 2. For the OctavaSilver - 95% sensitivity with at least 50% specificity. The biological objective of this study is to find the best set of antigens, that when combined with the appropriate algorithm will support each of the above clinical objectives</detailed_description>
