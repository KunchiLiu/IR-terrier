	<brief_summary>The NSCLC patients who experienced good clinical responses to an EGFR-TKI will inevitably develop acquired resistance. A great deal of research are focusing on this issue. Arsenic trioxide showed efficacy and safety in acute promyelocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma and other solid tumors. Moreover, preclinical studies showed arsenic trioxide can reduce the resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy and TKIs.</brief_summary>
