	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of locally delivered ozone gel as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy on selected clinical parameters as well as alveolar bone density (BD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in patient with chronic periodontitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ozone Gel on Treatment of Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators tested the effect of ozone gel as a local delivery system in treatment of chronic periodontitis in term of probing pocket depth reduction, mean gain in clinical attachment level, a more rise in BD values as well as greater reduction in SOD activity compared to scaling and root planing (SRP) alone.</detailed_description>
