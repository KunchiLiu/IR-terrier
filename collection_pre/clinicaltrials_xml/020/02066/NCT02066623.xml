	<brief_summary>The German-Austrian ABSORB Register shall provide an analysis of acute and long-term safety as well as therapy outcomes of the ABSORB (trade mark) bioresorbable vascular scaffold system in patients suffering from coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study to Evaluate Short and Long-term Safety of the ABSORB Scaffold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The register collects prospective data regarding the quality of care of this therapy concept including specifically the following objectives: - Documentation of all consecutive patients having been treated with the ABSORB biore-sorbable vascular scaffold system under clinical real-world conditions - Documentation of indications, procedural results, and short and long-term outcomes - Documentation of the technical performance of ABSORB implant procedures - Collection of safety data, in particular documentation of hospital mortality, major non-fatal complications (especially myocardial infarction, Re-PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) or CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting), stroke, thrombosis) - Documentation of long-term patient safety marked by mortality and major non-fatal complications (especially myocardial infarction, Re-PCI or CABG, stroke, thrombosis) at 30 days, 6 months, 2 years and 5 years - Gathering of health economics data (capture of direct costs, especially with view to change of medication and outpatient/inpatient hospital services, and indirect costs) pre and post ABSORB implant - Gathering data on the quality of life pre and post ABSORB implant to document individual QoL dimensions as well as QALY (quality adjusted life year) data</detailed_description>
