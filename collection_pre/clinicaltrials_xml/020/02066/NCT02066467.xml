	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to collect clinical data on safety and performance of ACUITY X4® leads when used in a standard clinical setting. It is a prospective, non-randomized, observational multicenter study evaluating standard of care. For Post Market Clinical Follow up (PMCF) purposes the 3 month implant success rate, adverse events and basic parameters of the lead will be assessed. The cohort of subjects included in this evaluation will be the first 200 subjects which are indicated for PMCF in Rally X4 to receive an ACUITY X4® lead implant. Study endpoints: Phrenic Nerve Stimulation (PNS) related CFR through 6 months post-implant (Defined as: rate of freedom from loss of function or operative system revision due to unacceptable PNS threshold) Lead-related Complication-Free Rate (CFR) from Implant through 3 months post-implant.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinic visits will occur at: - Enrollment and Consenting Clinic Visit (≤ 30 days prior to implant procedure) - Implant Procedure (Day 0; all future follow ups based on this date) - Pre-Discharge Clinic Visit (≤ 7 days post implant procedure) (Required) - One to 6 Month Clinic Visit (20 to 180 days post implant procedure) (Required) - Interim Visit(s) (Any time between the 1 to 6 Month Clinic Visit and Close-out Clinic Visit) (Following study center specific standard of care) (Device follow up optional) AE - reporting required - Close-out Clinic Visit (30 months ± 90 days, OR 180 days ± 90 days after the study is closed to enrollment, whichever comes first) (Required) - During the trial all AEs, deaths, and changes in the device system must be reported - Devices of subjects who have received a Latitude device will be followed by the Boston Scientific (BSC) Latitude team. Device Data as defined in the Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP), device alerts, and diagnostic data from the standard Latitude database may be collected and entered into the study database at any time.</detailed_description>
