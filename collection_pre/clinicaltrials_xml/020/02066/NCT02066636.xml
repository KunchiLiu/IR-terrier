Target Population Subjects with histologicallyor cytologicallydocumented NSCLC [squamous (SQ) or nonsquamous (NSQ)] who present with Stage IIIB/Stage IV disease (according to version 7 of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology), or with recurrent or progressive disease following multimodal therapy (radiation therapy, surgical resection or definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced disease) Subjects must have experienced disease progression or recurrence during or after at least one systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease Each subsequent line of therapy must be preceded by disease progression. A switch of an agent within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the start of a new line of therapy Maintenance therapy following platinum doubletbased chemotherapy is not considered as a separate regimen of therapy Subjects who received platinumcontaining adjuvant, neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease, and developed recurrent (local or metastatic) disease within 6 months of completing therapy are eligible Subjects with recurrent disease &gt;6 months after platinumcontaining adjuvant, neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease, who also subsequently progressed during or after a platinum doubletbased regimen given to treat the recurrence are eligible Subjects with nonsquamous histology must be tested for Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations (including, but not limited to, deletions in exon 19 and exon 21 [L858R] substitution) and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) rearrangement if tests have not been previously performed. Subjects with progressive disease during or after EGFR or ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) regimens are eligible. Subjects are eligible if genetic test results are indeterminate or if no tumor tissue is available or accessible for testing as long as they have received one prior systemic therapy Experimental therapies when given as separate regimen are considered as separate line of therapy Subjects must have measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria (radiographic tumor assessment performed within 28 days of first dose of study drug) or clinically apparent disease that the investigator can follow for response per RECIST 1.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Arm (ECOG) performance status (PS) PS 0 to 1 PS 2 1. Target Disease Exceptions Subjects with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases are excluded Subjects with carcinomatous meningitis 2. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases Subjects with a history of interstitial lung disease Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease Subject whom participated in either arm of the following clinical trials CA209017, CA209057, CA209026, and CA184104 or received prior treatment with antiprogrammed death 1 (PD1) or antiprogrammed deathligand 1 (PDL1) experimental agents 3. Prohibited Treatments and/or Restricted Therapies Ongoing or planned administration of anticancer therapies other than those specified in this study Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications</criteria>
