	<brief_title>A Phase I Randomized Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate Safety and Immunogenicity of AERASâ€‘404 Administered as Different Amounts of Antigen and Adjuvant Combinations in HIV-Negative BCG-Vaccinated Adults Without Evidence of Tuberculosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This ia a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in three groups of healthy adult males or sterile females who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, and have no evidence of tuberculosis infection. Sixty-four subjects assigned to one of eight treatment groups to receive one of four different antigen/adjuvant combinations of study vaccine, or placebo control. Within each study group, subjects will be randomized to receive either a single-dose antigen/adjuvant regimen of study vaccine (vaccination with study vaccine on Study Day 0 followed by vaccination with placebo control on Study Day 56) or a two-dose antigen/adjuvant regimen of study vaccine (vaccination with study vaccine on Study Days 0 and 56). All subjects will be followed for safety and immunogenicity evaluations for 182 days. The sample sizes specified for each study group were selected because they are judged to be adequate for preliminary safety and immunogenicity evaluations for a Phase I study rather than for statistical reasons. If no SAE are observed among 56 subjects receiving active study vaccine, an approximation to the upper 95% confidence bound on the rate of SAE occurrence would be 5.4%.</detailed_description>
