	<brief_summary>Octava has two versions, each with a different intend of use. OctavaPink is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service, performed by authorized clinical laboratories. The product is used for two following indications: - Intend of Use #1: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed mammography and were determined negative for breast cancer. Being moderately sensitive (&gt;55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of mammography false negatives. In addition, being highly specific (&gt;95% specificity) it supplies additional evidence for true mammography negative result which will reduce examinees anxiety of being misdiagnosed as a result of high false negative mammography rate (10-30%) - Intend of Use #2: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed biopsy after positive mammography and the biopsy result was negative. Being moderately sensitive (&gt;55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of biopsy false negatives. In addition being highly specific (&gt;95% specificity) it supplies an additional evidence for true biopsy negative result which reduces examinees anxiety of being misdiagnosed. OctavBlue is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service, performed by EventusDx authorized laboratories. Intend of use of OctavBlue is the following: â€¢ OctavBlue is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed mammography and received doubtful results. Being highly sensitive (&gt;95% sensitivity) the test can help to reveal 95% of positive cases; and being moderately specific (&gt;55% specificity) - about half of negative cases. The test is not intended to be used as a standalone diagnostic technique but to supply additional information to a physician and help deciding about the further course of diagnosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Test for Breast Cancer Associated Auto Antibodies - Improvement of Octava Blood Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives - To improve the specifications of the OctavaPink test and the OctavaBlue test. The current specifications being 1. For the OctavaPink - 95% specificity and 50% sensitivity. 2. For the OctavaBlue - 50% specificity and 95% sensitivity. The study will be considered as successful in any of the below options - 1. If the new antigens incorporated in the OctavaPink chip will maintain specificity of at least 95% and increase the sensitivity to at least 85%. 2. If the new antigens incorporated in the OctavaBlue chip will maintain sensitivity of at least 95% and increase the specificity to at least 85%.</detailed_description>
