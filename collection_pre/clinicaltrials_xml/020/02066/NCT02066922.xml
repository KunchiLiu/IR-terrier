	<brief_title>A Comparative Study of Two Daily Disposable Contact Lenses in Higher Myopia Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants were expected to attend 4 office visits. Visit 1 was the Screening/Enrollment visit. At Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), participants were randomized and the study lenses were trial fit. At Visit 3 (Dispense Visit), participants received study lenses for approximately 1 week of wear. Visit 4 was the Exit visit. Expected duration of participation in the study was 3 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sign Informed Consent document; Higher degree of myopia in both eyes, i.e. habitual contact lens power between 10.00 diopters (D) and 17.00D; Best corrected distance visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/30 in each eye (measured with either spectacle refraction or habitual contact lenses plus over refraction); Manifest astigmatism less than or equal to 1.00D; Soft contact lens wear in both eyes at least 5 days per week and at least 8 hours per day; Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Pregnant or lactating; Eye injury or surgery within twelve weeks immediately prior to enrollment; Any ocular condition that contraindicates contact lens wear; History of herpetic keratitis; Any use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated, including any use of topical ocular medications that would require instillation during contact lens wear, except for approved lubricating drops; Clinical significant dry eye not responding to treatment; Previous corneal or refractive surgery or irregular cornea; Requires reading glasses; Participation in a clinical trial (including contact lens or contact lens care product) within the previous 30 days; Wears habitual lenses in an extended wear modality (routinely sleeps in lenses overnight for 1 night per week or more) over the last 3 months prior to enrollment; Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
