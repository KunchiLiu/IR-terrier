	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by skeletal fragility due to decreased bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture , leading to increased fracture risk for low trauma, such as spinal fractures or femoral neck . It is estimated that 3 million people are living in France , particularly women , with an incidence that increases with age . This disease is a major public health issue in terms of morbidity and mortality , costs and risk of recurrence (after a first fracture episode) , including risk factors are identified. However, although bone densitometry is a reliable diagnostic tool and preventive treatments are at our disposal, screening for osteoporosis is still insufficient . The objective of our study is to improve the detection of osteoporosis in Hospital Departmental Vendee , using a simple questionnaire seeking risk factors followed by bone densitometry or if risk factors are found. Based on the results , the patient will be sent in rheumatology consultation for implementation of treatment if necessary . Therefore included women hospitalized in medical services , gynecology, surgery and orthopedics Hospital Departmental Vendee , aged 50 to 80 years. Will not be included women who could answer a simple questionnaire and those previously treated for osteoporosis or have already received a bone density there is less than 3 years old .</brief_summary>
