	<brief_summary>The aim of our study is to investigate if the use of the AirSeal insufflation system impairs the lung function of patients less than a conventional system in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP). Therefore we examine the lung function before and after surgery. As a second purpose of the study, in a subgroup, we investigate the influence of the gas insufflators (AirSeal and conventional) on hemodynamics during surgery. Furthermore we study the change in the lung perfusion-ventilation-ratio by using the electric impedance tomography technique.</brief_summary>
