	<brief_title>Laser Therapy to Treat the Dry Mouth of Sjogren's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Sjogren's Syndrome is a disease that affects around 0,5% of the population and is mainly characterized for inflammatory involvement of salivary and lacrimal glands. The xerostomia leads to low quality of life caused by dry sensations that can disturb the taste, the speaking, the swallow and chewing functions in the affected patients. The absent saliva can cause increase of dental caries and decays. Until now, there is no effective treatment that increases the amount of saliva and the patients have low improvements with cholinergic drugs such as pilocarpine and cevimeline. These drugs can cause unpleasant collateral effects.</detailed_description>
