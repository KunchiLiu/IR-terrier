	<brief_summary>In patients suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), hyperglycemia is considered an adverse prognostic factor. Glycated hemoglobin (or HbA1c) can be measured to estimate the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time, thus determination of glycated hemoglobin at admission after aSAH serves as an approximation of blood glucose levels in the weeks preceding aneurysm rupture. In this patient registry admission HbA1c, clinical course and neurological outcome after 6 month are recorded, to determine whether elevated blood glucose levels prior to aneurysm rupture influence the clinical course and patient outcome after aSAH.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In patients suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), hyperglycemia is considered an adverse prognostic factor. Glycated hemoglobin (or HbA1c) can be measured to estimate the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time, thus determination of glycated hemoglobin at admission after aSAH serves as an approximation of blood glucose levels in the weeks preceding aneurysm rupture. In this patient registry admission HbA1c within 72 hours after confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients aged over 18 years is determined and correlated with clinical course and neurological outcome after 6 month as determined by modified Rankin score. Additionally, patients are monitored for incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and the incidence of new infarction on the discharge ct scan attributable to DCI. General treatment of cerebral aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage in all patients follows international guidelines.</detailed_description>
