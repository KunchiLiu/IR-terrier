	<brief_summary>The blood concentration of the antibiotic colistin is determined in patients in whom kidney function is reduced such that a renal replacement therapy is needed. Hypothesis:no dose reduction is needed in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy over 24h because colistin is sufficiently removed by this procedure.</brief_summary>
