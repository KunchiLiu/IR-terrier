	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of tapentadol oral solution, based on the total amount of supplemental opioid analgesic used over 12 hours or 24 hours after initiation of investigational medicinal product in children and adolescents who have undergone surgery that would produce moderate to severe pain during opioid treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Tapentadol in the Treatment of Post-operative Acute Pain Requiring Opioid Treatment in Pediatric Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), multi-site, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication has a real effect in clinical study), parallel group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time), and multiple oral dose study. This study will consist of an enrollment phase (up to 28 days), a treatment and evaluation phase (4 days), and a follow-up phase (10 to 14 days after the first dose of IMP). A dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg will be used for the first 24 hours of treatment in this study in children aged 6 months to less than 18 years old. After 24 hours after the start of study medication, and based on clinical judgment, the dose may either be continued at 1.25 mg/kg or it may be decreased to 1.0 mg/kg. A decision to maintain or alter the dose will depend on the effectiveness of the analgesia (pain killer) and the adverse event profile observed in each child over the first 24 hour dosing period. The doses for participants aged less than 6 months old will be defined based on the forthcoming pharmacokinetic (what the body does to a medication) data. The supplemental opioid medication reflecting the standard of care will be available as patient or nurse controlled intravenous morphine or hydromorphone. This supplemental opioid medication will be given to control pain, as needed, in both the treatment and placebo groups. In exceptional cases, if a participant has unbearable pain despite using NCA/PCA, an additional bolus (defined as a clinician bolus) of morphine or hydromorphone may be administered. The clinician bolus can be given either using the NCA/PCA pump system or by an intravenous bolus injection. The opioid given as a clinician bolus or if the NCA/PCA intravenous line fails must be the same as that used in the NCA/PCA pump system. Dosing with Investigational Medicinal Product will be stopped if: - A switch to exclusively oral opioid analgesic medication is indicated according to the local standard of care. - Opioid analgesic medication is no longer needed. - Investigational Medicinal Product has been administered for 72 hours. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram, and specific scale to assess suicidal ideation. The maximum study duration for each participant will be 42 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Informed consent, and if applicable assent, given according to local regulations. 2. Male or female participant aged from birth to less than 18 years. 3. A female subject must be premenarchal, or surgically incapable of childbearing, or sexually abstinent, or if a female subject is sexually active, then she must be practicing an effective method of birth control (e.g., prescription hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices used according to the product's instruction, doublebarrier methods) before trial entry and throughout the trial. 4. A female subject must have a negative pregnancy test if aged 12 years or older, or is postmenarchal, or is sexually active. 5. Participant has undergone surgery (other than brain surgery or gastrointestinal surgery expected to affect the absorption of tapentadol [in the investigator's judgment]) that, in the investigator's opinion, would reliably produce moderate to severe pain requiring opioid treatment for at least 24 hours after first dose of Investigational Medicinal Product. Participants must remain hospitalized until the End of Treatment Visit. 6. Participant has received postoperative morphine or hydromorphone by NCA (Nurse Controlled Analgesia)/PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia), with or without a background infusion of the same opioid, according to standard of care prior to allocation/randomization to Investigational Medicinal Product and participant is expected to require this morphine or hydromorphone by NCA /PCA after starting Investigational Medicinal Product. 7. Participant is able to tolerate liquids at the time of allocation/randomization to Investigational Medicinal Product. 1. Participant, parent or the legal representative is an employee of the investigator or trial site, with direct involvement in the proposed trial or other trials under the direction of that investigator or trial site, or family member of the employees or the investigator. 2. Participant has been previously exposed to tapentadol. 3. Participant has received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device within 28 days before allocation/randomization to IMP, or within a period less than 10 times the drug's halflife, whichever is longer. 4. Participant has a history or current condition of any one of the following: Nonfebrile seizure disorder. Epilepsy. Serotonin syndrome. Traumatic or hypoxic brain injury, brain contusion, stroke, transient ischemic attack, intracranial hematoma, posttraumatic amnesia, brain neoplasm, or episode(s) of unconsciousness of more than 24 hours. 5. Participant has a history or current condition of any one of the following: Moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment. Abnormal pulmonary function or clinically relevant respiratory disease (e.g., acute or severe bronchial asthma, hypercapnia). 6. Participant has a concomitant disease or disorder (e.g., endocrine, metabolic, neurological, psychiatric, infection, febrile seizure, paralytic ileus) that in the opinion of the investigator may affect or compromise participant safety during the study participation. 7. Participant has history of suicidal ideation or behavior. 8. Participant is obese in the investigator's judgment. Obesity can be determined based on appropriate BMI charts or tables; e.g., a BMI above the 97th percentile for children based on the World Health Organization growth charts. 9. Participant has a clinically relevant history of hypersensitivity, allergy, or contraindication to the supplemental opioid analgesic medication or tapentadol, or the excipients, or naloxone. 10. Participant is not able to understand and comply with the protocol as appropriate for the age of the participant or participant is cognitively impaired in the investigator's judgment such that they cannot comply with the protocol 11. Participant has a history of alcohol and/or substance abuse in the investigator's judgment based on participant's history and physical examination. 12. Participant is taking prohibited concomitant medication. 13. Participant has received a longacting opioid for the treatment of pain following surgery within 6 hours of allocation/randomization to Investigational Medicinal Product. 14. Participant has clinically relevant (in the investigator's judgment) abnormal values for clinical chemistry or hematology (local laboratory sample taken after surgery). A participant is excluded if the: Aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase is greater 3times upper limit of normal. Total bilirubin is greater 2times upper limit of normal (except if the cause is due to Gilbert's syndrome). Glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min. 15. Participant has: Clinically relevant abnormal ECG. Signs of preexcitation syndrome. Brugada's syndrome. QT or QTc interval &gt;470 ms for children aged 6 years to less than 18 years old. QT or QTc interval &gt;460 ms for children aged from birth to less than 6 years old. 16. Peri or postoperative analgesia supplied by a continuous regional technique (e.g., nerve block, wound infiltration catheter) or subject controlled epidural analgesia that was terminated less than 6 hours before allocation/randomization to Investigational Medicinal Product. 17. Participant has postoperative clinically unstable systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory depression, or clinically unstable upper or lower airway conditions (in the investigator's judgment), or a saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) &lt;92% at the time of randomization (allocation/randomization to Investigational Medicinal Product). 18. Female participant is breastfeeding a child. 19. Participant requires continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation, at the time of allocation to Investigational Medicinal Product. 20. The mother of a newborn subject or the breastfeeding mother of a subject was administered a prohibited medication</criteria>
