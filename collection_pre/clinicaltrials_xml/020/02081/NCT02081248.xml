	<brief_title>Easy-to-Read Informed Consent (ETRIC) for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Clinical Trials (BMT CTN 1205)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A two-arm, randomized study will be conducted in patients about to undergo consent discussion for participation in two large, multicenter BMT CTN clinical trials. Once they agree to participate in this Easy-to-Read Informed Consent (ETRIC) study, they will go through the consent process for the parent trial using either a standard or the ETRIC consent form. The content of both forms will be similar but the ETRIC form will incorporate a two-column format with specific attention towards enhanced readability and processability. Following the consent discussion for the BMT CTN parent trial, patients will complete assessments of health literacy, comprehension of the parent trial and satisfaction and anxiety related to the consent process. These assessments will be completed within 7 business days of the consent discussion of the parent trial. Notes: Enrollment on the BMT CTN 0901 trial (NCT01339910) was closed to further accrual on April 18, 2014. Enrollment on the BMT CTN 1203 trial (NCT02208037) completed accrual on May 13, 2016.</detailed_description>
