	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are still considered the main cause of mortality and morbidity all over the world. In the last years, efforts have been made to define more effective therapeutic and preventive strategies.Periodontal diseases have been considered a probable risk factor for CVD with a great amount of evidence from observational studies. Although there are some interventional studies evaluating the systemic effects of periodontal therapy, there is little information regarding the impact of periodontal treatment on the prevention of cardiovascular events. To the best of our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled trials published to date assessing the effect of periodontal therapy in primary prevention of CVD.</brief_summary>
