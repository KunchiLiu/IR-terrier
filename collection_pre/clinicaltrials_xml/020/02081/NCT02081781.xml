	<brief_title>The Factors That Affected the Outcome of Treatment of Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction is a common condition during the first few years of childhood. Most cases may resolve spontaneously, but the remaining children whose blockage does not resolve may require primary probing. Controversy remains regarding the optimal timing of the probing procedure. Another controversy is related to the setting of surgery. Therefore, we try to investigate the factors that affected the outcome of treatment of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction under the same surgical doctor during the past 13 years in our hospital.</detailed_description>
