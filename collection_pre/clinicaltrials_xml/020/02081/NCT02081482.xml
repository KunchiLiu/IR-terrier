	<brief_summary>The occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) is used to treat patients with refractory primary chronic headache but its mechanism of action (MoA) remains unknown. Different hypothesis have been suggested in particular a specific action on cerebral generators involved in different types of primary headaches or a non specific action on pain modulatory network. The aim of this study, using the chronic cluster headache as a model, is to determine the changes in cerebral metabolism induced by ONS to precise its MoA in the treatment of primary chronic headache.</brief_summary>
