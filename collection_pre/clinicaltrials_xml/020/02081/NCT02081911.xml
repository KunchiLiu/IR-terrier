	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is quantitative motor-sparing of the quadriceps muscles following adductor canal nerve block versus femoral nerve block. Patients will be randomly placed into one of three treatment groups: 1) Femoral nerve block, 2) Adductor canal nerve block - low volume, or 3) Adductor canal nerve block - high volume. Quadriceps function will be assessed in the operating room using a skin patch and electrical stimulation. Follow up visits with the patients will continue over the course of 2 days during patient's stay at the hospital. A total of 60 patients will be enrolled for the study.</brief_summary>
