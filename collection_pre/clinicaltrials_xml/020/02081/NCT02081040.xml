	<brief_summary>To record diaphragm excursion in infratentorial brain lesions patients with dysphagia during coughing and compare them to those with supratentorial brain lesion patients with dysphasia and those with no dysphagia at a university affiliated rehabilitation department.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coughing in Infratentorial Brain Lesion Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our previous work has shown that stroke patients with dysphagia have impaired diaphragm excursion in comparison to those with no dysphagia. It has been postulated that respiratory and cough function are primarily controlled by respiratory and swallowing centers located in the brainstem.We postulated that those with infratentorial brain lesions would have more impaired cough and respiratory function than those with non-brainstem lesions and supratentorial brain lesions. However there has been no studies whether those with infratentorial brain lesions have more impaired cough function and decreased diaphragm excursion than those with supratentorial brain lesions.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Group 1 Brainstem lesion subjects with dysphagia that would require insertion of a nasogastric tube Group 2 Nonbrainstem lesion subjects with dysphagia that would require insertion of a nasogastric tube Group 3 Stroke patients with no evidence of dysphagia Episode of acute pneumonia or pulmonary embolism at time of enrollment Previous history of chronic respiratory disorders or other systemic disorders that may affect respiratory function ( ex, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic renal disease, spinal cord injury) Stroke patients with multiple brain lesions Episode of Diaphragm weakness due to peripheral polyneuropathy or unilateral phrenic nerve palsy Previous episode of abdominal or thoracic surgery within one year of enrollment Concomitant diagnosis of myopathy, muscular dystrophy or other disorders that may affect respiratory muscles. Episode of rib fracture within one year of enrollment Chronic alcoholism Patient with previous diagnosis of dementia or with impaired cognitive function that may limit full participation at the evaluation Patient with tracheostomy state</criteria>
