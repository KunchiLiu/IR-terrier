	<brief_summary>UPGRADE aims to see whether data from Pharmacogenomic Testing (PGx) can help physicians manage patient medication regimens and assess if the testing has an effect on reducing adverse drug reactions, hospitalizations and emergency department visits. The way an individual processes a drug is in part determined by their genes, and there is known to be genetic variation between humans in the way drugs are metabolized. The study of the way genes affect a person's response to drugs is known as "Pharmacogenomics."</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject plans to undergo current index PGx testing at the time of enrollment or underwent current index PGx testing within the prior 1year period, for genes known to influence metabolism of at least one target drug Subject is aged â‰¥18 years Subject is able and willing to provide written informed consent Subject reveals a history of at least one TDAE or an inadequate therapeutic effect from a target drug over the 12month period preceding expected receipt of PGx test results Subject is not taking an investigational medication or in an interventional trial that would interfere with participation in the registry Subject is currently hospitalized Subject's medical and medication history is unavailable over the 90day periods preceding and following the receipt of pharmacogenomic test results Subject is unable to provide an accurate history due to mental incapacity Subject is known to have undergone prior pharmacogenomic testing (exclusive of the current index PGx testing) for genes specific to the target drugs within the 2year period preceding enrollment and these results have been previously evaluated</criteria>
