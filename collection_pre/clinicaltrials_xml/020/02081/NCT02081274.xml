	<brief_summary>High tidal volume during mechanical ventilation has been reported to increase mortality in patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. High tidal volume was also reported to be associated with increased mortality in adult patients without acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the influence of high tidal volume on clinical outcome in pediatric patients who underwent surgery for congenital heart disease has not been evaluated yet. The investigators attempted to evaluate the effect of tidal volume on clinical outcome in both cyanotic and non-cyanotic congenital heart disease.</brief_summary>
