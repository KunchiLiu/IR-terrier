	<brief_summary>CMV is one of the most important opportunistic infection in transplant recipients. In South Korea, more than 95% of adults reveal sero-positivity for CMV IgG. Until now, sero-positivity for CMV IgG before bone marrow organ transplantation is a laboratory test of choice to stratify the risk of CMV reactivation after solid organ transplantation. Theoretically, CMV-specific cell-mediate immune response before and after bone marrow transplantation will further categorize the patients into high or low risk of CMV development after bone marrow transplantation. The investigators thus evaluate the usefulness of CMV-specific ELISPOT assay in bone marrow transplant candidates to predict the development of CMV infection after transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will evaluate whether CMV-specific cell-mediated immune response before transplant, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after transplantation will predict CMV infection after bone marrow transplantation.</detailed_description>
