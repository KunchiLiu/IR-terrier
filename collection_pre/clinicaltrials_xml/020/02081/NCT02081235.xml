	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication after cardiac surgery and has been reported to be associated with adverse outcome. Previous studies have reported that the incidence of AKI in patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease is as high as 42% and AKI increase the patient mortality, intensive care unit stay and hospital stay. Previous studies have reported several risk factors for AKI after congenital heart surgery, however, perioperative variables including anesthesia-related factors have not been evaluated fully. Therefore, the investigators attempt to find out independent risk factors regarding perioperative variables.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication after cardiac surgery and has been reported to be associated with adverse outcome. Previous studies have reported that the incidence of AKI in patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease is as high as 42% and AKI increase the patient mortality, intensive care unit stay and hospital stay. Previous studies have reported several risk factors for AKI after congenital heart surgery, however, perioperative variables including anesthesia-related factors have not been evaluated fully. In addition, a neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which have been reported to be a marker for systemic inflammation and associated with prognosis of cardiac and cancer patients might be able to predict development of postoperative AKI. Therefore, the investigators attempt to assess independent risk factors regarding perioperative variables including transfusion-related parameters, preoperative anemia, preoperative hypoalbuminemia, pulmonary hypertension, use of nitric oxide, use of hydroxyethyl starch, perioperative medication, hemodynamic variables and perioperative NLR.</detailed_description>
