	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Scheduled to undergo primary unilateral TKA for painful osteoarthritis without congenital knee pathology American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System â‰¤ 3 Medically stable as determined by the Investigator based on prestudy medical history, physical/neurological examination, clinical laboratory tests, and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) findings Body Mass Index of 1840 kg/m2 Stable medical regimen for at least 1 month before randomization Able to read and understand study instructions in English, and willing and able to comply with all study procedures More than 2 other current focal areas of pain, none greater in intensity than the target knee and no other active chronic pain conditions that would compromise operative knee pain evaluation Inflammatory arthridities (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis), with the exception of clinically stable/nonactive gout that does not affect the knee and does not interfere with walking Operative arthroscopy in the surgical knee in the last 4 months (except for meniscal repair which will be no shorter than 6 months before randomization) or in the contralateral knee in the last 2 months (or 3 months for meniscal repair), or other prior surgery in either knee in the last 12 months, except for diagnostic arthroscopy Planned use of any of the following for TKA: general anesthesia using potent inhalational agents, peripheral nerve block (i.e., femoral nerve block), neuroaxial (intrathecal or epidural) opioids postoperatively, or knee capsule injections Received aspirin or any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) prior to randomization within the washout period required by the surgical team for surgery with spinal anesthetic, or planned use of NSAIDS postoperatively through Day 28 Use of more than 20 mg per day (on average) of oral morphine or its equivalent within 1 month prior to randomization Use of adjuvant analgesics for chronic pain control (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin) within 2 weeks prior to randomization or planned use postoperatively through Day 28 Daily use of benzodiazepines in the 3 months prior to randomization (unless used for sleep and dosage will be consistent after surgery) Use of systemic corticosteroids (does not include inhaled steroids) within 3 months or intraarticular steroid injections within 1 month prior to randomization, or planned use of either postoperatively through Day 28 Treatment with immunosuppressives, antipsychotics, anticholinergics, or anticonvulsants within 1 month of randomization, with the exception of aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis (as long as discontinued within 1 week of randomization) Current neurologic disorder, which could confound the assessment of pain (e.g., Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis) Current active depression symptoms Has had a change in dose or regimen of SSRIs or SNRIs for depression within 1 month of randomization Mini Mental State Exam score &lt; 24 at Screening Severe pulmonary disease; if symptomatic sleep apnea is currently treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), use must be continued postoperatively at least during the inpatient period. Patients with sleep apnea associated with a history of postoperative delirium are excluded. Current evidence of alcohol abuse or history of alcoholrelated complications within 1 year of randomization including, but not limited to, alcoholic withdrawal seizures, hallucinations, delirium tremens or detoxification treatment Known or suspected history of illicit drug abuse within 1 year before randomization, current or planned use of medical marijuana, or history of opioid dependence within 2 years before randomization Any malignancy within the past year, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or uncomplicated or stable skin cancers documented to not require further or immediate treatment Women who are pregnant or nursing Previous participation in any study involving AYX1 Injection</criteria>
