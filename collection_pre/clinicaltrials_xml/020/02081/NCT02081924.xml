	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the physiological effects of sustained administration of the natural hormone kisspeptin on reproductive function in participants with reduced fertility. Kisspeptin is a recently identified natural hormone which is regulates human reproduction. Learning more about the physiological role of kisspeptins may therefore give us a better understanding about human fertility, and improve the management of patients with reduced fertility. The effects of sustained administration of kisspeptin on hypothalamic reproductive function (i.e. Luteinising hormone pulsatility) are not known.</brief_summary>
