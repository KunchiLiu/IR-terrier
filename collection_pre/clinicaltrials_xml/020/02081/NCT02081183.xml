	<brief_summary>This study will compare the efficacy of CellCept [0.5-2 grams per day (g/day) orally (p.o.)] and cyclophosphamide [0.5-1 grams per square meter (g/m2) quarterly] as maintenance treatment for patients with lupus nephritis. All patients will receive induction treatment with cyclophosphamide (0.5-1g/m2 monthly) for 6 months, and will then be randomized to the maintenance phase of the study for a further 6 months, followed by 6 months of treatment-free follow-up. The anticipated time on study treatment is 12 months.</brief_summary>
