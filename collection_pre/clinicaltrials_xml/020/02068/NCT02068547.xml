	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to test if that combining bone marrow aspirate (removing bone marrow with a needle) concentration with locally harvested (collected) autograft (patient's own bone from another part of the body) for use as the bone graft results in equal rates of a successful procedure (fusion), as compared to current best practice in high-risk patients undergoing posterior cervical fusion. Hypothesis: Bone marrow aspirate concentration combined with locally harvested autograft results in equivalent rates of bony fusion, as compared to current best practice in high-risk patients undergoing posterior cervical decompression and fusion.</brief_summary>
