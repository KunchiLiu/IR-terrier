	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the measure of the CO2 obtained on the end-tidal expiratory gas (ETCO2) with the value of CO2 obtained by transcutaneous measure (PTCO2), in home-ventilated neuromuscular patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concordance Between ETCO2, PTCO2 and PaCO2 in the Home-ventilated Neuromuscular Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monitoring of the effectiveness of ventilation in patients with neuromuscular require to regularly measure blood gases and in particular carbon dioxide (CO2). The reference technique is arterial puncture. In recent years, a non-invasive techniques measuring CO2 by transcutaneous sensor (PTCO2) was introduced among the tools regularly used for follow-up monitoring of home ventilated patients. Another technique for monitoring CO2, originally developed for anesthesia, is based on the measurement of exhaled CO2 (ETCO2). This technique requires relatively simple equipment, and represents a potential alternative for monitoring home-ventilated patients. Recently, sensors for ETCO2 were coupled to devices for home ventilation. To the best of our knowledge, the role of ETCO2 in monitoring long-term ventilated patients has not been investigated to date. The purpose of the study is to analyze the correlation between the two non-invasive methods for measuring CO2: PTCO2 and ETCO2, in a group of home-ventilated patients with neuromuscular disease. The patients will be recruited during a routine follow-up hospitalization for their home-ventilation, and the ETCO2 will be measured during one night, in addition to the routinely measured PTCO2.</detailed_description>
