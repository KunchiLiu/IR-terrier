	<brief_title>Comparative Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety When Metformin Hydrochloride 500 mg Once Daily is Added on to SYR-322 25 mg in Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Inadequate Glycemic Control Despite Treatment With SYR-322 25 mg in Addition to Diet and Exercise Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drugs being tested in this study are called alogliptin and metformin hydrochloride. Alogliptin in combination with metformin hydrochloride was being tested to treat people who have Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control despite treatment with alogliptin in addition to diet and exercise. This study looked at the efficacy and safety of alogliptin 25 mg once daily (QD) + metformin hydrochloride 500 mg QD compared to alogliptin 25 mg QD + metformin hydrochloride 250 mg twice daily (BID) and alogliptin 25 mg QD administered alone. The study enrolled 374 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups—which remained undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need): - Alogliptin 25 mg QD + metformin hydrochloride 500 mg QD - Alogliptin 25 mg QD + metformin hydrochloride 250 mg BID - Alogliptin 25 mg QD This multi-center trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study was 36 weeks (12-week screening period and 24-week treatment period). Participants made multiple visits to the clinic including a final visit 24 weeks after the start of study medication.</detailed_description>
