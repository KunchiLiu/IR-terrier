	<detailed_description>This is a Phase Ⅱ exploratory clinical study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for injection plus capecitabine in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed after standard therapy. All patients will receive recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for injection and capecitabine.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged above 18 years. Pathologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. All other histological types are excluded. Failure of SecondLine and more than secondline treatment, and fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan and oxaliplatincontaining regimens.(Subjects who progress during or within 3 months following the last administration of approved standard therapies and terminate standard treatment due to unacceptable toxicity warranting.).If recurrence and metastasis occurred within 6 months after discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy, the adjuvant chemotherapy is considered to be firstline treatment.Subject received lastline treatment not including capecitabine. At least one measurable lesion according to the RECIST criteria that has not been previously local treated. Minimum indicator lesion size as follows: greater than or equal to 10 mm measured by spiral CT or NMR.Malignant lymph nodes short diameter as follows: greater than or equal to 15 mm measured by spiral CT. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2. Minimum of 4 weeks since any local radiotherapy or surgery for the control of symptoms or severe complications(local radiotherapy for the control of bone metastases is not the limit)，and adequately recovered from toxicities of any prior therapy). Life expectancy of at least 3 months. Prior treatment with novaferon. Pregnancy or breastfeeding women or women who may be pregnant were positive drug test before administration. Patient of childbearing potential(male or less than 1 year postmenopausal women) were reluctant to take contraceptive measures. Patient who were allergic to Interferonα or who had interferonα antibody. Patients with uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases.</criteria>
