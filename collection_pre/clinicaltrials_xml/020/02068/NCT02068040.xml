	<brief_summary>The major goal of this proposal is to characterize the ability of epicatechin which a component of dark chocolate to improve the 1. structural and functional features of skeletal muscle (SkM) 2. exercise capacity (as assessed by VO2 max) 3. parameters of diastolic heart function (as assessed by echocardiography) We propose that a 3 month treatment with epicatechin (through CocoaViaÂ® capsules) will lead to a significant improvement in exercise capacity and diastolic function.</brief_summary>
