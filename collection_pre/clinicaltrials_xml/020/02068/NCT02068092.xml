	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study is evaluating the effect of hydroxytyrosol, a component of Olive oil, on mammographic density in women at high risk of breast through assessing whether mammographic density is reduced in women at high risk of breast cancer taking hydroxytyrosol for 1 year compared with baseline imaging.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Participants must have ≥18 years of age. 2. Participants must have an elevated risk of breast cancer as defined by at least one of the following categories and have declined tamoxifen and/or raloxifene therapy: 1. Diagnosis of LCIS, atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia. 2. A known deleterious mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN or TP53. (Note: The participant must be a documented carrier to meet this criterion. If there is a known mutation in a hereditary breast cancer susceptibility gene in a participant's family member, the participant herself must have undergone genetic testing as per NCCN clinical guidelines to be eligible per this criterion.) 3. Modified Gail/CARE model risk at 5 years ≥ 1.67%. (Note: Risk models are to be used only if there is no known previous diagnosis of resected DCIS or LCIS and there is no known deleterious mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN or TP53). 4. 10% or more probability of BRCA mutation by BRCAPRO or similar model 5. Cannot have DCIS or previous invasive ductal carcinoma 3. Participants must have at least one breast available for imaging and biopsy. A previously irradiated breast (i.e., for resected DCIS) is not evaluable for breast imaging or biopsy. a. Participants must allow submission of core needle breast material (obtained per Section 7.3) for future use. 4. Participants must have a baseline mammogram performed within 90 days prior to study entry, done on a digital mammography machine, that shows either normal or benign findings. Participants with mammograms that are reported as suspicious for malignancy are ineligible. 5. Participants must have baseline mammographic density &gt; 10% based upon the classification system (2 = 1150%, "scattered fibroglandular densities"; 3 = 5175%, "heterogeneously dense"; 4 = &gt;75%, "extremely dense"). Women with a baseline mammographic density of ≤ 10% (1 = ≤10%, breasts are almost entirely fat) will not be eligible 6. Prior tamoxifen or raloxifene use is allowed provided treatment is completed at least 1 year prior to registration 7. Participants must not have bilateral breast implants, but prior breast reduction surgery is allowed. (Breast implants are not allowed as they affect density measurements and because of the risk of rupturing the implant with biopsy). 8. Participants must have a ECOG Performance Status of 0 1 (see Section 11). 9. Prior anticoagulant therapy use is allowed provided therapy is discontinued at least 7 days prior to the breast biopsy in order to reduce the risk of bleeding. For subjects who have taken an anticoagulation within the past 7 days, INR (International Normalized Ratio) must be ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal and Prothrombin Time and Partial Thromboplastin Time ≤ IULN prior to the breast biopsy. 10. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer and in situ cervical cancer. 11. Participant must not be pregnant or nursing and must agree to use effective contraception. Hormonebased birth control (pills, patches or shots) are allowed, but switching birth control methods is discouraged while onstudy as hormonal changes can affect mammographic density. Hormone replacement therapy is not allowed for postmenopausal female. 12. Individuals must not participate in any other clinical trial for the treatment or prevention of cancer unless they are no longer receiving the intervention and are in the followup phase only. Participants must also agree not to join such a trial while participating in this study. 13. All participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. 14. Exclude patients with prior Tamoxifen and Raloxifene use in the past year Exclusion Criteria 1. Any prior malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer and in situ cervical cancer. 2. Prior Tamoxifen or Raloxifene use in the past 1 year</criteria>
