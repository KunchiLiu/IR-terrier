	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that stress hyperglycemia is an indicator that a patient will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus in the future. Subjects who are not diabetic are enrolled and blood glucose readings reviewed during their intensive care unit stay. All subjects are consented and have a HbA1C level drawn to determine if they have diabetes mellitus or not. They are then followed up in 1 year and the HbA1C repeated to determine if they have developed diabetes mellitus over the course.</brief_summary>
