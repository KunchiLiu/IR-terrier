	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to analyze BK viral infection in salivary gland diseases; specifically, to determine a definitive relationship between BK Virus and HIV associated salivary gland disease (HIVSGD). Participants are adults HIV+SGD+ who will be randomized 1:1 to receive BK Virus antiviral (ciprofloxacin) or placebo for 28 days. Salivary function/protein secretion will be correlated with BK polyomavirus titers. We expect that patients with HIV+SGD+ will have elevated oral BK polyomavirus viral loads and will benefit from Ciprofloxacin.</brief_summary>
