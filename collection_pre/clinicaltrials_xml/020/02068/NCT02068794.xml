	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) infected mesenchymal stem cells and to see how well it works in treating patients with ovarian cancer that has come back. Mesenchymal stem cells may be able to carry tumor-killing substances directly to ovarian cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MV-NIS Infected Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal administration of an Edmonston's strain measles virus genetically engineered to produce sodium iodine symporter (NIS) (measles virus [MV]-NIS) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, delivered by adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). (Phase I) II. To assess the 4 month progression free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the tolerability of this regimen. (Phase II) II. To assess the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS versus MSC delivered MV-NIS using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging. (Phase II) II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following intraperitoneal administration. (Phase II) III. To assess humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus. (Phase II) IV. To assess in a preliminary fashion the development of antitumor immune response. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by phase II study. Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1 of course 1 and MV-NIS infected mesenchymal stem cells IP over 30 minutes of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
