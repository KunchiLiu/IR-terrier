	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, routes and extent of elimination, as well as safety and tolerability of a single oral solution dose of [14C] Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)-986020 in healthy male subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) Study of BMS-986020</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary purpose: Other - This study will investigate the pharmacokinetic, biotransformation, routes of elimination, and mass balance of BMS-986020 in humans. The knowledge of the routes of elimination of the drug and its metabolites is useful for evaluating the likelihood of effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the disposition of BMS-986020</detailed_description>
