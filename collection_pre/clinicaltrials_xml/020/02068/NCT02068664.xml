	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if stroke survivors with aphasia have spatial neglect (Phase 1). If they are determined to have the condition Phase 2 will be offered: which is prism adaptation treatment. This is a pilot study that will be performed with 4-5 subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Assessment of the Prevalence of Spatial Neglect in Stroke Survivors With Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spatial neglect is a disorder that may occur after a brain injury such as stroke. Spatial neglect may affect stroke recovery. One example of this heterogeneous condition: Individuals with spatial neglect often pay more attention to one side of what they are looking at, even though they have no difficulty seeing. The study investigators would like to screen stroke survivors with aphasia because they may also have spatial neglect (right neglect after left hemisphere stroke), which is said by the literature to occur in 25% of cases. If it is identified, a treatment approach will be offered, to attempt to remediate the condition using prism goggles, following a prism treatment protocol based on previous studies.</detailed_description>
