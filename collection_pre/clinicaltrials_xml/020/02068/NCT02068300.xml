	<brief_title>The Role of 1.5-anhydro-D-glucitol as Clinical Biomarkers of Hypoglycemia in Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enrolled well controlled diabetes patients who had hypoglycemic event at least one time more. All patients assess the risk of severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness using hypoglycemic awareness questionnaires (HYPO score). The patients who are treated with insulin agent were inserted sensor of continuous glucose monitoring systems under the skin during three days. We were analysed the correlation between 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol and HYPO score.</detailed_description>
