	<brief_summary>Background: Although it is now possible to diagnose Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in adolescents younger than 18 years according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V), and studies indicates that BPD can be reliably diagnosed in adolescence, only a few evidence based treatment programmes for adolescent BPD exists. Mentalization-based treatment (MBT), including group psychotherapy, has repeatedly shown to be effective in treating adult BPD, but in the case of adolescents, only individual MBT have been tested and found to be effective. Aims/hypotheses: We will test whether group based MBT (MBT-G), including an introductory programme for patients (MBT-I) and their parents (MBT-P) is more effective than Treatment As Usual (TAU) in treating adolescents with BPD or subthreshold BPD. Methods/Design: 112 patients referred to child and adolescent psychiatric clinics in Region Zealand will be randomized to either MBT or TAU. Inclusion criteria: Meeting DSM-V BPD-criteria at the threshold (five criteria) or sub threshold level (4 criteria). Follow-up will be at three and 12 months. Discussion: Early intervention is especially important in relation to personality psychopathology and has long-term benefits for patients, their families and society. In addition to being cost effective, using the group modality in the treatment of BPD may have several advantages. This is the first Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of MBT in groups for adolescents.</brief_summary>
