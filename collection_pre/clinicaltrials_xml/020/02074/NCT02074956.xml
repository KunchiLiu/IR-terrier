	<brief_summary>This Phase I study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in five groups of healthy adult male and female subjects who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, and have no evidence of tuberculosis infection. Since BCG-vaccinated individuals are the target population for which AERAS 404 might be indicated, AERAS 404 will be administered to individuals already vaccinated with BCG</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety and Immunogenicity of AERAS 404 Administered in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty subjects will be sequentially enrolled into one of five study groups (i.e., Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, or Group 5) with 10 subjects per group in Groups 1-4 and 20 subjects in Group 5. Within each study group, subjects will be randomized to a treatment assignment of either AERAS-404 or placebo control at a ratio of 4:1 (Groups 1-4) or two different dose amounts of AERAS-404 or placebo control at a ratio of 9:9:2 (Group 5) administered by intramuscular injection on Study Day 0 and Study Day 56. The principal investigator will determine an appropriate interval between the vaccinations such that the entire group is not dosed at the same time. All subjects will receive the same treatment on Study Day 0 as they receive on Study Day 56. All subjects will be followed for safety and immunogenicity evaluations for 182 days. A total of eleven clinic visits are planned (excluding screening) for all subjects</detailed_description>
