	<brief_summary>Children ages 2 months to less than 19 years old, who have been diagnosed with a middle ear infection may receive either medicated ear drops (AR01) or glycerin (placebo) ear drops. The patient or caregiver will measure the amount of ear pain before and after the ear drops to establish if the medicated ear drops decrease the amount of pain more than the placebo ear drops. The subject may leave the clinic 60 minutes after the first dose. The ear drops can be used up to 4 days, as needed for ear pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Compare Efficacy and Safety of AR01 to a Placebo Solution for Relief of Pain in Acute Otitis Media (AR01007)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involves the initial clinic visit, using the ear drops at home and keeping a diary about the ear pain experienced and medications taken. The patient will return to the clinic 4 days later for evaluation and to return the ear drops and diary. The clinic staff will call to follow-up about the patient's condition seven days after the initial visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects 2 mo. to &lt; 19 yrs of age, with signs and symptoms of acute otitis media (AOM), with moderate to severe pain (current episode 2 wks duration). Moderate to severe pain is defined as a score of 5 (on a scale of 0 10) on the FAECC pain scale as evaluated by a trained clinical staff or 6 (on a scale of 0 10) on the FPSR as evaluated by the subject. Moderate to severe pain criteria must be met at eligibility and the predose pain assessment. Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females. The subject's caregiver must have read and signed the written informed consent (including assent from subjects 18 yrs as applicable according to Investigational review board (IRB) guidelines) prior to study participation. Subjects 18 yrs old must have read and signed the written informed consent prior to study participation. Normally active and otherwise judged to be in good health on the basis of medical history and limited physical examination. Females of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test at the randomization visit with negative results returned prior to randomization. Exclusion Criteria Perforated tympanic membrane, history of a perforated tympanic membrane in the last 6 months, or if a perforated tympanic membrane could not be ruled out by speculum examination, impedance testing tympanometry, pneumatic otoscopy, or Valsalva maneuver. Subjects who are subsequently diagnosed with a perforated membrane during treatment are to be discontinued immediately. Subjects with tympanostomy tubes are not allowed. Acute or chronic otitis externa. Chronic otitis media (refers to current episode 2 wks). Seborrheic dermatitis involving the affected external ear canal or pinna. Any otic, topical, or systemic antibiotic received within 14 days prior to study entry (topical or systemic antibiotics for acne will be allowed on a chronic basis for subjects who have been on a stable dose for at least 14 days prior to entry). Any topical drying agent or overthecounter therapy for otitis media received within 36 hrs prior to enrollment. Known hypersensitivity to drug or similar compounds including any of the inactive ingredients. Subjects receiving medication on a chronic basis for pain (including steroidal or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) who have not been on a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to entry into the study. Clinically significant mental illness that may interfere with the conduct of the study (determined by Investigator). Exposure to any investigational agent within 30 days prior to study entry. Previous enrollment in this study. Subject/caregiver has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with the ability to provide consent or assent (ageappropriate) or comply with study instructions, or that might confound the interpretation of the study results, or put the subject at undue risk. Subject has a glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or is taking concomitant medications associated with methemoglobinemia (such as nitrates or nitrites; aniline dyes; or medications, including lidocaine, prilocaine, phenazopyridine hydrochloride [Pyridium], and others). Subject shows clinical signs of anemia. The absolute amount of deoxygenated or abnormal hemoglobin (rather than its percentage) is required for cyanosis to be clinically evident. Subjects with moderatetosevere anemia may not appear cyanotic, even with elevated percentages of deoxygenated or abnormal hemoglobins. Subject has congenital (i.e., hereditary) methemoglobinemia. Subject has a recent history of acute gastroenteritis within 14 days prior to study entry. Subject exhibits clinical signs of methemoglobinemia, such as unexplained bluish coloring of skin, fatigue, shortness of breath, failure to thrive, and headache. Subjects 5 to &lt;19 yrs old who are unable to satisfactorily complete FPSR screening test.</criteria>
