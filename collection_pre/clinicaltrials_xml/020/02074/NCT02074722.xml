	<brief_summary>Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT), in the forms of various yoga and meditative practices, has become increasingly prevalent due to an increase in awareness of the potential health benefits, and improvements in concentration that this training can provide to practitioners. In the present study, we investigate the role of Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT) in the initial learning of a sensorimotor (SMR) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The PI's hypothesis is that MBAT will improve performance in SMR based BCI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this protocol, we will test the PI's hypothesis that MBAT including yoga will improve the ability for subjects to concentrate on control the SMR thus improving the performance of BCI. Subjects will be recruited for short term MBAT and then undergo BCI training. The performance of subjects with MBAT will be compared with those without MBAT to test the hypothesis. Procedures involved include 6 weeks yoga classes with at least 3 classes per week, and a EEG brain noninvasive brain computer interface study.</detailed_description>
