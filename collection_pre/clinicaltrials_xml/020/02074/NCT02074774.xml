	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate that the IntellO2 device providing automated control of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) adjustments in spontaneously breathing infants with fluctuating arterial blood oxygen saturation levels is safe and efficacious in the routine clinical environment. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the IntellO2 will perform as well or better than standard practice for maintaining infants' arterial blood oxygen saturation in a target range while minimizing the exposure to elevated levels of oxygen in the inspired gas.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Preterm infants being treated with high flow nasal cannula therapy 2. A need for supplemental oxygen as demonstrated by an required FiO2 &gt; 0.25 at enrollment 3. Requiring a flow rate of greater than 2 L/min such that the assumed inspired oxygen fraction matched delivered oxygen fraction (definition of HFNC). 1. Major congenital abnormalities 2. Hemodynamic instability, defined as being outside of a normotensive range based on each infant's individual characteristics 3. Seizures 4. Ongoing sepsis 5. Meningitis 6. Clinician's concern regarding stability of the infant</criteria>
