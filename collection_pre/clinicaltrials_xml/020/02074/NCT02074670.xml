	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential reorganization in the sensorimotor cortex in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients after Body Weight Supported Treadmill Training (BWSTT) associated with conventional motor rehabilitation. The investigators hypothesized that training with weight bearing associated with conventional motor rehabilitation will be able to reorganize the brain.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with ASIA C or D and the ability to cooperate with instructions of the motor task required. The motor task was to perform ankle plantar flexion and toe flexion and fingers and thumbs movement of the both sides; they also had to be able to fulfill the general conditions necessary for an MRI exploration. Patients with uncontrollable spasticityinduced body movements were excluded from the study.</criteria>
