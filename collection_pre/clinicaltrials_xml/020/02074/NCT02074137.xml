	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety of cabazitaxel (Jevtana) in patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer Secondary Objectives: 1. To describe the use of cabazitaxel (Jevtana) in combination with oral prednisolone for the treatment of patients with metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer 2. To describe patient profile in terms of demography, disease characteristics and prior treatment history 3. To describe efficacy outcomes: radiological response (if available) using Recist criteria V 1.1 and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) response</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consists of: - a screening phase (maximum length of 7-day). - a treatment phase with 21-day study treatment cycles. Patients continue to receive treatment until disease progression , death, unacceptable toxicity, investigator's decision or withdrawal of consent. - a 30-day follow-up visit after the last dose of study medication.</detailed_description>
