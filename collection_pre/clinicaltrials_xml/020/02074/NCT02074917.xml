	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized and double-blind clinical trial about anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. One of the most common causes of ACL reconstruction failure is poor graft positioning. There is evidence that graft placement aligned with native insertion sites results in superior clinical outcomes. Current anatomic ACL reconstruction concepts highlight the importance of the native anatomy to restore physiological knee kinematics more accurately. This study aims to investigate clinical outcomes and dynamic knee stability with force platform and other functional tests after ACL reconstruction in two different groups of tunnel position: anteromedial ACL footprint (AM) or central ACL footprint. It was hypothesized that there would be clinical or dynamic stability differences between AM or Central tunnel groups in ACL reconstruction.</brief_summary>
