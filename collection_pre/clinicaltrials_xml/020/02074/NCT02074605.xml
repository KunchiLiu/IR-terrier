	<brief_summary>Interferon alpha is the only approved adjuvant biologic therapy for individuals diagnosed with high risk malignant melanoma (stage 2 or 3). There is evidence that interferon has some adverse cognitive effects on patients, but there are limited data. The investigators hypothesis is that compared to patients with melanoma who do not receive interferon, patients who have melanoma and are treated with interferon will show an objective decrease in performance on neurocognitive assessment. This study will enroll patients with melanoma who qualify for interferon, and either decide to undergo interferon treatment or choose watchful waiting instead. All patients will be assessed with a cognitive testing battery twice. Observation patients will undergo testing at their first appointment in which they consent to the study, as well as at their next physician visit, approximately 3 months from the first visit. Interferon patients will be tested immediately prior to starting interferon, as well as immediately after completing high dose interferon.</brief_summary>
