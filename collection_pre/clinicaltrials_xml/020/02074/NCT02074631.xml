	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical study of pediatric subjects treated with pamidronate with calcium and vitamin D versus calcium and vitamin D alone following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that subjects receiving pamidronate with calcium and vitamin D will have higher lumbar spine bone mineral content (LBMC) measured by dual-energy X-ray tomography (DXA) at 1 year post-HCT than subjects receiving calcium and vitamin D alone (Control Group).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant for hematologic malignancy (i.e. leukemia, lymphoma including ALL, AML, CML, NHL, HL) in complete remission; myelodysplastic syndrome (active dysplasia and/or blasts are permitted, but must not have active leukemia) or idiopathic severe aplastic anemia (SAA) Myeloablative preparative regimen (for SAA any conditioning therapy allowed) Male or female ≥1 but ≤ 20 years of age at time of study enrollment Patient or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) is able and willing to provide informed consent. Assent will be obtained per local institutional policy. Subjects who turn 18 during the course of the study will be consented at that time of their next visit by a member of the research staff. History of a primary bone malignancy involving the lumbar spine Prior and/or planned concomitant medical therapy during the study period (through Day 360 postHCT) with other bisphosphonates, Denosumab, or Teriparatide Pregnancy or breastfeeding menstruating females must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study enrollment and agree to repeat pregnancy testing and contraception use per protocol as pamidronate is Pregnancy Category D positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data Renal insufficiency, defined as creatinine level greater than the upper limit of normal for age Hereditary metabolic bone disease or skeletal dysplasia (e.g., osteopetrosis or OI) or primary hyperparathyroidism Other indications for HCT, including Fanconi anemia, other form of inherited bone marrow failure diseases, metabolic disorder, hemoglobinopathy, or immune deficiency Clinically significant fractures as defined by ISCD (a long bone fracture of the lower extremities, vertebral compression fracture, or two or more long bone fractures of the upper extremities) (88,89) indicated by a cast or a spine xray within the last 2 weeks Known or suspected allergy to pamidronate or related products Planned administration of an investigational study drug or agent that either can interact with pamidronate or have an independent effect on bone mineral density within the 4 weeks prior to randomization (Day 90) or planned use during study participation (Day 90 through Day 360) Impending invasive dental procedure that would be expected to occur during study participation (through Day 360)</criteria>
