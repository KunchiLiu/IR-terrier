	<brief_title>Moyamoya Disease Biomarkers in Patients With Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Purpose Both moyamoya disease (MMD) and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) are more prevalent in Asians than in Westerners, although the reason for the race-ethnic differences is unsettled. It is possible that patients with adult-onset MMD were misclassified as having ICAS, which may in part explain the high prevalence of intracranial atherosclerosis in Asians. It is important to differentiation between these two diseases because MMD and ICAS have differential therapeutic strategies (surgical revascularization in MMD vs. the use of antithrombotics/statins and stenting in ICAS). The ring finger 213 (RNF213) was recently identified as a susceptibility gene for MMD in East Asians. Characteristic high-resolution (HR) MRI findings of MMD and ICAS have recently been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the proportion of patients with moyamoya disease among the patients who were diagnosed as having intracranial atherosclerotic stroke. To do this, biomarkers (gene and imaging) for moyamoya disease are tested and follow up angiography are performed during follow up (in selected patients). 2.
