	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate changes in abdominal tissue perfusion during adenosine vasodilation. Our hypotheses were that CT perfusion measurements are altered by changes in the circulatory system mediated by adenosine, and a more differentiated assessment of the circulatory capacity of abdominal tumours could be achieved by sequential rest and adenosine vasodilation CT perfusion measurements.</brief_summary>
