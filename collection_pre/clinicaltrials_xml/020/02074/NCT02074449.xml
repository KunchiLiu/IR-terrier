	<brief_summary>Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are at much higher risk of death if the RV (right ventricle) is weak. The purpose of this study is to get a better understanding of the factors that determine RV adaptation and how the RV compensates on therapy. The investigator is also interested in how Remodulin (treprostinil) infused over a short period (approximately 48-72 hours) affects the patient's quality of life, medical care, and personal health behaviors. Treprostinil, also known as Remodulin, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of PAH. The investigator has been treating patients with Remodulin by rapid infusion (over 48 hours) for over 6 years. The investigator would like to establish this practice as safe and effective for the benefit of other centers that treat PAH.</brief_summary>
