	<brief_summary>An ADE is defined as harm caused by a drug or the inappropriate use of a drug. Retrospective record reviews in several countries have shown that anticoagulants frequently lead to hospital readmissions. In this study a hospital readmission is defined as an admission to the emergency department of the Jessa hospital. The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of one week and 30-day readmissions caused by (preventable) ADE's due to anticoagulants.</brief_summary>
