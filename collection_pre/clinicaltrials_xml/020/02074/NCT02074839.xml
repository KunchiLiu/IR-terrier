	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-120 in advanced hematologic malignancies that harbor an IDH1 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-120 to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is a dose expansion phase where four cohorts of patients will receive AG-120 to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Subject must be ≥18 years of age. Subjects must have documented IDH1 R132 genemutated advanced hematologic malignancy based on local or central evaluation. Subjects must be amenable to serial bone marrow biopsies, peripheral blood sampling, and urine sampling during the study. Subjects must have ECOG PS of 0 to 2. Platelet count ≥20,000/µL (Transfusions to achieve this level are allowed). Subjects must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤3.0 × ULN, unless considered due to leukemic disease and serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to Gilbert's disease or leukemic disease Subjects must have adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine ≤2.0 × ULN or creatinine clearance &gt;40mL/min based on CockroftGault glomerular filtration rate (GFR) Subjects must be recovered from any clinically relevant toxic effects of any prior surgery, radiotherapy, or other therapy intended for the treatment of cancer. Female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the start of therapy and on the first day of study drug administration. Key Subjects who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) within 60 days of the first dose of AG120, or subjects on immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT at the time of screening, or with clinically significant graftversushost disease (GVHD). (The use of a stable dose of oral steroids post HSCT and/or topical for ongoing skin GVHD is permitted.) Subjects who received systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy &lt;14 days prior to their first day of study drug administration. (Hydroxyurea is allowed prior to enrollment and after the start of AG120). Subjects who received an investigational agent &lt;14 days prior to their first day of study drug administration. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Subjects with an active severe infection or with an unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C during screening visits or on their first day of study drug administration (at the discretion of the Investigator, subjects with tumor fever may be enrolled). Subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure or LVEF &lt;40% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan within approximately 28 days of C1D1. Subjects with a history of myocardial infarction within the last 6 months of screening. Subjects with a known unstable or uncontrolled angina pectoris. Subjects with a known history of severe and/or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias. Subjects with known unstable or uncontrolled angina pectoris. Subjects with heartrate corrected QT (QTc) interval ≥450 ms or other factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events. Patients taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval Subjects with known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B or C. Subjects with clinical symptoms suggesting active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia or known CNS leukemia. Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is only required if there is a clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening. Subjects with immediately lifethreatening, severe complications of leukemia such as uncontrolled bleeding, pneumonia with hypoxia or shock, and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation.</criteria>
