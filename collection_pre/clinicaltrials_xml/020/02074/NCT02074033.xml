	<brief_summary>The infection is a major risk to hospitalized patients, especially those admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and an unfavorable factor in the outcome of critically ill patients, increasing costs and prolonging hospitalization hospitalar. The ventilator-associated pneumonia (PAV) is considered the most prevalent nosocomial infection in the ICU, occurring in 9% to 68% of patients with prosthetic ventilat√≥ria.Due to the high rate of PAV and mortality related to it, is very important both prescription and administration of antibiotics correctly, as deescalation or escalation according the result of cultures.Therefore, the objectives of this study is assess if whether the antibiotic prescribed of ventilator-associated pneumonia following the orientation of literature. Will also be assessed the rate of PAV in patients critically ill adults, the main microorganisms responsible by PAV and determining antimicrobial susceptibility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Errors in Prescription Antibiotics in Ventilator-associated Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients who had a diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia by asssistente physician will be assessed initially prescribed antibiotics empirically and what conduct adopted after culture results. We will be examined whether the antibiotic prescribed following the orientation of literature, considering the dose, interval between doses, dose adjustment for renal failure infusion time, treatment time and conduct after the culture results (deescalation, escalation or maintenance of antimicrobial initially prescribed ) . The deescalation consists of discontinuing the use of antimicrobial or antibiotic change to another with lower coverage and spectrum is performed, escalation occurs when adding a new antibiotic or antibiotic to change the coverage of other larger spectrum after culture results .</detailed_description>
