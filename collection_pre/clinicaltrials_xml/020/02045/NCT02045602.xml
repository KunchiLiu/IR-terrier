	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of VCN-01 either administered alone or in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine, and to determine the recommended phase II dose of VCN-01 alone or in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Escalation Study of Intravenous VCN-01 With or Without Gemcitabine and Abraxane® in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of three parts: - Part I is a dose escalation study to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous injection of VCN-01 alone - In Part II the safety and tolerability of the two highest VCN-01 tolerable doses from part I will be evaluated in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine. - In Part III the safety and tolerability of the two highest VCN-01 tolerable doses from part I will be evaluated in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine in a "delayed" schedule compared with Part II.</detailed_description>
