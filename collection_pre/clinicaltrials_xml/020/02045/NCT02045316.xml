	<brief_summary>The etiologic agent responsible for the development of preeclampsia remains unknown. Aquaporins, members of integral membrane proteins, are responsible of water molecules movements through the plasma membrane channels, energy metabolism and associated with changes in cellular volume during apoptosis. Ä°n such placental pathology as preeclampsia, characterized with superficial implantation and increased apoptosis leading to a relative hypoxia between mother and fetus, the hypothesis of aquaporins important role in energy homeostasis and apoptosis maybe suggested.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Expression of Aquaporin 3, 8 and 9 in Placenta in Normal and Preeclamptic Pregnancies: Perinatal and Neonatal Outcomes.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are carrying out a study of 210 pregnant women , from whom 105 will have pregnancy complicated with preeclampsia and 105 with normal pregnancy. The investigators aim is to investigate the role of the placenta, umbilical cord and amniotic membrane aquaporin expression in etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia. The investigators will compare aquaporin levels in preeclamptic and normal placentas, umbilical cords and amniotic membranes , and investigate relation between aquaporin levels and perinatal ( maternal blood pressure, proteinuria, maternal-fetal doppler ultrasound, amniotic fluid index, fetal intrauterine growth) and neonatal ( Apgar score, biometry, complications) finding.</detailed_description>
