	<criteria>Main Inclusion at Screening (Visit 1): Subject has completed study 178CL101 or study 905EC012 (This inclusion criterion will no longer apply once the recruitment for study 178CL101 and study 905EC012 has been completed. In that case the subject has to have symptoms of "wet" OAB (urinary frequency and urgency with incontinence) for at least 3 months); Subject is willing and able to complete the micturition diary and questionnaires correctly and able to measure his/her vital signs at home at stipulated time points, using the device provided by the study personnel, and to adequately record the readings; Main Inclusion at Randomization (Visit 2): Subject has a micturition frequency of on average â‰¥ 8 times per 24hour period during the last 7 days of the micturition diary period (incontinence episode should not be counted as a micturition). Subject has experienced at least 3 incontinence episodes during the last 7 days of the micturition diary period. Subject has experienced on average at least 1 urgency episode (grade 3 or 4 on Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale [PPIUS]) per 24hour period during the 7day micturition diary period. Main Exclusion at Screening (Visit 1): Subject has clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction at risk of urinary retention; Subject has significant PVR volume (&gt; 150 mL); Subject has significant stress incontinence or mixed stress/urgency incontinence where stress is the predominant factor; Subject has an indwelling catheter or practices intermittent selfcatheterization; Subject has evidence of a UTI (urine culture containing &gt; 100,000 cfu/mL), chronic inflammation such as interstitial cystitis, bladder stones, previous pelvic radiation therapy or previous or current malignant disease of the pelvic organs; Subject has had intravesical treatment in the past 12 months with e.g., botulinum toxin, resiniferatoxin, capsaicin; Main Exclusion at Randomization (Visit 2): Subject has evidence of a UTI (urine culture containing &gt; 100,000 cfu/mL) as assessed in the Screening visit (V1) samples. The subject can be rescreened after successful treatment of the UTI (confirmed by a dipstick negative for nitrite). Subject had an average total daily urine volume &gt; 3000 mL as recorded in the micturition diary period.</criteria>
