	<brief_title>Calcium Ionophore Solution Can Increase Fertilization Rate in Patients During Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection(ICSI) Who Have Poor Ovarian Reserve?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During ICSI cycle , female patients who have poor ovarian reserve have low oocyte numbers. So by calcium ionophore solution which we know that it can increase fertilization rate in males who have azospermia or globozoospermia. we planned to check if this solution can increase fertilization rate also in poor ovarian reserve patients?</detailed_description>
