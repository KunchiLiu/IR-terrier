	<brief_summary>40 subjects with moderate-to-severe asthma will be randomly selected for study in which 20, will be monitored for medication use (Dulera 100/5, Dulera 200/5 and Proventil HFA) over 3 months. These intervention subjects will receive medication use feedback at each visit, while the control group will receive the standard of asthma care. Those interventional subjects with Dulera adherence&lt;60% will receive feedback based on an asthma adherence disease management model protocol, Asthma Adherence Pathway. Intervention clinicians will been trained in Motivational Interviewing to reduce subject ambivalence about medication use. The primary hypothesis is that subjects who receive medication monitoring and Motivational Interviewing adherence strategies will have better asthma control, as measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire, than the control group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Clinical Hypothesis: Poorly controlled subjects with moderate-to-severe asthma (measured by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) ≥ 1) despite treatment with Dulera, who are treated with the asthma adherence disease management protocol, Asthma Adherence Pathway™, will achieve greater asthma control than similar control subjects who are treated with the current standard of care. Primary end point: There will be four measures of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) over time over 3 months. The primary endpoint is the third month measure of ACQ. Secondary Clinical Hypothesis: The asthma adherence disease management program, Asthma Adherence Pathway™, will increase observed adherence to Dulera relative to a benchmark of 60% adherence (i.e., expected prescribed actuations). Secondary end points: a) Average adherence to Dulera over the three month study period Tertiary Clinical Hypothesis: Responses to Adult Asthma Adherence Questionnaire (AAAQ) will be related to Dulera Adherence Tertiary Study Endpoints: There will be 2 measures of the AAAQ (first and last visit) and the tertiary endpoint is the last visit</detailed_description>
