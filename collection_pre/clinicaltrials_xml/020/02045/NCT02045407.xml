	<brief_title>Computed Tomography Angiography to Brain Death Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critically ill patients, presenting Glasgow Coma Score 5 or lower, will be submitted to the Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the skull assessment, and follow a clinical evaluation for brain death, additionally, transcranial Doppler would be applied as the gold standard for brain death. We will exclude patients whose do not can be submitted to contrast injection, or if a brain death clinical evaluation has been performed prior the CTA.</detailed_description>
