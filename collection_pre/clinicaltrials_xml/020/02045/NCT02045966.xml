	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of the Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir/BMS-791325 fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet on the pharmacokinetics of the cocktail CYP and transporter probe substrates and to assess the effect of the DCV 3DAA FDC [DCV 3DAA FDC = fixed dose combination formulation of 3 direct-acting antivirals (3DAA) (DCV 30 mg, ASV 200 mg, and BMS-791325 75 mg)] + BMS-791325 75-mg single-agent tablet on the Pharmacokinetic (PK) of the cocktail CYP and transporter probe substrates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Determine the Potential DDIs When the Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir/BMS-791325 Three Drug Antiviral Combination Tablet (FDC) is Coadministered With a Cocktail of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Probe Substrates and Transporter Probe Substrates (Digoxin and Pravastatin) in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IND number: 79,599 and 101,943 Primary purpose: Other: study is being conducted to investigate the potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) when the Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir/BMS-791325 FDC formulation is coadministered with a cocktail of cytochrome P450 (CYP) probe substrates (Caffeine, Metoprolol, Montelukast, Flurbiprofen, Omeprazole, and Midazolam) and transporter probe substrates (Digoxin and Pravastatin) in healthy subjects. It is also intended to characterize the PK of Daclatasvir (DCV), Asunaprevir (ASV), BMS-791325, and its major metabolite, BMS-794712, at steady state.</detailed_description>
