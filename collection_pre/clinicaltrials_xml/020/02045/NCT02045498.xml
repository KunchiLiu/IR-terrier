The two groups patients for age, sex, initial rhythm of arrest, time of arrest until the first action, the time of arrest until the first shocks are comparing to control these factors influence on the outcome. quality performance of rescuers , resuscitation outcomes and CPR duration and relative factors in each of the groups were recorded and compared.</detailed_description>
