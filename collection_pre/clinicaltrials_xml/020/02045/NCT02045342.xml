	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effects of hydrothermally modified starch (SuperStarch) in adults. SuperStarch, originally developed as a drink for children with glycogen storage disease, is a slow digestible carbohydrate, maintaining blood sugar levels over extended periods. Therefore, it could be beneficial to exercise and mental performance, and could possibly have fat loss effects by increasing feelings of fullness. In this study, measures will be taken in 25 men to assess mental function, appetite, and metabolism to determine the processes involved in possible fat loss.</brief_summary>
