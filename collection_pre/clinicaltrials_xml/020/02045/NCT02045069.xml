	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Ivermectin Against Dengue Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with confirmed dengue infection who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and admitted in the hospital. Patients will be randomly assigned in a pre-specified ratio of 1:1:1 to one of the following study groups: ivermectin 200-400 µg/kg single daily dose for 2 days, ivermectin 200-400 µg/kg single daily dose for 3 days, or placebo. Tablets of ivermectin or placebo will be administered for 3 days. Clinical exam will be performed daily during hospitalization and blood samples will be collected for hematology, clinical chemistry, serology, viral load and quantitative nonstructural 1 (NS1) antigen. Safety assessment will be conducted during admission. Patients will be discharged one day after fever subsidence and will be asked to return 2 weeks after first dose of study medication for safety assessment and blood sampling.</detailed_description>
