	<brief_title>The Baltimore HEARS Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related hearing impairment is strongly associated with poorer communicative functioning and social isolation, but hearing impairment often goes undiagnosed and untreated, particularly among minority and low-income older adults. Novel interventions that translate research on social engagement, minority health, and hearing technology are needed to expand delivery of hearing health care to underserved older adults. The Baltimore Hearing Equality through Accessible Research and Solutions (HEARS) project will develop and pilot a first-in-kind community-based intervention to provide affordable, accessible, and effective hearing health care to minority and low-income older adults and their communication partners. The study will follow a mixed-methods approach that will incorporate quantitative and qualitative components throughout the formative and evaluative processes. Participants and their communication partners will be randomized to an immediate treatment group or a 3-month delayed treatment group. We hypothesize that the intervention is associated with increased social engagement and communication, improved quality of life, and decreased loneliness and third-party disability in the immediate treatment compared to the delayed treatment group.</detailed_description>
