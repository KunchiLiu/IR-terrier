	<brief_summary>Taxotere is the current standard first-line chemotherapy for mCRPC and may be used as second-line therapy in good responders in first-line (Taxotere rechallenge). Jevtana has demonstrated a survival benefit versus mitoxantrone in patients progressing during or after Taxotere and is now the standard second-line chemotherapy. Taxotere and Jevtana have different toxicity profiles. Many patients who are receiving Jevtana for second-line treatment indicate they prefer this agent over Taxotere with regards to the general tolerance (namely peripheral neuropathy, nail changes, asthenia). This was not expected since Jevtana in post-Taxotere setting was associated with more grade 3-4 adverse events such as febrile neutropenia and diarrhea than Taxotere in first-line setting. The study design of CABA-DOC is similar to that of the PISCES trial which evaluated the patient preference between two standard treatments for first-line metastatic kidney cancer. Despite similar PFS improvements over placebo in phase III trials, results clearly showed that patients preferred pazopanib over sunitinib. A randomized phase III study is currently comparing the efficacy of Taxotere and Jevtana in first-line setting with overall survival as a primary end-point. Assessing patient preference between Jevtana and Taxotere would contribute to further identify differences between these two taxanes and clarify which one of these two taxanes should be used for second-line chemotherapy and perhaps for first-line chemotherapy in the future. Assessing patient preference between the two taxanes might be less biased in the first-line setting where patients have no previous experience with a taxane.</brief_summary>
