	<brief_title>Dietary Nitrate on Plasma Nitrate Levels for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patients diagnosed as nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be recruited. A 70 ml beetroot juice containing 0.45g nitrate or placebo will be provided to the patients for 7 days at the end of the radiotherapy . The plasma nitrate levels will be determined before radiotherapy, before intervention and after intervention.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with newly diagnosed stages IIIIVb (UICC 2002) nasopharyngeal carcinomas, will be recruited. Patients with local invasion or metastatic foci in salivary glands, detected by MRI and PETCT prior to treatment, were excluded, as were patients suffering from diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome, or with a history of surgery to major salivary glands, or prior head and neck radiotherapy.</criteria>
