	<brief_title>Hepatitis B Antigen Kidney Graft Into Protective Level Hepatitis B Antibody Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The kidney transplant registry was conducted in KCMH since the year of 2000 until the present. The inclusion criterion was: - All kidney allograft recipients who received at least one month after transplantation. - All kidney recipients who already had the protective antibody against hepatitis B virus infection defined by anti-HBs titer above 100 mIU/mL at pre-transplantation period. The exclusion criterion was: - The recipients with positive hepatitis C virus antibody. - The recipients who had received a previous or simultaneous non-kidney solid organ transplant. - The recipients those lost to follow-up. Study group: - The recipients who received kidney allograft from the HBsAg(+) donor. Control group: - The recipients who received kidney allograft from the HBsAg(-) donor. According to the Thai Red Cross National Organ Donation and our institute's policy, the HBsAg(+) kidney allografts were distributed to only and informed consent. Data collection: - Baseline characteristic data e.g. donor and recipient age, donor and recipient gender, HLA, PRA, anti-HBs titer, immunity against HBV status (both natural and vaccinated),immunosuppressive regimens were collected. - The recipients were prospective followed up at month 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120. - Clinical data including jaundice, hepatitis, graft rejection were collected - Laboratory data of HBsAg, anti-HBc, HBV DNA, SGOT, SGOT, eGFR were collected. - Pathological data of allograft biopsy at month 12 and 24 were retrieved. Outcomes: - Primary outcome: hepatitis B transmission rate. - Secondary outcome: graft survival, patient survival.</detailed_description>
