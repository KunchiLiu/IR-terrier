	<brief_title>Randomized-controlled Trial of Aftercare-Coordination by Phone for Depression and Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression and anxiety are among the most prevalent mental health problems and are associated with a high risk of chronification. Despite the large capacities in the German health care system only a small percentage of these patients receive treatment. Relevant barriers on the pathways of patients are communication und coordination difficulties between different services and providers.The aftercare subsequent to an inpatient treatment represents one of these interfaces. Here the aim is to consolidate the treatment outcomes and to minimize the so called rebound-effect, the reduction of the positive treatment effects after the inpatient treatment. Although evidence-based treatments for depression and anxiety disorders exist, treatment effects often decrease after treatment due to the lack of an integration of different steps in care. The method of a case management-based aftercare coordination by phone could be a promising approach to overcome the interface between inpatient treatment and aftercare: case management is a patient-centered and situation-based approach which comprises systematic tracking and support of patients by a case-manager. Primary goal is to coordinate and integrate services across treatment settings. This approach can help to maintain and even improve longterm treatment outcomes.</detailed_description>
