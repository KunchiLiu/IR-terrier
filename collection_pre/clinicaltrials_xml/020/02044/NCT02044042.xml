	<brief_title>Vertical Transmission of Hepatitis C Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT) has been extensively studied, with a risk around 5% (range: 3 to 10%) from chronically infected pregnant women with a positive HCV RNA during pregnancy. Risk factors include: HCV RNA load level, HIV-HCV co-infection, duration of labour, HCV genotype, child gender, and invasive procedures either during pregnancy or at birth. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT) mainly occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy or at birth or around the birth (El-Shabrawi et al., World Journal of Gastroenterology 2013). Currently, using caesarian section to reduce the risk of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT) is still debated and not recommended in International Guidelines (EASL 2012). Spontaneous viral clearance in infected children during childhood seems to occur in 20% of cases, with predisposing genetic factors (Ruiz-Extremera A et al. Hepatology 2011 ; 53 : 1830-1838) but data about this phenomenon are scarse (Rerksuppaphol S et al. J Gastroenterol Hepatol 2004), justifying the study.</detailed_description>
