	<brief_summary>This project applies a randomized community design to test the effectiveness of health center level co-packaging and counseling messages to improve provider and caregiver behavior in the treatment of diarrhea with zinc &amp; oral rehydration salts (ORS) and treatment of pneumonia with zinc &amp; antibiotics in children aged 2-59 mo old. We will evaluate the adherence of caregivers in 10 health posts in 5 municipalities randomly assigned to receive the health center level co-packaging and counseling messages in addition to current standard care, by comparing them with the caregivers in 10 health posts in 5 municipalities randomly assigned to the receive only the current standard of care. Cost-effectiveness of co-packaging at the health-center level, as a means of improving provider treatment and counseling practices and caregiver adherence, will be evaluated. The main objective is to establish the effectiveness of a facility level co-packaging and counseling messages for increasing the adherence by caregivers of children aged 2-59 mo old to the prescribed 10 day treatment with zinc to complement ORS for the treatment of diarrhea and zinc to complement the antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia diagnosed and treated in public health posts. Specific Quantitative Objectives: â€¢ To determine if visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages: - Improves adherence of caregivers of children towards the prescribed zinc treatment. - Improves knowledge, awareness or attitudes of caregivers of children and health providers at public health care centers towards the prescribed zinc treatment. - Results in overall increase in health care-seeking for the treatment of diarrhea and pneumonia at public health care centers. Specific Qualitative Objectives: - To establish the perception, attitudes and experiences of caregivers towards the visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages to promote the prescribed zinc treatment. - To establish the perception, attitudes and experiences of health providers at public health care centers towards the visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages to promote the prescribed zinc treatment. - To establish the perception, attitudes and experiences of children aged 4 to 5 years old towards the visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages to promote the prescribed zinc treatment.</brief_summary>
