	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of QuantiFeron® and ImmuKnow® in combination for early detection of patients who will develop CMV infection in lung transplant patients with CMV-positive serology (R+) prior to transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytomegalovirus-Specific Response Measured by QuantiFeron® and Overall Immunologic Response Measured by ImmuKnow® in Lung Transplant Patients CMV-positive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of the study are: - To evaluate Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific immune response measured by QuantiFeron®. - To evaluate overall immune response measured by ImmuKnow®. - To study the course of QuantiFeron® and ImmuKnow®over the follow-up period. - To correlate levels of ImmuKnow® and QuantiFeron®. - To evaluate the relationship between levels and doses of immunosuppressants and their relationship to degree of overall immunosuppression (ImmuKnow®). - To evaluate the relationship between infections, immunological complications and degree of overall immunosuppression (ImmuKnow®).</detailed_description>
