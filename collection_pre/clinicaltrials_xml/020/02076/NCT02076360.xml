	<brief_summary>This is a single-blind, randomized (1:1 allocation), stratified, single-parallel clinical trial at one institution evaluating the use of a preoperative patient education video as an adjunct to preoperative counseling on patient-centered outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of a preoperative patient educational video as an adjunct to the routine preoperative visit on patients' preparedness for surgery, perception of time spent with their healthcare team, and ultimately their satisfaction after surgery. The aim of this video is not to limit the doctor patient interaction (as all patients will still be granted their pre-allotted 30 minute visit with the physician regardless of their intervention allocation) but rather to augment the visit with additional educational information in an attempt to optimize the visit. Objective: A. Primary Aim(s): â€¢ To determine if patients feel more prepared for surgery with addition of preoperative patient education video B. Secondary Aim(s): - To determine if addition of preoperative patient education video correlates with improved patient satisfaction after surgery - To determine if patients' perception of time spent with healthcare team in preparation for surgery increases with addition of patient educational video - To determine if actual patient-physician time spent counseling differs between groups - To determine if patient preparedness is correlated with objective surgical outcomes - To determine if patient preparedness is correlated with patient symptom improvement scores after surgery Hypothesis: The addition of a preoperative patient education video enhances patient preparedness for surgery, increases perception of the amount of time patients spend with healthcare team, and improves patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
