	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to pilot an innovative motivational text-message intervention for individuals with anorexia nervosa and subthreshold anorexia nervosa. Patients will receive personalized motivational text-messages as an adjunct to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT will be provided to patients at no cost for the duration of the study. The investigators hypothesize that the text-messages will help increase motivation to change and kilocalorie intake and decrease eating disordered behavior.</brief_summary>
