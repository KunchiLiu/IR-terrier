	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to take images of the brain in order to see if long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) exposure during infancy influences brain structure and function in middle childhood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LCPUFA Supplementation: A Multi-Modality Imaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LCPUFAs are essential fatty acids that are found in all cells of the body, particularly in the brain, retina and other nervous tissue. LCPUFAs are found naturally in seeds, nuts, fish and human breast milk. The body can also make LCPUFAs from shorter-chain fatty acid precursors. The researchers in the study have previously found that LCPUFA supplementation during infancy has a beneficial effect on vision and development in the early years of life. However, researchers feel there is a growing need to better understand if there are structural and/or functional changes in the brain that explain these benefits. It is also important to understand if changes in development are still present later in childhood.</detailed_description>
