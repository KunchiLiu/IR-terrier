	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, parallel group, non-blinded phase III trial. Patients with advanced (locoregional or metastatic) gastric cancer not previously treated with chemotherapy for this stage will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive low-TOX (arm A) or EOX (arm B). Randomization will be stratified by performance status (ECOG 0 or 1).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Tox Vs Eox In Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable Or Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the incidence of the adenocarcinoma of the stomach is slowly decreasing, gastric cancer represents the second worldwide cause of cancer death after lung cancer. In patients with advanced disease, chemotherapy improves survival and quality of life. Combinations of two or three drugs including a platin derivative (cisplatin or oxaliplatin), a fluoropyrimidine (5FU or capecitabine) and an anthracycline (usually epirubicin) have demonstrated superiority compared to single or double agent therapy and are the current standard. As of today there are no published studies comparing anthracycline-based to taxane-based three-drug regimens. The objective of the present study is to compare EOX as evaluated in REAL-2 to the low-TOX regimen consisting of docetaxel, oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Low-TOX is expected to be better tolerated than the original DCF regimen. The study will be performed in the HER2 negative patients.</detailed_description>
