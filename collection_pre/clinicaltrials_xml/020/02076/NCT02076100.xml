	<brief_summary>This is a 3-part study of ruzasvir (MK-8408) for participants with hepatitis C infection. Successive participants will be enrolled as dose levels are evaluated to find the maximum safe and well tolerated dose of ruzasvir. Part I will be for participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 (GT3) and will run first: Part II will be for participants with HCV genotype 1a (GT1a), and Part III will be for participants with HCV genotype 2b (GT2b). Parts II and III may run concurrently. The primary study hypothesis is that a safe and tolerable dose of ruzasvir that reduces viral load will be found to support further clinical investigation.</brief_summary>
