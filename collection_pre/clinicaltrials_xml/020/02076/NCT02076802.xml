	<brief_summary>The epidemic data shows that prehypertension is associated with cardiovascular disease, and heavy dietary salt intake could improve the developing of hypertension. We detected the risk factors of coronary atherosclerosis of prehypertensive patients with different levels of salt intake. The aim of this multicenter prospective, randomized controlled study is to evaluate regular physical exercise and salt diet effects on progression of coronary artery disease in patients with prehypertension.</brief_summary>
