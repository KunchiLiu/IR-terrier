	<brief_summary>To evaluate treatment tolerability, adherence and quality of life (QoL) over 1 year in MS (Multiple Sclerosis) participants who have been switched - due to persistent tolerability issues, particularly injection problems - from a subcutaneous injectable disease-modifying treatment (DMT) given several times a week (Rebif, Betaferon or Copaxone) to once weekly Avonex 30 μg given intra-muscularly. Avonex will be applied by the injection device Avonex Pen.</brief_summary>
