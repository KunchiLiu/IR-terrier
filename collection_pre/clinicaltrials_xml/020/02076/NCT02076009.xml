	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of daratumumab when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) to that of lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd), in terms of progression-free survival in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Daratumumab, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (participants will be assigned by chance to study treatments), open-label (all participants and study personnel will know the identity of the study treatments), active-controlled (none of the study treatments are placebo), parallel-group (both treatment arms will run at the same time), multicenter study. In this study, daratumumab, lenalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone (DRd) will be compared with lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone (Rd) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either DRd or Rd. The study will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase (involving treatment cycles of approximately 28 days in length), and a Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase will extend from the administration of the first dose of study medication until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants will also discontinue study treatment if: they become pregnant; have their dose held for more than 28 days (or if 3 consecutive planned doses of daratumumab are missed for reasons other than toxicity); or for safety reasons (for example, adverse event). The Follow-up Phase will begin at the end of treatment and will continue until death, loss to follow-up, consent withdrawal for study participation, or study end, whichever occurs first. Eligible participants from Rd group who have had sponsor-confirmed disease progression will be offered the option for treatment with daratumumab monotherapy (of 28 days cycle). The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis of the primary endpoint is anticipated to be performed at approximately 18 months after the last subject is randomized. Study end is anticipated at approximately 5 years after the last subject is randomized. Blood and urine samples will be obtained at time points during the study, together with bone marrow aspirates/biopsies and skeletal surveys. Participant safety will be assessed throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have documented multiple myeloma and measurable disease Must have received at least 1 prior line of therapy for multiple myeloma and achieved a response (partial response or better) to at least one prior regimen Must have documented evidence of progressive disease as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group criteria on or after their last regimen Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status score of 0, 1, or 2 If a subject is receiving subsequent anticancer therapy (salvage therapy), the subject must have a "washout period" prior to receiving daratumumab monotherapy. This period is defined as 2 weeks or 5 pharmacokinetic halflives of the treatment, whichever is longer, before the start date planned daratumumab monotherapy. The only exception is emergency use of a short course of corticosteroids (equivalent of dexamethasone 40 milligram per day for a maximum of 4 days) before Daratumumab monotherapy, which is permitted Has received any of the following therapies: daratumumab or other antiCD38 therapies Has received antimyeloma treatment within 2 weeks or 5 pharmacokinetic halflives of the treatment Disease shows evidence of refractoriness or intolerance to lenalidomide or if previously treated with a lenalidomidecontaining regimen the participant is excluded if he or she discontinued due to any adverse event related to prior lenalidomide treatment Has received autologous stem cell transplantation within 12 weeks before the date of randomization, or previously received an allogenic stem cell transplant (regardless of timing), or planning to undergo a stem cell transplant prior to progression of disease History of malignancy (other than multiple myeloma) within 5 years before the first dose of daratumumab monotherapy (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or breast, or other noninvasive lesion, that in the opinion of the investigator, with concurrence with the sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence within 5 years)</criteria>
