	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is twofold: 1. Assess the clinical efficacy of DBS on epilepsy according to their number and severity at 1 year follow up. 2. Perform a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of Medicare at 1 and 2 years. The study hypothesis is that thalamic DBS (neurostimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus) will decrease significantly, the frequency (potentially 50% reduction in severe crises) of the most severe seizures, in at least 50% of patients who have drug-resistant partial epilepsy; and should also improve significantly the quality of life through a gain of independence in activities of daily life, the possible recovery of functional abilities, recovery of social or professional activities.</brief_summary>
