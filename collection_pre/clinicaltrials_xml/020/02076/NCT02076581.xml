	<brief_summary>It is often difficult to quantify and distinguish aspects of abnormal muscle tone due to neurological injury. This makes it difficult to evaluate therapies that aim to reduce the effects of abnormal muscle tone. This research study will evaluate the feasibility of a clinician worn device to capture and quantify features of spasticity and dystonia.</brief_summary>
