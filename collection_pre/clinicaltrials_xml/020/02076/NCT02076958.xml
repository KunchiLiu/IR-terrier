	<brief_summary>The aim of the proposed project is to identify an optimal implementation strategy using a set of evidence-based interventions that aim to increase early detection of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer among African Americans as a model. These three interventions will be packaged and interwoven into a single branded project, Project HEAL (Health through Early Awareness and Learning) which will be delivered through trained Community Health Advisors (CHA) in African-American church settings. The implementation and sustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM Framework. Fourteen African American churches in Prince George's County, MD will be randomized to a traditional classroom training approach or an online training approach, in which the CHA training approach and level of technical assistance is varied (in-person classroom training of CHAs + monitoring/evaluation + technical assistance and training vs. online training of CHAs + monitoring and evaluation only, respectively). By varying the training methodology and level of technical assistance, we will be able to determine what level of technical assistance leads to successful implementation and sustainability. We will also identify church organizational capacity characteristics that lead to successful implementation and sustainability. The specific aims of this research are to: (1) Package the three interventions into a single branded project (Project HEAL), develop a local cancer screening resource guide, and pilot test the materials and training. (2) Implement Project HEAL in 14 churches in Prince George's County, Maryland. We will evaluate the implementation outcomes involving treatment fidelity and identify church organizational capacity characteristics that led to successful implementation. We will compare the two implementation strategies (traditional vs. online) to determine the optimal level of technical assistance necessary for successful implementation. (3) Evaluate the sustainability of Project HEAL over a two-year period of time. We will identify church organizational capacity characteristics that led to sustainability, and compare the two implementation strategies (traditional vs. online) to determine the optimal level of technical assistance for successful sustainability.</brief_summary>
