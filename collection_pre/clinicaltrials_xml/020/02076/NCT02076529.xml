	<brief_title>Phamacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of Ramosetron in Chemotherapy Induced Nasea and Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nausea and vomiting is a common adverse event during chemotherapy treatment. Even if preventive medicines such as dopamine receptor antagonist, corticosteroid, serotonin receptor antagonist, has been developed and used, there is residual nausea and/or vomiting in a significant percentage of patients treated for cancer. Serotonin receptor antagonist is the most potent antiemetic agent and has been used widely. However, the optimal dose of serotonin antagnosit based on individual symptoms is not defined. Therefore, this study was conducted to design standardization model for optiomal serotonin antagonist concentration using pharmacodynamic study and Rhodes Index as a suggogate marker for CINV.</detailed_description>
