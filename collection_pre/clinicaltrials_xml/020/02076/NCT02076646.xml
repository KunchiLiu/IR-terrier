	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Dose Escalation Study of the Tumor-targeting Human L19-IL2 Monoclonal Antibody-cytokine Fusion Protein in Combination With Dacarbazine for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, open-label, multi-center, Phase I/II dose escalation study in which cohorts of 3-6 patients with metastatic melanoma will be assigned to receive escalating doses of L19-IL2 in combination with a fixed dose of Dacarbazine. After definition of MTD and RD during the phase II part of this study, 60 patients with Stage IV M1a and M1b melanoma will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive open label the combination treatment at the RD (Arm 1) or DTIC monotherapy (Arm 2).</detailed_description>
