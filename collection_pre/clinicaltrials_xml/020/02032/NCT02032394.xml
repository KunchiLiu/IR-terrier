	<brief_title>Effect of Chlorhexidine on Bacteriuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blind randomized study with control group. The population is patients in intensive care unit of Shahid Beheshti hospital of Babol city. Main include criteria are 18-55 years old, need to having urine catheter for 10 days at least and no urinary infection in catheterization time.

Sample size include 105 patients dividing in three equal groups of Povidone-iodine, Chlorhexidine and Normal saline randomly. Interventions are Washing perinea area and catheter first 5 centimeters by 15 ml of Povidone-iodine 10%, Chlorhexidine .2% or Normal saline .9%, 3 times a day for 10 days. Urine analysis are performed in days 1,3,5,7 and 9 after catheterization and urine cultures are performed in days 5 and 10 after catheterization for detection of bacteriuria and microorganism type.</detailed_description>
