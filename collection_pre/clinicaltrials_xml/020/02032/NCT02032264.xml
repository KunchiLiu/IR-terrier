	<brief_summary>To evaluate the benefits of using next generation sequencing to assess embryonic aneuploidy. All viable blastocysts will be biopsied and cryopreserved for future transfer. After the final embryo is cryopreserved, patients will be randomized to either the intervention group or the control group. Patients and doctors are blinded to the randomization until study completion. A Double Embryo Transfer (DET) will be performed with either screened or unscreened embryos depending on randomization. A Single Embryo Transfer (SET) may occur in cases where only one embryo is available for transfer.</brief_summary>
