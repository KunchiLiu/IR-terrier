	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether revalidation following total hip replacement through the percutaneous approach is faster or better than following the anterolateral approach. We assume this would be the case since it is possible to spare a large part of the gluteus medius muscle with the percutaneous approach.</brief_summary>
