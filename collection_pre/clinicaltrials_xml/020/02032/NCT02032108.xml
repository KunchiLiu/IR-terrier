	<brief_summary>Strategies to reduce the burden of diabetes in Rwanda, like in other resource poor settings, include involving diabetic patients in their own care and targeting modifiable risk factors through adopting appropriate dietary and lifestyle habits. According to previous research carried out in developed countries, lifestyle modifications may have effect on the development of diabetes and prevention of its complications. However, direct evidence to show whether lifestyle intervention is beneficial for diabetic patients in resources limited countries like Rwanda is an open question. Though in these countries, access to healthy diet is claimed to be the barrier of implementation of therapeutic lifestyle based initiatives, we hypothesize that knowledge gaps are more important barriers than access to healthier diets and other lifestyle habits. We therefore would like to carry out this intervention to assess the effects of lifestyle education programs on glycemic control among people with diabetes followed up at CHUK.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Lifestyle Education Programs on Diabetes Control in Rwanda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized controlled trial with two groups (one interventional and one control) to be followed up for 12 months. It will be carried out in Kigali University Teaching Hospital, the main referral hospital in Rwanda. Lifestyle intervention will consist in group counselling on dietary habits (meals composition, importance and ways to reduce unhealthy foods: salty (especially because hypertension is of concern among diabetic people and blood pressure will be one of the secondary outcome measures), sugar, unsaturated fats, smoking, alcohol abuse and adapt healthier regimens including fruits &amp; vegetables), effects of regular physical activity, importance of adherence to medications (including taking medications as directed, regular medical follow up,etcâ€¦), diabetes complications, actions to control blood sugar and ways of coping with stress. Education &amp; counselling sessions will be provided by a team of registered dietitians, nurses and counselors who will have been trained for this purpose prior to the intervention and will be taking between 45 to 60 min. After baseline data collection, subjects in the control group will continue to receive usual care delivered by attending physicians and nutritionists at CHUK. This includes usual monthly medical follow up and individual conselling on dietary habits and lifestyle change delivered by attending physicians and/or dietitians</detailed_description>
