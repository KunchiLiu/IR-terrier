	<brief_summary>Cellulitis is among the most common infections leading to hospitalization, yet the optimal duration of therapy remains ill defined. Pragmatically, Dutch guidelines advise 10-14 days of antibiotics, which is the current standard of care. Recently it has been shown that antibiotic treatment for pneumonia and urinary tract infections can safely and significantly be shortened. Importantly, in an outpatient setting, treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis with 5 days of antibiotics was as effective as 10 days. We hypothesize that there is no difference in outcomes when patients hospitalized with cellulitis are treated with either a short-course (6 days) or standard-course (12 days) of antibiotics.</brief_summary>
