	<detailed_description>The objective is to test the comparative effectiveness of a conjoint analysis decision aid intervention compared to usual care. The investigators will identify preferred attributes of prostate cancer treatments that will help in designing a conjoint analysis decision aid to help patients weigh treatment attributes. The investigators will employ values markers to represent clusters of values for particular aspects of treatments that are valued most by individual patients. The investigators will test if the concordance between values markers and treatment received is predictive of objective outcomes and subjective outcomes. The study hypothesis is that conjoint task may help in treatment choice and prostate cancer patients whose treatment is more concordant with their values markers will have improved outcomes.</detailed_description>
