	<criteria>Male or female aged ≥ 18 years Current diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (updated Dana Point Classification 1). Current inhalative therapy with 5 µg iloprost using the INeb nebulizer WHO functional class III at the time of the patient's commencement of inhalative therapy with iloprost Hemodynamic diagnosis of Pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH) showing mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) &gt; 25 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) &lt; 15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) &gt; 320 dyn•s•cm5 If nonspecific types of chronic treatment for PAH are being administered: Stable dosage of these for at least the 4 weeks up to screening If PAHspecific drug treatments (such as endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) or phosphodiesterase5 (PDE5) inhibitors) are being administered: Stable dosage of these for at least the 3 months up to screening. PAH related to any other etiology, especially to pulmonary venoocclusive disease (PVOD) Clinically relevant obstructive lung disease Evidence of thromboembolic disease (probable pulmonary embolism) within 3 years before screening Cerebrovascular events within 3 months before screening Atrial septostomy within the 6 months before screening Severe arrhythmia, or severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within 6 months before screening, or congenital or acquired valvular defects with clinically relevant myocardial function disorders unrelated to PAH Systolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mm Hg, or uncontrolled systemic hypertension (systolic BP &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg) Hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B, C) or chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl) and /or requirement of dialysis Clinically relevant bleedings disorders or conditions with increased risk for hemorrhages (active ulcers, trauma etc.) Addition or dose change of PAH specific drug treatments such as ERA or PDE5 inhibitors within 3 months before screening, or addition or dose change of nonspecific treatments for PAH such as calcium channel blockers, nitrates, digitalis, diuretics within 4 weeks before Screening, or any kind of prostanoid other than those mentioned in inclusion criteria within less than 5 halflives before treatment</criteria>
