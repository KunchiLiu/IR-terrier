	<brief_summary>Survivors of childhood cancer have an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease due to both the therapies they received while undergoing treatment and diet and lifestyle factors. The nature of cardiovascular risk and the interaction between treatment affects and cardiovascular risk factors is unknown. We propose to study vascular inflammatory markers as well as measure of blood vessel stiffness (both of which are predictive of early heart disease) in 100 pediatric cancer survivors and 100 control children. Characterization of vascular inflammation and stiffness in long-term survivors will allow for the development of future interventions to decrease inflammation through both pharmacologic and lifestyle modifications.</brief_summary>
