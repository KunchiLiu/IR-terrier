	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with Pompe disease who previously completed a neoGAA study. The patient and/or their parent/legal guardian is willing and able to provide signed informed consent, and the patient, if &lt;18 years of age, is willing to provide assent if deemed able to do so. The patient (and patient's legal guardian if patient is &lt;18 years of age) must have the ability to comply with the clinical protocol. The patient, if female and of childbearing potential, must have a negative pregnancy test [urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin] at baseline. Exclusion criteria: The patient is concurrently participating in another clinical study using investigational treatment. The patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable to adhere to the requirements of the study. The patient has clinically significant organic disease (with the exception of symptoms relating to Pompe disease), including clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, or renal disease, or other medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes participation in the study or potentially decreases survival. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
