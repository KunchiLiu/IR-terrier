	<brief_summary>Isolated surgical repair of the inside portion of the tibia may be enough to stabilize an ankle fracture in which both the tibia and the fibula are broken. This would alleviate the need for another incision, plate, and screws to repair the fibula. The purpose of this study is to help determine if surgically repairing only the tibia fracture will lead to equivalent clinical outcomes when compared with surgical repair of both bones. The hypothesis of this study is that operative stabilization of the medial malleolus fracture only, in otherwise ligamentously stable bimalleolar and/or trimalleolar fractures of the ankle, will lead to equivalent clinical outcomes and functional scores as those treated with operative stabilization of both malleoli and/or all malleoli.</brief_summary>
