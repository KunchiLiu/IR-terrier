	<brief_summary>This trial was open to participants who had received a liver transplant or had cirrhosis due to chronic HCV. All subjects were treated with daclatasvir+sofosbuvir+ribavirin and were followed for 24 weeks post treatment. Under certain conditions, the treatment duration could have been extended for cirrhotic participants. The study tested the efficacy and safety of this combination for treatment of HCV in cirrhotic and post transplant patients.</brief_summary>
