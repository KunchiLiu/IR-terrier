	<brief_summary>A genomic test was developed to predict chemo-sensitivity to taxane-anthracycline-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment. The primary aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the microarray-based, genomic test as a predictor of axillary lymph node response. Also, to determine whether the probability of achieving negative axillary nodes, is sufficiently high for patients whose breast cancer is predicted to be chemo-sensitive to support omitting axillary dissection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical status of lymph nodes must be available Sonographical status of lymph nodes must be available Patients must consent to documentation of cancer treatment Histologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, clinical stage T14, M0 (noninflammatory T4c) Patients scheduled for neoadjuvant chemotherapy Treatment with a 3weekly FEC or AC regimen (34 cycles) followed by 34 cycles of q3 weekly docetaxel or paclitaxel. Local HER2 status of tumor biopsy must be negative. The patient has a prior history of invasive or metastatic breast cancer. The patient had prior excisional biopsy of the primary invasive breast cancer. The patient had prior ipsilateral sentinel axillary lymph node biopsy for breast cancer. The patient cannot safely or feasibly undergo biopsy of the primary tumor. The patient has a diagnosis of Stage IV (distant metastatic) breast cancer. The patient has proven HER2positive breast cancer, defined as a pathology report of amplification of the gene or 3+ score for immunohistochemical staining.</criteria>
