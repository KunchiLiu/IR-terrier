	<brief_summary>Primary graft dysfunction, a form of reperfusion pulmonary edema that occurs early after lung transplantation, shares key clinical and pathological features with acute lung injury and its more severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, in contrast to acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which biomarkers in plasma, urine and lung edema fluid have prognostic and pathogenetic value, the role of biomarkers in primary graft dysfunction has been less thoroughly explored. We will try in this study de determine the rule of pneumoproteins in the donor organ on the pulmonary edema in the recipient.</brief_summary>
