	<brief_title>Evaluation of Non-Ablative Laser for Treatment of Direct Brow Lift Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who undergo a direct brow lift may participate in this study. Participants will receive laser treatment on one of the two surgical wounds (side of treatment will be chosen randomly by an independent source). Treatment parameters will be 500 spots and 10-14 megajoules (mJ) depending on skin type. The opposite side brow scar will not be treated until 1 month after the study is completed (if the patient elects to treat the contralateral brow after study completion this will be done at no charge to the patient). This treatment will be given at 2-4 week intervals for 6 treatments. Photographs will be taken at each visit, and they will be assessed based on different parameters by an examiner, as well as judged by the patient based on overall appearance.</detailed_description>
