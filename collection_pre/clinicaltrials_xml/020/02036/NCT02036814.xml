	<brief_summary>The aim was to test if interpersonal relationships group strategies provided by nursing can promote an additional benefit on blood pressure (BP) control and quality of life (QoL) in hypertensive patients. Methods: 21 treated patients were randomized into two groups: Group A 10 patients (8 women), underwent to a health educational orientation program (inter-relational strategy), with group meetings every 15 days during 4 months(8 meetings). Group B 11 patients (7 women), who underwent group orientation by the nurse every 40 days during 4 months (3 meetings). Both groups received the same content guidelines (healthy lifestyle and prevention of risk factors). The patients had 2 visits by nurses at baseline (15 days) and at the final study (120 days). BP was measured by auscultatory method and QoL questionnaire (WHOQoL-Brief)was applied. The dispensing and pill counts were done every 30 days. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed at baseline and after 120 days.</brief_summary>
