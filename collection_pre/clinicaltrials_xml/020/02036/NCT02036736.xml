	<brief_summary>The recovery of cognitive and psychomotor functions is best performed under anesthesia after desflurane when propofol in that obtaining a Aldrete score&gt; 8/10 output of the allowing SSPI. The principal objective is to compare the cognitive and psychomotor status of patients recovered an Aldrete score&gt; 8/10 according to the anesthetic agent (propofol or desflurane) using three tests (Stroop test, Digit Symbol Substitution task and a test of verbal memory (visual verbal learning test) made SSPI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Influence of the Strategy Intraoperative Anesthetic (Desflurane Versus Propofol) on Cognitive and Psychomotor Functions in Output Post Interventional Room Monitoring - COGNIDES</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The day before surgery, patients sign the consent and will be randomized. Then 3 tests (Stroop test, Digit Symbol Substitution Task and visual verbal learning test) will be performed. No anxiolysis will be given to the patient. The anesthetic induction will be with IV propofol (2-3 mg / kg). The maintenance will anesthetic, desflurane by for a minimum alveolar concentration of between 2% and 6% or propofol for intravenous anesthesia user target controlled. In SSPI, the Aldrete score will be evaluated every 5min. Upon obtaining a Aldrete score&gt; 8/10, the day before the tests will be carried out again</detailed_description>
