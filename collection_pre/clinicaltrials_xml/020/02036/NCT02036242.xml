	<brief_summary>It is common for obstetric anesthesia using opioid supplement to local anesthetics for epidural labor pain control. Given the low doses of these epidural drugs, we never doubt the necessity of the supplement of opioid to lacal anesthetics during this process based on the concept that opioid addition can enhance and prolong the analgesic effect of local anesthetics. However, we unavoidably encounter many opioid-associated side effects during the labor delivery. In addition, usage of opioid increase the medical cost for each patient. We herein hypothesized that in the context of obstetric anesthesia, sole local anesthetics can produce as the same analgsic effect as opioid plus local anesthetics given for epidural labor pain control.</brief_summary>
