	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: All Participants Age 1018 years at time of visit Concussion Group Present to JHH PED within the first 24 hours following trauma. Diagnosis of concussion as defined by the 3rd International Conference on Concussion in Sport (McCrory), including the presence of any one or more of the following: 1. Symptoms (ie. headache, neck pain, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, balance problems, sensitive to light, sensitivity to noise, feeling slowed down, feeling in a fog, difficulty concentrating, difficulty remembering, fatigue, confusion, drowsiness, more emotional, irritability, sadness, nervous) 2. Physical Signs (ie. loss of consciousness, unsteadiness) 3. Impaired brain function (ie. confusion) Glasgow Coma Score of 1315 upon arrival to JHH PED. Loss of consciousness of less than 15 minutes (if applicable). No structural intracranial injuries identified on neuroimaging (if completed). EXCLUSION CRITERIA All Participants History of prior concussion or traumatic brain injury within preceding 6 weeks. History of prior intracranial disease or mass (ie. tumor, intraventricular hemorrhage, etc.) Presence of intracranial hardware. Complaints of respiratory distress, tachypnea or hypoxia, which may affect regional cerebral oxygen saturation. Inability to stand secondary to lower extremity disease or trauma, which is required for completion of SCAT2. Inability to complete SCAT2 questionnaire secondary to developmental delay. Child in foster care or legal guardian not available. Participant known to be pregnant, which alters total body blood flow and likely affects regional cerebral oxygen saturation.
