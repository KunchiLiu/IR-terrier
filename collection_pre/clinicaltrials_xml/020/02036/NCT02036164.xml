	<brief_summary>Data of survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) are still limited and inconsistent. We will investigate if ACT has survival benefit over CCRT alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) is the standard treatment for cervical cancer of FIGO stage IIB-IVA or so called locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). However, failure rate after treatment is still as high as 30% to 40%. This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial which evaluates whether adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after CCRT will improve treatment outcome comparing to CCRT alone.</detailed_description>
