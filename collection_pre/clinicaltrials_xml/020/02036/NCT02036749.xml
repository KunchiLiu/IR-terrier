	<brief_summary>The Quadratus Lumborum (QL) Block is an ultrasound-guided technique described by Rafael Blanco in 2007. The nerves to the lower abdominal wall can be anesthetized by injecting local anesthetics close to the anterior border of the quadratus lumborum muscle. In our randomized, controlled, double-blinded study ultrasound-guided QL-blocks in 20 female patients after cesarean delivery will be compared with a placebo control group of 20 patients to investigate analgesic consumption, pain level, opioid related side effects and mobilization.</brief_summary>
