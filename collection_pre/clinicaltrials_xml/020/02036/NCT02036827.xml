	<brief_title>The Effect of Deep Neuromuscular Blockade on Postoperative Shoulder Tip Pain After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the gold standard treatment for gall bladder disease. However, 30-50% of patients suffer from shoulder tip pain, which might arise from diaphragm stretch due to pneumoperitoneum. In the previous pilot study, working intra-abdominal space was increased in the condition of deep neuromuscular blockade. And thus investigators hypothesized that the depth of neuromuscular blockade can affect insufflation pressure and intra-abdominal volume, which result in the severity of diaphragm stretch and postoperative shoulder pain. In addition, the depth of neuromuscular blockade can alter pulmonary compliance.</detailed_description>
