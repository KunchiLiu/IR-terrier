	<brief_summary>Comparison of an ultrasound guided bilateral TAP (transversus abdominis plane) block with dexamethasone and preperitoneal instillation of local anesthetic with dexamethasone under direct visualization will be compared it to a standard anesthetic technique (control) following a TEP (total extraperitoneal) bilateral hernia repair. The investigators are hypothesizing that the bilateral TAP block and preperitoneal instillation of local anesthetics with the addition of dexamethasone are superior in terms of patient satisfaction and post-operative pain control when compared to a standard anesthetic technique (no regional technique).</brief_summary>
