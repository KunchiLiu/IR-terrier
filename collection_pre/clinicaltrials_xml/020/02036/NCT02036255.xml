	<brief_summary>The objective of our study is to investigate whether the substitution of the standard locking solution with a locking solution containing taurolidine and urokinase weekly (Taurolock â„¢ U 25,000 - www.taurolock.com ) reduces the rate of catheter dysfunction in hemodialysis patients with a history of TCC dysfunction requiring urokinase therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult, prevalent hemodialysis patients Informed and consented Hemodialysis 3x/week via a tunneled cuffed catheter Urokinase administration at least two times during the previous 6 months (with more than a week between 2 administrations) Adequate catheter function during the week before inclusion (defined by blood flow more than 250ml/min on each dialysis session and blood flow within 15% of the maximal blood flow after the last Urokinase administration) Presence of heparininduced thrombocytopenia Major hemorrhage or intracranial bleeding in the previous 3 months Pericarditis Intolerance to Taurolidine, citrate or to Urokinase Active catheterrelated infection Catheter in the femoral vein</criteria>
