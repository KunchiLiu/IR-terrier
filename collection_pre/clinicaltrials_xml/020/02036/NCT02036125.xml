	<brief_title>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating Effectiveness of Ultrasound in Corticosteroid Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corticosteroid injection is routinely given for treating carpal tunnel syndrome. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound guided corticosteroid injection in reducing symptoms caused by carpal tunnel syndrome. In this randomised clinical trial, 50 patients with both a clinical and electromyographic diagnosis of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome will be recruited from the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS). Subjects will be randomised to ultrasound guided or blind injection groups. All subjects will receive 40 mg of methylprednisolone. The primary outcome will be the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire - Symptom Severity Scale at baseline and 3 months post injection. Both subjects and assessors will be blinded.</detailed_description>
