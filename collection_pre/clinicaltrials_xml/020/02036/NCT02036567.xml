	<brief_summary>This longitudinal observational study will attempt to objectively measure pain with an experimental, non-invasive device. Patients and volunteers will receive a baseline screening with psychophysical tests and questionnaires. Investigators will apply the device to measure pain during routine clinical care and correlate patients pain ratings and analgesia requirements to that measured by the device. A more standardized approach with experimental pain stimuli will be pursued in human volunteer studies.</brief_summary>
