	<brief_summary>This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in participants with refractory or relapsed and refractory Multiple Myeloma (rrMM), and in combination with carfilzomib and low-dose dexamethasone in participants with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma (rMM). This study is being done to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when given in combination with standard of care (SOC) treatments in participants with rrMM or rMM. Preliminary efficacy data will also be assessed. The primary study hypothesis is that these combinations are sufficiently well tolerated to permit further clinical investigation.</brief_summary>
