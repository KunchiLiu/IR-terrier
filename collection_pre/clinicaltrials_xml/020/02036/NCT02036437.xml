	<brief_title>Titrated Oral Misoprostol Compared to Vaginal Dinoprostone for Induction of Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- There are many indications for induction of labor in the obstetric practice, of which prolonged gestational age stands as the most common indication. It is well recognized that with an unripe cervix, induction may be difficult and often unsuccessful. The use of an agent to ripen the cervix prior to induction is acceptable in the modern practice. - Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is the most interesting alternative to Dinoprostone because of its effectiveness, low cost, and temperature stability. It ripens the cervix by inducing regular uterine contractions. However, it is associated with several adverse effects especially uterine hyperstimulation, which is painful and may result in fetal compromise. - Testing the efficacy and safety of titrated oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone may develop a new safe and effective method for labor induction.</detailed_description>
