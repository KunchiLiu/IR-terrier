	<brief_summary>This study involves development and testing of a patient and family-centered transitional care program for patients who are hospitalized with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations. The study intervention includes tailored services to address individual patients' biopsychosocial needs, starting early during hospital stay and continuing for 3 months post hospital discharge. The study hypothesis is that compared to usual care, the study intervention will : a) Improve patient health- related quality of life and survival, and reduce use of hospital and emergency room visits; b) result in improved patient experience, self- confidence, and self-care behaviors; c) result in improved family caregivers coping skills, self-confidence, and problem solving skills to address patient barriers to care and treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluates using a randomized controlled trial design the impact of a patient and family-centered transitional care program named the BREATHE program. The BREATHE program stands for 'Better Respiratory Education and Treatment Help Empower'. The BREATHE program offers the following: 1. Individualized transition support services to help ensure that the patient (and family caregiver if available) are prepared for discharge, understand the discharge plan of care, and receive post discharge follow up to help meet their needs 2. Tailored COPD self-management education and support program that starts during the hospital stay and continues post discharge in the community setting 3. Facilitated access to community based services. The intervention is delivered by a new team member called "COPD Nurse Transition Guide". The new team member works with both the hospital and outpatient care teams, is a registered nurse with homecare services experience, and have received additional training in COPD self-management and motivational interviewing. The nurse meets participants in the hospital and then follows up with them via home visits and phone calls.The intervention involves both patients and family caregivers (if available), is literacy adapted, and follows a tailored approach based on patient needs, priorities, and preferences.</detailed_description>
