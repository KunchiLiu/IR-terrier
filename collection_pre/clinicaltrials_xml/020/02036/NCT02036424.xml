	<brief_summary>To determine if there is visual benefit with Ozurdex treatment every three months compared to monthly anti-VEGF alone, in subjects with persistent diabetic macular edema. The investigator hypothesizes more frequent administration of Ozurdex in patients that have persistent diabetic macular edema will result in a more rapid and sustained improvement of visual acuity and/or optical coherence topography (OCT) compared to the use of anti-VEGF alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Statistics throughout this study referred to the number of eyes rather than the number of subjects. Subjects were allowed to have both eyes in the study provided that inclusion/exclusion criteria were met. Five subjects had both eyes in the study; 45 subjects were actually enrolled, resulting in 50 study eyes.</detailed_description>
