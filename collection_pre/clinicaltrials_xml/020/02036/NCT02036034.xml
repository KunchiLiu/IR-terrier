	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Modified Ophthalmic Draping Method in Preventing Carbon Dioxide Accumulation in Patient Undergoing Eye Surgery Under Local Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Majority of eye surgery has been widely done under local anesthesia provided by the ophthalmologist with or without sedation.The surgical drapes used often covers the patients face and beyond in order to maintain sterility of the surgical field. This can lead to accumulation of carbon dioxide under ophthalmic drapes due to the exhaled carbon dioxide escapes incompletely through the drapes;hence results in an increase of carbon dioxide in the ambient air surrounding the patient's head.This causes an increase in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure and thus hyperventilation and patient discomfort with restlessness and unable to stay still during the surgery. In recent years,several types of ophthalmic drapes have been produced.This study is look for possible difference in accumulation of carbon dioxide under the standard ophthalmic drapes compared to the modified draping.</detailed_description>
