	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed non-skin cancer, and the second leading cause of men cancer death in the United States. Hormonal therapy remains a first-line treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Initial responses to hormonal therapy with chemical or surgical castration are quite favorable, however, most patients will progress to a castration-resistant phase of the disease. Docetaxel is the primary chemotherapeutic option for patients with mCRPC. Abiraterone is a novel, selective, irreversible, and potent inhibitor of 17-[alpha]-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17) enzymatic activity that has recently been demonstrated to further reduce testosterone levels in the blood to undetectable range (&lt; 1 ng/dL) and is suggested to reduce de novo intratumor androgen synthesis. Abiraterone demonstrated activity in castration resistant prostate cancer patients previously treated with docetaxel chemotherapy. Recently, results of a phase III trial comparing abiraterone plus prednisone vs placebo plus prednisone in asymptomatic and without visceral metastasis, castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer patients, demonstrated a better radiological progression free survival for abiraterone treated patients and a trend towards a better survival was clear for abiraterone treated patients. No clinical evidence exists about efficacy of chemotherapy and antiandrogen therapy combination. All trials have been performed in patients in which LHRH agonist treatment was continued although there is not clear evidence about efficacy of hormonal treatment. Some retrospective studies suggest that androgen deprivation treatment should be maintained in chemotherapy treated patients. Abiraterone has been proved to suppress androgen levels to negative values, and to add efficacy to castration hormonal therapy. Combination of abiraterone with docetaxel chemotherapy seems promising adding efficacy to only docetaxel chemotherapy. A randomized phase II study comparing docetaxel + prednisone + abiraterone to docetaxel + prednisone in mCRPC in patients treated previously with abiraterone, seems promising to explore addition of efficacy to taxotere after abiraterone hormonal treatment.</brief_summary>
