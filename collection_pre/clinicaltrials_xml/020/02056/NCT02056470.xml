	<brief_title>Evaluate the Safety, Functionality, and the Quality of Life of Patients Who Receive the Freedom Total Knee ® System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical study will involve a series of evaluations performed by your surgeon. These examinations are consistent with the normal surgeon care as part of Total Knee Replacement surgery. The study objective is to assess the safety, functionality, and survivorship of the Freedom Knee System through a multi-center clinical trial. Study endpoints include a comparison of Pre-Surgery (baseline) versus Post-Surgery data for Range of Motion and Flexion, Quality of Life (KSS), and survivorship (defined by 'no revisions'). Additionally, the structural integrity will be evaluated based on the x-ray performed 36-months after knee replacement.</detailed_description>
