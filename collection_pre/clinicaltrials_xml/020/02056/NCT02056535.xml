	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) among Mexican-origin young adults (age 18-25), using a motivational intervention delivered by a Health Promotion Advocate, relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems in the emergency department (ED) at the U.S.-Mexico border; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. Patients will be re-assessed by telephone at three and twelve months to evaluate outcomes.The specific hypotheses to be examined in this proposal are: 1) the motivational interview will lead to significantly greater reductions in the maximum number of drinks on an occasion and in Rapid Alcohol Problem Screen (RAPS4) score at the 12-month follow-up compared to standard care without assessment (those who screen positive but are not assessed) as well as compared to standard care with assessment; 2) the motivational interview will lead to significantly greater reductions in number of drinking days per week, average number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion, RAPS4 score, and number of negative consequences of drinking at 3-month and 12-month follow-up compared to standard care with assessment; 3) a positive breath alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of the ED visit and/or self-reported drinking prior to the event resulting in the ED visit will be positively predictive of effectiveness of the intervention; 4) attributing a causal association of drinking and the reason for the ED visit will be positively associated with effectiveness of brief intervention; 5) readiness to change (and stage of change) will be positively associated with effectiveness of brief intervention; 6) risk taking/impulsivity and sensation seeking dispositions will be negatively associated with effectiveness of brief intervention.</brief_summary>
