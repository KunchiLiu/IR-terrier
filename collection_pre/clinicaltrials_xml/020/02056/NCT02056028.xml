	<brief_summary>The definition of biliary fistula is heterogeneous and the more accepted is that proposed by the ISGLS. We devised a precise definition of post-resectional biliary fistula and a well-established policy both for its disclosure and management.Aim was the validation of our definition, and management of biliary fistula after hepatic resection in a large prospective cohort of patients and its comparison with that of the International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bile Leak After Liver Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data on abdominal drains and on clinical, pathological and short-term outcome were reviewed in a prospective cohort of patients who underwent hepatic resection between 2004 and 2012. Drains were maintained at least 7 days, and the bilirubin levels were measured in POD3, 5, and 7. Drains were removed if the bilirubin level in POD7 was inferior than in POD5, and less than 10 mg/dl. Statistical analysis on prognostic factors for biliary fistula was performed.</detailed_description>
