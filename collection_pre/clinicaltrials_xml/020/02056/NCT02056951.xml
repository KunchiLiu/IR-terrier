	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to analyse the long-term effectiveness of an interprofessional and interdisciplinary rehabilitation program named "PASTOR", with a biopsychosocial approach for participants with chronic non-specific low back pain (CLBP) compared to the standard inpatient multidisciplinary orthopaedic rehabilitation (MOR) in Germany. The investigators hypothesize that in adults with CLBP the rehabilitation program PASTOR would result in a significantly higher increase in functional ability 12 months after completion of the program in comparison to the standard inpatient MOR. The investigators further hypothesize that PASTOR would lead to significantly larger improvements regarding pain-related cognitions, pain coping strategies, physical activity, health-related quality of life, and back pain episodes compared to the standard inpatient MOR.</brief_summary>
