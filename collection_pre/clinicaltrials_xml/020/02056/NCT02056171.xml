	<brief_title>Efficacy of Quetiapine for Pediatric Delirium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many children in the ICU become confused, due to their underlying illness or treatment effects. The medical term for this confusion is delirium. In adults, a medication called quetiapine has been effective in treating delirium. This is considered an "off label" use as the FDA has not approved quetiapine for this indication. Pediatricians have been using quetiapine to treat delirium in children as well, but there is currently no data proving that it is effective in children. This study is being done to determine if quetiapine is effective for the treatment of ICU delirium in children.</detailed_description>
