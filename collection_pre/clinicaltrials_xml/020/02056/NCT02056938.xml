	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the following randomized open label trial is to demonstrate how low immunological risk patients (no anti HLA immunization and first kidney transplantation) but diagnosed at high-risk of delayed graft function (assessed by DGFS score) could benefit from induction with ATG for preventing delayed graft function compared to Basiliximab.</brief_summary>
