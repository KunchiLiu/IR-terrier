	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give alpha lipoic acid in people with cardiac autonomic neuropathy(CAN). Cardiac autonomic neuropathy(CAN) affects the nerves that control heart rate and blood flow to the heart in people with diabetes. CAN may cause problems with the rhythm of the heartbeat or decrease blood flow to the heart.</brief_summary>
