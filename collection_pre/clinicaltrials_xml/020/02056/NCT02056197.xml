	<brief_summary>Motor control exercises have demonstrated a good option for recovery from chronic low back pain. The purpose of this study is investigated the effectiveness of an exercise program for trunk stabilization performed in stable and unstable surfaces for people with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP). Patients will be randomly divided into 3 groups; control group will receive placebo treatment with shortwave; stable group will receive an exercise protocol to stabilize the trunk on a stable surface and unstable group will receive the same exercise protocol but performed on an unstable surface. We hypothesized the unstable group will present pain reduction and functional improvement.</brief_summary>
