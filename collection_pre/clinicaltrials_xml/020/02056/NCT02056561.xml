	<brief_summary>Introduction and Aim: Desflurane and sevoflurane are frequently used for maintenance of anesthesia and studies have shown that these anesthetics cause a variety of changes in oxidative stress and antioxidative defense mechanisms. The chemical structure of propofol is similar to some free radical consumers such as endogenous vitamin E and butylated hydroxene toluene. This study aims to compare the effects of sevoflurane, desflurane and propofol infusion anesthesia on the oxidant and antioxidant systems of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Material and Method: Forty-five patients, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) I-II, score between 18-50 years with planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) (group T n: 15), sevoflurane (group S n: 15) and desflurane (group D n: 15). Propofol 2 mg/kg IV, fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV, vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg IV given to all groups for anesthesia induction. For maintenance of anesthesia group S were ventilated with 2% sevoflurane, 50% air and 50% O2 mix at 6 L/min flow. Group D were given 6% desflurane 50% air and 50% O2 mix at 6 L/min flow. Group T were given propofol infusions of 12 mg/kg/hr for the first 10 minutes, 9 mg/kg/hr for the second 10 minutes and 6 mg/kg/hr after that. Patients were ventilated with 50% air and 50% O2 mix at 6 L/min flow. Before induction and after the operation venous blood samples were taken to evaluate the levels of glutathion peroxidase, total oxidants and antioxidants.</brief_summary>
