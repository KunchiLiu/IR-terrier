	<brief_summary>Postoperative Ileus is defined as the transient postoperative functional inhibition of propulsive bowel activity. The ethiology of this process can best be described as multifactorial. In its pathogenesis different mechanisms are involved such as hormones and neuropeptides, inflammation, narcotics and the Autonomic nervous system. Is one of the most common causes of prolonged hospital stays after abdominal surgery, thereby increasing health-care resource utilization. More importantly, it causes patient discomfort in the form of nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. It has a variable duration but is usually solved in 3 to 4 days. Prolonged Ileus is associated with postoperative complications like an increase on urinary and pulmonary infections, profound venous thrombosis and wound-site complications. Mosapride is a prokinetic agent that acts as a selective serotonin agonist (5- HT4) that facilitates acetylcholine release from the intrinsic plexus. This accelerates gastric emptying and propulsive peristaltic movements on the lower intestines. Mosapride has no action over the central nervous system therefore the lesser side effects like cardiac arrhythmias and extrapyramidal symptoms. For being a safer drug we chose it to be the center of our research. Two randomized controlled trials studied Mosapride concluding it shortens PI after colorectal surgery. However these trials took place on specific populations (Orientals) with less than 50 patients and only one of them included laparoscopic treatment specifically. Also the end point of these studies didn't consider the impact of PI over hospital stay or costs to the health system. We therefore decided to conduct a prospective randomized study in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery for colon cancer. The patients will be randomized to receive treatment or placebo after surgery. With this study we intend to prove that patients treated with mosapride immediately after surgery suffer from shorter postoperative ileus with earlier oral intake and shorter hospital stay. The primary aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of the use of Mosapride in shortening the duration of the Postoperative ileus in patients undergoing colorectal laparoscopic surgery. The trial hypothesis is that the standardized use of Mosapride immediately after colorectal laparoscopic surgery is safe and accelerates the recovery of propulsive bowel activity, thereby shortening postoperative ileus and hospital stay.</brief_summary>
