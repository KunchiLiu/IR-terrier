	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to examine 121 postmenopausal women diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer who have been taking aromatase inhibitors (AI) for at least 6 months and are experiencing at least mild arthralgia originating during AI treatment, the yearlong effect of exercise vs. attention control (health education), and on toxic side effects of AI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormones and Physical Exercise (HOPE) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to examine, in 121 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who have been taking an AI for at least 2 months and are currently experiencing at least mild arthralgia associated with AI use, the effect of a randomized controlled exercise intervention vs. attention control (health education) on severity of arthralgia, endocrine-related Quality of Life(QOL), Bone Mineral Density(BMD), and mediators/mechanisms influencing the effect of exercise on arthralgia severity. Women will be randomized to a year long exercise program or attention control group. Women randomized to exercise will participate in 150 min/wk of aerobic exercise and a twice-weekly strength training program. The investigators will conduct baseline, six-, and 12-month clinic visits, as well as a 3- and 9-month mailing to evaluate the effect of the intervention on study outcomes.</detailed_description>
