	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: - Compare PEEP level selected by individualized PEEP titration by electrical impedance tomography and PEEP level routinely used in post-operative cardiac patients with ARDS; - Compare the stability of the selected PEEP in both groups: individualized PEEP titration by electrical impedance tomography and the Control group (default strategy currently used in the institution) - Evaluate the agreement between the results of a rapid titration (total procedure duration = 5 min) versus an already validated slow titration (total procedure duration = 40 min) of the same patient, sequentially. Specifically, degree of collapse and degree of distention in each PEEP level, estimated by EIT; - Compare hemodynamic and oxygenation effects during the two maneuvers titration; - Evaluate the stability of the selected PEEP according to the rapid titration (minimum PEEP capable of collapsing equal or less 1%) in the maintenance of three variables over a four hour period: arterial oxygenation, respiratory system compliance, and degree of collapse by EIT; - Compare these results (evolution of the three variables, within 4 hours) compared to control (default strategy currently used in the institution) group. - Evaluate collapse amount determined by electrical impedance tomography (collapse &lt; 1%) and compares with collapse amount determined by pulmonary ultrasound during PEEP titration and pulmonary recruitment maneuver .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increases the morbidity and mortality of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the postoperative period of cardiac surgery, the use of intraoperative extracorporeal circulation is one of the factors triggering the syndrome, its incidence increasing. Potentially, a protective ventilatory strategy with optimal positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) could improve the prognosis of those patients with ARDS. An already validated maneuver to titrate the ideal PEEP to these patients has a longer duration, about 40 minutes. The lung Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) monitors respiratory system mechanics and intrathoracic lung volume changes and provides information about regional behavior and recruitability of lung tissue and thereby allows shortening titration maneuver, reducing its hemodynamic effects. Pulmonary Ultrasound (PU) is a useful tool in the alveolar-interstitial syndrome, consolidations, pleural effusion and pneumothorax diagnosis, and often has higher accuracy than chest radiography performed at bedside. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that PU can identify and quantify the changes in lung aeration secondary to different treatments and procedures, and individual optimization of the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Will participate this study patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery with a diagnosis of ARDS diagnosed from PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 250 mmHg calculated values supplied by arterial blood gas collected with FiO2 60% and presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography, admitted to the surgical ICU from Heart Institute, University of SÃ£o Paulo. Recruitment maneuver and PEEP titration maneuver will be monitored by EIT and PU. All patients will be followed and monitored for 4 hours, with measures of the evolution of alveolar collapse . Hemodynamic and oxygenation data will also be recorded .</detailed_description>
