	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study investigating the safety and efficacy of NA-1 in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) undergoing endovascular repair of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Up to 300 male and female patients with SAH undergoing endovascular repair of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm will be dosed with 2.60 mg/kg of NA-1 or placebo as a 10 minute intravenous infusion after completion of the endovascular procedure on Day 1 of the study period. Subjects will undergo interim procedures at Day 2-4, Day 30-45, and end-of-study procedures on Day 90.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. A diagnosis of a ruptured brain aneurysm deemed suitable for repair by neuroendovascular techniques involving intraluminal occlusion by detachable platinum coils, or any neuroendovascular technique such as balloonassisted coiling, stenting, or flowed diversion. 2. Patient should be Grade IIIV on the WFNS grading scale for SAH. 3. Male or female with a minimum age of 18 years on the day of enrolment. 4. Female subjects of childbearing potential: Negative pregnancy test. 5. Nonsurgically sterile males or males with partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use condoms with spermicide for 3 months after completion of dosing. 6. Body weight less than or equal to 180 kg. 7. Vital signs on admission: Blood pressure between 80180 mm Hg systolic/50100 mm Hg diastolic; Body temperature ≤ 38.5C. 8. Informed consent and availability of the subject for the entire study period and willingness of the subject to adhere to protocol requirements. 1. Prior SAH within 6 months of presentation. 2. Dissecting or mycotic brain aneurysm. 3. Planned endovascular vessel sacrifice as the primary modality for aneurysm treatment. 4. Known history of lifethreatening allergic reaction to any medication. 5. Chronic renal disease defined as a baseline serum creatinine &gt; 150 µmol/L. 6. Women who are pregnant, or have a positive urine or blood (βhCG) pregnancy test. 7. Women who are breastfeeding. 8. Any clinically significant psychiatric or psychological disease, which would preclude the patient from completing the protocol. 9. Premorbid (estimated) modified Rankin scale score of &gt;1. 10. Previous major stroke. 11. Patients with known HIV infection. 12. Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational drug within 30 days preceding this study. 13. Previous participation in the ENACT trial (e.g, to treat a prior aneurysm), participation in another trial involving NA1 or prior receipt of NA1. 14. Any other medical condition that the site investigator deems would put the patient at excessive risk of participation in the study or an expected life expectancy less than 1 year or that would result in inability to collect clinical outcomes at 90 days.</criteria>
