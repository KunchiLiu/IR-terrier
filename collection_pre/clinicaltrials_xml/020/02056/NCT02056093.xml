	<brief_summary>In spontaneously breathing mechanically ventilated patients, the adequacy between the patient's demand and the level of respiratory support delivered by the ventilator is a major clinical issue. Neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA) and proportional assist ventilation (PAV) have been developed to adapt the level of assistance to the patient's demand. These two modes have been compared to pressure support ventilation (PSV) but have not been compared to each other.</brief_summary>
