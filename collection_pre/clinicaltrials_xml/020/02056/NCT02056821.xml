	<brief_summary>This study investigates if there are hemodynamic alterations in acute stroke that predispose patients to impaired perfusion and regulation of cerebral blood flow. To test this, we will target recruitment of acute ischemic stroke patients who present to the ED within 12 hours of symptoms onset. Enrolled subjects will receive continuous noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring contemporaneous with measurements of cerebral blood flow velocities and cerebral oximetry.</brief_summary>
