	<brief_title>Comparison Between Budesonide and Dexamethasone Treatments for Respiratory Discomfort After Extubation on Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to perform a prospective, randomized, controlled and double-blind non inferiority study enrolling 70 children with postextubation stridor. The population will be divided in two groups: group 1 will receive inhaled budesonide and IV NS (intravenous normal saline) and group 2 will receive IV (intravenous) dexamethasone and inhaled normal saline. The study aims to analyze and compare (I would just say compare) the clinical effects of using inhaled budesonide or IV dexamethasone in the treatment of postextubation stridor on children admitted to the pediatric intensive care units at Hospital Municipal do M´Boi Mirim and Hospital Albert Einstein.</detailed_description>
