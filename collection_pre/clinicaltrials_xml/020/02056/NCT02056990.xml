	<brief_summary>Athletes have to participate in screenings in order to reduce injuries. Up-to-now most screenings are purely clinically based. Literature, however, indicates the importance of knowledge on deviant movement patterns as possible risk factors for injuries. From this perspective, the current project aims to measure movement patterns, gait and running in young athletes to optimise training and prevent injuries. 2D- and 3d registration methods, force plate data and pressure plate data will be used to document the performance of the athletes.</brief_summary>
