	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test a lung air vibrator device for vibrating air inside the lung. This exploratory diagnostic trial will test a novel and non-invasive means of detecting lower airway infections using exhaled breath sample.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detecting Lung Infections Through Vibration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has two phases. Once the subject has consented phase 1 will start by the subject breathing air out of their lungs into the device. Next, the subject will simply breathe through the mouthpiece with the machine turned on and take samples of exhaled air. In phase 2, the subjects will breathe air out of their lungs into the device for 15 minutes. Next, the subject will simply breathe through the mouthpiece with the machine turned on and take samples of exhaled air for 15 minutes.</detailed_description>
