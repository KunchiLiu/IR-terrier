	<brief_summary>Psychological problems are prevalent among patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The bi-directional interaction between psychological well-being and seizure have been recognized in recent years. Reduction of psychological stress has the potential to improve seizure manifestation. The present study uses an assessor-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based psychotherapy and an attentional-placebo social support on improving psychological well-being, seizure control and cognitive performance among adult patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.</brief_summary>
