	<brief_title>Effect of EGDT on Hepatic Perfusion in Patients With Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective To observe the effect of early goal directed therapy (EGDT) on hepatic perfusion in patients with septic shock. Methods A prospective observational study was carried out. The eligible patients were treated with the standard procedure of EGDT. The hemodynamic data were recorded. Oxygen metabolism and hepatic function were monitored. Indocyanine clearance test was applied to detect the hepatic perfusion. Hemodynamics, hepatic perfusion, oxygen metabolism and hepatic function were compared before treatment, after EGDT and 24 hours after EGDT.</detailed_description>
