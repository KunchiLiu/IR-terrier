	<brief_summary>This is a blinded study in adult patients with PAH evaluating the relative effects of sildenafil on mortality when administered at the three doses (80 mg, 20 mg or 5 mg, all three times per day [TID]). In addition, the relative effects on clinical worsening and 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) will be assessed.</brief_summary>
