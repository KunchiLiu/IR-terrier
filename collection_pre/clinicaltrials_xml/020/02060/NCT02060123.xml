	<brief_title>Qigong Intervention Program for Abused Chinese Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Qigong is a mind-body exercise rooted in the paradigm of traditional Chinese medicine, aiming to achieve a harmonious flow of energy (qi) in the body through gentle movements and is thus considered as a holistic health practice towards promoting physical and mental well-being and improving longevity. It was suggested that qigong exercise, as a stress management strategy, could be effective in improving psychological symptoms, as well as enhancing cellular telomerase activity by reducing oxidative stress level and regulating immune response. The study is to evaluate the effects of a qigong intervention on telomerase activity and pro-inflammation cytokines, perceived stress, perceived coping, and depressive symptoms in Chinese women with a history of intimate partner violence. The study design is a randomized, wait-list controlled design with intervention and wait-list control groups. A total of 240 Chinese abused women will be recruited. The qigong intervention program consists of: (i) a 2-hr group qigong training twice a week for 6 weeks; (ii) weekly group follow-up of a 1-hour group qigong exercise for 4 months; and (iii) self-practice of qigong exercise for 30 minutes each day throughout the intervention period lasting 5.5 months. It is hypothesized that the participants in the intervention group will have higher levels of telomerase activity and perceived coping, and lower levels of pro-inflammation cytokines, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms, on completion of a qigong intervention program, compared to abused Chinese women in the wait-list control group.</detailed_description>
