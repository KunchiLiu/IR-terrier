	<brief_summary>This therapeutical trial will be conducted in patients with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), which is mutations in MCT8. MCT8 is a thyroid hormone (TH) transporter which is crucial for the transport of TH from the blood into different tissues. Dysfunction of MCT8 results in a lack of TH (hypothyroidism) in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake. This local hypothyroidism in the brain of these patients causes severe psychomotor retardation. In addition, TH serum parameters are highly abnormal in AHDS: high T3, low T4 and normal TSH levels. The high serum T3 levels cause local hyperthyroidism in tissues that do not depend on MCT8 for cellular transport of TH, resulting in a low body weight and reduced muscle mass. Currently, no adequate treatment is available for the AHDS. A T3 analog that does not depend on MCT8 for its cellular entry could, at least partially, restore the abnormalities found in AHDS. Several in vivo, in vitro and animal studies have shown that the T3 analog Triac is a very promising candidate: 1. Triac binds to the same TH receptors as T3; 2. Cellular uptake of Triac does not depend on functional MCT8. Hence, in AHDS patients Triac will also be available in tissues that require functional MCT8 for TH uptake, e.g. the brain; 3. In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cells differentiate equally well in the presence of either Triac or T3; 4. In Mct8 deficient mice, Triac is taken up by the brain and suppresses serum TSH levels; consequently, serum T3 and T4 levels were lowered; 5. Triac is the treatment of choice in patient with the resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome. Patient with RTH have high serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels, which shows strong similarities to the profile found in AHDS patients; the longstanding experience with Triac in RTH indicates its safety and tolerability . Thus, Triac treatment could result in normalization of the abnormal serum TH values in AHDS patients. Furthermore, Triac could replace the function of T3 in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake (e.g. brain). The current trial will investigate if Triac treatment in ADHS patients 1. reduces the toxic effects of the high T3 levels 2. restores the local TH deficiency in brain.</brief_summary>
