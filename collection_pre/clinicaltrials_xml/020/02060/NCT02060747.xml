	<brief_summary>Harrington's metaphorical depiction captures the essence of the problem : "Osteoporosis care of fracture patients has been characterized as the Bermuda Triangle made up of orthopaedists, primary care physicians and osteoporosis experts into which the fracture patient disappears". The most effective way to achieve this goal is through implementation of coordinator-based post fracture models of care. Exemplar models have been refered to as "Fracture Liaison Service" (United-Kingdom [1-3], Europe [4,5] and Australia [6-8]) "Osteoporosis Coordinator Program" (Canada [9,10]) or "Care Manager Programs" (USA [11,12]). The objective of this trial is to assess efficacy of a new coordinator-based post-fracture program in the Saint-Joseph Hospital in Paris to improve the management of osteoporosis after fracture thanks to an optimal recommendations practice to reduce the incidence of secondary fractures. Men and women are included aged over 45 years with fragility wrist and hip fractures. Evaluation criteria are based on the evidence-based assessment (stratify risk, identify secondary causes of osteoporosis, fracture evaluation), the medication adherence, others prescriptions adherence (osteodensitometry), the incidence of secondary fractures and number of falls. Number of patients : 200 Duration of the study: 3 years Patients' participation duration: 6 months</brief_summary>
