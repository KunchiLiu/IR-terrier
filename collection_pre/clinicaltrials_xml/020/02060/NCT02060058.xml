	<brief_title>Boceprevir-based Therapy to Rescue HCV Genotype 1/HBV Infected Patients Refractory to Combination Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver disease, especially viral hepatitis, is an important public health issue, which frequent leads to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related death. Around 340 to 400 million persons are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 130 to 210 million persons are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, In Taiwan, the prevalence of HBV infection is 15-20%, and the prevalence of HCV infection is 2-5% in general population. Moreover, there are some HCV-hyperendemic areas in southern Taiwan with anti-HCV prevalence rate of as high as 30-40%. HBV/HCV dual infections is not uncommon in HBV epidemic areas, such as Southeastern Asia, with a prevalence rate of 1.1% in southern Taiwan. Recent study showed that the risk of HCC incidence is even higher among HBV/HCV co-infected persons than those with HBV or HCV mono-infection, indicating the importance of disease control in this clinical setting. The PEG-IFN/RBV has been effective in the treatment of HCV-dominant, treatment-naïve patients with HCV/HBV dual infections. For treatment-naive HCV genotype 1 (HCV GT1)/HBV co-infected patients, 48 weeks of peginterferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) could achieve an HCV sustained virological response (SVR) rate of 72%, which was comparable to 77% for patients with HCV GT1 monoinfection. For treatment-naive HCV GT2 or GT3 /HBV co-infected patients, 24 weeks of PEG-IFN plus RBV could achieve an HCV SVR rate of 83%, which was comparable to 84% for patients with HCV GT2/3 monoinfection . Furthermore, PEG-IFN plus RBV combination therapy could enhance seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with an HBsAg loss rate of upto 11%. Nevertheless, there is about 30% of HCV GT1/HBV and 20% of HCV GT2 or 3/HBV co-infected patients refractory to current PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy, which remains at high risk of HCC and liver-related death. Boceprevir is an oral antiviral drug, which is NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Boceprevir has been approved for treating HCV GT1 infection by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 11 May 2011. For HCV GT1 mono-infected patients who refractory to previous PEG-IFN plus RBV combination therapy, becoprevir combined with PEG-IFN/RBV triple therapy can improve the treatment efficacy. The SVR rate of becoprevir-based triple therapy is about 3 times when compared to patients who received PEG-IFN with RBV dual therapy [14].The investigators , therefore, hypothesize that boceprevir plus PEG-IFN/RBV is effective in treating HCV GT1/HBV dually infected patients who are refractory to previous PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient must be 20 years or older 2. Patient must have HCV GT1 infection combined with HBV infection. 3. Patients must be serum HCV RNA detectable, antiHCV positive, HBsAg positive and HBeAg negative. 4. Patient has previously failed treatment with PEGIFNα 2a or 2b/RBV for minimum of 12 weeks of treatment. 5. Patient must have compensated liver disease consistent with CHC and/or CHB, and no other etiology. Note: patients with cirrhosis should have a liver imaging study (e.g. ultrasound, CT scan or MRI) within the preceding 6 months showing no evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. 6. Patient meets all of the requirements and none of the contraindications for treatment with PEGIFN alpha2b/RBV or boceprevir defined in the labels for the PEGIFN/RBV to be used in combination with boceprevir. 7. Patient is able and willing to provide signed informed consent (prepared by and administered by the physician) as required by local country requirements. 1. Mixed genotypes including HCV genotype other than genotype 1. 2. Patient has received boceprevir, narlaprevir, telaprevir, or any other HCV protease inhibitor treatment. 3. Patient has evidence of decompensated liver disease including but not limited to, a history or presence of clinical ascites, bleeding varices, or hepatic encephalopathy. 4. Patient meets any of the following exclusionary hematologic and biochemical criteria (documentation required) Hemoglobin &lt;12 gm/dL for females and &lt;13 gm/dL for males Neutrophils &lt;1500/mm3 Platelets &lt;100,000/mm3 5. Patient has an organ transplant other than cornea or hair. 6. Patient is coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 7. Patient requires or is anticipated to require any of the following prohibited medications: midazolam, pimozide, amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, and ergot derivatives 8. Patient with clinical diagnosis or evidence of substance abuse involving alcohol, intravenous drugs, inhalational psychotropics, narcotics, cocaine prescription or overthecounter drugs. 9. Patient previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity or other contraindication to any component of the boceprevir formulation. This drug contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucosegalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 10. Serious illness, including malignancy, active coronary artery disease or cardiac dysfunction within 24 weeks prior to study entry, that in the opinion of the site investigator may preclude completion of the treatment regimen. 11. Major hemoglobinopathy (e.g., thalassemia major), coagulopathy or any other cause of or tendency to hemolysis or bleeding</criteria>
