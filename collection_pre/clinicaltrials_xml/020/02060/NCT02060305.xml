	<brief_summary>Primary Objective The efficacy of intra-articular bevacizumab injection for secondary prevention of recurrent hemarthroses for hemophilia patients who has had target joints with chronic synovitis. The safety profiles of intra-articular bevacizumab injection for hemophilia patients. Study Population Adult hemophilia patients who have had one or more target joints with chronic synovitis and recurrent hemarthroses. Investigational therapy: Intra-articular injection of Bevacizumab (20 or 40 mg/ 0.8 or 1.6 ml/ dose) every month (28 days) for up to 4 months, depending on the improvement of target joint bleeding. Study Design The estimated study period is between Jan 2014 and Dec 2015. Totally 10 joints will be enrolled for this pilot study. Before enrollment, the joint(s) will be evaluated for their severity both clinically (by 10-point Pain Score, range of motion for the target joint, and World Federation of Hemophilia Score) and by MRI (using the compatible MRI scales developed by International Prophylaxis Study Group [IPSG]). Intra-articular injection of bevacizumab will be administered, after prophylactic factor supplementation, every month for up to four injections. In the first four patients, 20mg of bevacizumab will be administered. If there are no Gr 3 or Gr4 dose-limiting toxicities, bevacizumab dose will be escalated to 40mg in the other 6 patients. Before every procedure, the plasma and the synovial fluid samples will be collected for VEGF quantification for the correlative biomarker study. After completing the protocol treatment, the efficacy parameters as well as the safety profiles will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-articular Bevacizumab for Recurrent Hemarthroses at Target Joints With Chronic Hemophilic Synovitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: The mechanism of recurrent hemarthroses (joint bleeds) resulted from chronic synovitis of target joints in hemophilic patients is thought to be a VEGF-based neo-angiogenic process. Local anti-VEGF therapy with intra-articular bevacizumab (Avastin), a VEGF-neutralizing monoclonal antibody that can efficiently antagonize VEGF activity, may block the process and decrease the frequency of recurrent bleeding episodes. In addition, we proved that intra-articular injection of bevacizumab in rat model is safe without significant local or systemic adverse events. Primary Objective The efficacy of intra-articular bevacizumab injection for secondary prevention of recurrent hemarthroses for hemophilia patients who has had target joints with chronic synovitis. The safety profiles of intra-articular bevacizumab injection for hemophilia patients. Study Population Adult hemophilia patients who have had one or more target joints with chronic synovitis and recurrent hemarthroses. Investigational therapy: Intra-articular injection of Bevacizumab (20 or 40 mg/ 0.8 or 1.6 ml/ dose) every month (28 days) for up to 4 months, depending on the improvement of target joint bleeding. Study Design The estimated study period is between Jan 2014 and Dec 2015. Totally 10 joints will be enrolled for this pilot study. Before enrollment, the joint(s) will be evaluated for their severity both clinically (by 10-point Pain Score, range of motion for the target joint, and World Federation of Hemophilia Score) and by MRI (using the compatible MRI scales developed by International Prophylaxis Study Group [IPSG]). Intra-articular injection of bevacizumab will be administered, after prophylactic factor supplementation, every month for up to four injections. In the first four patients, 20mg of bevacizumab will be administered. If there are no Gr 3 or Gr4 dose-limiting toxicities, bevacizumab dose will be escalated to 40mg in the other 6 patients. Before every procedure, the plasma and the synovial fluid samples will be collected for VEGF quantification for the correlative biomarker study. After completing the protocol treatment, the efficacy parameters as well as the safety profiles will be evaluated. Assessments The efficacy: the differences of total episodes of recurrent hemarthroses within 3 months before and after completing bevacizumab intra-articular injection. Post-procedure target joints bleedings will be recorded at intervals of 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th months. The total absence of haemarthrosis (zero bleeding) is rated as "excellent" response; bleeding reduction between 75% and 99% is rated "good", between 50% and 74% as "fair", and below 50% as "poor".</detailed_description>

The target joint(s) are limited to knee, elbow, or ankle, with substantial severity (World Federation of Hemophilia Score =2~3) 3. White cell count ≧ 3000/μL, Hemoglobin level ≧ 10 g/dL, and platelets ≧ 100,000/μL 4. Serum creatinine ≦1.5 X the upper limit of normal (ULN) 5. Total bilirubin ≦1.5 X ULN; aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST, ALT) ≦2.0 x ULN. 6. Willingness and ability to comply with the study scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other procedures, including the completion of patient questionnaires. 7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test done 1 week prior to the administration of the study drug. She and her partner should prevent pregnancy (oral contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptive device, barrier method of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly or surgically sterile) up to at least 6 months after last treatment completion or the last drug dose, whatever happens first. 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0~2 9. Signed written informed consent according to ICH/GCP and the local regulations (approved by the Institutional Review Board [IRB]/Independent Ethics Committee [IEC]) will be obtained prior to any study specific screening procedures. 1. Subjects with known HIV infection. 2. Subjects whose target joints have been heavily damaged into deformity or arthropathy, or whose target joints cannot receive intraarticular injection. 3. Subjects who cannot receive MRI study. 4. Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg). 5. Subjects who experienced major surgical procedures, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to the first dose of Bevacizumab administration (Patients must have recovered from any major surgery), or who have anticipation of need for major surgical procedures during the course of the study. 6.
