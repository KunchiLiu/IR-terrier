	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of re-endothelailisation of the Integrity Resolute zotarolimus eluting stent (Medtronic) and of the Promus Element erolimus eluting stent (Boston Scientific), in patients with diabetes. We plan to compare endothelial coverage and neointimal proliferation using OCT and compare this data to published results from conventional stents.</brief_summary>
