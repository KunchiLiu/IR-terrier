	<brief_summary>Photoaging is caused by the superposition of chronic ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage on the intrinsic aging process, and accounts for the majority of age-associated changes in skin appearance. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely contribute to this process. Strategies utilizing endogenous skin antioxidants as well as plant-derived or synthetic compounds have been examined. Cocoa beans fresh from the tree are exceptionally rich in polyphenols, such as flavanol, and have a higher antioxidant capacity. The present study is designed to investigate the effects of long-term intake of a product rich in cocoa flavanols on facial wrinkles, hydration, elasticity and photosensitivity.</brief_summary>
