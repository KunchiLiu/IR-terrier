	<brief_summary>The primary research question is to determine whether patients who undergo a stabilization of the shoulder using a novel decision-making algorithm (ISIS Score) have improved disease-specific quality of life at 1 year post-operatively, as measured by the Western Ontario Instability Index (WOSI) compared with patients who undergo stabilization using a conventional decision-making algorithm. Secondary outcomes include the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon's (ASES) score, and difference in recurrence rates of dislocation between the two decision-making algorithms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Recurrent anterior instability (dislocation or subluxation) with or without hyperlaxity, including a clinical history of traumatic anterior instability of the shoulder, with positive apprehension or relocation tests. 2. Provide consent 1. Patients with a concomitant rotator cuff lesion or humeral avulsion of the anteroinferior glenohumeral ligament (HAGL) 2. An acute firsttime dislocation 3. Previous shoulder surgery 4. Surgery for a painful, unstable shoulder without true dislocation or subluxation 5. Patients with active worker's compensation claims (due to the expectation of lower rates of success in this patient population) 6. Active joint or systemic infection 7. Patients with convulsive disorders, collagen diseases, previous shoulder surgeries, and any other conditions that might affect the mobility of the joint 8. Major medical illness (life expectancy less than 2 years or unacceptably high operative risk) 9. Unable to speak or read English/French 10. Inability to provide informed consent and comply with requirements of participation 11. Unwilling to be followed for 2 years</criteria>
