	<brief_summary>The Investigators aim to study the efficacy of Exparel as compared to Marcaine, taking into account pain control, narcotic consumption, narcotic-related side effects, outcomes measures, and patient satisfaction. Moreover, the Investigators plan to perform cost-benefit analysis to evaluate whether use of Exparel decreases analgesic consumption, duration of hospital stay and the need for physical therapy postoperatively, therefore, offsetting its higher price in comparison with Marcaine.</brief_summary>
