	<brief_title>Epstein-Barr Virus Status in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been recognized as a new provisional entity in the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue. This lymphoma is defined as EBV+ clonal B-cell proliferation in immunocompetent adults older than 50 years. To denote patient age in definition of this disease, age cutoff was defined as older than 50 years. However, this cutoff is clearly arbitrary without any scientific background. the knowledge on EBV+DLBCL in young adult is very scanty. This EBV+DLBCL in young adult can be the same disease entity or it can be a distinct disease form EBV+DLBCL of elderly.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed de novo DLBCL, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification: registered in Samsung Medical Center (SMC) Lymphoma Cohort Study I/II (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00822731, NCT01877109) or identified from Asan Medical Center (AMC) medical database: adequate amount and quality of paraffinembedded biopsy specimen or unstained slides for EBVencoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization. Patients with unknown EBV status, primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs), and HIVpositive DLBCL were excluded in the study.</criteria>
