	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence (BE) of Saxagliptin and Dapagliflozin from a 2.5-mg Saxagliptin/5-mg Dapagliflozin FDC tablet after oral administration relative to 2.5-mg Saxagliptin and 5-mg Dapagliflozin tablets administered orally together in the fasted state and to demonstrate the BE of Saxagliptin and Dapagliflozin from a 5-mg Saxagliptin/10-mg Dapagliflozin FDC tablet after oral administration relative to 5-mg Saxagliptin and 10-mg Dapagliflozin tablets administered orally together in the fasted state. Demonstrating bioequivalence refers to showing that the FDC tablet and co-administration of the individual components yield similar blood levels/concentrations of the drug and are handled by the body similarly.</brief_summary>
