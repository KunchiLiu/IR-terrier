	<brief_summary>We will compare the stent coverage at 3 months by optical coherence tomography (OCT) between the Cilotax and DESyne drug-eluting stents (DES). The extent of the strut uncoverage has not been evaluated yet for both the Cilotax and DESyne and we first sought to decide the reference intervals using 40 samples (total 44 patients for each group considering 10% drop-out rate) as the pilot study.</brief_summary>
