	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Intranasal Esketamine Administered With and Without a Nasal Guide on the Intranasal Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), single-center, single-dose, 2-way crossover (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the study in 2 sequence groups), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study. Approximately, 14 participants will be enrolled in this study. This study will consist of a screening phase of up to 21 days, a treatment phase of 3 days, and a follow-up phase of 9-13 days. Participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of the 2 treatment groups (Sequence 1 and 2). In sequence 1, participants will self-administer esketamine intranasally using a device with nasal guide as treatment A on Day 1 of period 1 and intranasally esketamine using a device without nasal guide as treatment B on Day 1 of period 2. In sequence 2, participants will self-administer intranasally esketamine as treatment B on Day 1 of period 1 and intranasally esketamine as treatment A on Day 1 of period 2. There will be a washout period of 5 to 10 days between each treatment regimen. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical examination, pulse oximetry, targeted nasal examination, nasal device questionnaire, and in addition to these evaluations, specific scales will be used to assess the safety. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 45 days.</detailed_description>
