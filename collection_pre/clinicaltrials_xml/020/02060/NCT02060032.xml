	<brief_summary>Background: Statins are the recently evolved agents that aid in periodontal regeneration and ultimately attaining periodontal health. Atorvastatin (ATV) and Simvastatin (SMV) are specific competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The present study was designed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of 1.2% ATV, and 1.2% SMV as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment subjects with chronic periodontitis. Methods: Ninety six subjects were categorized into three treatment groups: SRP plus 1.2% ATV, SRP plus 1.2% SMV and SRP plus placebo. Clinical parameters; full mouth plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), and relative attachment level (RAL) were recorded at baseline before SRP and at 3, 6 and 9 months. Percentage radiographic defect depth reduction was evaluated using computer-aided software at baseline, 6 months and 9 months.</brief_summary>
