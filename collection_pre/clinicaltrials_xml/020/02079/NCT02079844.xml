	<brief_title>Roflumilast Plus Antipsychotics Proof of Mechanism Study in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called roflumilast. Roflumilast is being tested as an add-on treatment to second generation antipsychotics (SGA) to treat cognitive impairment in people with stable schizophrenia. This study will look at improvement in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia in people who take roflumilast as an add-on to SGA. The study will enroll approximately 22 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of three treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need) All participants will receive the following treatments at different periods throughout the study: - Roflumilast Dose A + SGA - Roflumilast Dose B +SGA - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient + SGA. All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the study. This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 64 days. Participants will make 2 screening visits to the clinic and then must be brought to the clinic every day for dosing during each of 3 Treatment Periods. Each Treatment Period will be 8 days in duration. All participants will also make 1 final visit 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Has cognitive impairment as per investigator judgment. 7. Is aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent. 8. Weighs at least 60 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m^2 inclusive at Screening. 9. A male participant who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after last dose. 10. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use acceptable methods of contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after last dose. 11. Has clinical laboratory evaluations (including clinical chemistry, hematology and complete urinalysis) within the reference range for the testing laboratory, unless the results are deemed not to be clinically significant (NCS) by the investigator at screening and Day 1 of Period 1. 1. Has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication. 2. Has received roflumilast in a previous clinical study or as a therapeutic agent. 3. Is an immediate family member, study site employee, or in a dependant relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. Has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, or endocrine disease or other abnormality which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results. 5. History of claustrophobia or inability to tolerate mock scanner environment during habituation/screening session. 6.

There is any finding in the participant's medical history, physical examination, or safety laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that would contraindicate taking roflumilast or a similar drug in the same class, or that might interfere with the conduct of the study. This includes, but is not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, seizure disorders, and cardiac arrhythmias. 14.
