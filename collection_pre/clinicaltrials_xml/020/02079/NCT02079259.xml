	<brief_summary>The number of patients with acute congestion on chronic heart failure is increasing. Ultrafiltration has recently been proposed as an alternative approach for the stabilization of volume balance, especially in patients with imminent diuretic resistance. There is increasing evidence that ultrafiltration may relief cardiac congestion with lesser effects on blood pressure and activation of renin angiotensin system, respectively . However, recent studies revealed conflicting results: demonstration the superiority of ultrafiltration in comparison to diuretic treatment, and a lack of evidence of benefit, as well as an excess of adverse events with ultrafiltration. Aquapheresis with adapted ultrafiltration rate guided by central venous pressure is safer than aquaphesis with a constant ultrafiltration with comparable effectiveness</brief_summary>
