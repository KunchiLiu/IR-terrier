	<brief_summary>The objectives of this registry are to measure the outcomes, cost, adherence pattern and experience of patients treated as outpatients with rivaroxaban after being diagnosed with blood clots in the emergency department. The investigators hypothesize that patients will have a relatively low rate of adverse events and higher adherence than has been reported historically for warfarin treatment. Patients will be scheduled for follow up care with one of Dr. Kline's Outpatient Thrombosis clinics at Methodist Hospital or Eskenazi Health Services after diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The investigators will collect information for a registry and a database will be developed and blood specimens will be obtained at each follow up visit for analysis and storage for possible use related to this treatment and research or study at a later date. Questionnaires will be administered to collect variables that the investigators hypothesize to be important to understand the causes of non-adherence. To better quantify the economic impact, the investigators will also perform a cost effectiveness analysis with no comparator, meaning the investigators will tabulate the cost of care for each patient enrolled using variable costs from a UB92 report for each patient.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Information will be obtained from the patient medical records, past medical history, physical examination at initial outpatient clinic visit 30 days (+/- 14 days) and 6 months or 180 days (+/- 14 days) post diagnosis or start of treatment, then annual follow ups for up to 5 years. The data will be collected and stored in a database, the IU RedCap database system will be used to develop a database and store information . A blood sample will be obtained at the initial outpatient visit within 30 days (+/- 14 days) post diagnosis and/or start of treatment and at the 180 day (+/- 14 days) follow up post treatment visit and at each annual visit for up to 5 years. A SF 36 questionnaire will be administered at 30 days (+/- 14 days) post diagnosis and/or start of treatment and at the 180 day (+/- 14 days) follow up post treatment visit.</detailed_description>
