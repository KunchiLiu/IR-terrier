	<brief_summary>Research aimed to find a correlation with an invos drop and cardiac events in the peri-operative period of non cardiac surgery. The investigators postulate that a drop in the Invos numbers (with or without significant drop in BP) is associated with a variable degree of cardiac suffering. The idea is to prevent per and foremostpost-operative myocardial necrosis complications by acting as soon as we have an INVOS drop during anesthesia. The "cardiac events" will be monitored and defined according to the EHA (european heart association) guidelines. (Changes of the EKG and/or troponin I values above the threshold). Patient will be monitored per and post operatively.</brief_summary>
