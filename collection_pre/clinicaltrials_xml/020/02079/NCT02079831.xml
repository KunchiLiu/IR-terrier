	<brief_summary>The aim of the proposed study is to provide important data on weight loss efficacy in overweight and obese adolescents on an isocaloric higher protein diet vs a lower protein diet utilizing the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) MyPlate nutrition guide. The investigators hypothesize that the higher protein diet will result in greater weight loss due to increased satiety and better dietary adherence.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 is to test the efficacy of a personalized higher protein weight loss intervention compared to a lower protein intervention which use the USDA MyPlate nutrition guide. It is hypothesized that participants randomly assigned to the higher protein dietary treatment will lose more weight based on BMI-Z score over 12 weeks compared to participants in the lower dietary protein treatment. Aim 2 is to test if changes in subjective ratings of appetite differ by dietary treatment (i.e. protein intake). It is hypothesized that participants in the higher protein intervention will report a decrease in hunger and an increase in fullness compared to participants in the lower protein intervention. Aim 3 is to test if change in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) measured at the rate limiting step of glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) and glycosylation measured as O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) differ by dietary treatment. It is hypothesized that participants randomly assigned to the higher protein dietary treatment will have decreased change from baseline levels of GFAT and glycosylation (OGT) due to decreased carbohydrate intake compared to the lower protein treatment. Exploratory Aims: As exploratory aims, the investigators will test if the higher protein or lower protein dietary treatments differentially alter glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and triglycerides (markers of the metabolic syndrome).</detailed_description>
