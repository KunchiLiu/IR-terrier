	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine safety and effectiveness, as measured by changes in pain, disability, patient satisfaction, and claudicatory symptoms, at 6 months following treatment with the Totalis™ Direct Decompression System or Sham Surgery in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The STEPS - Totalis™ Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects suffering from symptoms of neurogenic intermittent claudication secondary to a radiographically-confirmed diagnosis of central canal stenosis, with or without mild or moderate lateral recess stenosis, at one or two levels from L1 to L5 who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, including ≥6 months of non-operative management. Patients included in the clinical investigation will return for follow-up visits at 1 week for safety evaluation, and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months post-treatment to collect data for evaluation of safety and effectiveness.</detailed_description>
