	<brief_title>Infants of Diabetic Mothers: A Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetics are followed regularly in diabetic outpatient clinics where dietary and medical management are offered. Diabetic pregnancies are managed by a team consisting of diabetologist, obstetrician, feto-maternal obstetrician and dietician. Management of these pregnancies depends on whether these women have pre-gestational or gestational diabetes. Very few diabetic women have exposure to preconceptual advice. For this reason we opted to find out the outcome of infants of diabetic mothers compared to those mothers who are essentially normal with no associated medical or obstetric disorders. Equally we wanted to see if there are differences in the outcome of infants born to pre-gestational and gestational diabetic mothers.</detailed_description>
