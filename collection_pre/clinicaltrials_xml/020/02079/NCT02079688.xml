	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic or chronic recurring inflammatory skin disorder. Patients suffer from eczema and often severe pruritus on the affected skin, as well as from frequent complications and secondary infections. Next to a genetically predetermined defect in epidermal barrier function and vegetative dysfunction, AD arises from an upregulation of Th2-modified immune responses inducing increased IgE-antibody production, cytokine secretion and subsequently, local inflammation. Although standard therapies of AD, modern topical corticosteroids, show a better ratio of therapeutic effects to side effects, they retain a moderate acceptance due to their non-specific action, strict compliance requirements and possible adverse effects. As a newer alternative, calcineurin inhibitors show fewer side effects but raise concerns regarding long term risks including the possibility of skin carcinogenicity. Therefore, medical need remains for novel therapies for this major public health problem, directed in particular at specific early disease-causing mechanisms and/or molecular targets, with an improved efficacy, safety and compliance. Novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by targeting early disease-causing mechanisms are a promising approach for the treatment of AD. The transcription factor GATA-3 represents the key regulatory factor of Th2-driven immune responses. It is indispensable for the differentiation and activation of Th2 cells; it integrates Th2 signals and induces Th2 cytokine expression. The investigational product SB011 contains the DNAzyme hgd40 that targets GATA-3. By cleaving GATA-3 mRNA hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production and thereby reduces key features of allergic airway inflammation. DNAzymes are completely generated by chemical synthesis and can be produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) controlled conditions. The DNAzymes are not biological drugs, i.e. they are not generated by use of any living organism including cell culture or bacteria. The molecules are highly water-soluble and will be applied as a water/oil/water (W/O/W) formulation since multiple emulsions have been shown to protect the active ingredient from degradation on the skin and have penetration enhancing properties in comparison to other carrier systems. This proof-of-concept study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the topical formulation SB011 containing 2 % hgd40 twice daily (BID) in patients with mild to moderate atopic eczema.</brief_summary>

SCORAD (12) between 20 and 50 (mild to moderate atopic dermatitis); Two comparable lesional areas of approximately 50 cm2 each (difference in modified local SCORAD not greater than 2) on the arms, legs, chest, stomach or neck (distance between the lesions at least 5 cm), clinical condition of atopic eczema mild to moderate defined by a modified local SCORAD between 7 and 10 with 2 parameters scored at least 2 one being the erythema score; Patient has to have an increased total IgE; Patient has to have an increased specific IgE of at least 1 of the sx1 allergens with CAP classification II [&gt;0.7 KU/l]; Erythema score from modified local SCORAD for both lesional areas of at least 2; TEWL in the lesional areas at least 12 g/m²h, TEWL value differences ≤ 30 % are allowed between both lesional areas (related to the higher TEWL value); Except for atopic diseases or asthma like atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis assessed as healthy based on a screening examination including medical history, physical examination of the skin, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results; The male patient must agree: to use two methods of contraception in combination with his female partner, if she is of childbearing potential (At least one of the contraception methods must be a barrier contraception method) The female patient must agree: to use two methods of contraception in combination with her male partner, if she is of childbearing potential; History of allergic reactions to any active or inactive component of the IMP; Presence of clinically significant diseases other than asthma or atopic diseases (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, haematological, neurological, genitourinary, autoimmune, endocrine, metabolic, etc.) which in the opinion of the investigator, influence the results of the trial or the patient's ability to take part in it; Inherent or acquired immune deficiency, immune deficiency in consequence of drug use; Immune mediated diseases; Suntan, hyperpigmentation or tattoos in the test fields; Darkskinned persons whose skin colour prevents ready assessment of skin reactions; Systemic bacterial or mycotic as well as severe viral systemic infections; Severe systemic other disease; Patients with a resting heart rate &lt;50 and &gt;100 bpm, systolic blood pressure &lt;100 and &gt;150 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;60 and &gt;95 mmHg; UVtherapy within 6 weeks before first treatment and during the trial; History or current evidence of a malignant tumour (an excised basal cell carcinoma distant from target lesion with at least 14 days after surgery will be allowed); Clinically relevant abnormalities in serology, clinical chemical, haematological or in any other laboratory variables; Chronic or acute infections (a small lesion of nontreated onychomycosis will be allowed in the opinion of the investigator); Pregnancy or nursing Signs of secondary infections on the lesions to be treated; History of previous administration of SB011 or any other registered or investigational oligonucleotidebased drug; History or presence of alcohol or drug abuse; Consumption of alcohol within 48 h before administration of IMPs and during the trial; Use of any medication (including overthecounter medication such as herbal products) except allowed concomitant medication within 2 weeks (for biologics: 6 months, for systemic treatment of atopic dermatitis 4 weeks) before administration of the IMPs or within &lt;10 times the elimination halflife of the respective drug, or the duration of the pharmacodynamics effect, whatever is longer, or anticipated concomitant medication during the treatment period (exception: asthma may be found in patients with AD, therefore the continuation of inhalative treatment with corticosteroids in patients with asthma accompanying AD that began at least four weeks prior to randomisation will be allowed; dose limited: ≤ 300 μg/d fluticasone propionate or equivalent); Treatment with known cytochrome P450 enzyme inducing or inhibiting agents (St. John's Wort ("Johanniskraut"), barbiturates, phenothiazines, cimetidine, ketoconazole) within 30 days before administration of the IMPs or during the trial;
