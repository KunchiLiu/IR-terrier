	<brief_summary>- With the underlying study the investigators address the question if Ninjurin-1 (Ninj1) expression is altered in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in comparison to healthy volunteers. - The adhesion molecule Ninj1 is induced following nerve injury where it contributes to nerve generation. Besides it is described to facilitate leukocyte migration especially in the nervous system. - The investigators hypothesize that Ninj1 expression is increased in SIRS patients, which will fortify its impact during inflammation and the transferability from bench to bedside.</brief_summary>
