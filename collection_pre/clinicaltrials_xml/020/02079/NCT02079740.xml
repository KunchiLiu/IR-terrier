	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib and navitoclax in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body or cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Trametinib and navitoclax may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib and Navitoclax in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of trametinib in combination with navitoclax, and the maximal doses at which both drugs can be safely administered together. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the response rate of the combination of trametinib and navitoclax in subjects with KRAS or NRAS mutation-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors in disease-specific expansion cohorts. (Phase II) III. To confirm the safety and tolerability of trametinib and navitoclax in combination at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in the Phase 1b portion. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of both drugs administered together. (Phase Ib) II. To assess for evidence of response to therapy. (Phase Ib) III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic response to therapy in tumor biopsies. (Phase Ib) IV. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic response to therapy in tumor biopsies (first 15 patients enrolled overall). (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and navitoclax PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If unacceptable toxicity is observed, patients may receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-14. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>
