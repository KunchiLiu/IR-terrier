	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new technique of radiotherapy for breast cancer (helical tomotherapy) can induce cardiac toxicity that would be detected in the first two years after treatment. Screening of subclinical cardiac lesions with non-invasive cardiac imaging techniques combined with measures of circulating biomarkers of cardiac tissue lesions and coronary lesions would allow assessing radiation-induced cardiac toxicity at an early stage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REBECCA Study (RadiothErapy for BrEast Cancer and CArdiotoxicity)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>REBECCA study will consist in a monocentric prospective cohort that will include 120 women volunteers treated with adjuvant tomotherapy for breast cancer in the Institut Regaud Claudius-Toulouse (ICR) and followed for 2 years after radiotherapy. In summary, women aged between 40 and 70 years, surgically treated at ICR for breast cancer and for whom adjuvant radiotherapy with tomotherapy is indicated, with no indication of chemotherapy will be eligible for the study.</detailed_description>
