	<brief_summary>Use of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) may improve the surgical work space in patients scheduled for laparoscopic surgical cases (e.g. hysterectomy, ovarian cystectomy, myomectomy). Clinical studies investigating this question often use a numerical or verbal rating scale for subjective evaluation of the surgical workspace. However, no good subjective rating scale have been developed or validated. Neither have possible inter-individual differences in use of such subjective scales been described. Purpose: The aim of this study is to validate different subjective rating scales to determine which scale is most useful among surgeons.</brief_summary>
