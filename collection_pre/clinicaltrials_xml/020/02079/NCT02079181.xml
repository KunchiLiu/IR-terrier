	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies the safety and drug distribution of the radioactive drug, 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-5-methyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (fluorine F 18 d-FMAU [18F-FMAU]), for imaging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with advanced cancers. A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. Because cancer cells often take up more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer cells in the body. PET/CT using the drug fluorine F 18 d-FMAU, may help find cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FMAU PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the radiation dosimetry of 18F-FMAU in humans, confirm absence of adverse events in humans from intravenous (i.v.) injection of 18F-FMAU for PET imaging, and characterize the incidence of circulating metabolites of 18F-FMAU in humans. II. To simply find out whether there is any visual uptake change of 18F-FMAU in tumors post-therapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorine F 18 d-FMAU IV followed by PET/CT prior to start of cancer treatment. Patients may undergo 2 additional scans at one week prior to second course of chemotherapy and after completion of cancer treatment depending on cancer type.</detailed_description>
