	<brief_summary>This study is to determine whether physiologic measures (peak cough flow, measures of respiratory muscle strength including MIP, MEP ,SNIP, and spirometry) can predict spontaneous cough clearance (as measured by a nuclear medicine study) in children with neuromuscular disease. It will also determine whether airway clearance is augmented by high frequency chest wall oscillation.</brief_summary>
