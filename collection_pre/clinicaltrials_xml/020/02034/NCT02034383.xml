	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to measure the effect of processing (roasting, slicing, or grinding) on the energy value of almonds in the human diet and study molecular mechanisms that may help explain the beneficial health effects of almonds.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Processing on the Measured Energy Value of Almonds in the Human Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolizable energy values, or Atwater general factors, for protein, fat, and carbohydrate are commonly used to calculate the metabolizable energy of a diet. Atwater factors are based on average values of mixed diets and are not exact; thus, using these values could introduce an error in the calculated metabolizable energy of a particular food due to differences in chemical structure and availability. Studies have demonstrated that Atwater general factors overestimate the energy derived from protein and fat, as well as the measured metabolizable energy of mixed diets, particularly those that are high in dietary fiber. Studies are lacking, however, that examine how different processing methods affect the metabolizable energy of a food due to differences in chemical structure and availability.</detailed_description>
