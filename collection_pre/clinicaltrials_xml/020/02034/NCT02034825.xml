	<brief_summary>This prospectively designed retrospective clinical utility study will evaluate urologists' treatment recommendations before and after reviewing Decipher results for selected patient cases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-site Decision Impact Study for Decipher</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical utility of Decipher will be evaluated at two time-points: 1. Post RP - within 6 months after surgery 2. PSA rise - defined as PSA detectable and rising on 2 or more subsequent determinations Patient cases will be retrospectively selected from at least 5 sites. Participating urologists at each site will be asked to each identify a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 50 suitable cases retrospectively. The resulting cases will then be de-identified, aggregated and evenly randomly distributed among the participating urologists via a secure on-line survey platform . All study participants (ie: urologists) will be masked to the original actual treatment decision and patient outcome. The design of this study is such that any participating urologist may or may not review a patient originating from their own clinical practice, but will not review a case they themselves identified. Patient cases will be de-identified and randomized amongst participating urologists . By the retrospective nature of this study, cases may be several years post-RP. It is not expected that that participation in this study will have any impact on actual clinical management of patients. Participants will be asked to complete two web-based electronic Case Report Questionnaires (eCRQ): 1. Pre-Decipher: will collect information on their recommended treatment decision and their decision confidence based on the de-identified clinical and pathological information provided for each patient case. 2. Post-Decipher: will collect their treatment recommendation and decision confidence for each de-identified patient case in the presence of the Decipher test results.</detailed_description>
