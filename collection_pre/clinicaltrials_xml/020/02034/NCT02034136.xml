	<brief_title>Ginsenoside Improve Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study in 60 subjects who are not taking drugs that could affect metabolic and vascular function. Subjects will be randomized into a Korean red ginseng (3.0g/d) group or placebo group for a 4-week study. We will collect anthropometric measurements, blood for laboratory testing, inflammatory marker, hormones and mitochondrial DNA copy number. Subject : Older than 40 years of age, presented with metabolic syndrome. Subjects were excluded if they were taking drugs that could affect metabolic and vascular function, including BP control drug, anti-diabetic drugs and lipid-lowering drugs. Measurement : We will collect anthropometric measurements and blood for laboratory testing at the initial(week 0) and final (week 4)visits. Serum levels of blood glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,triglyceride, and DNA copy number of mitochondria.</detailed_description>
