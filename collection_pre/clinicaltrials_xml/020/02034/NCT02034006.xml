	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Written informed consent given before any study related procedure is performed Diagnosis of active CNV secondary to PM confirmed by complete ocular examination in the affected eye(s) using the following criteria: Presence of high myopia greater than 6D of spherical equivalence Presence of posterior changes compatible with pathologic myopia (any signs of attenuation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroids, mottling of the RPE, tilted disc, geographic atrophy of RPE, Fuchs spots, posterior staphyloma, submacular hemorrhage, lacquer cracks) detected by fundus ophthalmoscopy and fundus photography Presence of active leakage from CNV observed through fluorescein angiography (FAG) Presence of intra or subretinal fluid demonstrated by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) BCVA &gt; 24 letters and &lt; 78 letters tested at 4 meters staring distance using ETDRSlike visual acuity chart Visual loss must be only due to the presence of any eligible types of CNV related to PM based on clinical ocular findings, FAG and OCT. (Also patients that have for example 20/60 as their best visual acuity due to PM in their history and have additional vision loss due to CNV lesion can be included) EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with inability to comply with study related procedures Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women and women of childbearing potential UNLESS using effective contraception during treatment Presence of confirmed systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 90 mmHg at the time of enrollment History of stroke Any type of advanced, severe or unstable medical condition or its treatment that could significantly bias the assessment of clinical status and interfere with primary and/or secondary outcome evaluations or put the patient at risk Presence of active infectious disease or intraocular inflammation in either eye at the time of enrollment Ocular disorders in the study eye that may confound interpretation of study results, compromise visual acuity or require medical or surgical intervention during the 12month study period (including retinal detachment, cataract and preretinal membrane of the macula) History of panretinal or focal/grid laser photocoagulation with involvement of the macular area in the study eye at any time History of intraocular treatment with any antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT) and any intraocular surgery or corticosteroid administration within one month before study entrance Known hypersensitivity to ranibizumab or any component of the ranibizumab formulation Simultaneous participation in a study that includes administration of any investigational drug</criteria>
