	<criteria>Signed and dated informed consent, approved by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), obtained prior to the performance of any studyspecific procedures or assessments. The subject must be able to understand and comply with protocol requirements and instructions. Males and females &gt;=18 years of age (at the time consent is obtained). Histologically or cytologically documented stage IV NSCLC, with prior histopathological reports showing one of the following: Evidence of Epidermal growth factor receptor activating mutation positive (EGFRm) or Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ Wild Type (WT) genes in Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) derived from formalinfixed paraffinembedded human nonsmall cell lung cancer tumor tissue; An orphan receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) chromosomal rearrangements as determined by ectopic expression of the ROS1 protein by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or detection of ROS1 rearrangements as determined by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); In Cohort 3, subjects with alternative molecular profiles (e.g., Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases [NRTK], Tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the glial cell linederived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family [RET], etc.) may be enrolled as subsets of this cohort if emerging data suggest they would likely respond to therapy. If genetic analyses have been performed previously, a copy of the complete mutation profile is requested. Tumor biopsy: For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, a fresh tumor sample after progression on erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or another EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and before starting in this study is required; in addition, archival samples obtained preEGFRTKI are required (if available). For Cohort 3, subjects who are crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor naive will be required to provide a copy of the genetic report showing ROS1 positive mutation and archival tissue if available; subjects with ROS1 fusions who progressed on crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor will be required to provide a copy of the genetic report showing ROS1 positive mutation and a fresh biopsy. Subjects must meet one of the following: Cohort 1 (EGFRm): Has documented progression (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria) after &gt;=4 months of clinical benefit on prior erlotinib/gefitinib/afatinib therapy within 30 days prior to the first dose of foretinib; Cohort 2 (EGFR/WT): Has documented progression (based on RECIST 1.1criteria) after &gt;=2 months of clinical benefit on prior EGFRTKI therapy within 30 days prior to the first dose of foretinib, or; Cohort 3: For the ROS1 subset, documented progression (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria) on or was intolerant of prior crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor therapy or is naive to crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor. Note: Crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor naive subjects will be eligible for the study if crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor is not available to them and participation in this trial is their only option for targeted ROS1 treatment. For additional biomarkerdriven subsets, written documentation of entry requirements will be provided to IRB(s)/IEC(s). Only one prior line of EGFRTKI therapy immediately preceding enrolment into the current study for Cohorts 1 or 2. Progression will have occurred on single agent EGFRTKI treatment in the 1st line setting for EGFRm subjects, and in the 2nd line or maintenance setting for EGFRm or EGFR/WT subjects. Measurable disease, i.e., presenting with at least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1. Subjects must not have participated in another clinical trial except with single agent EGFRTKI or crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor within the past 3 months and may not have received any intervening therapy of any kind (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.) between the time of progression on prior TKI and enrolment on this trial. Additional requirements regarding prior therapy may be added for Cohort 3 subsets as they are added to this study. Note: Subjects may continue treatment with the prior TKI on which they progressed during this 30 day period at the discretion of investigator, but must discontinue the prior TKI to allow 5 halflives off drug prior to the first dose of foretinib in this study. A minimum of 14 days must have elapsed since any palliative radiotherapy and subjects must have recovered from any treatment related toxicities prior to enrolment. A minimum of 14 days has elapsed from last surgery prior to first dose and wound healing has occurred. If subject has had exploratory thoracotomy, they must have recovered from the procedure prior to start. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. Any ongoing potentially reversible treatmentrelated toxicities must be (National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (NCICTCAE v4.03) &lt;=Grade 1 and not progressing in severity, except alopecia or the expected EGFRTKI toxicities of rash or diarrhea that are stable with intervention and then only if agreed to by the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor and the investigator. Adequate baseline organ function as defined in the protocol. Note: Laboratory results obtained during Screening should be used to determine eligibility criteria. In situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted range, the investigator may opt to retest the subject and the subsequent within range screening result may be used to confirm eligibility. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective contraception, as defined in the protocol, during the study and for 21 days following the last dose of study treatment. Men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception as described in the protocol for at least 14 days prior to administration of the first dose of study until 21 days after the last dose of study treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm. Subjects must discontinue hormone replacement therapy prior to study enrolment due to the potential for inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins. Cotinine level within the quantification limits of the assay. Subjects in erlotinib combination cohorts must have stopped smoking prior to study entry and must not have used any nicotinecontaining products, including nicotine patches or gum, within the past 6 months.
