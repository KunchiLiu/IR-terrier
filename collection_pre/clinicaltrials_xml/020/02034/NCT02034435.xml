	<brief_summary>Aim 1.Test the hypothesis that activation of the endogenous renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system impairs glycemic control via effects on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that activation of the endogenous renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system impairs insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity via an mineralocorticoid-receptor dependent mechanism.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In aim 1 subjects are randomized to cross over between an 8 day high salt and 8 day low salt diet and assessments are made. In aim 2, subjects are randomized to a 2x2 cross over study with an 8 day low salt diet and either eplerenone 50mg or amlodipine 5mg.</detailed_description>
