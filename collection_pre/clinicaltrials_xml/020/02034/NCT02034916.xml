	<brief_summary>The purpose of this 2-stage, 2-cohort Phase 2 trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of talazoparib (also known as BMN 673) in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a deleterious germline BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation. Subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 1 or 2 based on prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease: - Cohort 1) Subjects with a documented PR or CR to a prior platinum-containing regimen for metastatic disease with disease progression &gt; 8 weeks following the last dose of platinum; or - Cohort 2) Subjects who have received &gt; 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease and who have had no prior platinum therapy for metastatic disease</brief_summary>
