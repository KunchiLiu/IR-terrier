	<brief_summary>There have been reports suggesting that anti-epidermal growth factor antibody nimotuzumab is advantageous for advanced esophageal cancer patients in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.And,albumin-bound paclitaxel was characterized with high tolerated doses with greater efficacy,and with greater concentration in tumor tissue compared with normal tissues.So,The objective of this single-arm phase II trial was to evaluate the benefit of nimotuzumab plus nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nimotuzumab Plus Nab-paclitaxel and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the past decade, clinical trials have evaluated the role of chemotherapy, radiation, or both, for patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma, but have all failed to demonstrate a consistent survival benefit. In Eastern countries, Chemotherapy became one of the treatment strategies for advanced esophageal cancer. In an effort to improve the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy, the investigators conducted a prospective study to evaluate the regimen of Nimotuzumab plus Nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin for patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</detailed_description>
