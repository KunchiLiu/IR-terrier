	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of Dotarem®-enhanced MRI as compared to Gadovist®/ Gadavist®-enhanced MRI in the diagnosis of brain tumors in terms of overall lesion visualization and characterization (off-site assessment). 270 patients will be randomized between 2 arms defining the sequence of administration of the contrast agents at the dose of 0.1mmol/kg, with a minimum of 48 hours and a maximum of 14 days in between. Each patient will, therefore, receive two MRI during his/her participation in the study. The two arms consist in : - Dotarem® in the first MRI, then Gadovist®/Gadavist® in the second MRI. - Gadovist®/Gadavist® in the first MRI, then Dotarem® in the second MRI. Contrast-enhanced MRIs will be performed on 1.5 or 3 Tesla systems. MRI examinations will be evaluated centrally by blinded independent readers for the main evaluation criterion.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female or male adult patient (patient having reached legal majority age) Patient with known or highly suspected primary intracranial tumors (intraaxial or extraaxial) detected by previous CT or MRI examination who are scheduled to undergo a routine contrastenhanced MRI Female patient must have effective contraception throughout the study and must have a negative urine pregnancy test at inclusion, or be surgically sterilized, or postmenopausal (minimum 12 months of amenorrhea) Patient having provided his/her written informed consent to participate in the trial prior to any studyrelated procedure being conducted Patient with national health insurance (according to local regulatory requirements) Patient with rapidly evolving brain tumor that could change in appearance between the time of the two study MRI examinations. Patient undergoing current or recent treatment within past 6 weeks or scheduled for any treatment that could results in changes of lesion appearance between the two study examinations. This would include, but not restricted to, the following: current or recent radiation therapy, surgery, starting or recent chemotherapy. Patient with a contraindication to MRI (e.g., pacemaker, aneurysm clip, severe claustrophobia, infusion pumps, cochlear implants metallic or others according to the imaging site standard practice) Patient with known severely impaired renal function (defined as eGFR MDRD&lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2) Patient with known Class III/IV congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association classification Patient with known severe adverse drug reaction or contraindication to GadoliniumBased Contrast Agent Patient having received any contrast agent within 48 hours prior to first study contrast agent injection scheduled for the study and patient expected to receive any other contrast agent within 24 hours of the last study contrast agent injection Patient presenting with any condition which, based on the investigator's clinical judgment, would prevent the patient from completing all trial assessments and visits Patient under guardianship and/or unable or unwilling to cooperate with the requirements of this trial Pregnant or breast feeding female patient Patient already included in this trial Patient included in another clinical trial involving an IMP within 30 days before the first investigational contrast agent injection.</criteria>
