	<brief_summary>Tracheal cuff overinflation is known to reduce tracheal mucosal blood flow and to increase tracheal morbidity. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe insertion may increase the tracheal cuff pressure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of TEE probe insertion on tracheal cuff pressure and to compare the effects in single-lumen tube and double-lumen tube.</brief_summary>
