	<brief_summary>The investigators will study basic physiology of human peripheral nerves using high-count microelectrode arrays implanted into peripheral nerves of patients with limb amputations or peripheral nerve injury. These microelectrodes will be custom-made and are not available for commercial distribution. The investigators hypothesize that recording neural signals from a large number of microelectrodes will provide selective motor information in high enough numbers to allow control over future artificial devices with many moving parts, i.e. artificial limbs with shoulder, elbow, wrist, and/or individual fingers that move. These studies will also investigate to what extent microstimulation of nerve fibers can provide sensory feedback from a prosthetic limb. The investigators will also conduct up to three acute surgeries where a Utah slanted Electrode Array (USEA) will be implanted in volunteers who are about to undergo limb amputations. These acute implantations will provide Dr. Hutchinson with human surgical experience in implanting USEAs and evaluating the containment system we will be using to immobilize the implanted USEA in the nerve.</brief_summary>
