	<brief_summary>Nerves are made of different fats including omega-3s and omega-6s; however, dietary intakes of omega-6s are very high and omega-3 intakes are very low. We hypothesize that omega-3 supplementation will stop diabetes related changes in cornea nerve structure in patients with type 1 diabetes to stop the development of nerve injury associated with future risk of neuropathy, and reflect changes in the degree of nerve injury over time. As such, we anticipate that patients in the study will maintain Corneal Nerve Fiber Length (CNFL), the primary outcome measure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Omega-3 Supplementation on Nerve Structure and Function in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will test the use of an omega-3 supplement as a potential way to stop nerve damage that has been observed in individuals with type 1 diabetes Nerves supply signals to all structures in the body and take signals back to the spinal cord and brain. Both small and large nerve fibres can be affected in disease states, such as diabetes. Since defects of small nerve fibre activity have important consequences (painful symptoms, erectile dysfunction, cardiac rhythm disturbances, bladder and gastrointestinal dysfunction), it is important to determine new ways to maintain their function to help individuals maintain a high quality of life. Until now, researchers have only tested the effect of omega-3 supplementation in animals with diabetes and have found this nutrient to lessen nerve damage while maintaining the function of nerves. However, there has not been any research on the use of omega-3s on nerve structure and function in humans with type 1 diabetes. Current standard of care for type 1 diabetes is to manage glycemic control and any painful symptoms through medication. The use of omega-3 supplements for prevent or limit nerve damage in diabetes is not within the current standard of care. In this study omega-3 supplementation is experimental and has been approved by Health Canada for use in this study.</detailed_description>
