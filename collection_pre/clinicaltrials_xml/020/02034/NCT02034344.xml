	<brief_title>A Study of Skin and Systemic Biomarkers In Patients With Active Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus And In Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 0 multi-center and longitudinal study of biomarkers and clinical parameters in patients with lupus erythematosus (LE). Approximately 80 participants (20 healthy participants and 60 patients with LE) will be enrolled. This will include 30 with Discoid Lupus Erythematosus/Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (DLE/SCLE) without Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and 30 with DLE/SCLE with SLE. All patients with LE will continue to be managed by their personal physicians per their standard-of-care. Study participants will undergo interventional procedures that include collection of urine, blood samples and skin biopsy. There will be a single sample collection timepoint for healthy participants and two sample collection timepoints for LE patients, separated by approximately 12 weeks. A blood sample for genomic analysis will be collected for research purposes from patients who provide consent and where local regulations permit. The data obtained in this study will be used in the evaluation of new therapies for lupus and may help in developing new treatments. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examinations. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 11 days for healthy participants and 95 days for patients with LE.</detailed_description>
