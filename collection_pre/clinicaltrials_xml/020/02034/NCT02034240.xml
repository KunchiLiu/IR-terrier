	<brief_summary>Patients with severe infection and sepsis are in high risk of hypo perfusion and therefore organ affection. Temporary or permanent kidney failure is a common complication in these patients. Today's golden standard for kidney failure detection is creatinine levels rising and / or oliguria. The investigators hypothesize that an even more sensitive biomarker; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin(NGAL) in urine can predict kidney injury before creatinine levels rise. In recent studies NGAL in urine seem to be a sensitive biomarker in these patient to predict kidney injury, but the time factor for sampling optimally is not known. In this pilot study the investigators sample the urine at admission within the first hour of hospitalization to investigate if NGAL can be used as a predictor in an emergency setting.</brief_summary>
