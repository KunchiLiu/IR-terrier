	<brief_title>3-part Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics &amp; Pharmacodynamics of Multiple Doses of CC-220 and Relative Bioavailability of a Formulated CC-220 Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 3-part study to be conducted at a single study center. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose study. During the course of Part 1, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase and a follow up visit. There will be a total of 4 cohorts, each of which consists of a different dose level and/or dosing duration, with 8 or 9 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6 subjects will receive a dose of CC-220 and the remaining subjects will receive placebo depending on the randomization schedule. In 2 of the cohorts, study drug will be administered once daily for a total of 14 days. In the other 2 cohorts, study drug will be administered once daily for 28 days. In one of the 28-day dosing cohorts, 2 vaccinations (tetanus toxoid adsorbed and pneumococcal vaccinations) will also be administered on Day 14 of the 28-day dosing period to help characterize the effect of CC-220 on antibody responses. Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to explore the effects of an alternative dosing schedule on the pharmacodynamics of CC-220. During the course of Part 2, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase and a follow up visit. There will be a total of 2 cohorts, each of which consists of a different dose level, with 9 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6 subjects will receive a dose of CC-220 and 3 subjects will receive placebo depending on the randomization schedule. The dosing frequency will be either once every 3 days for 14 days or once every 7 days for 28 days. Part 3 is a randomized, open-label, two-period, two-way crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of one CC-220 formulated capsule, relative to two reference capsules, following a single oral dose of CC-220. During the course of Part 3, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase consisting of 2 periods, and a follow up visit. There will be one cohort consisting of a total of 12 subjects. In each study period, approximately 6 subjects will receive a single dose of CC-220 as one formulated capsule (test product) and approximately 6 subjects will receive a single dose of CC-220 as two reference capsules (reference product).</detailed_description>

Antitetanus immunoglobulin G titer ≥ 0.1 IU/mL to ensure prior exposure of tetanus toxoid. Note: This criterion only applies to those subjects who will be dosed once daily for 28 days. 1. History of any clinically significant and relevant neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological, allergic disease, drug allergies, or other major disorders. 2. Any condition which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study, or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 3. Used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 30 days of the first dose administration, unless sponsor agreement is obtained. 4. Used any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration, unless sponsor agreement is obtained. 5. Used CYP3A inducers and inhibitors (including St. John's Wort) within 30 days of the first dose administration. 6. Has any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, e.g., bariatric procedure. Appendectomy and cholecystectomy are acceptable. 7. Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration to a blood bank or blood donation center. 8. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) within 2 years before dosing, or positive drug screening test reflecting consumption of illicit drugs. 9. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) within 2 years before dosing, or positive alcohol screen. 10. Known to have serum hepatitis or known to be a carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis c antibody, or have a positive result to the test for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies at screening. 11.
