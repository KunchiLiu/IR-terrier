	<brief_summary>This study is a multicenter, randomized, comparison, open-label, phase IV study in kidney transplant recipients whose immunosuppressive regimen is converted from Cyclosporine with corticosteroid to Advagraf® with corticosteroid. The eligible patients will be randomized into either Arm 1 or Arm 2. The Arm 1 will be reduced corticosteroid slowly until 50% lower dose from 4 weeks to 12 weeks in the Advagraf®-based immunosuppressive regimen, and the Arm 2 will receive the same corticosteroid dose for 24 weeks with Advagraf ®.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Advagraf® Switching From Cyclosporine Between the Group That Was Treated With a 50% Reduced Corticosteroid and the Group With Maintained Corticosteroid for Stable Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to assess the changes in the GFR after 24 weeks of treatment between the group that was reduced corticosteroid slowly until 50% lower dose from 4 weeks to 12 weeks and the group with maintained corticosteroid in stable kidney transplant subjects whose regimen was converted from a CyA-based immunosuppressive regimen with corticosteroid to an Advagraf®-based immunosuppressive regimen with corticosteroid for kidney transplant subjects whose regimen was converted from a CyA-based immunosuppressive regimen. The secondary objective is to assess the creatinine clearance rate, acute rejection, satisfaction of medication and safety of the group with a 50% reduced dose of corticosteroid and the group in which the Advagraf ®-based immunosuppressive regimen with maintained corticosteroid.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Had a kidney transplant at least 12 months before his/her enrollment in this study (including a kidney retransplantation). Underwent a CyAbased immunosuppressive regimen since his/her last transplantation. The CyA dose remained unchanged during the last four weeks before the subject's enrollment. The immunosuppressive regimen (combination of medications) remained unchanged for a minimum of four weeks before the subject's enrollment. GFR≥30 mL/min Had received an organ transplant other than a kidney Had an acute rejection episode within 12 weeks before his/her enrollment in this study, or had an acute rejection episode within 24 weeks before his/her enrollment in this study that required antilymphocyte antibody therapy Had been diagnosed with newonset malignancy after his/her transplantation, except for basocellular or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that had been treated successfully The subject received a kidney transplant from fullHLA identical donor Known to have FSGS or MPGN Type II as an underlying disease Has elevated SGPT/ALT and/or SGOT/AST and/or total bilirubin levels ≥ 2 times the upper value of the normal range of the investigated site Has liver cirrhosis</criteria>
