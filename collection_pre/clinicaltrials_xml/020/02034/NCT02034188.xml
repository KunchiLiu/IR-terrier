	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will assess primarily safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) administered to 20 patients with MS. The primary objective of the trial is freedom from treatment associated adverse events at 4,12 and 52 weeks post treatment. Secondary objective will be efficacy as assessed at baseline, week 12 and 52 and will be quantified based on the following: Neurological assessment of the MS functional composite assessment which comprises of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the expanded EDSS (Rating Neurologic Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis, the Scripps neurological rating scale (NRS), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), the nine-hole peg test, and 25-foot walking time. Short-form 36 (SF-36) quality of life questionnaire and gadolinium enhanced MRI scans of the brain and cervical spinal cord will also be performed at the indicated time points.</detailed_description>
