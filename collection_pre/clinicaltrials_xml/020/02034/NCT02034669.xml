	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the safety and effect of autologous adipose derived stem cell (ADSCs) transplantation in acute spinal cord injury patients. 1. To assess the safety of autologous ADSCs transplantation in acute spinal cord injury and the complication after ADSCs transplantation. 2. To evaluate the effect of ADSCs isolation and expansion procedure. 3. To determine if functional outcome is improved following ADSCs transplantation in acute spinal cord injury patient, using pre-transplantation spinal cord function as the control.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research has carried out in Phase II which is designed as randomized controlled trials. Selection of patients began in Feb,2013, 48 patients are divided in two group according to a 2:1 ratio (the number of candidates as treated: the candidates as control). The effectiveness of preliminary trial are evaluated by assessing Frankel/ASIA motor grade, measuring electrophysiological parameters, enhanced MRI and urinary and bowel function.</detailed_description>
