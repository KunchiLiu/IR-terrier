	<brief_summary>Methamphetamine dependence is a serious public health problem, with methamphetamine abusers being at risk for significant morbidity and mortality, including HIV. To date, no medication or psychotherapeutic strategy has shown robust, long-term efficacy in treating this disorder. This clinical trial will examine whether lisdexamfetamine shows promise in alleviating withdrawal symptoms and preventing relapse relative to placebo in recently-abstinent methamphetamine dependent individuals. Findings of this study will not only shed light on whether lisdexamfetamine may improve upon treatment for this disorder but also inform future medication development strategies for improving treatment for drug dependence disorders. Discovering efficacious limited risk interventions that show more robust, longer-term outcomes would be beneficial both to the individual and society.</brief_summary>
