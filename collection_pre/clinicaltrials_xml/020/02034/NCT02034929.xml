	<brief_summary>The EndoCuff is novel flexible cuff that can be attached to the distal tip of the colonoscope and helps to flatten large mucosal folds during withdrawal. The study hypothesis is that the use of the Endocuff (EC) increases the adenoma detection rate during colonoscopy. The study purpose is to compare EC-assisted colonoscopy with standard colonoscopy for polyp detection.</brief_summary>
