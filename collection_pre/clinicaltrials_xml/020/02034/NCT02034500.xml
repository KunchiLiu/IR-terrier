	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 clinical trial is aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 3 doses of a candidate vaccine against Shigella sonnei (1790GAHB vaccine) when administered at different dosages by different routes (intradermally, intranasally or intramuscularly) in healthy adults (18 to 45 years of age at enrollment). The safety profile of the 1790GAHB vaccine is evaluated in comparison to that of placebo (GAHB-Placebo), constituted by an aluminum hydroxide suspension having the same concentration as study vaccine formulations. A total of 52 eligible subjects will be assigned to one of three sequential cohorts as follows: Cohort A) 0.1 μg ID and 5 μg IN Cohort B) 1 μg ID and 20 μg IN Cohort C) 10 μg ID, 80 μg IN and 5 μg IM Within each cohort, in an observer-blind fashion, subjects will be randomized to receive three vaccinations, four weeks apart, of either 1790GAHB vaccine (at five antigen concentrations) or GAHB placebo. Specifically for IN and ID administration routes, a Data Safety Monitoring Board will be in place to receive a summary of all safety data obtained during one week follow-up post-first vaccination with the lower dose. Based on evaluation of the safety data, the Data Safety Monitoring Board will make a recommendation, as to whether the next cohort should be vaccinated with higher antigen concentration or not. Expected duration of the study for an individual subject is 9 months. Each subject will be followed-up for 6 months after the 3rd vaccination</brief_summary>
