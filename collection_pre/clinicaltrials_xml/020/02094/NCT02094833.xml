	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a novel DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP~T fully liquid combined hexavalent vaccine (study vaccine) administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age compared to Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV//PRP~T combined vaccine (Pentaxim™) given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and Hep B vaccine (Euvax B®) given at 1 and 6 months of age in South Korean infants that received a birth dose of Hep B and born to mothers documented to be serum anti-HBs Ag negative. Primary Objective - To demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection (Diphtheria, Tetanus, poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, PRP-T, Hep B) and vaccine response for pertussis antigens (pertussis toxoid [PT] and filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA]) of Group A versus Group B, one month after the third dose of combined vaccines. Secondary Objectives: - To further study the immunogenicity of the two vaccination schemes, before the first dose and one month after the last dose of vaccines. - To study the safety after each and any dose of vaccines administered in the two vaccination schemes</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study participants who received a first dose of recombinant Hep B vaccine at birth will receive either DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP~T combined vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age + 3 doses of Hep B vaccine or Hep B vaccine (Euvax B®) at 1 and 6 months of age and DTaP IPV//PRP~T combined vaccine (Pentaxim™) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, according to the official vaccination schedule for Hep B, DTaP, poliovirus, and Hib vaccinations in South Korea.</detailed_description>

Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the trial inclusion or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding any trial vaccination (except Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine) or planned receipt of any vaccine in the 8 days following any trial vaccination Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B (except the dose of Hep B vaccine given at birth) diseases or Haemophilus influenzae type b infection with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine Past or current receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products or planned administration during the trial Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, since birth; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks since birth) Known personal or maternal history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or hepatitis C seropositivity History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, or Haemophilus influenzae type b infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Known thrombocytopenia, as reported by the parent/legally acceptable representative Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination In an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C). A prospective participant should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Identified as a natural or adopted child of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study History of seizures.</criteria>
