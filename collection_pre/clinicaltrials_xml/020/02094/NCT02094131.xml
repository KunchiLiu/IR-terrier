	<brief_summary>Experimental Procedure: The subjects underwent an initial interview in which was filled in a form of anamnesis, in addition to being assessed and reassessed by spirometry, dynamic circumference and manometer. Moreover, responded international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ - short version) in order to characterize the physical activity level of each participant being classified as inactive, irregularly active, active, and very active. The same examiner performed the assessments and reassessments of individuals after a training program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Training Using Volume and Flow-oriented Incentive Spirometry in Healthy Subjects - Case-control Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spirometry: It was performed by a portable spirometer Easy One® , according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society (ATS / ERS). The values obtained were compared with the values predicted by Knudson et al.. Cirtometry Dynamics: provided information on the degree of thoracoabdominal mobility and was performed with the use of a tape measure , which was used to measure the chest circumference during maximal inspiratory and expiratory phase . Measurements were taken horizontally at three different levels: axillary, xiphoid and abdominal, taking as references the axillary fold bottom edge of the xiphoid and umbilicus, respectively. Three measurements on each level were performed. The maximum values of inspiration and expiration were obtained, being considered for analysis, the highest value of the three measurements and subsequently the Index of Amplitude (IA) proposed by Jamami et al. was calculated in order to mitigate the different dimensions of the chest and abdomen. Respiratory muscle strength : They were taken with the subject in a sitting position using a digital manometer (MVD300 - Globalmed®) calibrated, nose clip, with the nozzle held firmly between his lips. The maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was obtained by a maximal inspiration preceded by a maximal expiration next to the residual volume (RV) , and to measure maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) a maximal inspiration was next performed to capacity total lung (CPT) followed by a maximal expiration. The evaluation was considered complete when the individual performed three acceptable measures and, among these, a minimum of two reproducible . The last value found could not be superior to the others. Maneuvers with the support pressure by three seconds, and reproducible measurements with a variation less than or equal to 10% of the highest value were considered acceptable. For analysis was considered the greatest pressure value achieved. MIP and MEP obtained the values predicted by the equations of Neder et al. were compared.</detailed_description>
