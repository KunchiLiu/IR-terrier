	<brief_summary>Objectives: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a medically unexplained condition characterized by severe and disabling fatigue. To date much research has focused on finding out whether CFS is caused by mainly physical or psychological factors. Perhaps as a result of this, few studies have examined the relationship between CFS and quality of life, in particular, more positive aspects of mental health, such as an individual's sense of purpose, autonomy and close relationships. This study will address these limitations by examining Ryff's (1989) six domains of psychological well-being (PWB), and other aspects of well-being including positive emotions, in CFS. It will also examine the relationship between measures of symptomology, emotional distress and PWB. Method: This is a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study with a clinical sample of adults with CFS. Participants will complete valid measures of well-being and symptomology. Results: We expect to find that compared to general population norms, individuals with CFS score lower on measures of PWB. Secondly, we expect PWB dimensions will be related to symptom measures. There are however, no grounds for making strong predictions. Implications: This study will advance our understanding of quality of life in CFS. Clinically, it has the potential to enrich and inform therapeutic interventions.</brief_summary>
