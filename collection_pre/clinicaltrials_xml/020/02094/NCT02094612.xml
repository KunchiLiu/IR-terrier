	<brief_title>Effectiveness of the QuotientÂ® ADHD Assessment in a System of Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, controlled trial using a 2-phase data collection. The first phase is the initial assessment for ADHD and includes all patients eligible to be assessed for ADHD as determined by their clinician in the course of usual care. The baseline measurements will be used to compare groups at baseline, and also for longitudinal analyses of medication management. Patients are randomized at this point. Patients in both treatment arms who then receive an ADHD diagnosis and who start medication for ADHD will be eligible for the second phase of the study: three follow-up assessments over six months. Patients who do not have an ADHD diagnosis will not continue in the study, and will be treated by their clinician as usual.</detailed_description>
