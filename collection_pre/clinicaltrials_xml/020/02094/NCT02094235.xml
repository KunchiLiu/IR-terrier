	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-control study of 0.05% and 0.2% E6005 ointment. Pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis (AD) will be grouped into two; an elder group (childhood - adolescent: 7 to 15 years of age) and a younger group (children: 2 to 6 years of age) according to the sequential cohorts by confirming the safety.</brief_summary>
