	<brief_summary>The present study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AMG531 and to determine the recommended initial dose of AMG531 on the basis of its efficacy and safety when it is administered subcutaneously (SC) to the Aplastic Anemia (AA) patients with immunosuppressive-therapy refractory thrombocytopenia and also to assess the pharmacokinetics of this product. Its efficacy and safety during the extension period beyond one year will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
