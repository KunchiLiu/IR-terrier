	<brief_summary>Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is defined as limb pain that occurs at rest, or impending limb loss that is caused by severe compromise of blood flow to the affected extremity. CLI is a major cause of death and disability (secondary to myocardial infarction, stroke and amputation). The mortality in patients with CLI approaches 25% and 50% at one and five years respectively. High on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) in patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel (previously referred to as "resistance") is associated with an increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events after percutaneous coronary interventions and acute coronary syndromes. The prevalence and significance of HPR in patients with critical limb ischemia treated with aspirin and/or clopidogrel is not known. The investigators project aims to investigate the prevalence of HPR (to aspirin and clopidogrel) in one hundred patients with diagnosis of critical limb ischemia encountered at University of Southern California affiliated hospitals (Los Angeles County Hospital and Keck Hospital of USC).</brief_summary>
