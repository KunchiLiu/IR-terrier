	<brief_title>CAP7.1 for the Treatment of Advanced Stage, Therapy Refractory Lung and Biliary Tract Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase II evaluation will be performed in adult patients in parallel studies in 3 tumor types: NSCLC, SCLC and Biliary Tract Cancer. All patients will have advanced or metastatic disease with primary or secondary resistance to standard therapy. In each tumor type the patients will be randomized to receive either therapy with CAP7.1 or best supportive care according to institution standards. Patient in the Control group who progress may cross over to CAP7.1, however these patients will be analyzed separately from the patients randomized to CAP7.1.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed, advanced disease with documented progression (RECIST1.1.) after one or several chemotherapy line Patients may also have received molecular targeted therapy and progressed while on therapy or after completion Must have recovered from the acute reversible effects of previous anticancer chemotherapy, usually 34 weeks after myelosuppressive chemotherapy Serious concurrent medical condition, which could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results. Patients with uncontrolled infection and patients known to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis infection are not eligible for the study Pregnancy or breastfeeding</criteria>
