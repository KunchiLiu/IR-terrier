	<brief_title>A Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Comparative Study and Open-label Extension Study to Confirm the Efficacy and Safety of E2020 in Subjects With Down Syndrome Having Regression Symptoms and Disabled Activities of Daily Living.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose (two doses), placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative study followed by an open-label extension study of E2020 in subjects with Down syndrome having regression and disabled ADL. A total of 60 subjects will be randomized to one of three dosing groups (at 1:1:1) to receive 3 mg of E2020, 5 mg of E2020, or placebo for 24 weeks based on their total scores of Body Functionality Checklist, sex, and study site as the allocation factors. This study consists of Pre-randomization Phase (4 weeks), Double-blind Phase (28 weeks), and Extension Phase (24 weeks). The Double-blind Phase includes a 24-week treatment period plus a 4-week transition period.</detailed_description>
