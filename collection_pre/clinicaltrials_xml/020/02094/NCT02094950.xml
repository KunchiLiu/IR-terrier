	<brief_summary>This is a single arm clinical trial to establish the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial of acupuncture in reducing dyspnea among lung cancer survivors who have completed chemoradiotherapy. Twelve subjects with dyspnea will be recruited to this clinical trial. Up to 10 sessions of acupuncture will be delivered over the course of 8-10 weeks. The primary outcome will be dyspnea as measured by the English version of the Cancer Dyspnea Scale at the completion of the intervention.</brief_summary>
