	<brief_title>The Effect of Tranexamic Acid for Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Orthopedic surgery may be associated with substantial blood loss requiring transfusion of erythrocytes.Transfusion of allogeneic erythrocytes is not free of adverse events and has been associated with transmission of infectious diseases, increased postoperative bacterial infection, immune sensitization, and transfusion related acute lung injury. Measures taken to allay concerns about the safety of blood transfusions have translated into the increasing cost of allogeneic blood units. Blood banks regularly undergo blood shortages. For these reasons, there is a need to reduce allogeneic blood transfusions. A number of effective interventions have been developed, such as preoperative autologous donation, cell salvage, or the use of erythropoietin. Pharmacologic agents such as aprotinin, tranexamic acid, or epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) could reduce perioperative blood loss by interfering with fibrinolysis.</detailed_description>
