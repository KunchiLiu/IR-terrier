	<brief_summary>A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of AZD9291 in Patients with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy and whose Tumours are Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation and T790M Mutation Positive</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II AZD9291 Open Label Study in NSCLC After Previous EGFR TKI Therapy in EGFR and T790M Mutation Positive Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, open label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of AZD9291 (80 mg, orally, once daily) in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation positive and T790M mutation positive NSCLC,who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent. Patients must agree to provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M mutation status following confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of AZD9291 by assessment of Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion: Aged at least 18 years. Japan patients aged at least 20 years. Locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy Radiological documentation of disease progression: following 1st line EGFR TKI treatment but who have not received further treatment OR following prior therapy with an EGFR TKI and a platinumbased doublet chemotherapy. Patients who received prior EGFR TKI and platinumbased doublet chemotherapy may have also received additional lines of treatment. All patients must have documented radiological progression on the last treatment administered prior to enrolling in the study. Disease progression following 1st line EGFR TKI treatment or following prior EGFR TKI and platinumcontaining doublet chemotherapy. Confirmation that the tumour harbours an EGFR mutation known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (including G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q). Patients must have central confirmation of tumour T790M mutation positive status from a biopsy sample taken after confirmation of disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status 01 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks. At least one lesion, not previously irradiated and not chosen for biopsy during the study screening period, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15mm) with computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Females of childbearing potential using contraception; negative pregnancy test. Exclusion: Treatment with an EGFRTKI within 8 days of study entry; any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents or other anticancer drugs within 14 days of study entry; previous treatment with AZD9291 (or 3rd generation TKIs); major surgery within 4 weeks; radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks; current treatment with potent inhibitors of CYP2C8 and potent inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4. Unresolved toxicities from prior therapy. Unstable spinal cord compression/brain metastases. Severe/uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension, bleeding diatheses or infection. Refractory nausea/vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or bowel resection. Cardiac disease. Past history of ILD, druginduced ILD, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease. Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function.</criteria>
