	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the the ability of a single dose of LAS40468 administered via Genuair® and a single dose of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (Seretide®) administered via Accuhaler to produce bronchodilation (opening of the airways) and the safety and tolerability of the treatments</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single-dose, Randomised, Crossover, Placebo-controlled Study Assessing Two Fixed-dose Combinations of Inhaled Long-acting Beta-agonist and Corticosteroid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, cross-over trial to assess the bronchodilation effect of a single dose of LAS40468 and a single dose of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (Seretide®) administered to adult patients with stable asthma. The study will consist of a screening visit and treatment periods of approximately 13 hours separated by washout periods of 7 to 14 days from the time of Investigational Medicinal product (IMP) administration.</detailed_description>
