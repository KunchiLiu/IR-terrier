	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Intranasal Esketamine on Cognitive Functioning in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (participants assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences by chance), double-blind (identity of study drugs will not be known to participant or members of study staff), placebo-controlled (a substance without active drug identical in appearance to esketamine), 2-period crossover study (participants assigned to each treatment sequence will receive 1 dose of esketamine and 1 dose of placebo administered intranasally [through the nose]) conducted in healthy adult participants at a single center. Participants will complete 3 study phases: A screening phase of up to 3 weeks; a 2-week double-blind treatment phase, which includes 2 treatment periods (Periods 1 and 2) separated by a washout interval of at least 7 days; and, a 1-week posttreatment (follow up) phase, if applicable. The duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 6 weeks. Blood and urine samples will be collected during the study for laboratory assessments. Participants will be monitored for safety from the time of signing the informed consent form up until 1 week after the last dose of study drug (or end of treatment).</detailed_description>
