	<brief_title>rhTPO in Critical Patients With Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thrombocytopenia is prevalent among critical patients who is admitted to intensive care unit. Researches have shown that thrombocytopenia is associated with mortality among those patients. Currently, no standard therapy exist for critical patients with Thrombocytopenia. In 2012 SSC guideline, platelet transfusion is induced for thrombocytopenia in critical patients for reducing the risk of bleeding. However, indication for platelet transfusion is relatively strict. No early intervention could be done according to this guideline. Previous studies have shown that recombinant human thrombopoietin can reduce severe sepsis with low platelet 28-day mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia, effectively improve peripheral platelet number, reducing the probability of platelet transfusion.The primary objectives of this study are to assess the impact of rhTPO on mortality among severe sepsis patients with thrombocytopenia, as well as changes of platelet counts and platelet transfusion rates.</detailed_description>
