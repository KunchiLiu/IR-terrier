	<brief_summary>Postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be difficult to manage and may delay recovery. There are multimodal postoperative pain management after TKA, including intravenous opioids, epidural analgesia, peripheral nerve blocks or periarticular infiltration with local anesthetics. All of these treatments may lead to side effects such as nausea, headache, hypotension, urinary retention, partial motor block and infection of the knee. Therefore the investigators will compare three methods of postoperative analgesic after TKA by their efficiency and complication.</brief_summary>
