	<brief_summary>To determine and compare the safety and efficacy of PF-045 and PF-055 with that of vehicle in subjects with scabies. It is anticipated that a majority of subjects will require and receive a single treatment; however, those subjects not showing improvement at the follow-up visit 2 weeks after initial treatment will be treated a second time. Those subjects originally assigned to vehicle for the first treatment will receive a "re-treatment" with one of the active doses.</brief_summary>
