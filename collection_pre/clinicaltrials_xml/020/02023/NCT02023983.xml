	<brief_title>Verification of the Safety of Early Discharge in Patients After Acute ST-segment Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to prove - that early discharge (within 72 hours) in selected group of patients with low risk of follow-up complications after myocardial infarction with elevations of ST-segment, treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, is feasible and safe - that early discharge is "non-inferior" in comparison with the group of patients, discharged in a standard way accordingly with present practice and physician´s decision (usually 4th-7th day), thus it is not associated with higher incidence of complications in 90th day after myocardial infarction</detailed_description>
