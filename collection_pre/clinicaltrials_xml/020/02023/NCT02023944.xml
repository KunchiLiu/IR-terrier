	<brief_summary>Interventions aimed at disseminating information about cognitive aging and lifestyle factors that contribute to successful cognitive aging, in addition to providing broad cognitive skills training, may improve the psychological wellness and day-to-day functioning of the aging Veteran population. This 12-week course aims to teach older Veterans (age 50+) about brain aging, lifestyle factors that contribute to successful aging, and techniques that can boost cognition in daily life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maintaining Cognitive Health in Aging Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proportion of Veterans over age 65 has risen from 11% to 26% from 1980 to 1990, and is estimated to rise to over 50% by 2030. Due to the growing number of older Veterans, health issues specific to the aging Veteran population is a primary concern for the Veterans Health Administration. Fear of developing dementia is common among older adults and minor memory lapses that were previously of little concern may be misinterpreted as signaling the beginning stages of dementia. Although normal cognitive aging is not the same as pathological aging, the impact of normal age-related changes warrants intervention since it can cause emotional distress and functional difficulties impacting occupational, recreational, and social pursuits and subjective cognitive impairment, defined as a noticed cognitive change without objective evidence of decline on neuropsychological testing may be the earliest precursor for dementia. While cognitive changes can be expected as we age, there is a growing body of literature demonstrating that modifiable lifestyle factors can influence functional ability and quality of life as one ages. In addition, cognitive training may result in improvements in cognition and functioning in older adults. Unfortunately, many older adults lack knowledge about cognitive aging and the factors that contribute to successful cognitive aging, which limits their ability to make changes that can improve the odds of successful cognitive aging. The need to disseminate information related to brain health has recently been recognized by key agencies involved in promoting the welfare of older adults, including the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Mental Health, and Aging as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Alzheimer's Association. The current study builds upon previous work on cognitive intervention in older adults by investigating a multi-component intervention which includes psychoeducation about cognitive aging, presentation of lifestyle factors that contribute to successful cognitive aging, and broad cognitive skills training. Using a randomized controlled trial design, 72 Veterans will be assigned to either the intervention group (36) or a no treatment control group (36). Veterans will undergo baseline assessment, which will be used for comparison immediately following the intervention and at 3 and 6 month followup. Outcomes include knowledge of cognitive aging, measures of psychological wellness, and indicators of cognitive and functional ability.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Veterans age 50 and older who are concerned about their memory. Veterans age 50 and older who want to learn about memory processes. Participants will be excluded if they display impairment on a cognitive screening measure, as determined using age and education corrected criteria with a minimum 90% specificity (using criteria: Schretlen, Testa, and Pearlson, 2010) as follows: Age Education MMSE Cutoff Specificity Sensitivity 5155 / 26 or &lt; 5660 / 25 or &lt; 6165 / 25 or &lt; 6670 / 25 or &lt; 7175 / 23 or &lt; 7680 / 23 or &lt; 86+ / 22 or &lt; Or self or informant reported diagnosis of a brain disorder affecting cognition such as Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Parkinson's disease, other dementia, stroke, or brain injury or diagnosis of a major mental illness such as major depression, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder; active alcohol or substance abuse.</criteria>
