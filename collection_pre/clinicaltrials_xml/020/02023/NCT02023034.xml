	<brief_summary>Introduction: Although the motor changes are well determined in Parkinson's disease (PD), few studies describe the effects the virtual exercises on the clinical and functional outcomes in this disease. Objectives: To analyze the effectiveness of virtual exercises on functional exercise capacity, fatigue and quality of life in patients with PD. Methods: 20 subjects, 60 years old will be included, who will be randomized into 2 groups: group of virtual exercises associated with conventional exercises (n = 10) and control group with conventional exercise group (n = 10). The following variables are evaluated: functional exercise through walking test in 6 minutes, fatigue by the Fatigue Severity Scale and Quality of Life through Quality of Life Questionnaire-PDQ-39.</brief_summary>
