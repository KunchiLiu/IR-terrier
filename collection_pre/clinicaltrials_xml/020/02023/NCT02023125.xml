	<brief_summary>This two-group study will investigate the effect of food (Group 1) and esomeprazole (Group 2) on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics of alectinib in healthy volunteers. Participants in Group 1 will be randomly assigned to a two period treatment sequence (AB or BA) in which they will receive a single, oral dose of alectinib per period separated by at least 10 days. Each participant will receive single, oral doses alectinib given under fasted conditions (Treatment A) or following the ingestion of a high fat, high calorie meal (Treatment B) as determined by their assigned sequence. Participants in Group 2 will be given a single, oral dose of alectinib following a standard meal. After a washout period of at least 10 days, they will receive an oral dose of esomeprazole (40 mg) once daily for 6 days. On the 6th day of esomeprazole administration, a single, oral dose alectinib will be given after ingestion of a standard meal. In all groups, pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the 4 days following alectinib administration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Body mass index (BMI) between 18 to 32 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) Healthy male and female participants. Healthy status will be defined by absence of evidence of any active or chronic disease following a detailed medical and surgical history, a complete physical examination including vital signs, 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), hematology, blood chemistry, serology and urinalysis Female participants must be surgically sterile or postmenopausal for the past year confirmed by a blood follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) test for females without hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Male participants must be willing to use effective contraception, as defined by the protocol, throughout the study and for 3 months after last drug administration Willing to abstain from xanthinecontaining beverages or food (coffee, tea, cola, chocolate, and "energy drinks") use from 72 hours prior to admission to the study clinic until discharge Willing to abstain from consuming grapefruit, pomelo, star fruit, or Seville orange containing products from 7 days prior to first dose of study medication through discharge Willing to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking alectinib and through followup. Participants should also be advised to use a broad spectrum sun screen and lip balm of at least sun protection factor (SPF) &gt; 30 to help protect against potential sunburn Group 2 participants should be H. Pylori negative via breath test Pregnant or breastfeeding women, males with female partners who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or women of childbearing potential. Positive test for drugs of abuse, alcohol or cotinine test at screening or prior to admission to the study unit Suspicion of regular consumption of drug(s) of abuse including marijuana. Current smokers or participants who have discontinued smoking less than six months prior to first dosing. Participants should avoid smoky environments for at least 1 weeks prior to each cotinine test History (within 3 months of screening) of alcohol consumption exceeding 2 standard drinks per day on average (1 standard drink = 10 grams of alcohol). Alcohol consumption will be prohibited 72 hours prior to admission to the study clinic and throughout the entire study until discharge Participants with any risk factors or family history for QT/QTcF prolongation or ECG abnormalities or any abnormality in the ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of participating in the study Confirmed systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) or less than 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg or less than 45 mmHg at screening, admission to the study center or prior to dosing. Notable resting bradycardia (mean pulse rate &lt; 45 beats per minute [bpm]) or tachycardia (mean pulse rate &gt; 90 bpm) Use of any medications (prescription or overthecounter) within 2 weeks or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of the study medication with the exception of acetaminophen up to 2 g per day up to 48 hours prior to dosing, not to exceed 4 g total during the week prior to dosing Use of any herbal supplements or any metabolic inducers within 4 weeks or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study medication, including but not limited to the following drugs: rifampin, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital Strenuous activity, sunbathing or contact sports are not allowed from 4 days prior to entry into the clinical site and for the duration of the study until followup Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 45 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) or 6 months for biologic therapies prior to first dosing Donation of blood over 450 mL within 45 days prior to screening Regular use of antacids, Histamine 2 (H2) receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or any medications which may alter the normal gastric environment and/or motility. No use of such medications within 2 weeks prior to first dose.</criteria>
