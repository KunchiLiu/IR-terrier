	<brief_summary>Regular physical activity is associated with a diverse range of physical and mental health outcomes, with the effects being particularly pronounced among older adults. Despite these health benefits, involvement in physical activity has been found to decline over the course of adulthood with older adults in particular risk of inactivity. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that group-based settings that are sensitive to both the age-composition and gender-composition of their constituent members may represent an opportune means of supporting the improved adoption and maintenance of older adults in physical activity programs. The overall purpose of this feasibility trial is to test the effectiveness of a group-based physical activity program for older adults that is sensitive to both age-congruent and gender-congruent contextual factors, in supporting their sustained involvement in physical activity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The results of prominent meta-analytic reviews suggest that when people exercise in groups they tend to sustain their involvement to a greater extent than when they exercise on their own. Despite the potential for groups to sustain long-term physical activity behaviours, there appears to be an important caveat that comes with exercising with others: if people perceive themselves to be similar to other members of a given group, in terms of salient underlying qualities, this corresponds positively with their attraction to, and level of involvement within, that group. If, however, people perceive themselves to be distinctly different from others within their social group, this is likely to undermine their attraction to, and involvement in that group. Recent research by Dr. Beauchamp and his team suggests that across the adult age spectrum people report a positive preference for exercising within groups that are comprised of others their own age, and when they participate in such classes they display higher levels of adherence to the group. In a similar regard, people report comparable positive preferences for same-gender rather than mixed-gender physical activity group settings. However, to date, research has yet to examine these effects using an experimental (RCT) design. This constitutes the purpose of this present trial.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participants must be 65 years of age or older (both males and females), be able to speak and read English, and not experience any contraindication which might prevent that person from participating in moderateintensity physical activity. Participants will be required to complete PARQ+, and where necessary ePARmedX. The only exclusionary criteria is that participants must be 65 years of age or older (both males and females), be able to speak and read English, and not experience any contraindication which might prevent that person from participating in moderateintensity physical activity.</criteria>
