	<brief_summary>Patients with mitochondrial diseases, who are ≥ 2 years old and &lt; 18 years, will be included in this study. It is anticipated that approximately one half of subjects will have genetically confirmed Leigh Syndrome. Up to 25 patients will be enrolled if there is no toxicity up to the level of 1.3 g/m2/day of RP103. Interim analyses will occur after 4 and then 12 subjects complete the study through Week 24. If the study is not stopped early, final analysis will occur after 25 subjects have completed through Week 24.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label, Dose-Escalating Study Assessing Safety, Tolerability, Efficacy, of RP103 in Mitochondrial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Cysteamine Bitartrate Delayed-release Capsules (RP103) for treatment of children with inherited mitochondrial disease. Patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases associated with nuclear or mitochondrial DNA mutations that impair the respiratory chain. These include, but are not limited to the following clinical syndromes: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy; myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERFF); mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike syndrome (MELAS); KearnSayre syndrome; subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (Leigh Syndrome); POLGrelated disorders (Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome, Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia, Autosomal Recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia, Childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum Disorders, Myoclonic Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia, POLGRelated Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders); Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE), also called myoneurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome or POLIP syndrome; others, e.g., mitochondrial cardiomyopathies and other syndromes due to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. Prior to treatment, patients will undergo a Screening Visit. If eligible, each subject will return for the Day 1 study visit and begin RP103 dosing on that day. Every 2 weeks over the subsequent 8 weeks, subjects will alternate between returning to the clinic for detailed assessments (Weeks 4 and 8) and receiving a telephone call from the Investigator team to assess safety and RP103 dose (Weeks 2 and 6) and the potential need for an immediate unscheduled study visit. Thereafter, subjects will continue to return to the clinic every 4 weeks for detailed assessments at Weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24 (the Study Exit visit). The Week 24 visit will be the same as the Study Exit visit (i.e. a single visit rather two separate ones) if a subject elects to continue on to the RP103-MITO-002 (NCT02473445) extension study, and that study has been IRB approved at the site or if the subject does not continue on to the extension study. If the extension study has not yet been IRB approved by the time a subject reaches Week 24, and that subject elects to continue on RP103, then Study Exit visit will take place later and separately from the Week 24 visit. The extension study will continue until results of the present RP103-MITO-001 study are known.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 6 years and &lt; 18 years 2. Body weight ≥ 5 kgs 3. Documented (genetically confirmed known mutation, i.e. no variants of uncertain significance) diagnosis of inherited mitochondrial disease other than Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) 4. Moderate disease severity based on Newcastle Pediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMD) score, with a score between 15 to 45 inclusive [LHON subjects are exempt of this inclusion criteria], if approved by the sponsor. 5. For patients regularly taking dietary supplements such as creatinine, alphalipoic acid, CoQ10, vitamin B, carnitine, etc. they have to have been taking them for at least 3 months prestudy and will agree to keep these the same throughout the study (from the Screening Visit to Study Exit) 6. With respect to concomitant medications, the subject must: 1. Be willing to abstain from initiating dietary supplements and nonprescribed medications, except as allowed by the Investigator, throughout the study (from the Screening Visit to Study Exit); 2. Be on a stable dose of medications prescribed for seizure management and prevention. Stable dose in this context means unchanged for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. 7. Willing and able to comply with study drug dosing requirements, i.e. ingest the RP103 capsules intact, or sprinkled in liquid or soft food, or using a gtube 8. Sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e., not surgically sterile [tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy]) must agree to utilize two of the following acceptable forms of contraception throughout the study (from the Screening Visit to Study Exit): 1. Hormonal contraception: birth control pills, injection, patch, vaginal ring or implant; 2. Condom or diaphragm, with spermicide; 3. Intrauterine device (IUD) 4. Sterile male partner (vasectomy performed at least 6 months prior to the study). 9. Subjects's legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent; Subject must provide assent, if required by local/institutional requirements 10. Have mitochondrial myopathy as evidenced by one or more of the following criteria: 1. Weakness consistent with myopathy (e.g. accompanied by muscle wasting and/or absence of neuropathy) on physical exam 2. OR documented myopathy on the basis of muscle biopsy consistent with mitochondrial myopathy disease 3. OR weakness and/or progressive exercise intolerance (in which modest exercise typically provokes heaviness, weakness, aching of active muscles, or tachycardia). Weakness should be due to myopathy and not neuropathy or other causes as deemed by investigator 1. Documented diagnosis of concurrent inborn errors of metabolism 2. Nonelective hospitalization relative to mitochondrial disease or direct complication of disease within 60 days prior to the Screening Visit. 3. Platelet count, lymphocyte count or hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal (LLN) at the Screening Visit 4. Hepatic insufficiency with liver enzyme tests (alkaline phosphatase, AST or ALT) greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at the Screening Visit 5. Bilirubin &gt; 1.2 g/dL at the Screening Visit 6. Inability to complete the elements of the study, e.g., coma, hemodynamic instability or requiring continuous ventilator support. 7. Malabsorption requiring TPN, chronic diarrhea, bouts of pseudo obstruction 8. Severe endorgan hypoperfusion syndrome secondary to cardiac failure resulting in lactic acidosis 9. Patients with suspected elevated intracranial pressure, pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) and/or papilledema 10. Severe gastrointestinal disease including gastroparesis 11. History of angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac surgery within 2 years prior to the Screening Visit 12. Any clinically significant ECG, including dysrhythmia, or clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding not already listed above at the Screening Visit 13. History of drug or alcohol abuse 14. History of pancreatitis 15. Participated in an investigational drug trial within 30 days or, within 90 days for a biologic, device, or surgical treatment, for inherited mitochondrial diseases prior to the Screening Visit 16. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to cysteamine and penicillamine 17. Female subjects who are nursing, planning a pregnancy, known or suspected to be pregnant, or with a positive serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit 18. Subject's who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are not able or willing to comply with the protocol.</criteria>
