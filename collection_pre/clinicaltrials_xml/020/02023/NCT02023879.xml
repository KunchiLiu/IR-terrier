	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by a regimen of alirocumab including a starting dose of 150 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) as add-on to non-statin lipid modifying background therapy or as monotherapy in comparison with placebo in participants with primary hypercholesterolemia not treated with a statin. Secondary Objective: - To evaluate the effects on other lipid parameters of alirocumab 150 mg Q4W versus placebo. - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab 150 mg Q4W. Alirocumab 75 mg Q2W was added as a calibrator arm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Study To Evaluate Alirocumab in Patients With Hypercholesterolemia Not Treated With a Statin (ODYSSEY CHOICE II)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The core study duration was approximately 35 weeks per participant (screening: 3 weeks, double-blind treatment period: 24 weeks; follow-up: 8 weeks). Participants who successfully completed the treatment period had the possibility to participate in an optional open-label treatment period with alirocumab 150 mg Q4W until second quarter 2017 or until the drug is commercially available in the country, whatever comes first.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Participants with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [heFH] or nonFH) not adequately controlled with their nonstatin LMT (either ezetimibe or fenofibrate) or diet alone. Exclusion criteria: LDLC &lt;70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at screening for statin intolerant participants at very high cardiovascular (CV) risk; LDLC &lt;100 mg/dL (&lt;2.59 mmol/L) at screening for statin intolerant participants at high or moderate CV risk or, participants not fulfilling the statin intolerant definition at moderate CV risk; LDLC ≥160 mg/dL (≥4.1 mmol/L) at screening for participants receiving diet only or, participants not fulfilling the statin intolerant definition at moderate CV risk and receiving a nonstatin LMT. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
