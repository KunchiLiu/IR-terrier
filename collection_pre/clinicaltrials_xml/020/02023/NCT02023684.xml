	<brief_title>Routine Irrigation With Ropivacaine vs. Lidocaine vs. Saline of Surgical Bed in Sleeve Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As in any other surgery, postoperative pain control after bariatric procedure should provide comfort and early mobilisation as well as enable adequate respiratory effort. Early ambulation is thought to reduce the risk of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis and respiratory complications. In contrast, early inadequate postoperative pain management can lead to hypoxemia, hypercarbia and atelectasis. However, the use of opioids for pain control is limited in bariatric surgery due to sedative effect which might worsen obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a common comorbidity amongst morbidly obese patients and opioid-sparing techniques might help avoid respiratory complications. Methods of regional analgesic are limited and might be challenging in the obese patient and although techniques such continuous epidural analgesia is possible it is not the common practise. The use of patient-controlled i.v. analgesia of opioids is limited owed to increased risk for hypoxemia and other practises such as routine local anaesthetic port site wound infiltration and systemic non-steroidal drugs are warranted. The benefit of intra-peritoneal irrigation with local anaesthetic for abdominal pain relief after laparoscopic procedures was established in few studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect its' effect on postoperative pain relief and breathing parameters in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.By pain score</detailed_description>
