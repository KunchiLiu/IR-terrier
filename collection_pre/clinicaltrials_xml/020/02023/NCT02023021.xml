	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. About 25% of patients have the opportunity for radically surgical resection when diagnosis. However, the recurrence rate is up to 85% within 2 years. Data from clinical trials indicated that gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy reduced recurrence and enhanced overall survival for patients who have undergone surgery to remove their tumor. Nab-paclitaxel could enhance the intratumoral concentration of gemcitabine; recent studies showed that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. The present study is intended to investigate the activity and safety of the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as adjuvant chemotherapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer after curative resection.</brief_summary>
