	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Combined With Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel Chemotherapy to Treat Metastatic Mucosal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mucosal melanoma is rare and associated with extremely poor prognosis.It is the second most common subtype in Asians.No effective treatment for advanced mucosal melanoma patients.Malignant melanoma is a highly vascular tumor in which vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) is strongly expressed and seems to play an important role in disease progression.A randomized phase II study evaluated the activity of Bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel(CPB arm) in patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma.Overall response rates was 25.5%,median overall survival time(OS) was 12.3 months in the CPB arm. Investigators conducted a randomized phase II study in patients with previously untreated metastatic mucosal melanoma to characterize the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab when combined with carboplatin plus paclitaxel.</detailed_description>
