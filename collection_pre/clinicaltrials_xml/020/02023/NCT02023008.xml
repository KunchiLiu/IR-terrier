	<brief_title>Interactive Gentle Yoga in Improving Quality of Life in Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of implementing a 6-week biweekly yoga intervention delivered by multi-point videoconferencing in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain preliminary data on changes in depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep quality pre- and post-intervention in women with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy. II. To obtain preliminary data on acute effects of the yoga classes on fatigue and distress. OUTLINE: Participants undergo 12 sessions of cancer-adapted integral yoga classes using an internet-based videoconferencing platform. Integral yoga includes postures, deep relaxation, breathing practices and meditation to create a profound experience of peace and well-being. Participants take part in study classes from home (or other location that is convenient for the participant and that allows them to access the internet-based classes) with two-way interaction with group instructors and members alike over 75 minutes twice weekly for 6 weeks during radiation therapy. Participants are encouraged to complete additional yoga practice sessions outside of the twice weekly study sessions. After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 week.</detailed_description>
