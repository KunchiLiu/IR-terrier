	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to compare spinal anesthesia with low dose heavy bupivacaine combined with 0.1 mg or 0.4 mg of morphine in inguinal hernia repair surgeries. Anesthesia onset time (sensory and motor blocks) as well as postoperative recovery (first mobilisation, first voiding) time were compared. Also the postoperative pain management and side effects (nausea, vomiting and pruritus) were assessed.</detailed_description>
