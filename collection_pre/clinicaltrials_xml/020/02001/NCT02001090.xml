	<brief_summary>This study examines the flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery before and after cardiac surgery. FMD is measured with ultrasound technique. Increased flow is achieved trough obstructing blood flow with a cuff around the forearm for five minutes. FMD is measured before surgery and on the first morning after the operation.</brief_summary>
