	<brief_title>Examination of the Pancreas in New-onset Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared to the general population, subjects &gt;50 years of age with new-onset diabetes (DM) are 8-times more likely to have pancreatic cancer (PaC). The likelihood of PaC in new-onset DM is further increased in those who have weight loss or elevated CA19-9. In this study patients with newly diagnosed diabetes will be prospectively identified. Those with weight loss and/or elevated pancreatic cancer marker (CA 19-9) will undergo pancreatic imaging. All subjects will be followed up to 24 months. If successful in identifying surgically removable PaC, this study will fundamentally change our practice and will be a major breakthrough in PaC treatment and research.</detailed_description>
