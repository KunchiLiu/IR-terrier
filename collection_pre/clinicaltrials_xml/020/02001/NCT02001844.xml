	<brief_summary>Modern modular foot-orthoses systems allow an integration of the cost and efficiency benefits afforded by the use of pre-formed semi-rigid FOs components, while simultaneously allowing a high degree of individualisation of prescription. Such systems, while popular, still remain unproven. Recent studies in paediatric rheumatology have made a contribution in developing guidelines with regards to pharmacological intervention in arthritic children. In addition, specific drug therapy protocols have been published to effectively help general practitioners, physiotherapists and ophthalmologists to successfully treat children with JIA patients (BSPAR 2006; Hull 2001; NICE guidelines 2002). A Cochrane systematic review on treatment of pes planus, highlighted that children with JIA were excluded as a group from most of the studies (Ashford et al. 2005). At present little evidence exists for the podiatric management of children affected by this disabling pathology, especially for orthotic management. This research has provided evidence to support the use of readily available off-the-shelf FOs in treating JIA children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Foot Orthoses (FOs) on Pain, Quality of Life and the Gait With Children Diagnosed With JIA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction - Currently there is limited evidence supporting podiatric treatment of children with JIA. The foot orthoses (FOs) prescribed to JIA children so far appeared to be very expensive and required long time to manufacture before the fitting. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to determine whether pre-formed FOs that can be prescribed at chair side, impacted on pain, quality of life (primary outcomes) and/or gait-parameters (secondary outcomes) in children affected by JIA. Methods - The study took place at the Gait Analysis laboratory at Queen Margaret University - Edinburgh and at the TORT Centre, Ninewells Hospital-Dundee. Children with JIA were diagnosed according to the ILAR criteria. Intervention was blinded to the patients. The trial group received Slimflex-plus FOs, with the addition of chair side corrections and the control FOs supplied were made with leather board (1mm thick) only. Both FOs had the same black EVA top cover. Primary outcomes were investigated using validated questionnaires (VAS, CHAQ and PedsQL). Tekscan™ equipment (F-Scan™ and HR Walkway®) measured secondary outcomes in-shoe pressure and force data with and without FOs intervention. Multiple foot strikes and repetitive gait patterns were compared pre and post-treatment. Primary and secondary outcome measures were recorded at baseline, 3rd and 6th month's period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed with JIA according to ILAR criteria. All subjects with lower extremity joint involvement with disease onset ranging from 5 to 18 years old. Previous failure of orthotic management, where the patient has not worn any FOs for a period of at least 3 months. Ability to walk a minimum of 15 metres without assistive devices. Six months after start of DMARD therapy. Inability to walk barefoot or shod. Concomitant musculoskeletal disease, central or peripheral nerve disease and endocrine disorders, especially Diabetes Mellitus. Previous foot surgery. Currently using foot orthosis. Where supply of orthotics are contraindicated: (Less than 12 degrees at subtler joint; Fully compensated ankle equines; Osseous anomaly noted in the lower limbs and/or vertebrae during the physical evaluation; Inappropriate footwear for fitting orthoses).</criteria>
