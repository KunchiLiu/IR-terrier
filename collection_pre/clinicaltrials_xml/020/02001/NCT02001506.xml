	<brief_summary>Various regimens and schedule as neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens were investigated and sequential treatment of anthracyclines followed by taxanes, which has shown superior pathologic complete respone (pCR) rate (NSABP-B27 study) is widely used until now. Considering the proven efficacy and tolerable toxicity of 3 cycles of FEC followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel (FEC3-D3) compared to FEC 6 cycles in adjuvant chemotherapy (PACS 01 trial), use of FEC3-D3 regimen in neoadjuvant setting will be feasible with acceptable efficacy and further reduce the duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
