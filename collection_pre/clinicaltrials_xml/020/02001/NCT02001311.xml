	<brief_summary>This study investigates the benefit of using chlorhexidine gel as an antimicrobial agent in orthodontic patient to reduce caries risk and the possible consequential effect of this use on the orthodontic brackets used for the treatment. The investigators hypothesis is that chlorhexidine gel use can reduce caries risk in orthodontic patients with out causing damage to the bonded ceramic or metal orthodontic brackets.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients' age range from 1830 years. Fixed orthodontic treatment. All the patients are at the end of leveling and alignment stage. Initial bacterial count indicates high caries risk. All patients will be given good oral hygiene instruction at the first visit. The subjects had not taken antibiotics for at least 6 weeks before saliva sampling or during the experimental period. All subjects used a fluoride dentifrice twice a day. Patients' age more or less then the age range specified. Removable orthodontic treatment. Patients at early stages of leveling and alignment. Initial bacterial count indicates low caries risk. Subjects that have taken antibiotics for at least 6 weeks before saliva sampling.</criteria>
