	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose statin therapy vs. the association between a low-dose statin and a nutraceutical-based protocol in high-dose statin-intolerant patients with coronary artery disease deemed to be at high-risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose Statins and Nutraceuticals in High-intensity Statin-intolerant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several clinical trials have shown that in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level with a beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (ie, statin) is associated with significant reductions in both mortality rate and major cardiac events. Accordingly, current guidelines recommend that high-intensity statin therapy—such as rosuvastatin 20 to 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg—should be used to achieve at least a 50% reduction in LDL cholesterol unless otherwise contraindicated. In real world clinical practice, however, high-intensity statin treatment is often discontinued by patients due to side effects. As alternatives, nonstatin drugs, such as ezetimibe, are often prescribed in association with moderate-to-low intensity statin. It remains unknown, however, whether the association between moderate-to-low intensity statin therapy and and nutraceuticals (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions) can have a therapeutic role in high-intensity statin-intolerant patients.</detailed_description>
