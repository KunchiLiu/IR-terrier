	<brief_summary>Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most common inherited peripheral neuropathy. Foot deformities are frequent complications in CMT patients and orthopaedic surgery is often required. As yet there are no systematic studies on the management of orthopaedic complications in CMT patients and the current approach varies between centres. This study is a survey with the aim of understanding the current surgical approach to orthopaedic complications in CMT. The target population includes orthopaedic surgeons who perform surgical procedures for foot deformities in CMT patients attending centres participating in the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium (INC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Survey of Current Management of Orthopaedic Complications in CMT Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study protocol consists of a survey addressed to orthopaedic surgeons. The survey will be completed once and it includes two different scenarios of typical CMT patients (one adult and one child). The orthopaedic surgeons will be asked which surgical procedures they would apply to each scenario: - forefoot cavus, - clawtoes and - hindfoot varus No medications or therapeutic agents are a component of this project.</detailed_description>
