	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are examine the effects of sleep deprivation in muscle recovery after a maximum eccentric resistance exercise session performed on an isokinetic dynamometer (24 series of 10 repetitions). The sample will consist of 10 men, sedentary, clinically healthy, aged between 20 and 31 years old. Two experimental groups will be developed: EXE-SLEEP, in which subjects will perform the exercise protocol (~18:00-19:00) and will be subject to normal period of sleep for 3 nights; EXE-TOTAL, in which subjects will perform the same exercise protocol and will be sleep deprived for 60 hours, followed by one night of sleep rebound.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The blood parameters analyzed will be: - Creatine kinase and myoglobin: before, immediately after, 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours after exercise protocol. - Total and free testosterone, IGF-1, and cortisol: before, immediately after, 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours after exercise protocol. Moreover, from 19:00 of the second day to 19:00 of the third day it will be collected blood samples every 2 hours. - GH: during the second night, GH will be evaluated every 1 hour, from 23:00 to 07:00. - TNF-alfa, IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-10, and IL-1ra: before, immediately after, and 2 hour after exercise, as well every 4 hours from 19:00 of the second day to 19:00 of the third day. It will be evaluated isometric strength every 12 hours, as well visual analog scale of pain.</detailed_description>
