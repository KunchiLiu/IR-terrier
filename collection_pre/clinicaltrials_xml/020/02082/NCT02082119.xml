	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety and feasibility of hypofractionated IMRT in addition to chemotherapy, concomitant and adjuvant, in patients with newly diagnosed HGGs after surgery. Primary endpoint: progression free survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) and Toxicity. Secondary endpoint: to evaluate Quality of life (QoL) of patients after surgery, concomitant chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy through neuropsychological examination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated IMRT With Temozolomide for HGG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We designed a study of a hypofractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), using VMAT RapidArc approach. The potential advantage of this approach is to deliver a more selective irradiation to tumor's target with reducing dose to normal brain and to allow to deliver a higher dose, optimizing the therapeutic window</detailed_description>
