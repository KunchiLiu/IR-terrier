	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficiency ( cost-effectiveness ) of a telemedicine system : eNephro Application , compared with traditional care in the management of chronic renal failure in different populations : - population 1 : Patients with CKD stage 3B- 4 , the combined endpoint achievement of target blood pressure and proteinuria . - population 2 : Patients with ESRD treated by ambulatory dialysis , the cumulative duration of hospitalization in short-stay for 1 year. - population 3 : Patients with ESRD treated with Renal Transplantation , the cumulative duration of unplanned short stay for 1 year. The intervention tested in this study is a telemedicine system which is a collaborative and expert system, consisting of: - A dynamic shared medical record for the collection of administrative , medical, biological and clinical data for each patient. All health professionals can access the folder and fill in the support. It is the same for patients treated at home. - A secure messaging for communication between health professionals and between patients and health professionals - Expert systems analyzing data from each patient - A management tool of therapeutic education - A compliance assistance: electronic pillbox and pharmaceutical care Patients included in this study are major patients, male and female who signed a consent form. These patients have a chronic renal failure moderate to end up being treated by ambulatory dialysis or kidney transplantation. The patients of each population will be randomly assigned in group 1 ie traditional care or in group 2 ie traditional care added by telemedicine system. Each patient and whatever the group will perform as part of its monitoring of the CKD assessments at baseline , 6 months and end of study (12 months). These evaluations are about compliance, quality of life, anxiety - depression state. To enhance costs the point of view retained will be health insurance's point of view. Among the various costs, only direct costs are considered: disease management, hospitalizations, consultations in hospitals and private practice, prescribed medical transportation , home visits by health professionals, additional assessments related to the evaluated intervention. A probabilistic matching with the data bases of the National Information System of the Social Insurance will be performed. In addition, the acceptability of the system of telemedicine by patients in the intervention and health professionals will be also evaluated.</brief_summary>
