	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the true incidence of long QT (LQT) amongst a large cohort of subjects diagnosed with unilateral (right/left) or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The goal of this study is to answer the following questions: 1. What is the incidence of an abnormal ECG (QTc &gt; 450 msec) in neonates greater than a week of age with either unilateral or bilateral Sensorineural hearing loss? 2. What percentage of neonates greater than one week of age with either bilateral or unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and an abnormal ECG have an identifiable genetic mutation? 3. What is the incidence of an abnormal genetic mutation consistent with long QT regardless of the ECG in neonates with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss?</detailed_description>
