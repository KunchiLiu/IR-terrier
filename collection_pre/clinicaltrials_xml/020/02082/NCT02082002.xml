	<brief_summary>Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis, however, its nature is not completely understood. Fatigue overlaps often with other symptoms such as somnolence, depression and cognitive disorders, from which it is not always readily distinguished. The evaluation of fatigue and the three most frequently associated symptoms using a multidimensional approach might allow to understand, which methodology is the best indicated to estimate the prevalence of fatigue with greatest accuracy, leading to a better differentiation of the symptoms in the diagnostic setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis- Observational Study - Ticino</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: 1- to provide a detailed characterization of fatigue in a cohort of selected MS patients, including a definition of the boundaries and the overlaps between fatigue, somnolence, mood disorders and attention dysfunction; 2- to see how the prevalence and the overlaps between fatigue, somnolence, depression and attention dysfunction are influenced by the method of assessment. 3-To better characterize the sleep structure in MS patients with fatigue under both the macro- and microstructural point of view.</detailed_description>
