	<brief_summary>This active vs active comparative trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of incremental doses of atropine in combination with pseudoephedrine 120 mg/chlorpheniramine 8 mg in adult patients with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Hypotheses are defined by total nasal symptom scores (TNSS) recorded by subjects in diaries where efficacy will be established by statistical significance where p &lt; 0.05.</brief_summary>
