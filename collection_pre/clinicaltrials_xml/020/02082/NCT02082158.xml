	<brief_summary>This VA-based study will obtain feedback from healthcare workers via validated survey instrument on the comfort and tolerability of wearing current models of N95 respirators and novel respirator designs currently in development. There will be 4 novel respirators and 1 commonly used respirator (not locally used) to compare to a locally used respirator, which is familiar to participants. Comparisons will be examined between each of the first 5 models with the locally used control using Dunnett's t-test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Novel Respiratory Protective Devices in Healthcare</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to compare novel designs to products currently in the marketplace by comparing scores on a survey tool which measures comfort and tolerability of respiratory protective devices. Study participants will be clinical healthcare workers who have experience wearing respiratory protective devices in their workplace. We will enroll up to 400 participants in the study, made up of physicians, nurses, nursing assistants and other healthcare employees who have previously been fit-tested to a N95 respirator. Subjects will be screened to determine eligibility and must pass fit-testing on the respirator he/she is randomized to. Participants will wear the respirator while performing a series of motions that simulate movements made by healthcare workers when performing patient care tasks. There will be no contact with patients during participation. Feedback via validated survey tool will be collected from all study participants on the comfort and tolerability of the respirator worn.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>VA or UF Health Shands Hospital clinical healthcare worker Has been previously fittested to a N95 respirator Is able to pass fittesting on the model of respirator he/she is randomized to Does not meet study inclusion criteria Is pregnant Has a health condition that prevents him/her from wearing a respirator Has physical characteristics that may interfere with his/her ability to attain an adequate facial seal when fittested (e.g. growth of facial hair, facial scarring) Has any condition which could, in the opinion of the investigator, place the participant at risk or interfere with data integrity. This includes a previous reaction to inhalation of both the Bitrex or saccharin solution used during fittesting procedures.</criteria>
