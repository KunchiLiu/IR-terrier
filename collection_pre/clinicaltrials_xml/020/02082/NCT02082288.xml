	<detailed_description>A total of 243 infertile couples underwent long GnRH agonist protocol in the ART unit, International Islamic Center for Population Studies and Research (IICPSR), Al-Azhar University. Embryos which reached the two cell stage at 25-27 hr were classified as EC, and the remaining as Non Early Cleavage embryos (NEC). Embryos were assessed again at 64-68 hours post-ICSI for day three embryo morphology score (Loi et al.,2008). The best two or three embryos, according to day 3 embryo morphology were transferred. Each patient was given a score according to EIOS (female age, number of retrieved oocytes, number of EC embryos, number of good quality embryos and number of embryos transferred).</detailed_description>
