	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK2816126 given twice weekly by intravenous (IV) infusion. Part 1 will be conducted in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL), other Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), solid tumors and multiple myeloma (MM) to determine the safety and tolerability of GSK2816126. Expansion cohorts (Part 2) are planned to further explore clinical activity of GSK2816126 at the RP2D in subjects with Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2) wild type and EZH2 mutant positive germinal centre B-cell like diffuse large B cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL), tFL and MM.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part 1 Inclusion Criteria Provided signed written informed consent Males and females &gt;=18 years of age (at the time consent is obtained). Tumor type criteria: relapsed/refractory nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) that meets one of the following criteria: DLBCL or transformed FL relapsed after or refractory to at least one prior chemotherapy regimen AND not a candidate for standard salvage regimens or autologous stem cell transplant. Local confirmation of lymphoma subtype (e.g. GCBDLBCL) is allowed for enrollment but must be confirmed through central laboratory testing; DLBCL or transformed FL relapsed after or refractory to at least two prior chemotherapy regimens; Other NHLs that have failed at least one prior line of therapy and for which there is no standard salvage regimen. Relapsed and/or refractory MM that have failed prior standard therapy and for which there is no standard salvage regimen. Solid tumors (RECIST evaluable, with the exception of castrate resistant prostate cancer [CRPC] at least one and not more than three standard of care chemotherapeutic regimens, or tumor for which there is no approved therapy, or for which standard therapy is refused. Must have a preexisting central venous access such as a port, Hickmann catheter or a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) or be willing and able to have one inserted DLBCL and tFL: Availability of archival tissue, or willingness to undergo fresh biopsy for: confirmation of GCBDLBCL status (DLBCL subjects); and retrospective central testing of EZH2 mutation status (DLBCL ,and tFL subjects), for all other tumor types: availability of either archival tissue or fresh biopsies. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1. Men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior vasectomy or must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol from the time of the first dose of study medication until 3 months after the last dose of study treatment for clearance of any altered sperm. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective contraception, as defined in protocol, during the study and for at least one week following the last dose of study treatment. Adequate organ system function as defined in the protocol. Part 2 Inclusion Criteria In addition to inclusion criteria listed for Part 1, Part 2 will enroll GCBDLBCL tFL and MM subjects only Lymphoma subjects will be required to undergo EZH2 mutation testing. Local mutation testing is allowed for enrollment but must be confirmed through central laboratory testing.. This will require availability of archival tissue, or willingness to undergo fresh biopsy, for central testing of EZH2 mutation status. Based on the results of the mutation test, lymphoma subjects may be enrolled in one of four cohorts: GCBDLBCL EZH2 mutant cohort: Tumors must contain one, or more, of the following EZH2 activating mutations: Y641F; Y641N; Y641S; Y641H; Y641C; A677G; and/or A687V. GCBDLBCL EZH2 wild type cohort: Tumors that do not contain one of the above mutations; Subjects with tumors harboring EZH2 mutations other than the seven outlined above will be enrolled in the EZH2 wild type cohort. tFL EZH2 mutant cohort: Tumors must contain one, or more, of the following EZH2 activating mutations: Y641F; Y641N; Y641S; Y641H; Y641C; A677G; and/or A687V. tFL EZH2 wild type cohort: Tumors that do not contain one of the above mutations; Subjects with tumors harboring EZH2 mutations other than the seven outlined above will be enrolled in the EZH2 wild type cohort Exclusion Criteria Currently receiving cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy or biologic therapy) (permitting corticosteroids to control systemic or local symptoms, up to a dose of 10 milligram [mg] prednisolone or equivalent daily and stable for at least 7 days prior to enrollment). Hormonal (e.g., antiandrogen) therapies for prostate cancer must be stopped 4 to 6 weeks prior to enrolment. Subjects with prostate cancer may remain on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. Subjects with prostate cancer may also remain on lowdose prednisone or prednisolone (up to 10 mg/day) and still be eligible for this study. Received an investigational anticancer drug within 4 weeks, or within 5 halflives (whichever is shorter) of the first dose of study drug(s). At least 14 days must have passed between the last dose of prior investigational agent and the first dose of study drug. Current use of a prohibited medication or expected to require any of these medications during treatment with study drug. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis B (positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]), or Hepatitis C infection. Subjects who are negative for HBsAg, but Hepatitis B core Antibody [HBcAB] positive, a HB deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test will be performed and if positive will be excluded. Subjects with positive serology but negative HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) test results are eligible. Current use of therapeutic warfarin. Therapeutic dosing of warfarin is defined as resulting in an international normalization ratio (INR) &gt;1.3. Low molecular weight heparin is permitted. Any major surgery, radiotherapy or immunotherapy within the 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug, or palliative radiotherapy to a single symptomatic lesion within the 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drugs. Subjects who have previously received an autologous stem cell transplant are allowed if a minimum of 100 days has elapsed from the time of transplant and the subject has recovered from transplantassociated toxicities prior to the first dose of GSK2816126. Chemotherapy regimens with delayed toxicity within the 3 weeks prior to first dose of study drug(s). Chemotherapy regimens given continuously or on a weekly basis with limited potential for delayed toxicity within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug(s).

Lymphoma subjects with &lt;= Grade 3 lymphopenia can be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with the protocol. Cardiac exclusion criteria: History of acute coronary syndromes, coronary angioplasty, or stenting within the past 6 months prior to first dose of study drug(s); Corrected QT Interval (QTc) interval &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec); Uncontrolled arrhythmias.
