	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to monitor the skin blood flow in the lower leg, with different levels and types of applied loads. These loads will not be placed over the patient's wound nor will they be higher than loads the skin normally experiences in daily activities. The results of this research will help investigators understand the development of pressure ulcers, commonly known as bedsores and stasis ulcers.</brief_summary>
