	<detailed_description>The innovative treatment approach integrates several educational, technological, and social evidence-based components. The aim of this study is to pilot the innovative approach for drug-sensitive TB patients during the outpatient phase of tuberculosis treatment. To test the effectiveness of the innovative approach (intervention) a randomized controlled trial with two arms will be conducted. The intervention arm will include drug-sensitive tuberculosis patients that are treated according to the innovative approach, which includes self-administered drug intake supervised by a family member, TB patient and family member training (including distribution of a leaflet about TB) and psychological counseling, reminder text messages to TB patients, and reminder phone call to TB patient family members. The control arm will include drug-sensitive tuberculosis patients that receive the regular Directly Observed Therapy recommended by the World Health Organization.</detailed_description>
