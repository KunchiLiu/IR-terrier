	<brief_title>The Use of Brace to Retrain Hemiparetic Gait</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective To compare the behavior of plantar pressure peak distribution, before and after training using a brace for gait rehabilitation. Method The brace was developed with the aim of promoting better biomechanical alignment, as well as providing proprioceptive information in order to stimulate action in the knee's flexor muscle groups, thus facilitating the activation pattern contrary to what occurs during genu recurvatum. We conducted a quasi-experimental "before and after" study with twelve hemiparetic adult patients who had genu recurvatum in the gait. The plantar pressure peaks were compared at the various moments of the study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>the presence of hemiparesis after the stroke, with an evolution time of between 6 and 24 months, the ability to walk without using assistive aids, and the presence of genu recurvatum during the midstance in the gait. conditions that would preclude evaluation and training with the brace; for example, the presence of contractures or fixed deformities in the lower limbs, and moderate to severe impairments related to cognition, perception, attention, or language</criteria>
