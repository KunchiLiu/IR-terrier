	<brief_summary>The obesity epidemic is attributable to dietary and behavioral trends acting on a person's genetic makeup to determine body mass and susceptibility to obesity-related diseases. Common forms of obesity have a strong hereditary component and many genetic pathways that contribute to obesity have already ben identified. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) -1 is an incretin hormone that potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. However, GLP-1 also acts as an appetite-inhibiting hormone affecting the appetite center in the hypothalamus. Today, GLP-1 agonists are available for treatment of type 2 diabetes, and their treatment potential in obesity is an area of active research. The aim of this study is to explore if the appetite inhibiting effect of GLP-1 is intact in people diagnosed with obesity causing genetic disorders and to investigate the physiological role of GLP-1 on food intake and appetite regulation in this group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Exploration of the physiological role of GLP-1 concerning food intake and appetite regulation in obese adults diagnosed with obesity related genetic disorders. - Assessment of the effect of GLP-1 on body composition, bone mineral density, energy expenditure, cardiac function, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, lipid concentrations and neuroendocrine function. - Assessment of the impact of the leptin induced adaptive thermogenesis response in the weight reduced study participants. - Investigating the alteration of the composition of gut bacteria as well as subjective ratings of satiety and hunger before after supplement with GLP-1.</detailed_description>
