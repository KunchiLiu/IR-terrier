	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of IV migalastat HCl alone and to determine absolute bioavailability for oral migalastat HCl as compared to IV administered migalastat HCl in healthy volunteers. The data from this study will help us understand how migalastat works in the body and will help us determine what would be an effective dose in future studies with migalastat hydrochloride.</brief_summary>
