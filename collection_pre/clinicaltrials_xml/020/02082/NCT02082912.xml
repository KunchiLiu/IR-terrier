	<detailed_description>Disability after a stroke is common, leaving 65% of patients unable to use their affected hand in daily activities after 6 months. Frequently, these limitations can cause a decreased quality of life. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the important factors in rehabilitation therapy that help improve arm function after stroke. This information may help to ultimately reduce disability and improve quality of life in patients with stroke.</detailed_description>
