	<brief_summary>Explorative study on a medical device with two steps. The first pilot step will be on 8 patients (4 with lymphedema and 4 with venous insufficiency). The main objective is to assess the feasibility of measures by high resolution transient elastography on these pathologic skins, and to define 3 areas for measures. The second step will be on 136 participants (48 healthy volunteers, 48 with venous insufficiency and 40 with unilateral lymphedema of a limb). The main objective is to quantify, by high resolution transient elastography, the dermal and hypodermal cutaneous fibrosis in limbs with lymphedema and venous insufficiency, and to compare it to healthy skin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This diagnostic study will be performed in two steps, in the goal of evaluating a new device, called elastograph. The first pilot step will be on 8 patients (4 with lymphedema and 4 with venous insufficiency). The main objective is to assess the feasibility of measures by high resolution transient elastography on these pathologic skins, and to define 3 areas for measures. The second step will be on 136 participants (48 healthy volunteers, 48 with venous insufficiency and 40 with unilateral lymphedema of a limb). The main objective is to quantify, by high resolution transient elastography, the dermal and hypodermal cutaneous fibrosis in limbs with lymphedema and venous insufficiency, and to compare it to healthy skin.</detailed_description>
