	<brief_title>Spinal Anesthesia - Intraocular Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal anesthesia provides adequate anesthetic conditions for many operations. These operations include orthopedic, urological, gynecological and many general surgery operations. Although few, side effects of the procedure and its effects on body are well known. However, there is inadequate knowledge about the effects of spinal anesthesia on pressure changes in the eyes. These pressure changes in eyes can result in some detriments. Elevated pressures in the eyes can result in disease known as glaucoma, that makes hazard to eyes. Decreased eye pressures can also result in some eye detriments. We aimed to investigate the effects of spinal anesthesia procedure on eye (intraocular) pressure changes.</detailed_description>
