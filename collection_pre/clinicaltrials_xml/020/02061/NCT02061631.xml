	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the overall response rate (including complete response and partial response) of subjects treated with combination therapy docetaxel and cisplatin followed by the chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer Secondary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of combination therapy docetaxel and cisplatin followed by the chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Response Rate to Therapy With Docetaxel and Cisplatin in Unresectable Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment duration for each patient will be around six months. Patients included in the study will be treated with induction regimen followed by chemo radiotherapy. Within the induction period there are three cycles (Docetaxel + Cisplatin) every 21 days, with follow-up post-induction at day 21 after cycle three. This is followed by chemoradiotherapy consisting of radiotherapy for six weeks and cisplatin every week for four weeks. The post-consolidation follow up is at eight weeks after end of chemoradiotherapy.</detailed_description>
