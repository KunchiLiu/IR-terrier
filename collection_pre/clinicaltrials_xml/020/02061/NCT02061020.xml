	<brief_title>Study of the Relationship Between Dose-concentration-effect of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the Ability to Drive in Chronic or Occasional Cannabis Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine: - The relationship between THC blood levels and driving performance measured on a York Driving simulator - The relationship between THC blood levels and reaction times as measured on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) - the pharmacokinetics of THC in occasional and chronic cannabis consumers - Determine the minimum blood concentration level of THC and 11-OH-THC, below which no effect of cannabis is observed - Determine whether the polymorphism of CYP2C9 (* 3) is associated with the AUC, Cmax, and higher THC T1/2 - Determine if the polymorphism of CYP2C9 (* 3) is associated with different pharmacodynamic effects at a given THC level on performance measured by driving simulation</detailed_description>
