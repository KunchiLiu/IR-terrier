	<brief_summary>The investigators objective is to carry out a placebo-controlled, dose-response, randomized clinical trial to assess the effects of polyphenols or derived metabolites on cardiovascular disease risk in overweight adult subjects upon the consumption of pomegranate extract. The investigators hypothesis is that chronic consumption of a ellagitannin-rich source such as pomegranate extract could decrease serum oxidized-LDL as well as other inflammatory markers. The correlation between the effect exerted and the subjects' microbiota (capacity to produce the ellagitannin-derived metabolites urolithins) will indicate a possible role of urolithins on the effects.</brief_summary>
