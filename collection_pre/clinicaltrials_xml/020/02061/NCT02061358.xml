	<detailed_description>The causative agent of dengue fever is Dengue Virus (DENV), a member of the flavivirus genus. There are four DENV serotypes. Infection with one serotype results in lifelong immunity against that serotype, but only limited short-term cross-protection from infection with the other serotypes. Immunity to one serotype has a downside as subsequent infections by other serotypes increase the risk of developing more severe forms of dengue, which includes the most lethal form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever. Traditional epidemiologic and serologic-based estimates suggest a range of 50 to 100 million DENV infections per year distributed over 100 countries. Recent cartographic-based modeling studies suggest that up to 390 million of dengue infections per year, of which 96 million are associated with clinical symptoms.</detailed_description>
