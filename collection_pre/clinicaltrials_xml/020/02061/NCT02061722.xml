	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to measure the availability of the PDE10A enzyme in Huntington disease gene expansion carriers (HDGECs) using the recently developed radioligand [18F]MNI-659. The study will be cross-sectional, examining HDGECs at different stages of the disease (pre-manifest, stage 1 and stage 2), in comparison with Healthy Controls (HCs). The HDGECs included in this study will be recruited from the large database of the REGISTRY (NCT01590589) or ENROLL-HD (NCT01574053) studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be organized in an "adaptive-like" mode. Initially a cohort of 5 HDGECs and 5 HCs will be studied. The data obtained in the first cohort will be analysed and depending on the variability of the data, there will be approximately 10 HDGECs and an equal number of HCs in the second cohort and the size of the third cohort may be altered to in total include approximately 45 HDGECs and an equal number of HCs.</detailed_description>
