	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a subsequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Osteoporosis is one of the most common and debilitating chronic diseases, and a global health concern with a high prevalence not only in Western countries, but also in Asia and Latin America. Most efficacious anti-osteoporotic treatments either inhibit bone resorption like bisphosphonates or denosumab or increase bone formation like teripartide an anabolic agent. Anti-osteoporotic drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy with an increase in bone mass and a decrease of fracture risk (at the hip) by 30 to 50% after 3 years of treatment (Black et al., 1996; Neer et al., 2001; Meunier et al., 2004). Despite the availability of pharmacological treatments, osteoporosis remains a significant health problem for patients who do not respond to the available treatments or fail to comply with their regimens. The present phase 2a study aims to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PREOBÂ®, a proprietary population of autologous osteoblastic cells, in the treatment of osteoporotic patients who do not respond to pharmacological treatments.</brief_summary>
