	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this proof of mechanism pilot clinical trial is to determine if the RXR agonist bexarotene acts in humans to alter the CSF levels of apoE and alter the clearance of Amyloid-Beta</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Bexarotene on Beta-Amyloid and Apolipoprotein E Metabolism in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blinded, investigational drug study designed to measure the effect of bexarotene on the clearance of AÎ² total and production of apoE in the human brain of young, healthy individuals with the APOE3/3 genotype. From the date of initial subject recruitment to the issuance of a final study report and closeout activities, the expected total study duration is 6 to 10 months. Each participant will be screened for eligibility and randomized to receive either oral bexarotene or placebo control ("Test Article").The study has the potential to demonstrate the pharmacodynamic properties of a novel treatment approach to Alzheimer's disease. The primary biomarker measurements obtained from this study are believed to be highly dynamic and able to provide a rapid read-out of the biologic activity of the candidate therapeutic under study. In addition, exploratory analysis will involve a proteomics-based screen to identify proteins within both blood and CSF that are induced by the Test Article, thereby potentially identifying new biomarkers that can be used in future clinical trials to demonstrate bexarotene action and target engagement.</detailed_description>
