	<brief_summary>Visual cognitive deficits in children are frequent, with an impact on working and daily activities. Optometric therapy may improve those functions, however few studies have been performed. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of such therapy by a comparative study between two groups of children aged between 5 and 12 after 6 months of rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
