	<brief_summary>The goals of the study are to investigate the needs of older (age 60+) caregivers caring for adults with cancer at 1-week and 2 weeks following hospital discharge and to explore strategies that may assist caregivers in their home caregiving needs. This study will explore how these needs vary based on caregiver spirituality and relationship with the care recipient. The study will enroll cancer patients and their caregivers admitted to 9100 and 9300, which are the hematological and non-hematological malignancy units at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) respectively. Results of this study will lay the groundwork for creating tailored interventions for caregivers that are compatible to their preferences and more responsive to their needs.</brief_summary>
