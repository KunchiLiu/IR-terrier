	<brief_summary>As the prospective, observational, cross-sectional study, the accuracy of CT angiography-based therapeutic decision-making for revascularization will be evaluated. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of CT angiography-based therapeutic decision-making for revascularization prior to conventional angiography whether CT angiography is an accurate non-invasive technique to determine the most appropriate therapeutic strategies.</brief_summary>
