	<brief_summary>This research study was done to see what the effects are of Teduglutide on people with short bowel syndrome (SBS). Teduglutide is a synthetic medication administered as an injection, which has shown to increase intestinal blood flow, inhibit gastric secretion, increase growth of intestinal cells and increase absorption of nutrients. Teduglutide has demonstrated to decrease Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) requirements by 20%. Teduglutide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) who are dependent on parenteral support. The primary hypotheses for this study were 1) that Teduglutide significantly increases the gastric emptying half time of solids when compared to placebo. 2) Teduglutide will significantly decrease the intestinal permeability and urinary excretion of lactulose when compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Bowel Syndrome and Teduglutide Versus Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Short bowel syndrome (SBS) refers to the anatomical and/or functional decrease in small intestinal absorptive capacity, mostly caused by extensive intestinal resections. The decrease in intestinal absorptive capacity leads to malabsorption causing malnutrition, dehydration and weight loss, all of which severely impact patient's quality of life. In this study, qualifying participants were assigned to 2 different treatment arms consisting of placebo or Teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously daily for seven days. Subsequently, participants were switched over to the alternate treatment arm for seven days, after a washout period of at least seven days. In both arms, after six days of treatment or placebo, participants underwent a series of measurements during day 7 of treatment, including 8 hour GI transit, permeability measurements by using mannitol and lactulose (0-2h, 2-8h collections), and 8 hour urine and stool collections for measurement of volume. Throughout the study participants filled out a food diary and a stool diary (number, consistency, ease of passage) every day. On day 7 of each intervention period participants arrived in the clinical research unit after having fasted for at least 8 hours. Women of childbearing potential had a pregnancy test. Participants then received their seventh dose of placebo or Teduglutide (1 dose, 1 hour before breakfast). Technetium sestamibi (99mTc) pellets were ingested in a scrambled egg, toast, and milk meal (218 kcal) to facilitate measurement of gastric transit. All subjects received a standard 550 kcal meal at 4 hours (chicken meal) after the radiolabeled meal.</detailed_description>
