	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi center, patient sponsored study of Adipose-Derived Stromal Cell (ASC) implantation via intramuscular injections in patients who have critical limb ischemia not amenable for revascularization. The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with diagnosed critical limb ischemia ASCs will be collected from the patient's adipose-derived tissue (body fat). Using local anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The adipose tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of the adipose tissue derived stem cells. In addition, peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of platelet rich plasma, which are then combined with the ASC's for intramuscular injection into the lower limb.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ~ 18 years Existence of limb ischemia, with clinical presentation corresponding to Rutherford Categories 26 as defined in the reporting standards adopted by \ the Society of Vascular Surgeons, or corresponding to the LericheFontaine Classification, stages II, III, or IV Patients with, ischemia and ischemic ulceration provided patient have angiographic evidence of vascular compromise and is not a candidate for revascularization Stable and on optimal medical management for &gt; 60 days as follows: Clopidogrel/aspirin therapy or other anticoagulation therapy, cholesterol lowering agent, and⁄or antihypertensive medication Hematocrit ≥ 28.0%, White Blood Cell count ≤14,000, Platelet count ≥ 50,000 Creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg/dL, and INR ≤ 1.6 (unless taking warfarin) or PTT &lt; 1.5× control (to avoid bleeding complications). INR values for patients taking warfarin will be corrected prior to the procedure Patient meets at least one of the following diagnostic criteria for the index limb: 1. ABI&lt;.5mmHg 2. TcpO2 &lt;20 mm Hg when lying down and breathing room air, if available 3. Or, nonhealing ulcer due to local arterial compromise with no opportunity for revascularization At least one nonhealing distal extremity ischemic ulcer as confirmed by a vascular surgeon Up to date on all age and gender appropriate cancer screening per American Cancer Society Female who is pregnant or nursing, or is of childbearing potential and not using a reliable method of contraception Any medical problems contraindicating tumescent syringe liposuction Life expectancy &lt; 6 months Patient determined to be nonsurgical candidate due to reasons such as 1. Highrisk medical conditions 2. Unstable cardiac disease 3. Stroke or transient ischemic attack leading to limitations in lower extremities or occurring within 180 days prior to the initial screening visit 4. Severe arthritis or other musculoskeletal disorder. Systolic blood pressure (supine) ≤ 90 mmHg Resting heart rate &gt; 100 bpm Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HgbA1c &gt; 10%) Life‐threatening complications of limb ischemia necessitating immediate amputation Uncorrected iliac artery occlusion on index side unless corrected with stent Extensive necrosis of the index limb or other conditions that make amputation inevitable (Rutherford Category 6) Active clinical infection within one week of enrollment Treatment with immunosuppressant drugs Known drug or alcohol dependence, or any other factors which will interfere with the study conduct or interpretation of the results Not suitable to participate in the opinion of the principal investigator History cancer (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer) within five years preceding study entry Unwilling and/or not able to give written informed consent</criteria>
