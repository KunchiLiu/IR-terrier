	<brief_summary>The investigators' preliminary findings suggest that providing patients with acute ischemic stroke hydration therapy on the basis of their presenting BUN/Cr ratio may help reduce the occurrence of stroke-in-evolution(SIE) and therefore improve prognosis. The trial will be carried out in two parts. Part 1 assesses the rate of stroke-in-evolution 72 hours after the onset of stroke as a measure of the activity of BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy. Part 2, The investigators use two outcome measures, including Barthel index, and modified Rankin scale for neurological evaluation to assess whether BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy results in sustained clinical benefit at three months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BUN/Cr-based Hydration Therapy to Improve Outcomes for Dehydrated Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have recently reported a novel finding that the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr) ratio, a marker of hydration status, was an independent predictor of SIE among patients who had suffered acute ischemic stroke. The investigators found that patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15 were 3.4-fold more likely to experience SIE than patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio &lt; 15. The ratio of SIE was 13.9% in all patients, with 20% in patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15 and 8.3% in patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio &lt; 15. Among the patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke, 37% of them had a BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15. The investigators' recent pilot study was designed to determine if providing hydration therapy, specifically intravenous saline infusion, to patients with a blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) ≥15 reduces the occurrence of SIE after acute ischemic stroke. Patients in the hydration group received a significantly larger (all P &lt; 0.001) median volume of infused saline than patients in the control group. And this allowed 82% of the patients to maintain their BUN/Cr ratio &lt;15 in first 8 hours. The proportion of patients who experienced SIE was significantly lower in the hydration group compared with the control group. Dehydration, as indicated by an increased BUN/Cr ratio, is known to be relatively common among patients who have experienced stroke. According to the result of our pilot study, a hydration strategy with intravenous 20 cc per kilogram of body weight normal saline in first 8 hours was safe and effective to prevent dehydration related early neurological deterioration. In this study, the investigators conduct a randomized double-blind control trial to test the hypothesis that whether BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy has clinical activity.</detailed_description>
