	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the evolution of raltegravir concentration in the mother (between the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and one month post-delivery) and her neonate, when this drug is used to prevent mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission as part of a combined antiretroviral regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Raltegravir During the Third Trimester of Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Objectives 1. Principal objective - To study pharmacokinetic properties of raltegravir in pregnant women infected by HIV-1, during the third trimester of pregnancy (between 30 and 37 weeks of amenorrhea) and 1 month after childbirth (between W4 and W6 postpartum), as well as in their neonate. 2. Secondary objectives - Estimate the frequency of women receiving raltegravir and having indetectable viral load at delivery (and those having a strictly indetectable viral load, with no signal under the threshold of the technique used). - Describe the tolerance to raltegravir in pregnant women during the third trimester and in her neonates 2. Methodology - National multicenter pharmacokinetic study conducted among pregnant women infected by HIV-1 and exposed to raltegravir during pregnancy. 3. Statistical method - Method of population pharmacokinetic with 5 samples: before the drug intake, 0.5, 3, 8 and 12 hours after the intake at each of the 2 visits (between 30 and 37 weeks of amenorrhea, and 4 to 6 weeks after delivery).</detailed_description>
