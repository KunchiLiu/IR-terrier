	<brief_summary>This is a study of co-administration of ertugliflozin (MK-8835/PF-04971729) and sitagliptin given together or alone along with metformin in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The primary hypothesis of this study is that ertugliflozin 15 mg daily plus sitagliptin 100 mg daily provides greater hemoglobin A1C (A1C)-lowering compared with sitagliptin 100 mg daily alone.</brief_summary>
