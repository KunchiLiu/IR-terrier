	<brief_summary>Polar lipids have a specific chemical structure: they are an essential component of human cell membranes, play a major role in the nervous system and also influence the metabolic pathways including the cholesterol metabolism. Polar lipids are used in food-processing industry for their emulsification properties. The most famous emulsifier is soya lecithin but milk also naturally contains natural emulsifiers such as polar lipids. The purpose of this research is to study plasma cholesterol variation after daily intake of milk polar lipids-fortified cheese products. The volunteers will have to consume 100 g of cheese product during four weeks instead of their usual cheese products. It is a bi-centric study with a centre in LYON (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Rh√¥ne-Alpes) and CLERMONT-FERRAND (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne).</brief_summary>
