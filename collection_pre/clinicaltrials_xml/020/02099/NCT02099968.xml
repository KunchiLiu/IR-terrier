	<brief_summary>Different forms of diet, e.g. Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, or fasting, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing elevated blood pressure. Moreover, Mediterranean diet, and fasting seem to be effective in improving insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes. Further, studies on meditation or mindfulness-based interventions have shown positive effects in patients with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes. Comprehensive Lifestyle Modification, this is a combination of diet, exercise, and stress management, have improved coronary atherosclerosis. However, no studies have yet investigated the effects of Comprehensive Lifestyle Modification in patients with metabolic syndrome and/or in combination with fasting therapy. This study is supported by a grant from the Corona-Foundation, Germany.</brief_summary>
