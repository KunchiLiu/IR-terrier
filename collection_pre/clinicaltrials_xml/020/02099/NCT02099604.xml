	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show the superiority of a 4 weeks lead-in phase of Vitamin D followed by a 48 weeks combination of Vitamin D with PEG-IFN plus RBV in comparison with standard PEG-IFN + RBV in untreated Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C, on the sustained virological response (SVR) at 3 months after end of treatment (week 60).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of the Combination Vitamin D With Standard of Care in Egyptian Patients With Untreated Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Method: Phase III, randomized, open-label superiority clinical trial, among Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C. - Treatment strategy: Vitamin D Arm: Vitamin D over a 4 weeks lead-in phase followed by Vitamin D in combination with PEG-INF plus RBV during 48 weeks. Standard of Care Arm: PEG-INF plus RBV during 48 weeks. - Main outcome: Proportion of patients with Sustained Virological Response (SVR) as defined by HCV RNA below the detection limit based on quantitative PCR 12 weeks after stopping treatment. - Sample Size: 520 patients (260 per arm) - Enrollment period: 12 months - Patient's participation duration: 62 weeks (SOC Arm), 66 weeks (Vit-D Arm) - Statistical analysis: The superiority of the vitamin D arm will be tested against the standard PEG IFN + RBV combination. 260 patients in each arm will give 80% power to document a 12% difference in the SVR rates between the experimental (Vitamin D) and the control (standard treatment) arms.. A futility analysis is planned for this study, in order to be able to interrupt the trial prematurely in case preliminary results show a lack of efficacy of vitamin D. This analysis will be performed on half of the patients, thus 260 patients (130 patients per arm), on a week 12/14 week criterion (HCV RNA viral load at W12/W14).</detailed_description>
