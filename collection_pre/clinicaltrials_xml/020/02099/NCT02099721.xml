	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that primary prevention patients with one or more additional risk factors (1.5 prevention criteria: syncope/pre-syncope, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), frequent pre-ventricular contractions (PVCs), and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) are at a similar risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (LTVA) when compared to secondary prevention patients, and would receive similar benefit from an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), or cardiac resynchronization therapy- defibrillator (CRT-D) implant.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Devices allowed in the study include any Medtronic single, dual, or triple chamber defibrillator that has received appropriate license or regulatory approval and is commercially available by Medtronic in the geography in which the implant will take place. Any market-released, commercially available lead(s) can be used in the study.</detailed_description>
