	<brief_summary>This Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will evaluate the effects of lebrikizumab on airway eosinophilic inflammation in participants with uncontrolled asthma who are using inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment and a second controller medication. Enrolled participants will undergo a 3-week screening period during which assessments, including a bronchoscopy procedure, will be made. Participants will subsequently be randomized to receive lebrikizumab or placebo by subcutaneous (SC) injection on Day 1, Day 8, Week 4, and Week 8. Participants will continue their standard of care therapy throughout the study. End of treatment assessments will be taken at Week 12. Total study period, including screening and follow-up, is expected to last 23 weeks.</brief_summary>
