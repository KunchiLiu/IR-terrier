	<brief_summary>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been recently studied for evaluation of coronary stenting. Because of high resolutions, several reports have shown that OCT is appropriate for evaluating neointimal tissue after coronary stent implantation. Also, the strut coverage and the characterization of neointimal tissue can be accurately evaluated. Furthermore, OCT-defined coverage of a stent strut was proposed to be related with clinical safety in drug-eluting stents-treated patients. Therefore, we will evaluate the appropriateness of currently using coronary stents (e.g. Sirolimus eluting stent, Paclitaxel-eluting stent, Zotarolimus-eluting stent, Everolimus-eluting stent, Biolimus eluting stent, EPC(endothelial progenitor cell) Capture stent, etc) based on the findings of OCT. Additionally, we will evaluate neointimal hyperplasia, malposition or strut coverage to decide the differences in the stent characteristics, the duration of antiplatelet use, and the differences according to the clinical presentations.</brief_summary>
