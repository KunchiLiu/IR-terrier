	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to determine if there is a change in quality and quantity of sleep perceived by adults and children with GSD and their parents while starting a modified UCCS (Glycosade) to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. The investigators also aim to evaluate if there is a change in quality of life perceived by adults and children and their parents with Glycosade.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep and Quality of Life in Patients With Glycogen Storage Disease on Standard Versus Modified Uncooked Cornstarch</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective cohort study. Patients above 2 years old and their parents (for children only) will be enrolled during their usual follow-up. Parents will be asked to complete a quality of sleep questionnaire (as it pertains to both child and parent) relating to the past month on their current dietary regimen (standard UCCS) and a quality of life questionnaire (as it pertains to the child only). Parents will then complete a sleep diary (for both child and parent) and both child and parent will wear an actigraph that will record movements during sleep over a 1 week period. Adult GSD patients will complete their own questionnaires. Following this first assessment, they will be hospitalised over a 24 hour period as part of standard of care to start the modified UCCS, Glycosade, under supervision and with a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor. Following hospitalization, the family will return home. Glucose will be monitored with the aid of the CGM sensor for 5 to 7 days. The actigraphy and the sleep diary will be repeated after 2 weeks (for 1 week) while on Glycosade. One month after starting the modified UCCS, questionnaires on quality of sleep and quality of life will be repeated.</detailed_description>
