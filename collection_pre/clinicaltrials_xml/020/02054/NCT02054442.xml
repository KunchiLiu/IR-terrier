	<brief_title>A Study of the Combination of Cetuximab and Methotrexate in Recurrent or Metastatic Cancer of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The addition of cetuximab to cisplatin and 5-FU in recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) showed an improvement of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR). However, cisplatin and 5-FU are toxic cytostatics for the vulnerable recurrent or metastatic SCCHN patient. As one of the primary goals in these patients is palliation, in some patients treatment with cisplatin, 5-FU and cetuximab is not feasible owing to a low performance score (PS of 2) or the patient refusal to receive chemotherapy, i.e. cisplatin and 5-FU, possibly influencing quality of life negatively. Methotrexate is a cytostatic which has shown to have modest activity in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. The RR is between 14 and 20%, the median PFS is 3 months, and there is no improvement in OS, which is only 6 months. Toxicity of MTX is very low. Patients with a PS of 2 can be treated with MTX. Patients refusing treatment with cisplatin, 5-FU and cetuximab, frequently choose MTX as palliative treatment. No data are available on the combination of cetuximab and MTX. The investigators will perform a randomized phase II study to investigate if the addition of cetuximab to MTX is beneficial, i.e. an improvement in the PFS, for the patient. Because no data on this combination are available the investigators will start with a phase Ib study to investigate the feasibility of the schedule.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cytologically/histologicallyproven SCCHN Recurrent or metastatic SCCHN At least one measurable lesion as determined by RECIST v1.1 is required. Lesions in previously irradiated areas should not be considered measurable unless there is clear evidence of progression in such lesions since the radiotherapy. No prior systemic treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease Primary site: (1) oral cavity, (2) oropharynx, (3) hypopharynx, (4) larynx, or (5) unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck region presenting originally with lymph node metastases (N1N3). Time between prior treatment and inclusion in the study (&gt; 3 months). Palliative RT in case of painful bone metastases is allowed in phase II and after 4 weeks in phase Ib Ineligible (due to medical comorbidities) or intolerant to platinumbased therapy per medical history or refusing cisplatinbased chemotherapy by the patient WHO performance status 02. Age &gt;18 years Adequate organ function and laboratory parameters as defined by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9 g/dl 5.6 mmol/l (which may be achieved by transfusion) Platelets (PLT) ≥ 100 x 109/L AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Calculated creatinine clearance or MDRD &gt; 60ml/min Recovered from all adverse events (AEs) of previous anticancer therapies. AEs related to prior radiotherapy are allowed. Written informed consent Serious active infections Patients (M/F) with reproductive potential not implementing adequate contraceptives measures Prior treatment with EGFR inhibitors or MTX Concomitant (or within 4 weeks before randomization) administration of any other experimental drug under investigation Concurrent treatment with any other anticancer therapy. Central nervous system involvement Lung fibrosis Pleural effusion or ascites or other third space effusions History of another malignancy within 2 years prior to starting study treatment, except cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin, excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other head and neck cancer. Pregnancy or lactation Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, preclude patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures, e.g. infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction, social/psychological complications.</criteria>
