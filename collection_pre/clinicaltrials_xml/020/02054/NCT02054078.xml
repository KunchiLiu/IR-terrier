	<brief_summary>Patients with Malignant pleural effusion can be diagnosis advanced cancer. Currently recognized as the most reliable method to control malignant pleural effusion is pleural fixed or thoracic catheter drainage. The most effective pleural fixed agent is pulvis talci, but there are about 30% relapse rate. Thoracic drainage can lead to some complications, such as chest infections, catheter migration and blockage etc. The investigators need a reliable methods to solve dyspnea and other symptoms caused by malignant pleural effusion, and improve quality of life. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and Safety of intrapleural Bevacizumab versus pulvis talci as treatment for malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in patients.</brief_summary>

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and Safety of intrapleural Bevacizumab versus pulvis talci as treatment for malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in patients. Methods: A unblended, randomized study to compare the inhibition of two treatment methods in malignant pleural effusion. Consecutive 183 patients were randomly assigned to two groups, A group is Bevacizumab200mg by intrapleural administration; B group is injected pulvis talci with closed thoracic drainage.</detailed_description>
