	<brief_summary>This study proposes to expand upon previous research by studying the effects of a urinary-catheter removal alert on duration of urinary catheter use and frequency of CAUTIs with a large, randomized controlled trial within a three-hospital academic medical center. Hypothesis The proposed urinary-catheter removal alerts will decrease the number of catheter days and decrease the number of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), but will not affect the catheter re-insertion rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of CAUTI Prevention Alert - A Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives - Specific Aim 1: Investigate the effect of a urinary-catheter removal alert on the rate of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). - Specific Aim 2: Investigate the effect of a urinary-catheter removal alert on the number of catheter days. - Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the effect of a urinary-catheter removal alert on the rate of catheter re-insertion. - Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the effect of a urinary-catheter removal alert on overall mortality in patients with indwelling catheters.</detailed_description>
