	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome (MS) has been reported as a risk for cardiovascular events. The aim of the present cohort study is to investigate whether ACEi therapy reduces the rate of periprocedural myocardial injury (PPMI) after elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) among patients with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
