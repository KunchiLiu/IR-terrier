	<brief_summary>This is a study to find out whether the dietary amino acid supplement, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is helpful in reducing the frequency of seizures in children with autism and comorbid epilepsy whose seizures are not responding well to usual medical treatment. The study is also looking to see if this supplement is helpful for immediate and ongoing treatment of symptoms of irritability. Additionally, this study will also look to see if certain substances in the blood that measure a specific type of stress on cells in the body can help tell us how NAC may be helping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Resistant Epilepsy and N-Acetyl Cysteine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One third of patients with idiopathic autism have treatment resistant epilepsy, associated with earlier onset of seizures. In addition to insufficient response to medical treatment, they also have poorer responses to surgical and VNS approaches (Sansa et al 2011). Novel approaches to reduce seizure burden and improve quality of life for the children and their caregivers are needed. There is a plethora of basic research documenting elevated oxidative stress in animal models of seizures. Several animal models have decreased oxidative stress through using compounds with antioxidant effects, but suprisingly, few human studies have been done to date. This small open-label pilot study will examine the use of N-acetyl cysteine, an inexpensive but readily available over-the-counter nutritional supplement, to reduce seizure frequency in 10 youth with autism who have not responded completely to conventional anticonvulsant therapy</detailed_description>
