	<brief_title>Anesthetic Efficacy in Irreversible Pulpitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) is the most commonly used technique for achieving pulpal anesthesia in posterior mandibular endodontic procedures. However, IANB has a high failure rate and success rates are even lower when applied for the treatment of mandibular posterior teeth with irreversible pulpitis.</detailed_description>
