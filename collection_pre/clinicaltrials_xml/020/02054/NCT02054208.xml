	<brief_summary>This combined phase 1/2a clinical trial is to investigate the safety, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and exploratory efficacy of three repeated intraventricular administrations of NEUROSTEM® (human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells) versus placebo via an Ommaya reservoir at 4 week intervals in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Exploratory Efficacy Study of NEUROSTEM® Versus Placebo in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is divided into the 2 stages: dose-escalation in stage 1 and randomized and multiple-dose cohort parallel design in stage 2.The target population for enrollment in this study is patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.</detailed_description>
