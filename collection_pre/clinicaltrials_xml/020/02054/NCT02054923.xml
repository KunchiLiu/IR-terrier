	<brief_summary>Routine video recording of the colonoscopy examination has been proposed as a simple and easy to implement method that could improve the quality of colonoscopy. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether implementation of routine video recording of screening colonoscopy withdrawal is effective as a means of supporting quality performance of colonoscopy. The study will be performed in 8 screening centers within the framework of a national colonoscopy screening program in Poland (the Polish Colonoscopy Screening Platform; PCSP). Individuals aged 55-64 years are eligible to participate in the PCSP. In the run-in period colonoscopy quality measures will be monitored through a dedicated joint database. Then eligible screening centres will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the video recording group or the control group. Screening centres assigned to the video recording group will receive videorecorders and DVDs and will be asked to video record all screening colonoscopies (only withdrawal). Control group will be allowed to record colonoscopies on demand only. Then , the colonoscopy quality measures will again be monitored through a dedicated joint database. All the recorded DVDs will be reviewed to verify ceacal intubation and withdrawal time by the PCSP team.</brief_summary>
