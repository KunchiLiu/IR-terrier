	<brief_summary>Objective perimetry can better monitor visual field defects in retinal dystrophy and Glaucoma patients than conventional subjective perimetry. The PLR ( Pupil Light Reflex to short and long wavelength stimuli should be significantly lower compared to healthy participants in areas of visual field defects in retinal dystrophy and Glaucoma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Objective Perimetry Using Chromatic Multifocal Pupillometer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pupil light reflex (PLR) will be measured by a chromatic multifocal pupillometer in response to short and long wavelength light with small spot stimulus in 76 points of the 30 degree visual field. A computerized infrared video pupillometer will be used to record changes in pupil diameter in response to short- and long-wavelength stimuli (peak 485 nm and 620 nm, respectively) presented by 76 LEDs, 1.8mm spot size, at light intensities of 10-3000 cd/m2 and duration of 1-3 sec at different points of the 30 degree visual field</detailed_description>
