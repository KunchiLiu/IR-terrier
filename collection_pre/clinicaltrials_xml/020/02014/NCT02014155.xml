	<brief_summary>Intended to treat disorders of the respiratory muscles can use the device Threshold IMT Â® through an inspiratory muscle training (IMT) that allows training of the inspiratory muscles, the chief of these being the diaphragm which is which objectified the improvement of its function . To monitor the action of the respiratory muscles can be used several tools such as manometer that aims to assess respiratory pressures, ie, the strength of respiratory muscles, or the Surface Electromyography (sEMG) that allow evaluating the electromyographic activity of muscles analyzed. From a quantitative clinical trial, randomized and blinded, composed of 45 individuals obtained by random convenience and divided into three groups, COPD participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation program (RP) which will make TMI (TGR - Trained Group Rehabilitated), COPD does not participant in a PR program (TGNR - Trained Group not Rehabilitated) and a control group composed of healthy individuals (CG) that seek to analyze the electromyographic activity of sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and diaphragm muscle strength, lung volumes and breathing patterns before and after a period of eight weeks of TMI. Manual will also be held dynamometry to compare the grip strength of the CG, TGR and TGNR only at baseline. Hypothesis: 1. The Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) increases the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) in COPD patients regardless of whether they are enrolled in a program of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). 2. TMI alters the breathing pattern in COPD patients regardless of whether they were entered into a PR program. 3. Patients with COPD who do not participate in a PR program have higher handgrip strength compared to patients who did not participate in a PR program. 4. There is decreased activity of the sternocleidomastoid muscle due to increased activity in the diaphragmatic muscle fibers after a period of TMI. 5. TMI in COPD patients participating in a program RP produces greater increase in MIP, the handgrip strength, improves breathing pattern and a greater reduction in the activity of the SCM muscle and diaphragm than in those who did not participate in a program RP. 6. There will be a reduction in respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increased oxygen saturation at the end of the TMI. 7. TMI reduce the degree of dyspnea reported by patients as MRC scale at the end of the training period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Will be included in the study subjects of both sexes aged between 40 and 80 years. For the control group will participate in healthy subjects, nonsmokers with normal lung function. For Group TMI + Rehabilitation, NonRehabilitated and Rehabilitation Group participate COPD patients with GOLD staging II and III, participants and nonparticipants of a PR program respectively, where individuals not participating (GTMINR) will be those who will enter the PR program during the stipulated time of study and the participants have (GTMIR) should be included in the project for at least eight weeks, the time required for a program to provide RP's effects in COPD Not participate in the study and Group TMI + Rehabilitation, NonRehabilitated and Rehabilitation Group, individuals who do not fit the criteria for GOLD in stages II and III, which are in acute disease, presenting hemodynamic instability, aneurysm, cognitive impairment or any other comorbidity that prevents this study. For the GC will not participate smokers, exsmokers or who have compromised lung function, individuals participating in regular physical activity, ie three or more times per week, and no pathology that affects the cardiorespiratory system. Also excluded are those who do not sign the consent form.</criteria>
