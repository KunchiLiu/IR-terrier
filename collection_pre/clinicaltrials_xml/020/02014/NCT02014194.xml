	<brief_summary>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic condition. Even with proper treatment, no significant improvement is reached in about 30% to 40% of patients. Thus, the development of new treatment strategies is necessary. The attentional bias - ability to aversive stimuli in capturing the attention of an individual compared to a neutral stimulus - has been extensively studied. Already training attentional bias modification has been shown effective in reducing anxiety present in other anxiety disorders.This project aims to: 1 - generate knowledge on attentional bias in individuals with OCD through the use of a standardized protocol developed for OCD; 2 - available to the scientific community the first specific paradigm for the study of attentional bias in OCD patients, 3 - test the effectiveness of a training protocol for reversing attentional bias in individuals with OCD.</brief_summary>
