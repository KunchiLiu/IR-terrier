	<brief_summary>This purpose of this clinical trial is to study the safety and efficacy of Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols as an add-on treatment to help stop bleeding during vascular, liver, soft tissue, and spinal open surgical procedures. Approximately 180 subjects will be treated with either Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols (120 subjects) or Bovine Thrombin JMI® (60 subjects). Subjects will be evaluated for identification of a target bleeding site (TBS) in which control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques is ineffective or impractical and requires an additional treatment to stop the bleeding. The Investigator (surgeon) will rate the intensity of bleeding at the TBS. Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols or Bovine Thrombin JMI will then be applied to the TBS and the amount of bleeding at the TBS will be examined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols as an Adjunct to Hemostasis During Open Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, Phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols as an adjunct to hemostasis during vascular (IG1202-A), hepatic (IG1202-B), soft tissue (IG1202-C), and spinal (IG1202-D) open surgical procedures. Approximately 180 subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio: Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols (120 subjects) or Bovine Thrombin JMI (60 subjects) among the 4 types of surgeries. Randomized subjects will be evaluated for identification of a target bleeding site (TBS) in which control of bleeding by conventional surgical techniques (including suture, ligature and cautery) is ineffective or impractical and requires an adjunct treatment to achieve hemostasis. The Investigator will rate the intensity of bleeding at the TBS. Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols or Bovine Thrombin JMI will be applied to the TBS and hemostasis will be assessed at various timepoints during a 5-minute observation period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Preoperative (at Baseline Assessments Visit) hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥9.0 g/dL (deciliter) Preoperative (at Baseline Assessments Visit) fibrinogen level ≥150 mg/dL (functional method). Require one of the following procedures: 1. An elective (nonemergency), open (nonlaparoscopic; non endovascular) surgical procedure involving a native arterygraft endtoside proximal anastomosis utilizing coated or uncoated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft (IG1202A). 2. An elective (nonemergency), open (nonlaparoscopic) hepatic resection (anatomic and nonanatomic resections of at least one anatomical hepatic segment or equivalent tissue volume) (IG1202B). 3. An elective (nonemergency), open (nonlaparoscopic), surgical procedure involving soft (nonparenchymous) tissue (IG1202C). 4. An elective (nonemergency), spinal surgical procedure in which the epidural venous plexus should be exposed (IG1202D). A target bleeding site (TBS) can be identified according to the Investigator's judgment, and the TBS has mild or moderate bleeding according to the Investigator's judgment. Requires surgical procedure due to trauma (except for spinal surgery). Infection in the anatomic surgical area. History of severe (e.g. anaphylactic) reactions to blood or to any bloodderived (human or animal) product. Previous known sensitivity to any Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols component, any Bovine Thrombin JMI component, porcine collagen, and heparin or protamine (vascular surgery only) component. Receiving an organ transplant. Undergoing another concurrent major surgical intervention beyond the liver (applies to hepatic surgery [IG1202B] only; concurrent interventions on the pancreas, gall bladder, bile duct, or intestines are allowed). Undergoing a reoperative procedure, which is defined as a second, or successive, surgical procedure on the same anatomic location. Undergoing other vascular procedures during the same surgical session (applies to vascular surgery [IG1202A] only; stenting and/or endarterectomy of the same artery are allowed). Undergone a therapeutic surgical procedure within 30 days from screening (diagnostic procedures are allowed). Previously included in this trial (i.e. each subject can only be enrolled once in this study). TBS cannot be identified according to the investigator's judgment. TBS has a severe bleeding according to the Investigator's judgment. Occurrence of major intraoperative complications that require resuscitation or deviation from the planned surgical procedure. Application of any topical haemostatic material on the resection surface of the liver prior to application of the study treatment (applies to hepatic surgery [IG1202B] only). Radiofrequency precoagulation of the liver resection surface, except focal use of radiofrequency as primary haemostatic treatment (applies to hepatic surgery [IG1202B] only). Intraoperative change in planned surgical procedure which results in subject no longer meeting preoperative inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. Application of any topical haemostatic material on the cut soft tissue surface prior to application of the study treatment (applies to soft tissue surgery [IG1202C] only).</criteria>
