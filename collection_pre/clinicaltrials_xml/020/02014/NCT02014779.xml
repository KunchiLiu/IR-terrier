	<brief_summary>Objectives: This study will evaluate the efficacy of internet-based relapse prevention with therapist support, as compared to face-to-face therapy at an employee assistance program. The design is a two-armed randomized controlled design, and outcomes are measured in terms of changes in problematic alcohol use, as well as depression and quality of life. Method: Participants with problematic alcohol use who, after an initial evaluation consisting of five face-to-face sessions with a licensed psychologist where alcohol and collateral problems are extensively assessed, are recommended treatment for problematic alcohol use. Consenting participants will be randomized into one of two groups: 1. Internet delivered relapse prevention with therapist support or 2. Face-to-face therapy. Outcomes on alcohol use, depression and quality of life as well as information on user satisfaction will be gathered post treatment. Follow up will be at 3, 6 and 12 months after completion. Our hypothesis is that the internet-based program with therapist support and the face-to-face therapy will be equally effective in reducing alcohol use (non-inferiority).</brief_summary>
