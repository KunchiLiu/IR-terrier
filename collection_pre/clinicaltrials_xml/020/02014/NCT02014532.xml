	<brief_summary>The adjunctive use of Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist (Montelukast) along with scaling and root planing in patients with chronic periodontitis leads to host inflammatory response modulation and decrease in serum C reactive protein (CRP) levels. If proven this will open new vistas in treatment of chronic periodontitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists in Treatment of Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A RCT was carried out to check the efficacy of Montelukast as an adjunct to scaling and root planing. The patients were randomised to either test group (SRP + Montelukast) and control group (SRP). Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks. Serum C-reactive protein levels were assessed at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
