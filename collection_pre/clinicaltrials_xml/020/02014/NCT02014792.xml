	<brief_summary>Studies suggest that dietary omega-3 fatty acids influence the extent to which the time interval between each heart beat varies (heart rate variability; HRV). Low HRV is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between 24 hour parameters of HRV and blood omega-3 fatty acid levels in patients who have recently commenced haemodialysis.</brief_summary>
