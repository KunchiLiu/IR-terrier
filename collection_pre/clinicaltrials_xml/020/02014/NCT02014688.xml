	<brief_summary>This study is being initiated to create a normal database including measures of optic nerve head (ONH), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Normative Data Collection Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center, prospective, observational (non-interventional) study is the third in a series to measure structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is conducted in normal volunteers of various non-Caucasian ethnic group, and data will be combined with Caucasian subjects to be representative of the US population: (1) Hispanic Descent, (2) Black or African American Descent, (3) Asian Descent, (4) American Indian or Alaskan Native Descent. This study will complement the previous study S-2012-1 NORM-cc, in which normal data from Caucasian individuals were collected. The main goal of the study is to provide the range of these structural parameters in normal eyes. The study will include at least 87 (enrollment target: 135) normal volunteers; each study site will recruit at least 29 (target: 45) subjects with an age range of 18 to 90 years and an approximately equal number of females and males. All subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination, disc photography and visual field testing in one single visit. All examinations performed on the subjects are non-significant risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for marketing in Europe and in the U.S. Total study duration including IRB approval is anticipated to not exceed 4 months.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject is not an employee of the eye clinic. Age ≥18 to 90. Able and willing to undergo the test procedures, give consent, and to follow instructions. Healthy eye without prior intraocular surgery (except cataract surgery) and without clinically significant vitreal, retinal or choroidal diseases, clinically significant diabetic retinopathy (subject may have diabetes), or disease of the optic nerve. Small Drusen are acceptable in older subjects. Hispanic Descent, Black or African American Descent, Asian Descent, American Indian or Alaskan Native Descent Negative history of glaucoma. Intraocular pressure ≤21mmHg. Best corrected visual acuity ≥0.5. Refraction between +6 and 6 diopters and astigmatism ≤ 2 diopters. Normal visual field with Glaucoma Hemifield Test and Mean Deviation within normal limits, or not abnormal visual field by judgment of the ophthalmologist. Clinically normal appearance of the optic disc, with normal appearing neuroretinal rim with respect to color and shape. The optic disc is examined ophthalmoscopically and by evaluation of stereo photographs. When both eyes are eligible, both eyes enter the study. Unreliable visual field. The reliability indices should be used as guide as well as the perimetrist's notes. Unusable disc stereo photos. Inability to undergo the tests. Insufficient quality of Spectralis OCT images (this is not determined until after Spectralis OCT examination, and is an unusual circumstance). Minimum requirements are: Retina completely included in image frame, Quality Score ≥ 20 in the stored ART mean images, and For ONHR scan: Center position error ≤ 100 μm. Note: Inability of a subject to perform one of the two scan patterns or insufficient image quality in one scan pattern does not exclude the subject or eye from the study.</criteria>
