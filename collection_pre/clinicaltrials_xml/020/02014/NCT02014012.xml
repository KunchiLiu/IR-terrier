	<brief_summary>Arterial stiffness has been suggested as an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease and stroke. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an noninvasive established index to quantify arterial stiffness. Therefore, we try to investigate the correlation between PWV values and cardiovascular complications like stroke, acute renal failure, or perioperative myocardial infarction after cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
