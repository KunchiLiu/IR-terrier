	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of 3 doses given at D0, W4, and W26 of 50 µg dosage of AMA1-DiCo adjuvanted either with GLA-SE or Alhydrogel® in healthy European adults not previously exposed to the parasite P.falciparum and in healthy African adults exposed to the parasite. The safety and the tolerability of the vaccine will be assessed on the rate of solicited and unsolicited events/reactions. The safety profile will include local and systemic reactions/events as well as the biological safety, based on a clinically significant change of the baseline value of the main biological criteria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of Recombinant Pichia Pastoris AMA1-DiCo Candidate Malaria Vaccine With GLA-SE and Alhydrogel ® as Adjuvant in Healthy Malaria Non-Exposed European and Malaria Exposed African Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project aims are : -To evaluate the safety of 50 µg AMA1-DiCo malaria vaccine candidate with GLA-SE and Alhydrogel® as adjuvant, in healthy European adults not previously exposed to the parasite Plasmodium falciparum and in healthy African adults exposed to the parasite. T-o assess the humoral immune response to the vaccine antigens by measuring the level of IgG in all volunteers. To assess the cellular immune response by measuring the T cell cytokines IL-5 and IFNγ production following in vitro stimulation with the vaccine antigens in all volunteers. Design : This trial is a staggered Phase Ia/Ib, Randomised, Double-blind, Multi-center Centre trial. Two different adjuvants will be assessed, Alhydrogel® and GLA-SE. One dosage of 50 µg/3 injections of AMA1-DiCo will be evaluated for each adjuvant. Sixty six (66) healthy volunteers will be included into the 2 following cohorts (A and B): Cohort A: 30 Non-exposed European Volunteers (France) Cohort B: 36 Malaria Exposed African Volunteers (Burkina Faso) The non-exposed European volunteers (cohort A) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into two groups of 15 volunteers per group. The malaria exposed African volunteers (cohort B) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio, into two groups of 18 volunteers per group. European Volunteers: Cohort A (30): Group A1 (15): 50µg AMA1-DiCo + Alhydrogel® Group A2 (15): 50 µg AMA1-DiCo+ GLA-SE African Volunteers Cohort B (36) : Group B1 (18): 50 µg AMA1-DiCo + GLA-SE Group B2 (18): Placebo (isotonic saline solution) In order to start recruitment in cohort B (Africa), the safety will be evaluated on the data of all European volunteers until Day 7 after 1st immunisation of the last European volunteer Data will be presented to an Independent Data safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will be appointed for this trial</detailed_description>
