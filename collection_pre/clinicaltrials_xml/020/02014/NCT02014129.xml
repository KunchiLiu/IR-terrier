	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Neoplasm Metastasis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of cancer (either a solid tumor or a lymphoma) that is advanced and/or metastatic Must be, in the judgment of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for the experimental therapy after available standard therapies have failed to provide clinical benefit for their disease Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Guideline Version 1.1, or the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma Guideline Have adequate organ function Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and investigational therapy, for at least 21 days before the first dose of study drug and recovered from the acute effects of any such therapy Males must agree to use medically approved barrier contraceptive precautions during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug Females with child bearing potential: must agree to use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug, must have had a negative serum or urine pregnancy test ≤7 days before the first dose of study drug. A breastfeeding woman must not be breastfeeding. If a female who stops breastfeeding enters the study, the female must stop breastfeeding from the day of the first study drug administration until at least 3 months after the last administration Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks Are able to swallow capsules Have received treatment within 21 days of the initial dose of study drug with an experimental agent for noncancer indications that has not received regulatory approval for any indication Have a medical history of any of the following conditions: presyncope or syncope of either unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (e.g., ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) or sudden cardiac arrest Have a baseline with any of the following findings on screening electrocardiogram (ECG): ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, abnormal QTc using Bazett's formula (QTcB) (defined as ≥470 milliseconds), or evidence of acute myocardial ischemia Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel) Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis. For asymptomatic participants without history of CNS malignancy or metastases Have evidence or history of a leukemia Have received a stemcell transplant. As an exception, a participant with lymphoma who received an autologous stemcell transplant is eligible for the study, if more than 75 days have passed before the initial dose of study drug Have active bacterial, fungal, and/or known viral infection (for example, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis B, or hepatitis C)</criteria>
