	<brief_summary>Flaxseed (FS) is a safe and well tolerated supplement with an ability to fight inflammation and oxidative stress - a byproduct of daily stress the human body faces everyday and especially with chronic diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease resulting from a mutation in sodium and chloride transport channels that results in pancreatic insufficiency, chronic sinusitis and chronic lung infections. The investigators hypothesize that chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are a part of the chronic exacerbations that are a part of cystic fibrosis. The investigators believe that flaxseed with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties can help dampen these stressors on the CF lung and potentially result in fewer exacerbations of CF, fewer antibiotics, fewer hospitalizations, and improved well-being.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flaxseed Modulates Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in CF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten patients with steady-state cystic fibrosis (CF) - not hospitalized, not on intravenous antibiotics, with stable FEV1 40-100% predicted were enrolled in a four week long pilot study where-in each patient consumed 40 grams of flaxseed each day, in the form of finely ground flaxseed, however they wished. Prior to starting flaxseed, each week, and then four weeks after each patient had finished taking flaxseed, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as measurements of flaxseed metabolism were collected. F2-isoprostanes, 8-oxo-dGuo, as well as cytokines including IL-6, TNF-a, IFN-g among others were measured to trend flaxseed effects. Enterolignans - enterodiol and enterolactone (products of flaxseed metabolism) were measured each week as well.</detailed_description>
