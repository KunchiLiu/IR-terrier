	<brief_summary>About 31% of the Danish population participates regularly in running. The positive health benefits of running have been well documented in the literature. Unfortunately, running has been connected with a high risk of injuries. Running related injuries can cause a long rehabilitation and may even force the runner to quit running permanently. To ensure that running can be practiced as a safe exercise activity prevention must be considered.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Running Related Injury Among Novice Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Training errors (i.e. excessive volume, sudden change of training routines etc.) are held to be the main reasons to running related injuries. Fortunately, training errors can be avoided as training characteristics (distance, duration, pace) can be controlled by the runner. In order to avoiding training errors, especially excessive volume many novice runners follow 0-5 kilometres type training programmes. However, limited research has been conducted on the training volume of beginner programs and the risk of running related injuries. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the running volume the first 4 weeks of a running regime and the risk of running related injuries among novice runners. The relationship between running volume and running related injuries will be investigated in proportion to their body mass index (BMI).</detailed_description>
