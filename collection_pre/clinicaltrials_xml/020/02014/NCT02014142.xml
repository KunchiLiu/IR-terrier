Subject must be willing to comply with study instructions, dosing (if applicable), agree to make all office appointments, and complete the entire course of the study 7. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating, must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and must be practicing an adequate method of birth control, including intrauterine device (IUD); oral, dermal ("patch"), implant or injected contraceptives; tubal ligation; or barrier methods with spermicide 8. Subject has a central corneal thickness of &gt; 500 μm and &lt; 600 μm in study eye 9. Subject has a BCVA or pinhole visual acuity (Snellen) of 20/100 or better in both eyes 1. Subject with a history of nonresponse to topical prostaglandin eye drops for OAG/OH 2. Subject with angleclosure glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma, traumatic glaucoma or iridocorneal endothelium syndrome in either eye 3. Subject with a known sensitivity to latanoprost, timolol, fluorescein, topical anesthetic, silicone, any inactive ingredient of the LPPDS or any other products required for the study procedures 4. Subject with a history of intolerance to topical betablocker therapy 5. Subject with &gt; 0.8 vertical cup or completely notched optic nerve head rim in either eye 6. Subject with any functionally significant visual field loss or progressive field loss within the last year in either eye 7. Subject with a history of complications, AEs, trauma or disease in the nasolacrimal area, whether or not it was due to punctal plug wear, including but not limited to dacryocystitis, inflammation or canaliculitis in study eye 8. Subject with structural lid abnormalities (i.e., ectropion, entropion) in study eye 9. Subject with an active lid disease in either eye (i.e., moderate or severe blepharitis, meibomianitis) that requires medical treatment 10. Subject with a history of chronic/recurrent inflammatory eye disease (i.e., scleritis, uveitis, herpes keratitis) in either eye 11. Subject who would require the use of any ocular topical medication(s), an overthe counter drop(s), ointment(s) or gel(s), other than the study ocular hypotensive medication(s) in either eye during the study period 12. Subject who has had any ophthalmic surgical procedures (i.e., glaucoma laser, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery, cataract, refractive, etc.) in study eye within the last six months or will require ophthalmic surgery before completing the study 13. Subject with a history of penetrating keratoplasty in study eye 14. Subject who is incapable of instilling ocular drops into his or her eyes 15. Subject requiring the use of a contact lens in either eye at any time during the study period 16. Subject with advanced diabetic retinopathy, branch retinal vein occlusion or central retinal vein occlusion in either eye 17. Subject with a history of macular edema in either eye 18. Subject currently on any systemic medication [i.e., betablocker, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, corticosteroids (including dermal), etc.], that may have an effect on the subject's IOP, or who will require its use during the study period (Note: an inhaled steroid, systemic betablocker or βadrenoceptor antagonist may be permitted, providing the subject has maintained a stable dosage regimen for at least the last three months) 19. Subject contraindicated to therapy with a betablocker (i.e., history or presence of bradycardia, untreated congestive heart failure, untreated second or thirddegree heart block, sinoatrial block, myasthenia gravis, cardiogenic shock, history or presence of bronchial asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or history of bronchospasm) 20. Subject with an uncontrolled systemic disease or a medical condition that may increase the risk associated with study participation or administration of study treatment or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results (e.g., autoimmune disease if the subject is on chronic medications and has ocular involvement; hostversusgraft disease) 21. Subject currently participating or has participated within the last 30 days prior to the start of this study in a drug, device or other investigational research study</criteria>
