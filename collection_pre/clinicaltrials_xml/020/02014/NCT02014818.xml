	<brief_summary>To treat patients with stable coronary artery disease, elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be performed with the use of an everolimus-eluting cobalt- chromium stent (everolimus-eluting stent: EES, Xience Prime, Xpedition), which is the current standard drug-eluting stent (DES). Vascular responses at the site of stent placement will be evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) at 1 or 3 months and at 12 months after stent placement, along with observation of changes over time in the target vessel. The relationships between OCT findings and the time course of platelet aggregation and between OCT findings and the occurrence of major cardio- cerebrovascular events will also be elucidated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients having at least one de novo lesion in a coronary artery in whom PCI with a DES is indicated Patients aged 20 to less than 85 years at the time of informed consent Patients who have provided informed consent written by themselves Patients who are able to undergo OCT examinations of the site of stent placement at 1 or 3 months and at 12 months If it is judged difficult to perform clinical and angiographic followup at 12 months (considering the patient's remote place of residence, etc.) Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Patients in a state of shock Patients with cardiac failure Patients having a culprit lesion in the left main coronary artery trunk Patients having a lesion with a reference vessel diameter of less than 2.0 mm or 4.5 mm or larger by visual estimate Patients having an instent restenosis lesion as the culprit lesion Patients having chronic renal failure with a serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL or higher at a screening visit Patients on hemodialysis Cancer patients with a life expectancy of less than 2 years Patients who are scheduled to undergo elective surgery requiring discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy within the next 3 months Pregnant women or women expected to become pregnant Patients with a history of adverse reactions to aspirin or clopidogrel (however, it is acceptable to enroll patients in whom the safety of ticlopidine has been confirmed, even if they have a history of adverse reactions to clopidogrel)</criteria>
