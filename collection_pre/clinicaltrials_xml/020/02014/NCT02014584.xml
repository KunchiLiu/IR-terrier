	<brief_summary>Treatment of male pattern hair loss (MPHL) or androgenetic alopecia (AGA) with 5α-reductase inhibitor (5-ARIs) has been associated with sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction and loss of libido. This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess the impact of dutasteride treatment on sexual function as well as subject satisfaction with hair growth and quality of life in men with AGA. This study will consist of a Screening Visit, a 4-week Placebo Run-in Phase, a Treatment Phase of 48 weeks, and a subsequent Follow-up Visit after 4 weeks. The treatment phase will include 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo controlled treatment and 24 weeks of open-label treatment with dutasteride. An extended 6-month Follow-up Visit will be conducted for any individuals with a change in erectile function at the end of treatment.</brief_summary>

AGA classified utilizing the NorwoodHamilton classification. Men 18 to 50 years old, inclusively. Fluent and literate in local language with the ability to comprehend and record information on the International Index of Erectile Function, Hair Growth Satisfaction Scale, and DLQI questionnaires. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%). Have been in a stable heterosexual relationship during the last 6 months prior to screening and expect to maintain that relationship throughout the study. Must be sexually active: a man is considered sexually active if he has engaged in sexual intercourse (at least once) during the 4 weeks prior to screening. Men with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to avoid exposure of his partner to semen by using a condom. Use of a condom must be from 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment until at least 5 halflives for the drug (45 days) plus 3 months (i.e., a total of 4.5 months) to allow clearance of any residual drug in the semen after the last dose of study treatment. Willing to comply with study requirements. Current or preexisting sexual dysfunction as determined by: History of erectile dysfunction defined as the consistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse. Score of ≤25 on the erectile function domain (IIEFEF) of the IIEF at screening or at the baseline visit. Evidence of hypogonadism. Have a communicable skin or sexuallytransmitted disease, or any rash or lesions on the penis or in the surrounding area (as reported by subject and evaluated by investigator). Serum prostatespecific antigen (PSA) &gt;2.0 ng/mL at screening. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5xULN at screening. Unstable liver disease (chronic stable hepatitis B and C are acceptable if the subject otherwise meets entry criteria). History of malignancy (including prostate cancer) within the past 5 years, except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. History of prostate cancer before the age of 50 years in a first degree relative. History of breast cancer or clinical breast examination suggestive of malignancy. Any unstable, serious coexisting medical condition(s) including, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmias, clinically evident congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to screening; and uncontrolled diabetes or peptic ulcer disease that is uncontrolled by medical management. History or current evidence of any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical or psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could, in the opinion of the investigator or the medical monitor, interfere with the subject's safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance with study procedures.Note: the investigator may consult with the GSK medical monitor if a condition could interfere with the subject's safety. Global scalp hair thinning, including occipital areas. Scarring of the scalp, including prior hair transplant or scalp reduction, or any other condition or disease of the scalp or hair, including diseases of the hair shaft (e.g., tinea infection, nonandrogeneticcause of alopecia, psoriatic dermatitis or other psoriatic lesions, or uncontrolled seborrheic dermatitis). History of hair transplantation at any time to correct AGA or use of hair weaving within 6 months prior to screening. History or evidence of hair loss other than AGA (e.g., due to an autoimmune, endocrine, mechanical or infectious process, or secondary to a scalp dermatological disorder). Use of any cosmetic product aimed at improving or correcting the signs of hair loss (e.g., scalp preparations with claims aiming at improved hair growth) within 2 weeks prior to screening. Use of light or laser treatments on the scalp (e.g., light emitting diode [LED] lamps) within 3 months prior to screening. Hypersensitivity to any 5alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI) or its components or excipients or drugs chemically related to the study treatment. Use of dutasteride within 10 months prior to screening or use of finasteride within 6 months prior to screening. Previous use of systemic cytotoxic agents. Use of glucocorticoids (inhaled glucocorticoids are allowed; topical corticosteroids are allowed provided that they are not used on the scalp) within 3 months prior to screening. Use of the following prior to Baseline (within 1 week for topical products; within 1 week or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, for systemic treatments): Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil); Minoxidil (oral or topical); Carpronium chloride; Systemic drugs with antiandrogenic properties (e.g., cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, ketoconazole, flutamide, and bicalutamide); Topical or systemic estrogen or progesterone; Drugs potentially causing hypertrichosis (e.g., cyclosporine, diazoxide, phenytoin, psoralens); Drugs potentially causing hypertrichosis or telogen effluvium (e.g., valproic acid); Anabolic steroids; Participation in any study of an investigational or marketed drug (within 5 half lives of drug) or device that may affect hair growth or sexual function prior to screening for this study. Note: Subject must not participate in any other drug or device studies during the course of this study.</criteria>
