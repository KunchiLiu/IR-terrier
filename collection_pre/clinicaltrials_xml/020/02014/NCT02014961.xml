	<brief_summary>Quest for modifier genes associated with ventricular arrhythmias in presence of a cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A-delPhe1617) mutation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Worm Study: Modifier Genes in Sudden Cardiac Death</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a large Dutch SCN5A founder population with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, the investigators aim to identify genetic modifiers by means of whole-exome sequencing and to establish a comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlation, focussing on clinical and cellular electrophysiological characteristics and neurocardiac modulation.</detailed_description>
