	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess whether the clinical management of patients with recent acute-onset chest pain without acute coronary syndrome may be optimized by a combined coronary CT angiography (CTA) + CT myocardial perfusion (CTP) guided, rapid diagnostic strategy as compared to CTA alone. CT diagnostic evaluation and potential referral for invasive testing will be performed within 2 weeks after hospital discharge. The following main hypothesis will be tested: - Combined assessment of coronary anatomy and myocardial perfusion using 320 MDCT results in a safe and optimized, cost-effective invasive treatment strategy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MATERIAL - Consecutive patients referred with chest pain in whom acute coronary syndrome has been excluded, yet with a maintained clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease will be included in the study. Only patients deemed clinically suited for subsequent invasive evaluation and treatment will be included. METHODS -If the patients accept participation in the trial a computerized 1:1 randomization for CTA alone (control group) or CTA and CTP combined (intervention group) within 2 weeks from discharge will be conducted. CT angiography and CT myocardial perfusion imaging will be performed using a 320-slice MSCT Toshiba VISION Edition Aquilion One scanner according to recommendations from the vendor and clinical routine developed at Rigshospitalet. Based on CTA and/or CTP findings patients will be referred for invasive evaluation including fractional flow reserve assessment (FFR) and treatment within 30 days. Invasive procedures will be performed according to international guidelines and the frequency of revascularization procedures recorded. Clinical outcome data according to specified secondary endpoints will be recorded from hospital charts and medical registries.</detailed_description>
