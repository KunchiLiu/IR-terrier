	<brief_summary>Dry eye is a very common condition that most often affects women and the elderly, and can be caused when the eyes do not produce enough tears, or when the tears evaporate too quickly. Although there isn't a simple cure for dry eye, there are numerous products on the market that attempt to help relieve some of the discomfort caused by this condition. Some of these products include artificial tears, omega-3 supplements, and/or anti-inflammatory medications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a combination of TheraTears® products, and to compare them with the product(s) you have been using.</brief_summary>

Has an average noninvasive tear breakup time ≤ 5.00 seconds in at least one eye. 1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study; 2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection and/or allergies; * For the purposes of study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are typical findings and are not considered active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active. 3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study outcome variable; 4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study outcome variable; 5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study; 6. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrollment, as determined verbally; 7. Is aphakic; 8. Has undergone refractive error surgery; 9. Has taken part in another (pharmaceutical) research study within the last 30 days; 10. Has worn contact lenses within the past 5 years; 11.
