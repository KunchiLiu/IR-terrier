	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) will provide a more efficient method of treating neonates with dysfunctional oral feeding such as dysphagia. This study will attempt to determine if NMES applied to neonates at 36-42 weeks post-conception age (PCA) will decrease the need for nasogastric tubes (NG) and gastrostomy tubes (G-TUBE). Increase the rate at which these neonates complete full oral feeds, improve their swallowing skills, increase oral intake of calories, and gain weight.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female. Meet diagnostic criteria for dysphagia symptoms using the NOMAS and a VFSS. Infants with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and hypoxic events can be included. Infants taking less than 510% of target volume by mouth between the ages of 3642 weeks PCA. Multiple swallows to clear bolus following suck that includes a desaturation &lt;80% and bradycardia &lt;80 bpm. Apnea spells during feeds. Aspiration or penetration by VFSS Known neurologic or neurodegenerative disorders. Chromosomal anomalies and syndromes. Cleft lip or palate. Birth defects. Unresolved cutaneous rash at the area of electrode placement. Medical condition that is a contraindication to NMES.</criteria>
