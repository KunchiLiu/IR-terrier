	<detailed_description>The trial consists of 12 weeks of therapy that is divided into two sections. In the first 6-week section patients receive treatment with either TNI or BiPAP and in the second 6-week section treatment is changed. The starting therapy is allocated to the patients via randomisation and should be started directly after the baseline visit. The treatment and the follow-up period end with the second visit after the second treatment section and the patient decides which device he/she wants to use further.</detailed_description>
