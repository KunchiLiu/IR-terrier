	<brief_summary>This study is being done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors that are positive for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1): the hypothesis is that treatment with pembrolizumab will result in a clinically meaningful Overall Response Rate (ORR).</brief_summary>
