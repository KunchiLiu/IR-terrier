	<brief_summary>The study patients are patients suffering from primary or secondary immunodeficiencies investigated in the Hospital Necker for a suspected infectious disease. The study purpose is to assess the performance of a High Throughput Sequencing method, the PATHOQUEST method (from sample preparation to bio informatic analysis), versus the classic diagnostic approach. The study will evaluate the capacity of the PATHOQUEST method to detect pathogens responsible for an infectious disease episode and will also evaluate the delay of obtention of results compared to the classic diagnostic approach.</brief_summary>
