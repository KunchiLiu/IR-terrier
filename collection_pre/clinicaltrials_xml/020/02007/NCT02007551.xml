	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a psychosocial and nutritional intervention, entitled "RelAte", on cooking and mealtime behaviours of older adults who are living alone and at risk of social isolation. The intervention will be delivered in the home of participants by a trained volunteer of a similar age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the RelAte Mealtime Program as an Intervention to Treat Social Isolation and Improve Cooking Behaviour Among Older Adults Living Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial employs a randomised controlled trial design to evaluate the impact of a novel mealtime intervention for older adults who are living alone and may be at risk of social isolation. The intervention combines social interaction, cooking, and shared mealtime behaviour, as well as nutritional education, in a once-weekly, mealtime visit, delivered by a peer volunteer. RelAte is grounded in psychological theory. It is expected that the RelAte intervention will have a beneficial impact on self-efficacy and on energy intake among participants. As an additional point, we will be looking at whether the intervention also impacts on physical and mental health among older adults over time. RelAte involves sharing a mealtime with a trained peer volunteer once a week for 8 weeks, as well as sharing the cooking and food preparation associated with the meal. The one-to-one intervention comprises social, nutritional and cooking components, and can be described as a complex intervention. The intervention will run for 8 weeks and each participant will be matched with a peer volunteer for the duration. At baseline and at three follow-up points, participants will undergo a social cognitive, and nutritional assessment, as well as physical and mental health assessments, to ascertain whether the intervention has a lasting impact on defined primary outcomes. Participant outcomes will also be compared with the control group to assess the impact of the intervention. Volunteers will also undergo an assessment to investigate whether being a volunteer in an intervention has positive impact on psychological wellbeing and social connectedness. Primarily the intention is to improve self-efficacy and energy intake among older adults, thus maintaining or improving general functioning, rather than treating an existing condition or syndrome. Thus the intervention aims to optimise functioning in older adults rather than to treat a pre-existing condition.</detailed_description>
