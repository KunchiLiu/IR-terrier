	<brief_summary>To assess the feasibility of donor-derived interferon (IFN)-γ positive select-ed virus-specific T-cells using the cytokine capture system® (CCS) and the safety of subsequent infusion in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with treatment refractory post-transplant viral infections. The CCS has already been successfully used in clinical studies in Germany and United Kingdom (UK).</brief_summary>
