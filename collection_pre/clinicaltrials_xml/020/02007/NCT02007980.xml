	<brief_title>Indwelling Stent Discoloration Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to identify the root cause for the significant discolouration of Boston Scientific Percuflex based stents observed in some patients, particularly those from Japan. We will also test and compare them to stents from Canadian patients. Furthermore, we will determine whether the discolouration promotes bacterial adhesion and/or encrustation of the stent.</detailed_description>
