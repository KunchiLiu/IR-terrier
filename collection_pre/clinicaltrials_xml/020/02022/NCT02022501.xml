	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Safety Study of DE-120 Injectable Solution for Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, dose-escalating, sequential-cohort study of DE-120 injectable solution administered in 9, and up to 12, subjects with late stage exudative age-related macular degeneration. Three cohorts of 3 subjects will receive a single intravitreal injection in the study eye. Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive a single intravitreal injection of Low Dose DE-120 injectable solution in the study eye and will be evaluated through Visit 5 (Month 1). If the Low Dose is considered to be safe, the next higher dose will be administered to Cohort 2. The same enrollment and safety review procedures will be followed for Cohort 2 (Medium Dose DE-120) and Cohort 3 (High Dose DE-120).</detailed_description>
