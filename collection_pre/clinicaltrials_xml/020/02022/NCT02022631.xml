	<brief_summary>The investigators will conduct a parallel two-armed, non-inferiority randomized trial comparing new alternative formats of summary of findings tables (SoF) tables with current formats. The investigators will contact Cochrane review users by email and will ask them to fill a questionnaire developed using the "Survey Monkey" online system. The survey will include questions about baseline information (demographic characteristics, background, number of visits to the Cochrane Library, familiarity with the GRADE system, etc.). Then, participants will be stratified (health professional, guideline developer, researcher) and randomly assigned to one of the two SoF table formats, either the alternative (Table A) or the current one (Table C). Participants will be asked to answer questions to determine understanding, accessibility, and satisfaction with the formats to which they were randomized. Finally, the investigators will show them the table format to which they were not initially allocated in order to test their preference for either one.</brief_summary>
