	<brief_summary>This is a single centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study, in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of laninamivir octanoate administered by inhalation via the TwinCaps® DPI will be assessed in adults with mild or moderate chronic asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Inhaled Laninamivir Octanoate TwinCaps® DPI in Adults With Chronic Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>32 subjects, as two sequential groups of 16 subjects at each dose level (40 mg and 80 mg), will be randomised 3:1 to receive active drug or matching placebo. Males and females aged 18 to 65 years inclusive, with mild or moderate chronic asthma. Stratum 1: Mild asthma - requiring treatment consistent with Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 2 Stratum 2: Moderate asthma - requiring treatment consistent with GINA Step 3 Following a screening period of up to 30 days, eligible consenting subjects will be admitted to the clinic on the morning of Day 1. Laninamivir octanoate will be administered on Day 1. Subjects will remain in the clinic until Day 3 and will return for subsequent outpatient visits on Day 5, Day 6 and Day 7. A final follow-up visit for safety evaluations will occur on Day 14 ± 1 (or at the time of premature discontinuation). Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 7 weeks.</detailed_description>

Female subjects of childbearing potential must be practising true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (Periodic abstinence, e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception), or be using and willing to continue using a medically acceptable form of birth control for at least 1 month prior to screening (at least 3 months for hormonal contraceptives) and for at least 1 month after the last study drug administration 12. Male subjects of reproductive potential who are not truly abstinent must be using and willing to continue using medically acceptable contraceptive precautions from screening and for at least 1 month after the last study drug administration 13.

Must provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of any protocolspecific procedures 1. A history of a lifethreatening asthma exacerbation that required intubation and mechanical ventilation 2. History of severe asthma exacerbation in the last year that required the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension or injection) 3. Hospitalization or a visit to ER because of asthma in the last year 4. Intensive care admission for asthma in the previous 5 years 5. Any clinically significant abnormalities on clinical chemistry, haematology, or urinalysis, as judged by the investigator (at screening and/or Day 1) 6. Clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination, medical history, 12lead ECG, or vital signs, as judged by the investigator (at screening or predose Day 1) 7. A QTcF &gt;430 msec for male subjects and &gt;450 msec for female subjects on ECG at screening or predose Day 1 8. History or presence of any clinically significant illness (e.g., cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, oncologic, musculoskeletal, or psychiatric) or any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the study results 9.
