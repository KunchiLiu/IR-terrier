	<brief_title>Trigger Point Injections and Pelvic Rehabilitation for the Treatment of Pelvic Floor Myalgia and Sexual Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic floor pain may be treated with trigger point injections with medications (steroids and local anesthetics) that are FDA approved for injection into muscles. The alternative is a noninvasive treatment option using pelvic rehabilitation which involves vaginal muscle massage. Both treatment options have been used and reported; however, rapidity of improvement and return to normal sexual function have not been assessed. This study assigns patients to either treatment option randomly and the sexual function is assessed based on standardized sexual function questionnaires as well as pain ratings.</detailed_description>
