	<brief_summary>Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is sufficient for triggering final oocyte maturation in GnRH antagonist protocol and can significantly reduce incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in high-risk patients. However, lower oocyte yield was reported in patients with lower luteinizing hormone (LH) level post trigger with single injection of GnRH agonist, which might be related to the shorter duration and lower amount of LH induced by GnRH agonist. Our aim is to study repeated injection of GnRH agonist for preventing OHSS and maintaining clinical outcome in high risk patients who receive controlled ovarian stimulation in GnRH antagonist protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repeated Injection of GnRH Agonist to Reduce Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a prospective cohort study of all women attending the Center for Reproductive Medicine, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Nanfang Hospital, affiliated with Southern Medical University for in vitro fertilization and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection . Women at high risk of OHSS who received IVF and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment with a flexible GnRH antagonist protocol were recruited to participate in this study. All patients underwent standard ovarian stimulation protocol with gonadotropins, standard individualized adjustment of medication dose, and standard egg retrieval procedure. Patients were triggered with a single bolus of 0.2 mg triptorelin at night and had second injection of 0.2 mg triptorelin 12 hours later when the criteria for administration of the ovulation trigger were met.</detailed_description>
