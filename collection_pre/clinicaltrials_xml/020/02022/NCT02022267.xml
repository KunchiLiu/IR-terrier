	<brief_title>Gait Analysis in Ponseti Clubfoot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a minimum age of three years from a prospective, consecutive database of patients with clubfoot treated with the Ponseti method beginning in 2002 are considered for this study. Thereby patients will typically have a follow up of nearly three to eight years after initial clubfoot correction. Patients with unilateral or bilateral idiopathic clubfoot are included. Patients with clubfoot associated with syndromes or neurological diseases, with mild clubfoot that required fewer than three casts for initial correction, who first presented at an age older than three months, who were living outside of the country, and who were initially treated elsewhere with more than three casts are excluded. An invitation letter to participate in the study was sent out at the end of 2011, with a second letter being sent out three months after the first. After the second letter patients had a time frame of three more months to participate before the study was closed. To comprise a control group for the purpose of collecting gait analysis data of healthy children, employees of our hospital are asked to allow their children to participate in this study. Each patient will be physically examined, active and passive range of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint will be measured with a hand-held goniometer. Ability to walk on the heels and on tiptoes will be recorded. The disease-specific instrument questionnaire, which will be blinded for the treating physician will be handed out to fill in. Patients will undergo gait analysis, including video recordings with a Vicon motion capture system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) with kinetic data collected from three AMTI force plates (Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown, MA). Placement of markers will be a combination of Cleveland (lower extremity), PlugInGait (upper body), and Oxford Foot (movement within the foot) models.</detailed_description>
