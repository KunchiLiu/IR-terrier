	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Deep Brain stimulation (DBS) on walking in patients with Parkinson's disease that have had DBS. While DBS improves Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms and walking in many patients in some of the patients walking problems persist. This study aims to find out what are the best stimulation parameters of the DBS in order to improve walking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation Effects on Gait and Balance in Patients With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson disease (PD) is defined by the presence of a resting tremor, slowness, stiffness and problems with balance and walking. Gait disorder in Parkinson's disease is common and has a greater impact on quality of life. Currently, carbidopa-levodopa and Deep Brain Stimulation are the only treatments available for gait impairment. This study is meant to see if there is improvement in gait or freezing of gait are seen after changes in the stimulation parameters. Subjects will be randomly assigned to four different stimulation parameters: both stimulators on (BL ON), both stimulators off (BL OFF), right stimulator on (R ON), left stimulator on (L ON). The investigators will assess your gait using a clinical scales as well as wearable sensors attached to your body. Assessments will be done one hour after each change in the stimulation parameters. Gait will be studied using wireless sensors attached to the ankles and wrists to determine speed, stride length and turning time.</detailed_description>
