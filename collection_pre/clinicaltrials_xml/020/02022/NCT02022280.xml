	<brief_summary>In this randomized controlled crossover study, the investigators propose to test the hypothesis that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is a marker of endothelial dysfunction. The authors propose to evaluate ADMA concentrations and vascular function analysis in healthy volunteers and adults with a history of cardiovascular disease given PPI vs placebo for four weeks each.</brief_summary>
