	<brief_summary>The investigators preliminary data suggests that FOLFOX-A may have equal or superior activity as compared to FOLFIRINOX and appears to be better tolerated. Therefore, FOLFOX-A may be a better regimen in the adjuvant setting for patients with resected pancreatic cancer. This protocol will obtain preliminary data on safety and disease-free and overall survival following administration of FOLFOX-A for patients with resected pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic proof of primary pancreas invasive adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous cancer, managed with a potentially curative resection (i.e., removal of all gross tumor). Patients with invasive adenocarcinoma that also contains a component of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) are eligible. Interval between definitive tumorrelated surgery and registration between 2170 days. Patients will be staged according to the 6th edition AJCC staging system with pathologic stage T13, N01, M0 being eligible. Post resection serum CA199 ≤ 180 units/mL within 21 days of registration on study. Preexisting neuropathy &lt; grade 1 (per CTCAE). ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Age ≥ 18 Not pregnant and not nursing. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 7 days prior to beginning of treatment. Postmenopausal women (surgical menopause of lack of menses &gt;12 months) do not need to have a pregnancy test, please document status. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must use an effective contraception method during treatment and for three months after completing treatment. Required Initial Laboratory Values: Neutrophils ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST (SGOT) &amp; ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatases &lt; 2.5x ULN Abdominal CT scan with contrast and chest CT/xray (CT of chest preferred) within 6 weeks of registration on study. Patients can have PET/MRI of the chest/abdomen instead. Patients with serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems such that the investigator considers it unsafe for the patient to receive FOLFOXA Prior hypersensitivity to Oxaliplatin or Abraxane that in the investigators opinion would put the patient at risk if reexposed Patients with islet cell (neuroendocrine) tumors, cystadenomas, cystadenocarcinomas, carcinoid tumors, duodenal carcinomas, distal bile duct, and ampullary carcinomas. Prior systemic chemotherapy for pancreas cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable. Patients must not have received chemotherapy for a year prior to registering on study No prior invasive malignancy within the prior two years. However, patients with an early stage malignancy that is not expected to require treatment in the next 2 years (such as early stage, resected breast cancer or asymptomatic prostate cancer) are eligible. This must be documented.</criteria>
