	<brief_title>Study of Convection-Enhanced, Image-Assisted Delivery of Liposomal-Irinotecan In Recurrent High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High grade gliomas (HGG) are the most common brain tumor in adults, with 15,000 new cases/year in the USA. Despite progress made using combination therapies including surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, the treatment of HGG remains challenging with a typical median survival of 6-12 months for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GB) and 24-36 months for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. The time to tumor progression of patients with recurrent GBM is nine weeks and the median survival is 25 weeks, while for recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), the time to tumor progression is 13 weeks and the median survival is 47 weeks. More recently, single-agent Avastin has been seen to improve 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) to 42.6% as well as increase Median Overall Survival to 9.3 months in patients with recurrent GBM. However, chemotherapy treatment for malignant gliomas has limitations given the low activity of available antineoplastic agents, the emergence or de-novo presence of resistance to such agents, the sensitivity of the brain to irreversible damage from a therapeutic modality, and the compromised delivery of these agents to partially privileged intracranial sites. Effective agents with novel mechanisms of action need to be evaluated in HGG which account for these limitations. With these limitations in mind, this study directs attention to two particularly appealing delivery modalities which may improve the efficacy of neuro-oncologic chemotherapeutic agents: liposomes (liposomal irinotecan) and convection enhanced delivery (CED). Liposomes are typically composed of double chain phospholipid amphiphiles (chemical compounds with combined hydrophilic and lipophilic properties) in combination with cholesterol, forming spheroidal bilayer membrane structures that encompass an aqueous internal domain. Based on structural/pharmacologic features, distinct liposome classes have been developed to package various therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. From the circulating bloodstream, liposomes are able to diffuse across the blood brain barrier (BBB) due to their lipophilic characteristics. An example is liposomal irinotecan which may reduce the toxicity of irinotecan to healthy tissues while maintaining or increasing its anti-tumor potency. CED improves chemotherapeutic delivery to brain tumors intraparenchymally by utilizing bulk flow, or fluid convection, established as a result of a pressure gradient, rather than a concentration gradient. As such, CED offers markedly improved distribution of infused therapeutics within the central nervous system (CNS) compared to direct injection or via drug eluting polymers, both of which depend on diffusion for parenchymal distribution. Additionally, CED obviates the challenges of systemic agents crossing the blood brain barrier while minimizing systemic exposure and toxicity. Through the maintenance of a pressure gradient from the delivery cannula tip to the surrounding tissues, CED is able to distribute small and large molecules, including high molecular weight proteins, to clinically significant target volumes centimeters rather than millimeters in diameter. Although developed independently, work combining the two delivery options, liposomes and CED, is presently underway in an effort to improve treatment efficacy in the treatment of CNS malignancies. This clinical trial is a step in this direction with a prospective, single-arm, open-label trial that delivers liposomal-irinotecan and gadolinium (which provided real time imaging of delivery) by CED in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Added to this logic is support from a recent preclinical study at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) which compared routes of delivery for liposomal irinotecan (CED versus IV) and showed superior anti-tumor activity of CED administration in treating mice with intracranial glioblastoma xenografts. In total, such results indicate that liposomal formulation plus direct intratumoral administration of therapeutic are important for maximizing the anti-tumor effects of irinotecan and support the current clinical trial evaluation of this therapeutic plus CED route of administration combination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with radiographically proven recurrent, intracranial high grade glioma will be eligible for this protocol. Patients must have evidence of tumor progression as determined by the Revised Assessment in NeuroOncology RANO criteria following standard therapy. High grade glioma includes glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), Gliosarcoma (GS), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant astrocytoma not otherwise specified. (NOS) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must be performed within 21 days prior to enrollment, and patients who are receiving steroids must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to imaging. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and enrollment, a new baseline MRI is required. Patients must have completed only 1 prior course of radiation therapy and must have experienced an interval of greater than 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry. Patients will be eligible if the original histology was lowgrade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a high grade glioma is made. There is no limit as to the number of prior treatments but patients must have radiographic evidence of progressive disease Recurrent tumor must be a solid, single, supratentorial, contrastenhancing HGG which conforms to the following volume according to the relevant treatment group Group Tumor volume 1 14 cm3 2 14 cm3 3 25 cm3 4 26 cm3 All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study. Patients must be registered prior to treatment with study drug. Patients must be&gt; 18 years old, and with a life expectancy &gt; 8 weeks Patients with Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 70.
