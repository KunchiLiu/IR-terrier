	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety Study of Ticagrelor in Hemodialysis Patients and Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single dose, randomised, open label, parallel group study conducted in the US to examine the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of ticagrelor in ESRD subjects on HD compared with healthy subjects with normal renal function. Up to a total of 30 male and female adult subjects aged 18 to 80 years (inclusive) with a weight of at least 50 kg and a body mass index between 18 and 40 kg/m2 (inclusive), will be dosed to assure that there will be 20 evaluable subjects (10 subjects on HD and in 10 healthy subjects with normal renal function (CrCL ≥90 mL/min). The normal renal function groups should have a similar distribution with respect to age, weight and gender. Subjects will be required to have an inpatient stay from the day prior to dosing until the 48-hour post-dose time-point to ensure that all PK samples are collected at the appropriate timepoints. The study will be conducted in two groups: Group A consisting of ESRD subjects on HD, Group B consisting of healthy subjects. A crossover design will be implemented for Group A subjects as follows: Group A subjects will be randomized into two sequences, Sequence 1 and Sequence 2. In Sequence 1, subjects will receive treatment A in Period 1 and treatment B in Period 2. There will be washout period of at least 7 days between Period 1 and Period 2 in Sequence 1. Similarly in Sequence 2, subjects will receive treatment B in Period 1 and treatment A in Period 2. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between Period 1 and Period 2 in Sequence 2 as well. Treatment A and treatment B are defined as follows: Treatment A: subjects will be dosed with an oral 90 mg ticagrelor tablet 1 day following the dialysis session but 2 days before the next dialysis session; • Treatment B: subjects will be dosed with an oral 90 mg ticagrelor tablet just prior to dialysis session.(NB: Treatment B dosing should occur within 5 minutes of dialysis start). Group B subjects (healthy subjects) with normal renal function (CrCL of ≥ 90 mL/min) will receive just an oral 90 mg ticagrelor referred to as treatment H. All doses will be administered in an open-label design.</detailed_description>

History of alcohol, drug, or substance abuse within the past year Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as judged by the investigator. Increased bleeding risk including GI bleeding in past 30 days; history of intracranial, retroperitoneal, or spinal bleeding, recent major trauma within 30 days of dosing, Sustained uncontrolled hypertension, history of hemorrhagic disorders. Pregnant or lactating females, or females of childbearing potential (ie, those who are not chemically or surgically sterilised or who are not postmenopause) who are not willing to use a medically accepted method of contraception that is considered reliable in the judgment of the investigator throughout the duration of the study OR females who have a positive pregnancy test at Visit 1.</criteria>
