	<brief_summary>Patients with head and neck cancer who underwent irradiation have a higher risk of developing severe carotid stenosis, and eventually develop to transient ischemic attack or stroke. However, it's still not clear whether early intervene in vascular risk factors is benefit for patients after radiotherapy. Our study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of atorvastatin for preventing NPC patients after radiotherapy from severe carotid stenosis. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, about 324 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients will be enrolled from six centers in Guangdong Province and randomized 1:1 to atorvastatin group or placebo group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atorvastatin in Preventing Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients Receiving Radiotherapy From Carotid Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, about 324 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients will be enrolled from six centers in Guangdong Province and randomized 1:1 to atorvastatin group (20mg per night, totally 2 years) or placebo group. All Patients will be followed up for 2 years. Ultrasound and Transcranial Color Doppler (TCD) will be used to evaluate the changes of intima-media thickness (IMT) and occurrence of plaque formation of carotid arteries. Safety will be monitored every 6 months.</detailed_description>
