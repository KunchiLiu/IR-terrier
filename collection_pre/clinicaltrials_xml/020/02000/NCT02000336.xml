	<brief_summary>Although cortisone is widely used in the treatment of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, the best dosage is not known. Therefore we will compare two standard prednisolon starting dosages and placebo in the treatment of patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis on the background of the established therapy with methotrexate. In total 450 patients will be included into the study. Two different treatment arms starting with 10 or 60 mg of prednisolone, and one placebo arm. Duration of intervention is 12 weeks. In parallel, all patients start medication with methotrexate, usual dosage 15 mg/week. Primary efficacy endpoint is progression of radiographic damage after one year compared to baseline. Safety monitoring is performed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Effectiveness of Two Different Dosages of Cortisone Compared to Placebo in Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Although glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used in the treatment of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the best dosage for GCs, related to both, efficacy and safety, is not known. OBJECTIVE: To compare two standard p.o. GC starting dosages and the non-use of GCs in the treatment of patients with early active RA on the background of the established 'anchor' therapy with methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with two treatment arms (starting with 10 or 60 mg of p.o. prednisolone (P), tapered down to 5 mg P per day within 8 weeks) and one placebo arm, each arm comprising 150 patients. Duration of intervention is 12 weeks. In parallel, all patients start medication with MTX, usual dosage 15 mg/week. Primary efficacy endpoint is progression of radiographic damage after one year compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints are: percentage of patients in remission, changes of functional capacity etc. Safety monitoring is performed. The analysis is performed in three hierarchical steps. First step is an analysis of covariance to compare the group with an initial P dosage of 60 mg (V60) and the placebo group (Pl). In case of a statistical significant result (α = 0.05), a comparison of the group starting with 10 mg P (V10) and Pl will be done in a second step (α = 0.05). In case of superiority of V10 versus Pl, a third step will be a non-inferiority test for V10 versus V60 (α = 0.025).</detailed_description>
