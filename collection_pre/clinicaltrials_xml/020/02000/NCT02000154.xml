	<brief_summary>This is an extension study study to investigate long term safety of SyB L-1101 when administered intravenously every 4 weeks to the patients who have completed 8 cycles in the study 2011005 whose purpose is to investigate tolerability of SyB L-1101 when administered intravenously in patients with recurrent/relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome. Antitumor effects will also be investigated in this study.</brief_summary>
