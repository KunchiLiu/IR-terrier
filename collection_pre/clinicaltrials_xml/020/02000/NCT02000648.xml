	<brief_title>Real-life Management and Therapeutic Outcome of Patients With Chronic Rhinitis and Chronic Urticaria in Thailand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients presenting with symptoms of chronic rhinitis for at least 12 consecutive or non-consecutive weeks per years or symptoms of chronic urticaria for at least 6 weeks will be asked to complete the case report forms asking for details of symptom characteristics, risk factors, personal habits, underlying diseases, and quality of life at the first visit. Investigation results, final diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions will also be recorded by the responsible allergist. On every follow-up appointment, patient symptoms, aggravating factors, medication use and side effects will be completed by patients. New findings, associated diseases, and prescriptions will be completed by allergist. The unfilled variables by patients will be asked in the following visit. Any "non-reported" variables those are unable to retrieve will be treated as missing data for data analysis. The estimated sample size is about 200 new cases per year. Patient demographic data, clinical presentations, and associated diseases will be reported. The association between clinical characteristics and quality of life will be analyzed. The relationship between clinical manifestations and therapeutic outcomes will be determined.</detailed_description>
