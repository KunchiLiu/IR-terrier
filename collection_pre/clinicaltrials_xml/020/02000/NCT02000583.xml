	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn about the possible benefits of aerobic exercise in controlling or reducing the amount of amyloid present in the brain, reducing changes in brain structure that may lead to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and increasing cognitive ability in individuals that have amyloid deposits and are at risk to develop AD.</brief_summary>
