	<brief_summary>Vaginal packing is used routinely following vaginal reconstructive surgery. Despite little data to support the practice, purported benefits include reduced pelvic fluid accumulation or blood loss. Patients often complain of discomfort associated with the packing or its removal. This randomized controlled trial seeks to document differences in subjective impressions of pain in women undergoing vaginal repairs treated with and without packing. The investigators also aim to assess differences in postoperative fluid collection in those with and without packing.</brief_summary>
