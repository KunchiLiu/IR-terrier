	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized pilot study to assess the applicability of the Weight Watchers model for lifestyle modification to the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. The approach developed by Weight Watchers to achieve weight loss is based on similar nutritional principals and techniques used in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention; monitoring food intake, exercising calorie control, setting modest weight loss goals and using physical activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing the Effectiveness of a Weight Watchers-based Lifestyle Intervention for the Primary Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the proposed study, the standard Weight Watchers program will serve as the base curriculum. Persons with increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes will be exposed to an initial "orientation session" designed to frame the rationale for participation in the program and to encourage attendance to a core series of sessions. This orientation session will reinforce the pre-diabetes status of participants and present the rationale for lifestyle modification as a means to reduce diabetes risk. In addition, this session will highlight the recommended sessions and topics that are needed to help reduce risk. In many respects it mirrors the curriculum content used in the DPP with regards to themes and specific topics. There are significant differences, however, between the two approaches that warrant investigation. Weight Watchers uses a point system to help users select appropriate foods. This system is less focused on fat gram control as a central theme than was the case with the DPP. More importantly, it uses an "open visit" system in which users get a core set of materials for home review that is then reviewed in facilitated group sessions. In this regard, the group session content is not configured as a sequential series of sessions delivered in a specific order, as was the case with the DPP. Moreover, participants can rejoin groups at any time that they choose. Weight Watchers also provides a sophisticated set of support materials online, using both phone apps (to help users track food consumption and "points" used) and a website program. The open attendance feature and the availability of online support should, in theory, facilitate long-term adherence.</detailed_description>
