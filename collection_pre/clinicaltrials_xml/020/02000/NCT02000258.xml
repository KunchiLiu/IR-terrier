	<brief_summary>Purpose: To find out whether the clinical and MRI findings two years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction were associated with each other so that MRI-based graft invisibility in the anteromedial (AM) graft would have an impact on anteroposterior stability of the knee, and MRI-based posterolateral (PL) graft invisibility on rotational stability of the knee. Methods: 75 patients. One experienced orthopaedic surgeon performed all double-bundle (DB) ACL reconstructions. Two independent examiners made the clinical examinations at the two-year follow-up: clinical examination of the knee, KT-1000, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm knee evaluation scores and IKDC functional score. The MRI evaluations were made by two musculoskeletal radiologists separately and the means of these measurements were used.</brief_summary>
