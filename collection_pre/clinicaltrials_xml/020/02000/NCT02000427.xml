	<brief_summary>This study seeks adult subjects with R/R Ph+ B-precursor ALL. This is a single-arm Simon II stage design, multicenter study consisting of a screening period, an induction treatment period (2 cycles of blinatumomab), a consolidation treatment period (up to 3 additional cycles of blinatumomab for applicable subjects), and a safety follow-up visit 30 days after treatment. Following the safety follow-up visit, subjects will be followed for response duration and survival every 3 months for 18 months or death, whichever occurs first.</brief_summary>
