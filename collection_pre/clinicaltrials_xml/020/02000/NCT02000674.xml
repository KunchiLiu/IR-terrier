	<brief_title>Succinylcholine vs Rocuronium for Prehospital Emergency Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All adult patients with spontaneous cardiac activity and requiring tracheal intubation in the pre hospital emergency context will be included. All intubation will be performed by an emergency physician or a nurse specialized in anesthesia. For patients with spontaneous cardiac activity, rapid sequence intubation will be performed to allow intubation. Comparisons studied will be : Intubation success rate at the first laryngoscopy, glottis exposure assessed by Cormack and Lehane classification, difficult intubation rate assessed by the Intubation Difficult Score (IDS), the conditions of intubation assessed by the Copenhagen score, the need for alternative airway techniques and the immediate post intubation complications rate as vomiting, dental trauma, pulmonary inhalation, arterial desaturation , hypotension episodes and cardiac arrest occurrence.</detailed_description>
