	<brief_summary>The lysosome is a specialized part of the cell that functions to degrade metabolic wastes in the cell. Defects in the functioning of the lysosome result in accumulation and subsequent storage of such metabolic wastes. These defects lead to conditions known as lysosomal storage diseases (LSD). LSDs are caused by inherited genetic mutations and there are over 40 genetically distinct lysosomal storage diseases. Within each specific lysosomal storage disease there are variances in severity of disease, age of onset, and clinical presentation. Though the genetic mutations contributing to the disease have been largely clarified, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to variations in each distinct LSD remain unclear. With this study we intend to better understand at the cellular and molecular level how the accumulation and storage of metabolic wastes in the lysosome affect the clinical manifestation of LSDs, to detect changes in these mechanisms upon treatment administration, and to correlate these results to genetic information. The knowledge obtained from this research study could lead to better ways to diagnose and treat lysosomal storage diseases.</brief_summary>
