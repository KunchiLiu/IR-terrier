	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Registry will be to evaluate patient safety following Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) - (Equine) (BAT®) administration in adult and pediatric patients with a confirmed or suspected exposure to botulinum toxin. This Registry is intended to serve as an active surveillance system to further assess the safety profile for BAT® and to quantify the occurrence of unexpected adverse events, given that the current safety database is considered too small to reliably identify unexpected risks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BT-010 Registry for the Evaluation of Safety and Clinical Outcomes in Patients Treated With Botulinum Antitoxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: The primary objective of the Registry is to estimate the absolute risk (incidence rates) of hypersensitivity /allergic reactions, including serum sickness, febrile reactions, hemodynamic instability, bradycardia, and other serious adverse events in pediatric and adult patients who are administered Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) - (Equine) (BAT®). The secondary objectives of the Registry are to: - Evaluate the safety of BAT® used to treat patients with a confirmed or suspected exposure to botulinum toxin. - Collect and summarize clinical outcome information in patients treated with BAT®. - Validate the design of a patient Registry to be implemented in the event of a mass botulinum toxin exposure scenario. Subject Population: The base population will include all patients in the United States of America with a confirmed or suspected exposure to botulinum toxin who are treated with BAT®. There are no age or gender restrictions. Sample Size: The study size goal is enrollment of a minimum of 100 patients into the Registry during a 3-year recruitment period, including at least 10 pediatric patients under the age of 17-years. Enrollment into the Registry will be closed once the minimum sample size has been achieved or after 3-years, whichever occurs last. Registry Location: Any hospitals /facilities treating a patient with a confirmed or suspected exposure to botulinum toxin who was treated with BAT® from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Strategic National Stockpile or State stockpiles are eligible for participation. Registry Design: Noninterventional, retrospective, observational phase 4 patient Registry. All patients treated with BAT® will be asked to participate in the Registry; the data obtained aim to better define the absolute risk (incidence rates) of hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions, including serum sickness, febrile reactions, hemodynamic instability, bradycardia, and other serious adverse events in patients that are treated with BAT® due to a confirmed or suspected case of botulism. Clinical outcome data will be collected and summarized to further evaluate the safety of BAT®, in patients treated with BAT® due to a confirmed or suspected case of botulism. Assessments: Data will be collected from treating physicians and/or health care professionals involved in the care of BAT® treated patient(s) using Cangene's Botulism Case Report Forms; Form 1-Initial Case Report Form; Form 2-Follow-up Case Report Form. Form 1-Initial Case Report Form will collect baseline patient demographic information, including; treating physician(s) and facility; time and date (or presumed time and date) of exposure to botulinum toxin (if known), relevant medical history including neurologic impairment, respiratory and cardiac conditions, and known allergies; clinical signs of botulism at presentation; supportive care, intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation use; concomitant mediations; monitoring details pre- and post-BAT® infusion including occurrence of hypersensitivity /allergic reactions, febrile reactions, bradycardia, hemodynamic instability, anaphylaxis and/or serum sickness and information on inadvertent overdoses, medication errors or no drug effect whether or not it leads to an adverse event. Form 2-Follow-up Case Report Form will collect clinical outcome data including; discharge status, duration of hospitalization and intensive care, death (date and cause); diagnosis at discharge, confirmatory laboratory results for toxin type and source where available; occurrence of adverse events (including but not limited to blood borne infections, any serious labeled or unlabeled events and death),and concomitant mediations. All adverse events information reported will be reviewed by Cangene's Pharmacovigilance department. Data Analysis: The analysis will be descriptive and will include frequency tables to summarize the characteristics of patients in the Registry and details of exposure to botulinum toxin, clinical signs of botulism, and details of BAT® administration. Incidence rates of adverse reactions overall and by type of reaction (i.e., immediate hypersensitivity, delayed hypersensitivity) will be calculated as the incidence proportion with 95% confidence intervals for all patients treated with BAT® and stratified by final botulism diagnosis and by age. Clinical outcomes to be tabulated include duration of hospitalization, duration of intensive care unit stay and mechanical ventilation, clinical status at the time of hospital discharge, destination upon discharge, presence of residual disability at time of hospital discharge, death, and cause of death. Patients enrolled into the Registry will be stratified according to the time from exposure to BAT® administration: early treatment (≤2 days from symptom onset) or late treatment (&gt;2 days from symptom onset).</detailed_description>
