	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is to investigate three different methods of perineal skin closure during second-degree perineal wound repair and determine which method is associated with the least amount of patient pain. Null hypothesis: There will be no difference in patient pain among the three different methods for second degree perineal wound repair.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Promoting Optimal Healing After Laceration Repair Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the University of Michigan, there are currently two standard techniques for repairing second-degree perineal lacerations that differ only in management of the perineal skin : 1. Closure of the deep tissues and superficial perineal skin using a continuous 3-0 Vicryl suture 2. Closure of the deep tissues with a continuous 3-0 Vicryl suture and reapproximation of, but not suture-closure of the perineal skin. The primary goal of our study is to compare patient pain amongst the following three perineal skin repair techniques after second degree laceration: 1. Perineal skin closure with suturing 2. Not suturing the perineal skin 3. Closure of the perineal skin with n-Butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (IndermilÂ®) surgical glue. In all women, the deep vaginal and perineal tissues will be closed using a continuous 3-0 Vicryl suture, as is current standard practice. Aim: To assess and compare patient pain among the three groups at intervals of 1 day, 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months postpartum.</detailed_description>
