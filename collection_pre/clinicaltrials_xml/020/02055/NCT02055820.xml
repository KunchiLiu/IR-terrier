	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study of GDC-0199 administered orally in combination with MabThera/Rituxan (R) or obinutuzumab (G) and standard doses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and oral prednisone (CHOP) in patients with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL). Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms of GDC-0199 in combination with R-CHOP and G-CHOP. The study will consist of two stages, a dose-finding stage and an expansion stage. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GDC-0199 in combination with R-CHOP and G-CHOP will be determined during the dose-finding stage.</brief_summary>
