	<brief_summary>New effective non-surgical treatments are needed for patients whose obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) do not respond to current medical therapies. We propose a randomised controlled trial of Endobarrier, an implantable intestinal device that separates ingested food from contacting the first 60cm of intestine where sited and that mimics some of the clinical effects of bariatric surgery (improved metabolic control with weight loss) with or without continued use of the GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) Liraglutide 1.2mg vs Liraglutide 1.8mg without the device in obese patients with T2DM who remain with suboptimal glycaemic control despite current conventional diabetes treatment, in an NHS setting. Seventy-two patients with T2DM and obesity (HbA1c≥7.5%, BMI≥35kg/m2) despite previous GLP-1RA therapy will be studied over 24 months and randomised to receive Endobarrier with continued Liraglutide 1.2mg for 12 months; Endobarrier alone for 12 months; or Liraglutide 1.8mg without Endobarrier. We will investigate potential mechanisms of action and their time course as part of the study by repeated measures of: 1. insulin resistance measures, gut peptides, bile acids; 2. energy intake and nutritional composition; 3. liver fat stores, 4. intestinal inflammation and permeability measures. The data will inform clinical use of the device and development of new treatments for T2DM and obesity.</brief_summary>
