	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine (FLT)-positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in measuring early response in patients with metastatic solid tumors receiving treatment that blocks blood flow to the tumor. Diagnostic procedures, such as FLT-PET/MRI, may help measure a patient's response earlier during treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of FLT-PET/MRI for Early Response Monitoring to Anti-Angiogenic Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of FLT-PET/MRI for early prediction of treatment response in patients undergoing anti-angiogenic cancer treatment. II. To assess the test-retest reproducibility of PET biomarker (FLT) uptake using PET/MRI. III. To assess the test-retest reproducibility of quantification of MR sequences (multi-parametric MRI particularly related to tissue perfusion). IV. To assess the ability of PET/MRI to measure changes in PET biomarker (FLT) tumor uptake after initiation of therapy. V. To assess changes in qualitative morphologic imaging and quantitative functional MRI parameters after initiation of therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare early changes in PET biomarker (FLT) tumor uptake with treatment response assessed at completion of therapy (prediction of treatment response). II. To compare changes in MRI signal intensities (multi-parametric MRI) with treatment response assessed at completion of therapy. III. To compare results from multi-parametric MR imaging with FLT tumor uptake. IV. To assess combinations of quantitative PET and MRI metrics. OUTLINE: Patients undergo FLT-PET/MRI twice at baseline and once within 4 weeks after start of treatment.</detailed_description>
