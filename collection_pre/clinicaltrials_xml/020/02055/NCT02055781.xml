	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis of the study is that treatment with either once-daily or twice-daily pacritinib results in a greater proportion of patients with thrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis achieving ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to Week 24 than treatment with Best Available Therapy, and a greater proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in total symptom score from baseline to Week 24 as measured by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form 2.0.</brief_summary>
