	<brief_summary>This study will be a single-center, open-label, drug-drug interaction study in healthy male and female subjects. The study will consist of 3 parts: A, B, and C. In Part A, the effect of itraconazole or rifampin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of E2609 and metabolites will be assessed. Approximately 32 subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (itraconazole or rifampin) in equal numbers, with approximately 16 subjects per group. In Part B, the effects of steady-state dosing of E2609 on the PK of digoxin will be assessed in approximately 18 subjects. In Part C, the effects of donepezil administered in combination with, or 2 hours after, E2609 dosing on the PK of E2609 and metabolites, will be assessed in approximately 24 subjects.</brief_summary>
