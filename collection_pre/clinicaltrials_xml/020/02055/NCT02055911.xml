	<brief_title>Retinal Ganglion Cell Function After Intravitreous Ranibizumab in Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Ranibizumab can be a safe treatment for diabetic macular edema regarding maintenance of retinal ganglion cell function after repeated intravitreal injections. - To evaluate the safety of intravitreal ranibizumab repeated injections in patients with diabetic macular edema regarding maintenance of retinal ganglion cell function. - The primary endpoint for the study will be the changes in full-field and focal macular photopic negative response (PhRN) amplitude (in ÂµV) over time, from baseline to month 12.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients, older than 18 years, who have signed an informed consent. Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus and prior diagnosis of diabetic macular edema (DME), who had not undergone any previous treatment, either pharmacological or laser photocoagulation. Patients with visual impairment due to DME whom, in the opinion of the investigator, would benefit from treating with IVR. Known hypersensitivity to ranibizumab or any of its components. Previous participation in any clinical studies of investigational drugs within 1 month Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means, UNLESS they are using two birth control methods. The two methods can be a double barrier method or a barrier method plus a hormonal method. Adequate barrier methods of contraception include: diaphragm, condom (by the partner), intrauterine device (copper or hormonal), sponge or spermicide. Hormonal contraceptives include any marketed contraceptive agent that includes an estrogen and/or a progestational agent. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.
