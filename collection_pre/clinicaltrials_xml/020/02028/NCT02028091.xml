	<brief_title>Diabetes Mellitus - A Diagnosis Trial by Means of Non Invasive Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus related vascular alterations are associated with an increased risk of hypertonia, atherosclerosis, neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and further more. Increased vascular rigidity, which is based on the increased stiffness of vessels caused by vascular damage leads to an increase of pulse wave velocity. This assumption is based on the Moens-Korteweg-equation which is calculated using the modus of arterial vessel elasticity, arterial vessel wall thickness, the arterial radius and blood viscosity.</detailed_description>
