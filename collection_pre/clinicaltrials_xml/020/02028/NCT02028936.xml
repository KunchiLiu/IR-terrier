	<brief_summary>Many epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested the negative effect of oxidative stress ( = attack of cell components by free radicals) on the cardiovascular risk, notably in patients with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, diabetes or obesity and smokers. Polyphenols, notably those present in red grapes, have a certain antioxidant effect. Dietary supplementation with polyphenols in high-risk patients could diminish the harmful consequences of oxidative stress. The aim of this study is to show that the daily consumption of grape juice rich in polyphenols " R@isol ", has a positive impact on the oxidation/antioxidation balance in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
