	<brief_summary>Introduction: Recently it has involved the role of TLR (toll-like receptors) in the pathogenesis of asthma. TLRs are a family of proteins responsible for the recognition of Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patters (PAMPs). The possible role that TLRs play in IgE-dependent asthma (not eosinophilic) and its recognition as a new endotype asthma, could open new therapeutic expectations. Objective: To analyze the expression of TLR 2 and 4 in monocytes/ macrophages and neutrophils in peripheral blood and induced sputum from asthmatic patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expression of Toll-Like Receptors 2 and 4 in Asthmatic Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators studied patients with asthma. All patients underwent the same day an induced sputum, pulmonary function studies, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, blood total IgE and skin test by prick technique. Asthmatic patients were classified according to the criteria of the GINA 2012. The cellular composition was analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 were analyzed using monoclonal antibodies conjugated with fluorochromes appropriate.</detailed_description>
