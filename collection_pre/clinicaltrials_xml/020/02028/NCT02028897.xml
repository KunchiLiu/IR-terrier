One group will be cultured conventionally in oil-covered droplets in dishes. The other group will be assigned to an enclosed system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Alternative Embryo Culture Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Qualifying and consenting IVF patients will have approximately half of their developing embryos cultured in droplets covered with oil. The other approximate half of their embryos will be cultured in small enclosed containers. Embryo assignments will be at random. Regardless of culture system, all embryos will be cultured from the bipronuclear stage to the blastocyst stage in the same (Global) media, without the usual refreshing of media on day 3.</detailed_description>
