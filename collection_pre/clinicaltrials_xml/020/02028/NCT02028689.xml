	<brief_summary>This study will assess the potential effects of lesinurad on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of metformin and furosemide in healthy, adult male subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin and Furosemide Drug-Drug Interaction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leinurad is a weak in vitro inhibitor of the hepatic transporter OCT1 and the renal transporters OAT1 and OAT3 (OAT1/3). To assess the clinical relevance of these in vitro findings, this clinical study will evaluate the effect of lesinurad on the PK of metformin (OCT1 substrate) and furosemide (OAT1/3 substrate).</detailed_description>
