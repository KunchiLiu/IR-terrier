	<brief_summary>1. Background - Advanced guidewires with a U-shaped tip could effectively cross the long or multi-occlusive segment smoothly and go into the distal outflow vessel. - The guidewire looping technique is a safe and effective method for the recanalization of the occluded lesions in infrapopliteal vessels. 2. Objective - To compare the performance a loop-tipped guidewire with a straight-tipped guidewire in achieving successful deep biliary cannulation. 3. Design - Prospective randomized trial. 4. Setting: - Tertiary-care medical center 5. Patients - This study will involve 192 patients with biliary diseases which require endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. 6. Intervention - Cannulation of bile duct by using a loop-tipped guidewire or a straight-tipped guidewire 7. Main outcome measurements - Compare the cannulation success rate, the duration of the cannulation, immediate and late complications.</brief_summary>
