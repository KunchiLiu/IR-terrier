	<brief_title>Effects of Low Fat Milk Consumption on Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, controlled, parallel, dietary intervention study was designed. Subjects with metabolic syndrome and body mass index ≥23 kg/m2 were randomized to the low-fat milk group, which were instructed to consume 2 packs of low-fat milk per day (200 mL twice daily) for 6 weeks, and the control group was instructed to maintain their habitual diet. Metabolic markers were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects were enrolled if their body mass index (BMI) was ≥23 kg/m2 and they met the criteria for metabolic syndrome. Those who were allergic to milk; those who had a history of digestive disorder; those with a medical history of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery diseases, valvular heart diseases, heart failure, or stroke; those who had cancer in the past 5 years; those who were taking hypoglycemic agents for diabetes mellitus; those who had chronic disease such as renal failure or liver cirrhosis; and those with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level ≥ 7% were excluded from the research. People who had a weight change &gt; 5% of the total weight within the past 3 months, those who had started taking or had changed their dose of antihypertensive agents or medications for dyslipidemia within the previous 1 month, those who had a newly diagnosed dyslipidemia requiring drug treatment, those who had taken steroids either orally or by injection within the previous 3 months, those who were pregnant or were expecting to become pregnant; and those who regularly consumed milk in quantities ≥ 200 mL per day at least 3 times a week on average were also excluded.</criteria>
