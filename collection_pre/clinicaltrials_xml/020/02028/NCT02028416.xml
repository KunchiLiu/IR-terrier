	<brief_summary>Acquired Aplastic anemia is one of the most frequent reason of bone marrow failure in East (Pakistan). - The first treatment option is Allogenic Bone Marrow transplantation which is an expansive treatment option and also require a full matched HLA identical donor, hence hardly 25% of our affected patients get opportunity for BMT. - The second line treatment option caters a large chunk of patients (severe and non-severe AA) along with those who lack HLA identical donor. Previously many protocols had been used in past for ATG+CsA Treatment, this treatment protocol especially addresses the two different regimens of ATG to study its efficacy, durability and long-term effects. Following doses would be used: - CsA+ATG @ 10mg/kg for 3 days - CsA+ATG @ 10mg/kg for 5 days</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Different Doses of Rabbit ATG-Fresenius With Cyclosporin in the Treatment of Acquired Aplastic Anaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aplastic Anaemia (AA) is characterized by pancytopenia with hypo-cellular bone marrow in the absence of dysplasia, infiltration or fibrosis. The recommended first-line treatment options include Allogenic Bone Marrow Transplantation with HLA matched sibling donor. However, due to non-availability HLA matched identical sibling donor or due to other co-morbids and age, second choice of treatment is Anti Thymocyte Globulin (ATG) and Cyclosporin (CsA). Rabbit ATG (Fresenius) has never been tested for the treatment of aplastic anaemia in Pakistani population before. We propose this investigator initiated trial which will will compare two different protocols of Rabbit ATG-Fresenius, 10mg/kg for 3 days and 10mg/kg for 5 days along with CsA in Pakistani patients suffering from AA. The subjects will be Non-severe (NSAA) and severe AA (SAA) who are not the eligible candidate for Allogenic Bone Marrow Transplantation. Patients will be randomized into two equal arms with same biological characteristics. Both arms will be treated with ATG-Fresenius and CsA in same doses with two different duration of treatment. They will later continue with CsA for at least 12 months and if response achieved, will be tapered more slowly over next 6 months. The primary end point is to document the number of doses required by each of the two dose schedule to produce a response, achieve a nadir absolute lymphocyte count of 200 cmm. Secondary endpoints are short term safety of ATG-Fresenius, change in absolute neutrophil count from the baseline in both arms, change in platelet count from the baseline, change in absolute reticulocyte count, Number of blood units required till 8 weeks and 26 weeks, Number of platelet doses required till 8 weeks and 26 weeks, relapse, response rates at 6 and 12 months, clonal evolution to PNH, myelodysplasia or acute leukaemia. Long-course CsA will be assessed separately for its efficacy in reducing late events of relapse and evolution by comparison to historical control data.</detailed_description>
