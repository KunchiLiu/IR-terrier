	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, single arm trial in which patients with locally advanced or metastatic endocrine receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer refractory to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI) will receive Everolimus 10mg orally daily given in conjunction with exemestane 25mg orally daily until disease progression or treatment discontinuation for any other reasons. Tumour, metastatic lesions and blood samples will be collected during the treatment period. Genomic analysis on metastatic tumour tissue specimens and "liquid biopsies" will help to identify patients who benefit of this treatment regimen. The main objective is to evaluate if early metabolic response (MR) using FDG-PET/CT is associated with progression free survival (PFS) this population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult women (≥18 years of age) with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer not amenable to curative treatment by surgery or radiotherapy. Histological or cytological confirmation of estrogenreceptor positive (ER+), HER2 negative breast cancer. Postmenopausal female defined as: Age ≥55 years and one year or more of amenorrhoea Age &lt;55 years and one year or more of amenorrhoea, with an estradiol assay &lt;20pg/ml Surgical menopause with bilateral oophorectomy Breast cancer that is refractory to nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI) (i.e. anastrozole or letrozole) defined as: Recurrence while on, or within 12 months of end of adjuvant treatment with anastrozole or letrozole; OR Progression while on, or within one month of end of anastrozole or letrozole or treatment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. FDGPET measurable disease defined as: at least one target lesion fulfilling following criteria: Size ≥1.5cm; AND FDGPET avid lesion with uptake above the background liver uptake as described below: i.e. with a marked accumulation of FDG, at least 1.5fold greater than liver SUV mean + 2 SDs (in 3cm spherical ROI in normal right lobe of liver).

For patients with accessible metastatic lesions, possibility to obtain biopsy (FFPE and frozen) of a metastatic lesion Exclusion criteria: HER2overexpressing patients by local laboratory testing (IHC 3+ staining or in situ hybridization positive). Patients with only nonmeasurable lesions by FDGPET (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites etc.). Symptomatic visceral disease for example liver, pulmonary metastases or lymphangitis carcinomatosis.

Another malignancy within 5 years prior to enrolment, with the exception of adequately treated insitu carcinoma of the cervix, uteri, basal or squamous cell carcinoma or nonmelanomatous skin cancer. Radiotherapy within four weeks prior to enrolment except in case of localized radiotherapy for analgesic purpose or for lytic lesions at risk of fracture, which can then be completed within two weeks prior to enrolment. Patients must have recovered from radiotherapy toxicities prior to enrolment. Currently receiving hormone replacement therapy, unless discontinued prior to enrolment. History of symptomatic brain metastases or other central nervous system metastases. Patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive agents or chronic corticosteroid use at the time of study entry except in cases outlined below: Topical applications (e.g. rash) Inhaled sprays (e.g. obstructive airways disease) Eye drops Local injections (e.g. intraarticular) Stable low dose of corticosteroids for at least two weeks before enrolment Patients with known HIV seropositivity. Screening for HIV infection at baseline is not required Acute and chronic, active infectious disorders (except for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C positive patients). Active bleeding diathesis, or on oral antivitamin K medication (except low dose warfarin, LMWH and acetylsalicylic acid or equivalent, as long as the INR is ≤ 2.0).

History of noncompliance to medical regimens. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol. Concurrent anticancer treatment in another investigational trial, including hormonal therapy, immunotherapy or targeted agents other than those administered in this study.</criteria>
