When patient has multiple painful chronic wounds, the wound having only the highest pain intensity is considered for evaluation. Ineffective systemic analgesic with or without opioid analgesic established and maintained at the same dose for 3 days before inclusion. If treatment includes morphine, the daily dose should not exceed 60 mg of morphine equivalent and this treatment must be a treatment exclusive background. Patient requiring an analgesic equilibration for intense and rebellious local pain, with a daily average score greater than or equal to 5, on a graduated numerical scale of 0 to 10. The score is defined at the inclusion and corresponds to the pain intensity felt locally by the patient under treatment systemic analgesic with or without coanalgesics. If analgesics to treat systemic pain is ongoing, it must have been introduced for more than 3 days (according to criteria 3) If antidepressant treatment is in progress, it must have been established for over a month for a tricyclic and for more than 15 days for other classes of antidepressants. If an antiepileptic treatment analgesic is in progress, it must have been established for over 15 days. Signing of the informed consent form.
