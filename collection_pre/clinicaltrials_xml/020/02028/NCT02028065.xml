	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the potential for hypersensitivity symptoms upon repeat exposure to sugammadex. Healthy participants will be randomized to one of three treatment arms: sugammadex 4 mg/kg, sugammadex 16 mg/kg or placebo. Participants will receive 3 single intravenous (IV) doses of their randomized treatment, with an approximately 5-week washout between Dose 1 and Dose 2 and between Dose 2 and Dose 3. Participants will be confined at the study center from the day before each dose until completion of the 24-hour post dose assessments.</brief_summary>
