	<brief_summary>The two original objectives were to determine in HIV-infected children initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART): 1. Whether clinically driven monitoring (CDM) will have a similar outcome in terms of disease progression or death as routine laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM) for toxicity (haematology/biochemistry) and efficacy (CD4)? 2. Whether induction with four drugs from two ART classes followed by maintenance with three drugs after 36 weeks be more effective than a continuous non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-based triple drug regimen in terms of CD4 and clinical outcome? Two secondary objectives were to determine 3. Whether changing from twice daily lamivudine+abacavir to once daily lamivudine+abacavir after 48 weeks on ART will have a similar outcome in terms of virological suppression and will result in improvements in adherence to ART? 4. Whether stopping daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in children over 3 years of age who have been on ART for at least 96 weeks has a similar outcome in terms of hospitalisation or death as continuing daily cotrimoxazole?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Different Laboratory Management Strategies and Drug Regimens in HIV-infected Children in Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ARROW (AntiRetroviral Research fOr Watoto) protocol describes an open-label randomised trial primarily evaluating two strategic approaches for management of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1200 symptomatic HIV-infected infants and children initiating ART following WHO guidelines in Uganda and Zimbabwe. The first strategy compares clinically driven monitoring (CDM) with laboratory plus clinical monitoring (LCM). In both groups, tests for toxicity (standard haematology and biochemistry panels) and efficacy (lymphocyte subsets including CD4 count) will be done every 12 weeks. In LCM, all results will be returned for patient management. In CDM, physicians may request results from routine haematology/biochemistry panels if needed for clinical management, but results will not be returned routinely, and lymphocyte subsets will never be returned. Extra laboratory tests may be requested outside of the scheduled visits at any time in either group (except for lymphocyte subsets in CDM). The second strategy compares a continuous WHO-recommended first-line ART three-drug two-class regimen, comprising two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) plus one Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), with induction with four drugs (two classes) for 36 weeks followed by maintenance with three drugs. After at least 36 and 96 weeks on ART respectively, two further randomisations will assess simplification strategies which could improve long-term ART adherence (i) once versus twice daily lamivudine+abacavir NRTI drugs (ii) stopping versus continuing daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For initial randomisation to CDM vs LCM, and to ART induction strategy: 1. Children should have an adult carer in the household who is either: participating in the DART trial OR being treated with ART OR HIV positive but not yet needing treatment but with access to a treatment programme when ART is required OR HIV negative. Children of DART participants should have first priority on any available remaining slots to enter ARROW. 2. Parents or guardians, and children where appropriate according to age and knowledge of HIV status, must be willing and able to give informed consent for randomisation to CDM or LCM and to firstline ART strategy. 3. Participants must have a confirmed documented diagnosis of HIV1 infection: 1. For children aged under 18 months: two separate peripheral blood specimens from different days, both results being positive with HIVDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 2. For children aged 18 months or over: antibody positive serology by ELISA test (confirmed by licensed second ELISA or Western Blot) or WHO approved rapid test (performed in series) both on the same sample. Any child previously tested at another clinic should have a repeat test at an ARROW screening laboratory to confirm their status. 4. Age 3 months to 17 years (1317 years to be capped at 10%) 5. ART na√Øve (except for exposure to perinatal ART for the prevention of mothertochild HIV transmission). 6. Meeting criteria for requiring ART according to WHO stage and CD4 percent or count: WHO paediatric clinical stage IV disease: treat regardless of CD4 percent or count WHO paediatric clinical stage III disease: &lt;12 months: treat all &gt;12 months: treat all children irrespective of the CD4 percent or count; however, in children aged &gt; 12 months with tuberculosis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP), oral hairy leukoplakia (OHP) or thrombocytopenia (low platelet count treat) be guided by CD4 cell assays (see below). WHO paediatric clinical stage II or I disease: treat guided by CD4 percent or count CD4%&lt;25% for infants &lt;12 months; CD4%&lt;20% for children 1&lt;3 years; CD4% &lt;15% for children 3&lt;5years; CD4% &lt;15% for children &gt; 5years (consideration should also be taken of the CD4 count. A CD4 count &lt;200 cells/mm3 can be used to guide starting ART and CD4 should generally be &lt;350 cells/mm3.) 1. Cannot, or unlikely to attend regularly (e.g. usual residence too far from study centre) 2. Likelihood of poor adherence 3. Presence of acute infection (e.g. malaria, helminthiasis, acute hepatitis, acute pneumonia, septicaemia, meningitis). Children may be admitted after recovery of an acute infection. Children with chronic lung disease, including recurrent respiratory infections, are eligible. Children with tuberculosis (TB) will not be enrolled while on the intensive phase of antituberculosis therapy, but should be reevaluated after the intensive phase and a decision made then about starting ART (see 4 below) 4. In receipt of medication contraindicated by ART children under three years of age receiving antituberculosis therapy should not be enrolled (as they will have to receive nevirapine). on chemotherapy for malignancy 5. Laboratory abnormalities which are a contraindication for the child to start ART (haemoglobin &lt;8.5g/dL; neutrophils &lt;0.50x109/L; aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); grade 3 renal dysfunction creatinine &gt;1.9 x ULN). N.B. causes of anaemia, such as concurrent bacterial infection, malaria, helminthiasis and/or malnutrition should be investigated, and treatment for anaemia and its causes commenced prior to rescreening for eligibility. 6. Being pregnant or breastfeeding an infant 7. Perinatal exposure to nevirapine (either through prevention of mothertochild transmission (pMTCT) or breastfeeding) for children aged 3 6 months only Eligibility criteria for the secondary randomisation to once vs twice daily lamivudine+abacavir Inclusion criteria 1.

Likely to switch to secondline therapy in the next 12 weeks Eligibility criteria for the secondary randomisation to stop or continue cotrimoxazole prophylaxis randomisation Inclusion criteria 1. Participating in ARROW 2. Aged at least 3 years 3. Initiated ART at least 96 weeks previously, and received at least 96 weeks of ART allowing for any interruptions in ART 4.
