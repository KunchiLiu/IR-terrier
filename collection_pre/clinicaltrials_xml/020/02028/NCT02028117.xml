	<brief_summary>This study is a phase I/II open label clinical study in patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. The Phase I part of the study will determine the dose of enadenotucirev to be recommended for further studies and will examine primarily the safety and tolerability but also the pharmacokinetics of administering enadenotucirev intraperitoneally. Once the dose of IP enadenotucirev to be used in combination with IV weekly paclitaxel has been determined, the phase II stage will begin as an open label dose expansion of that regimen. The phase II stage aims to determine whether intraperitoneal enadenotucirev has a risk benefit profile that supports further investigation in the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian Cancer.</brief_summary>

For patients in the Phase II part of the study participating in the exploratory assessment of tumour samples: Ovarian Disease amenable to percutaneous imageguided biopsy. 1. Tumours of malignant mixed mesodermal (MMMT) or mucinous subtypes, or nonepithelial ovarian cancers (e.g. Brenner tumours, Sexcord tumours). 2.

Splenectomy; 8. Prior allogeneic or autologous bone marrow or organ transplantation; 9.

Administration of a systemic cancer therapy within 3 weeks of the first administration of Coload1 14. Major surgery within 3 weeks or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to first dose of ColoAd1; 15. Another primary malignancy within the past 3 years (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ); 16. Known CNS metastasis; 17. Inflammatory diseases of the bowel; 18. Concurrent congestive heart failure or prior history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV cardiac disease. 19. Any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the medical monitor, would compromise patient safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the drug; 20. Known allergy to treatment medication or its excipients; 21. Any other medical or psychological condition that would preclude participation in the study or compromise ability to give informed consent.</criteria>
