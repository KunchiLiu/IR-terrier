	<brief_title>Yellow 560 Microscope for Intraoperative Visualization of Fluorescein Stained Intracranial Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using Fluorescein Sodium and the Yellow 560 microscope to aid in treatment of intracranial tumors and vascular lesions. The objectives of this study aim to investigate the use of Fluorescein in assisting with evaluating complete tumor removal and thorough treatment of intracranial vascular lesions as well as tumor biopsy procedures. The hypothesis is that Fluorescein Sodium will help surgeons better identify residual tumor and vascular lesions and its use will allow surgeons to obtain better surgical results and prognostic outcomes.</detailed_description>
