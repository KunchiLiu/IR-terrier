	<brief_title>Pediatric Integrative Medicine Trial Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objective: To determine if a pediatric integrative medicine (PIM) service is effective in reducing overall symptoms of pain, nausea/vomiting, and/or anxiety (PNVA), length of stay, and costs, in hospitalized children when compared to conventional care. In this context, "integrative" refers to a combined approach of complementary and conventional medical therapies in an evidence-based fashion. Design: cluster trial; 2-arm controlled evaluation study in pediatric oncology, general pediatrics and pediatric cardiology. Intervention will be offered during a 6-month PIM period following a 6 month control period. Population: Inclusion criteria: (i) In-patients in participating division and (ii) informed consent/assent. Exclusion criteria: (i) lack of parent participation, fluency in English, or informed consent Intervention: Recommendations for specific CAM therapies will be determined by a staff PIM pediatrician. Any combination of the following CAM therapies (dose, duration, amount to be based on patient need as assessed by CAM provider, patient, and parent): acupuncture/acupressure, massage, Reiki; all are to be offered in addition to usual care. Control: Usual care. Outcomes: Primary outcome: feasibility (i.e enrollment); Secondary outcomes: (i) PNVA symptom management, (ii) need for conventional pharmacotherapy, (iii) adverse events; (iv) parent and health care provider satisfaction with care provided, v) length of stay; and vi) cost-effectiveness (analysis of this outcome to be limited to patients admitted for at least 2 days and for not more than 30 days). Significance: To our knowledge, this study will be the first comparative effectiveness trial to assess the impact of PIM for hospitalized children with cancer.</detailed_description>
