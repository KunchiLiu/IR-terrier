	<brief_title>Phase 2a Study of Dapivirine Ring in Adolescent Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MTN-023/IPM 030 is a Phase 2a, two-arm, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-site, randomized trial of dapivirine vaginal ring (VR) versus placebo VR. The clinical trial is designed to assess the safety of dapivirine (25 mg) administered via a silicone vaginal ring (primary objective) and evaluate the acceptability of the dapivirine or placebo VR in sexually experienced, HIV-uninfected adolescent females, when inserted once every 4 weeks during 12 weeks of study product use. Approximately 96 participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either a silicone elastomer vaginal ring containing 25 mg of dapivirine or a placebo VR. The ring will be replaced every 4 weeks during the 12 week study product use period. Use of a VR to provide sustained delivery of microbicides is a novel investigational method for prevention of heterosexual transmission of HIV in women. This drug delivery method may circumvent potential difficulties related to adherence to daily or coitally-dependent uses of microbicide regimens.</detailed_description>

Able and willing to comply with all study procedural requirements 6. Per participant report at Screening and Enrollment, willing to abstain from inserting anything into the vagina for 72 hours prior to each followup visit, including abstaining from penilevaginal intercourse. Note: In the event the vaginal ring has been expelled and requires reinsertion, repositioning the vaginal ring is permitted 7.

Assessment of onset and progression of puberty, as measured by Tanner stage 4 or 5 at Screening, per participant report and/or clinician assessment 9. HIVuninfected based on testing performed at Screening and Enrollment (per protocol algorithm in Appendix II) 10. Per participant report at Screening, history of sexual intercourse (at least one episode in participant's lifetime) 11. Per participant report at Screening and Enrollment, agrees to use condoms for sexual intercourse 12. Negative pregnancy test at Screening and Enrollment 13. Per participant report, using an effective method of contraception for at least 30 days (inclusive) prior to Enrollment, and intending to continue use of an effective method for the duration of study participation; effective methods include: hormonal methods (except contraceptive ring) intrauterine device (IUD) sterilization (of participant, as defined in site SOPs) 14. At Screening and Enrollment, participant states a willingness to refrain from inserting the following vaginal products and/or objects into the vagina; spermicides, diaphragms, contraceptive vaginal rings, menstrual cups, cervical caps (or any other vaginal barrier method), douches, lubricants, for the 5 days prior to Enrollment throughout the duration of study participation. Note: Neither the use of tampons or sex toys, nor participant engagement in coitus is restricted. 15. At Screening and Enrollment, agrees not to participate in other research studies involving drugs, medical devices, vaginal products, or vaccines for the duration of study participation, unless approved by the PSRT 1. Per participant report at Screening, intends to do any of the following during the study participation period: 1. become pregnant 2. relocate away from the study site 3. travel away from the study site for more than 4 consecutive weeks 2. Diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and/or reproductive tract infection (RTI) at Screening and/or Enrollment. Note: Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI during Screening will be offered treatment and may be enrolled after completing treatment and all symptoms have resolved. If treatment is completed and symptoms have resolved within 56 days of obtaining informed consent for Screening, the participant may be enrolled. 3. Diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease and/or an sexually transmitted infection (STI) requiring treatment per current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines within 60 days of Enrollment (inclusive) 4. At Enrollment, has a clinically apparent Grade 2 or higher pelvic exam finding (observed by study staff)** Note: Cervical bleeding associated with speculum insertion and/or specimen collection judged to be within the range of normal according to the clinical judgment of the IoR/designee is considered expected nonmenstrual bleeding and is not exclusionary. Note: Otherwise eligible participants with exclusionary pelvic exam findings may be enrolled/randomized after the findings have improved to a nonexclusionary severity grading or resolved. If improvement to a nonexclusionary grade or resolution is documented within 56 days of providing informed consent for screening, the participant may be enrolled. 5. Participant report and/or clinical evidence of any of the following: 1. Known adverse reaction to any of the study products (ever) 2. Known HIVinfected partner 3. Nontherapeutic injection drug use in the 12 months prior to Screening 4. The use of HIV Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and/or Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) within the 6 months prior to Enrollment 5. Currently breastfeeding 6. Last pregnancy outcome within 90 days or less of Screening 7. Participation in any other research study involving drugs, medical devices, vaginal products, or vaccines, within 60 days of Screening 8. Participant report of 3 or more penilevaginal sexual partners in the month prior to Screening 9. At Enrollment, as determined by the IoR/designee, has any significant uncontrolled active or chronic cardiovascular, renal, liver, hematologic, neurologic, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, endocrine, respiratory, immunologic disorder or infectious disease 6. Has any of the following Grade 1 or higher* laboratory abnormalities at Screening Visit: 1. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) 2. Creatinine 3. Hemoglobin 4. Platelet count Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an exclusionary test may be retested during the screening process. Please see the MTN023/IPM 030 SSP for additional details. 7. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude informed assent/consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009) **Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 to the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009)</criteria>
