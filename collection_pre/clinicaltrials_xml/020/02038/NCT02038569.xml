	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (all subjects): Clinical signs of psoriasis vulgaris on both the scalp and body (trunk and/or limbs) At SV2 and Visit 1, a clinical diagnosis of scalp and body (trunk and/or limbs) psoriasis which is: of an extent of 10 to 35% of the body surface area (excluding psoriatic lesions of the face and sensitive areas. Sensitive areas include armpits, groin, under the breasts and in other skin folds around the genitals and buttocks), and of at least moderate severity according to the investigator's global assessment of disease severity on the body. A serum albumincorrected calcium level below the upper reference limit at SV2 Inclusion Criteria (for subjects performing HPA axis assessments): At SV2 and Visit 1, a clinical diagnosis of scalp psoriasis which is: more than or equal to 20% of the scalp area, and of at least moderate severity according to the investigator's global assessment of disease severity on the scalp. Subjects with a normal HPA axis function at SV2 including serum cortisol concentration above 5 mcg/dl before ACTH challenge and serum cortisol concentration above 18 mcg/dl 30 minutes after ACTH challenge. Inclusion Criteria (for subjects not performing HPA axis assessments): At SV2 and Visit 1, a clinical diagnosis of scalp psoriasis which is: more than or equal to 10% of the scalp area, and of at least moderate severity according to the investigator's global assessment of disease severity on the scalp. Exclusion Criteria (all subjects): Systemic treatment with biological therapies (marketed or not marketed), with a possible effect on scalp and/or body psoriasis within the following time period prior to Visit 1 and during the trial: etanercept within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 adalimumab, infliximab within 2 months prior to Visit 1 ustekinumab within 4 months prior to Visit 1 experimental products within 4 weeks/5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to Visit 1 Systemic treatment with therapies other than biologicals, with a possible effect on scalp and/or body psoriasis (e.g., retinoids, immunosuppressants, PUVA) within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Day 0) or during the trial.

Current diagnosis of guttate, erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis. Subjects with any of the following conditions present on the treatment areas on scalp and/or body: viral (e.g., herpes or varicella) lesions of the skin, fungal and bacterial skin infections, parasitic infections, skin manifestations in relation to syphilis or tuberculosis, rosacea, acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, atrophic skin, striae atrophicae, fragility of skin veins, ichthyosis, ulcers and wounds. Other inflammatory skin diseases that may confound the evaluation of scalp and/or body psoriasis. Planned excessive exposure to sun during the trial that may affect scalp and/or body psoriasis. Known or suspected severe renal insufficiency or severe hepatic disorders. Known or suspected disorders of calcium metabolism associated with hypercalcaemia. Any clinically significant abnormality following review of screening laboratory tests (blood and urine samples), physical examination or blood pressure/heart rate measurement performed at SV2. Current participation in any other interventional clinical trial. Previously enrolled in this trial. Subjects who have received treatment with any nonmarketed drug substance (i.e., an agent which has not yet been made available for clinical use following registration) within a month prior to SV1 or longer, if the class of substance required a longer washout as defined above (e.g., biological treatments).
