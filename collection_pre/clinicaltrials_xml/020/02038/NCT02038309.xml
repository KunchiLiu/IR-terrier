	<brief_summary>Study of persistent platelet reactivity during acute coronary syndrome. Patients are included at admission to the hospital. Platelet aggregation is evaluated by platelet function testing after blood sampling during hospitalization. No changes in treatment is planned.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood samples are performed on day 2 and 4 and collected with usual blood samples and analyzed by the laboratory. Maximal aggregation intensity and velocity are measured by light transmission aggregometry induced by arachidonic acid (AA) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Platelet function analyzer will be also used. No changes in treatment in response to the results is planned.</detailed_description>
