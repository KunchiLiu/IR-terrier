	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine if a monoclonal antibody VAY736 can reduce disease activity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) as compared to placebo. The study will also provide the first safety and tolerability information for VAY736 in RRMS patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 Years to 55 Years Male and Female Diagnosis of MS as defined by the 2010 revised McDonald criteria (Polman, et. al2011). A relapsingremitting course of disease with: at least 1 documented relapse during the previous 12 months (but not within 30 days prior to randomization), or a positive Gdenhancing lesion on brain MRI scan at screening. An Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 05.0 inclusive at screening. No evidence of a relapse within 30 days prior to randomization. â€¢ A manifestation of another type of MS other than RRMS. Findings on screening or baseline brain MRI inconsistent with the diagnosis of MS. History of chronic disease of the immune system other than MS, or a known immunodeficiency syndrome Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 4 months following completion of the study. Unable to undergo MRI scans due to interalia, claustrophobia, incompatible cardiac pacemakers, ferromagnetic intracranial aneurysm clips, certain cochlear implants, and certain other ferromagnetic foreign bodies (e.g. tattoos containing metal) or electronic devices, or metallic implants incompatible with MRI. Unable to receive gadoliniumbased MRI contrast agents due to a history of hypersensitivity to gadoliniumbased contrast agents, renal insufficiency or impairment. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
