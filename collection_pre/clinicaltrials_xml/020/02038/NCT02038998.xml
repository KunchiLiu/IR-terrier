	<brief_summary>Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. More than 85% of strokes are due to blood vessel occlusion resulting in partial destruction of the brain parenchyma. Current protocols try to re-establish blood circulation as soon as possible through chemical and/or mechanical interventions but new strategies are needed. Periodic acceleration (pGz) is a non-invasive method consisting in the application of a rocking movement to the patient that ultimately will induce the release of beneficial chemicals from the vascular endothelium (the cells lining the inside of the blood vessels). Application of pGz in an animal model of stroke resulted in a dramatic reduction of associated brain damage. This trial will investigate whether stroke patients exposed to pGz experiment significantly higher recovery than patients that remained static during their treatment.</brief_summary>
