	<brief_summary>We propose a novel intervention for reducing BP that could have a preferential impact in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. There is a great need for new anti-hypertensives, particularly among those with gout. The proposed study is novel in its plans to investigate the physiologic mechanisms through which urate contributes to vascular disease and by which ULT may contribute to BP reduction. Also innovative, we will: 1) determine to what extent the described benefit of lowering serum urate extends beyond the adolescent population previously studied into young adults, 2) test whether a urate-lowering approach will benefit individuals that do not yet meet the current definition of hyperuricemia and do not have gout, and 3) begin to explore potential mechanisms for the higher prevalence of hypertension among African-Americans. If successful, this work could translate to the standard of clinical care and to health care recommendations for the population as a whole.</brief_summary>
