	<brief_title>An Open-label Phase I Study of Orally Available Novel Small-molecule Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFR) 1,2,3 and 4 Inhibitor, ASP5878 at Single and Multiple Doses in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of two parts. In the dose-escalation part, ASP5878 (orally available novel small-molecule FGFR 1,2,3 and 4 inhibitor, multiple dosing once-a-day (q.d.), multiple dosing twice-a-day (b.i.d.) or 5-day on/2-day off dosing twice-a-day (5on-2off)) is administered to patients with solid tumors in an increasing dose manner, and the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of ASP5878 are evaluated in these patients. Cycle 0 consists of 3 days and Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles consist of 28 days each in the dose-escalation part. In the expansion part, 16mg twice-a-day 5-day on/2-day off dose of ASP5878 (5on-2off) is administered to patients with solid tumors and safety, PK, PD and efficacy of ASP5878 are evaluated. The expansion part starts from Cycle 1 and each cycle consists of 28 days.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor. Patient must meet at least one of the following criteria in the judgment of the investigator or subinvestigator: Disease progression despite standard therapies Progressive disease without any standard therapies established Standard therapies are considered intolerable Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1. Predicted life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks in the judgment of the investigator or subinvestigator. Patient with ≥ Grade 2 (CTCAE v 4.0JCOG) persistent symptoms and objective findings due to the toxicity attributable to prior treatment with antitumor effect (except alopecia). Patient who received a prior treatment intended for antitumor effect (medication, surgery, radiotherapy, etc.) within 4 weeks prior to the planned first day of study drug dosing (or patient who received mitomycin C or Nitrosourea within 6 weeks prior to the planned first day of study drug dosing). A major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to the planned first day of study drug dosing or a surgical procedure is planned during the course of the study. Patient who were treated with other investigational drug or medical device within 4 weeks prior to the planned first day of study drug dosing. Patient who has a history of organ transplantation. Patient with a brain metastasis with symptoms or requiring treatment.</criteria>
