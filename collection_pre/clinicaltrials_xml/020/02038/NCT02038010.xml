	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see whether a combination of two different drugs - trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (T-DM1) and BYL719 is safe, and if it might be effective in treating metastatic breast cancer. T-DM1 is a type of drug that contains an antibody (trastuzumab) linked to chemotherapy. The antibody in T-DM1 targets a marker on breast cancer cells called HER2, which allows the drug to go directly to the cancer cells. The use of T-DM1 in this study is considered standard treatment for the type of cancer in this study. Participants in this study have already been treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the past, and their cancer has gotten worse in spite of those treatments. BYL719 is an oral drug (taken by mouth) that the researchers think may help T-DM1 to work better.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BYL719 + T-DM1 in HER2(+) Metastatic Breast Cancer Pts Who Progress on Prior Trastuzumab &amp; Taxane Tx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine safety, tolerability, feasibility, and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of dose-escalating BYL719 in combination with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) after progression on trastuzumab and taxane-based therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of BYL719 administered in combination with T-DM1. II. Assess any preliminary evidence of efficacy of BYL719 and T-DM1 in combination in patients with HER2-positive MBC. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Explore efficacy in patients whose tumors have an alteration (mutation or amplification) of the PIK3CA gene and decrease of phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) expression. (Optional) II. Examine other v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream markers by immunohistochemistry. (Optional) OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BYL719. Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BYL719 orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or at the discretion of the treating physician. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologicallyconfirmed HER2positive breast cancer that is locally advanced or metastatic (stage 4); ideally this should be from biopsy of the metastatic disease; however if this is not available, histologic confirmation from the primary tumor is acceptable Patients must have had progression on a trastuzumab and taxanebased chemotherapy regimen during or after treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease or within 6 months after treatment for earlystage HER2positive disease documented by one of the following results using Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved testing methods: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)positive (with an amplification ratio &gt;= 2.0 indicating positive status) and/or Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3 + by local laboratory assessment Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 Patients must have a life expectancy &gt;= 90 days Patients must have baseline laboratory tests within the following parameters at least 4 weeks (28 days) prior to registration: Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL (which may be reached by transfusion) Platelet count &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L (no transfusion allowed within 2 weeks) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L without growth factor support Serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) =&lt;

140 mg/dL/7.8 mmol/L Patients with childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration Patients must have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) showing QT interval =&lt; 460 msec within 14 days prior to registration Patients must provide written informed consent prior to any registration on study Patients must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan and laboratory tests Patient must be able to swallow and retain oral medication Patients with prior sensitivity or intolerance to PI3K inhibitors are not eligible for participation Patients with a history of grade &gt;= 3 hypersensitivity reaction to trastuzumab, OR grade &gt;= 1 with the most recent trastuzumab infusion before study entry, OR continued requirement for prolonged trastuzumab infusions to prevent hypersensitivity reactions are not eligible for participation Patients with a history of intolerance to trastuzumab and/or adverse events related to trastuzumab that resulted in trastuzumab being permanently discontinued are not eligible for participation Patients who have received prior treatment with TDM1 are not eligible for participation Patients who have received prior anticancer therapy (e.g., biologic or other targeted therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy) within 2 weeks prior to registration are not eligible for participation Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement may participate if the patient meets all of the following criteria: At least 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery) to starting the study treatment Clinically stable with respect to the CNS tumor at the time of screening Not receiving steroid therapy Not receiving enzyme inducing antiepileptic medications that were started for brain metastases Patients who have received radiotherapy =&lt;
