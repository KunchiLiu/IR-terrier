	<brief_summary>Binge Eating Disorder (BED) may be associated with he development of obesity. However, the pathogenesis of BED is currently unclear, thus making the development of treatment and prevention strategies for BED difficult. Differences in the mechanisms regulating food intake may go some way to reveal potential mechanisms for BED.The purpose of this study is to investigate the responses of key gut-derived hormones that are associated with the regulation of food intake and functional brain activity to food cues using fMRI in BED patients and weight matched controls.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will attend the laboratory on two separate occasions following an overnight fast. Following baseline measures they will be provided wither with a 600mL (600kcal) liquid meal (Fed condition) or a volume matched amount of plain water (Fasted condition) to consume within 15 min in a randomized crossover design. Blood samples will be collected for during the subsequent 120min to measure the glucose, insulin and gut hormone responses, and subjective appetite ratings will be collected. 1500mg of acetaminophen will be added to each of the test drinks so that the appearance in the blood can be used as a proxy measure of gastric emptying. Participants will then undergo a 45min brain scan to assess the responses to visual and auditory food cues.</detailed_description>
