	<brief_summary>The development of a safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine strategy would probably be the best solution for the ultimate control of the worldwide AIDS pandemic. Heterologous prime-boost immunisations are today considered promising HIV prophylactic vaccine strategies. It is thus relevant to pursue the development of different candidate vaccines in prime-boost vaccine strategies to identify the most promising prime-boost combinations and to integrate scientific inquiry into trial protocols from the beginning to maximize learning opportunities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of 4 Prime-boost Combinations of HIV Vaccine Candidates in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I/II, multicenter, national, open-label, randomized trial HIV including 4 prophylactic prime-boost HIV vaccines strategies: Volunteers are randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio at trial entry to 4 parallel arms with the following prime-boost strategies: Arm 1. MVA HIV-B primes at Week 0 and Week 8 + LIPO-5 boosts at Week 20 and Week 28 Arm 2. LIPO-5 primes at Week 0 and Week 8 + MVA HIV-B boosts at Week 20 and Week 28 Arm 3. GTU-MultiHIV B primes at Week 0, Week 4 and Week 12 + LIPO-5 boosts at Week 20 and Week 28 Arm 4. GTU-MultiHIV B primes at Week 0, Week 4 and Week 12 + MVA HIV-B boosts at Week 20 and Week 28</detailed_description>
