	<brief_summary>Antiplatelet therapy is indispensable for the prevention of stent thrombosis in patients who underwent coronary artery stenting. Similarly, anticoagulant therapy is essential for the prevention of cardiogenic embolism including cerebral infarction in AF patients. However, the combined antithrombotic therapy has been reported to increase the risk of major bleeding for AF patients after coronary stenting, New anticoagulant drugs that hardly interact with other drugs and do not need frequent blood tests have become commonly used. The purpose of this study is to assess the hypothesis that Rivaroxaban is non-inferior to Warfarin in the efficacy and safety for AF patients after coronary stenting.</brief_summary>
