	<brief_summary>Despite recent advances, morbidity and mortality associated to major abdominal surgery is significant. A poor physical condition and functional status reduces the ability of a person to cope, mentally and physically, with hospitalization and surgery and may compromise functional recovery, potentially leading to postoperative complications and death. Prehabilitation aims to enhance functional capacity preoperatively for better toleration of surgery and to facilitate recovery and eventually the prognosis of the surgical patient. Whereas the benefits of cardiopulmonary fitness programs are well established, the accessibility, sustainability of effects, and impact on the surgical outcome of these programs are unsolved issues. Wellness programs based on integrated care services supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can overcome such limitations. The investigators hypothesized that a prehabilitation program, inducing beneficial effects on exercise capacity, may improve the surgical outcome in high-risk patients. Moreover, ICT support may contribute to increase the adherence and sustainability of this intervention.</brief_summary>
