	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand why patients in the World Trade Center program have continuing breathing problems. This study will improve investigators understanding of breathing problems among individuals with World Trade Center exposure by allowing them to review and monitor medication use, lung function, and examine other conditions that can contribute to problems with breathing. The findings from the study will help investigators understand why some people have persistent lower respiratory symptoms (breathing problems) after their exposure to World Trade Center dust and fumes, and may help guide better management and treatment of these symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uncontrolled Lower Respiratory Symptoms in the WTC Survivor Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will conduct a clinical study with aggressive treatment for lower respiratory symptoms in patients in the World Trade Center Environmental Health Center. Patients in the WTC EHC with uncontrolled LRS at visit 1 will be identified and placed on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists for three months. Adherence will be assessed at monthly visits. Patients will perform spirometry and oscillometry at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. They will also be assessed for markers of airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and co-morbid conditions including depression,anxiety,post-traumatic stress disorder, gastroesophageal reflux, paradoxical vocal cord motion and rhinosinusitis.</detailed_description>
