	<brief_title>Evaluation of Choroidal Thickness During Pregnancy Using Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnant women in the last trimester and age-matched healthy controls have an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) image taken on the OCT SpectralisÂ® device. A map of the choroid in the macular area is constructed automatically. Choroidal thickness and volume are calculated for the 9 subfields defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). A comparative analysis between the two groups will be performed. As a secondary outcome measure, the change in choroidal thickness of the pregnant group of women will be assessed at 6 months postpartum by comparison to the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The OCT is a non-invasive examination that poses no risk to the mother or the fetus.</detailed_description>
