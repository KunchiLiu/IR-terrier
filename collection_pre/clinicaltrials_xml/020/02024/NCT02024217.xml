	<brief_summary>To investigate the feasibility, safety and tolerability of Preoperative Chemoradiation in Patients With Localized Gastric Cancer. Primary endpoint: R0 resection rate. Secondary endpoint: resection rate, pathological complete regression (pCR), effectiveness and safety of regime, disease free survival(DFS) and overall survival(OS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Plus Chemoradiation in Patients With Potentially Resectable Gastric Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis of gastric cancer is poor partially due to low R0 resection rate. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was reported to be effective in this setting by several phase II studies. The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in a prospective phase II study.</detailed_description>
