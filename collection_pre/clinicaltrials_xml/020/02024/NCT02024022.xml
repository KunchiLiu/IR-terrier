	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare a standard approach to bowel preparation for colonoscopy (using sodium picosulphate/magnesium citrate or 4lPEG) to an individualized approach where patients are assigned a specific regimen of either sodium picosulphate/magnesium citrate or 4lPEG depending on patient-related factors. The study aims to compare patient-related outcomes such as comfort levels during bowel cleansing and physician-related outcomes such as bowel prep quality in the two study groups.</brief_summary>
