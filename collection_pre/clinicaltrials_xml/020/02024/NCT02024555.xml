	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral antimycobacterial therapy in patients with confirmed progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis. We suspect that the CLEAR regimen will improve the absolute FVC percent predicted in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Investigation of Antimycobacterial Therapy on Progressive, Pulmonary Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral CLEAR therapy in patients with confirmed progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis. Hypothesis: The CLEAR regimen will improve the absolute FVC percent predicted in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis participants by augmenting T cell responses through the normalization of p56Lck expression and IL-2 production.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with sarcoidosis as defined by the ATS/ERS/WASOG statement on sarcoidosis as defined by the clinical presentation consistent with sarcoidosis, as well as biopsy demonstrating granulomas, and no alternative for the cause of the granulomas, such as tuberculosis for at least one year prior to randomization. Tuberculosis must be ruled out by negative histology and culture. Diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis was made at least 1 year prior to consent date. Evidence of disease progression as defined by at least two of the following four criteria: 1. Decline of absolute percent predicted of FVC (FVC&gt;45% and &lt;=90% of predicted value) or DLCO of at least 5% on serial measurements (DLCO range &gt;35%, if measured); 2. Radiographic progression in chest imaging on side by side comparison; 3. Change in dyspnea score, as measured by Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI); 4. Progression of pulmonary sarcoidosis necessitating an increase in antisarcoidosis therapy. Positive peripheral immune responses to ESAT6 as a biomarker of response to CLEAR regimen. Possess evidence of parenchymal or nodal disease on chest radiograph. • Inability to obtain consent Age less than 18 years of age If female, participant is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), or is using one of the following methods of birth control for the duration of the study and 90 days after study completion: condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm, or intrauterine device or a vasectomized sole partner. Note: Oral contraceptive pills are not effective birth control when taking rifampin or rifabutin. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening visit Endstage fibrotic pulmonary disease Significant underlying liver disease Poor venous access for obtaining blood samples History of active tuberculosis, close contact with a person with active tuberculosis within the 6 months prior to the screening visit or has a positive PPD. Significant disorder, other than sarcoidosis, that would complicate the treatment evaluation, such as respiratory, cardiac, neurologic, musculoskeletal or seizure disorders Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening or within 5 halflives of the agent, whichever is longer. Currently receiving &gt;40mg prednisone. ALT or AST ≥5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Leukopenia, as defined by WBC &lt;3.0 cells/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 mm3 Breast feeding. Color perception impairment as defined by the inability to differentiate colors per personal history or history of optic neuritis from any cause, including from sarcoidosis. Family or personal history of long QT interval Most recent nuclear medicine scan or echocardiogram (if done), demonstrating cardiac ejection fraction &lt;35% If patient is on immunomodulators, they must be on regimen for ≥3month period and on a stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks. Participant has persistent or active infections requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV antibiotics, IV antiretrovirals, or IV antifungals within 30 days of baseline, OR oral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals for purpose of treating infection, within 14 days of baseline. Minocycline and doxycycline are not considered antibiotics when used to treat sarcoidosis. Any significant finding in the patient's medical history or physical or psychiatric exam prior to or after randomization that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect patient safety or compliance or ability to deliver the study drug according to protocol. On medications that interacts with the antibiotics of the CLEAR regimen (Listed in Appendix A) History of or receiving treatment for pulmonary hypertension.</criteria>
