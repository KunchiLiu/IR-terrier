	<brief_summary>Trigeminal neuralgia is a craniofacial pain syndrome that is typically characterized by unilateral severe, recurrent, electrical pain in one or more distributions of the trigeminal nerve. Current treatment strategies include oral medications as first line therapy with surgical interventions reserved for those patients who are refractory to medications or unable to tolerate medication side effects. Despite these current treatment options, many patients continue to have symptoms. Ultrasound-guided trigeminal nerve block allows for fine adjustment of the needle tip and direct observation of the medicine. Local anesthetic and steroids have been successfully used for diagnostic and or therapeutic nerve pain with great success. Steroids can be short or long acting in duration with varying side effects. If there exists a difference in duration of action, using the longer acting drug will provide a greater period of symptom relief for the patient and may allow the patient to undergo fewer interventional procedures.</brief_summary>
