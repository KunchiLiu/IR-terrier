	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of Tc-99m Sestamibi Molecular Breast Imaging as an imaging modality for breast cancer screening. Tc-MBI has shown significantly higher sensitivity and equivalent specificity in the detection of breast cancer among high risk women when compared to mammography. However, there is little published data comparing Tc-MBI to MRI for evaluating extent of disease in women with known breast cancer. The study will target twenty (20) women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who are scheduled to undergo biopsy of additional suspicious lesions that were identified on standard of care contrast- enhanced breast MRI. Prior to the biopsy, these subjects will receive a Tc-MBI scan of the breast. The results from both imaging methods will be compared to histological findings. These results may be used to design larger and more comprehensive studies with an overarching goal to determine if there is a role for Tc-MBI in the pre-operative evaluation of patients with known breast cancer.</brief_summary>
