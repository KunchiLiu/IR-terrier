	<brief_title>Observational Study to Investigate the Effectiveness of Eprosartan on Pulse Pressure (Teveten_MS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective -To assess the changes of pulse pressure at 12 weeks Secondary Objectives - To assess the changes of pulse pressure at 4, 24 weeks - To assess the changes of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure at each visit - Percentage of responder rate* at each visit and time to get normalized BP from enrollment - Responder rate at last visit - To assess IIEF-5 (5-item Version of the International Index of Erectile Function) score at enrollment and 24 weeks (percentage of patients with ED according to IIEF-5, Changes of IIEF-5 domains) - Percentage of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) according to IIEF-5 and changes of PP in subgroup (age 65, body mass index (BMI) 23, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, benign prostate hypertrophy) - Analysis of correlation between ED and concomitant disease and concomitant medications in patients who received Eprosartan - Score changes of Framingham 10-year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk at 1st visit, 4th visit - Percentages of Eprosartan monotherapy and multiple antihypertensive therapies at enrollment and last visit - Reason for treatment discontinuation (Inadequate BP control, adverse events, others) - Adverse events - Responder rate: SBP &lt;140mmHg and DBP &lt;90mmHg (SBP &lt;140mmHg and DBP &lt;85mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus)</detailed_description>
