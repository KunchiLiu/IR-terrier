	<brief_summary>Liver cirrhosis is an advanced stage of chronic liver diseases, which is often associated with various complications, namely esophageal and/or gastric varices, ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is well known that the risk of complications varies even among cirrhotic patients, as those with more advanced disease would have more complications and poorer survival rates. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with transient elastography is found useful to identify cirrhotic patients with higher risk of portal hypertension and presence of varices . Recently, spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) with the same machine was found accurate to predict portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Investigators hypothesized that a new screening strategy guided by LSM and SSM (LSSM) values (LSSM-guided) is non-inferior to conventional strategy in terms of detection rate of clinically significant esophageal and/or gastric varices for patients with liver cirrhosis in an open-labeled randomized controlled trial. Consecutive patients with compensated liver cirrhosis will be invited for the study. Patients fulfilling the study criteria will be randomized into LSSM arm (upper endoscopy only performed to patients with high LSM or SSM values), and control arm (upper endoscopy performed to all patients). Patients randomized into LSSM arm will undergo transient elastography examination; those with high LSM or SSM results will be referred for upper endoscopy examination for to screen varices. Patients randomized into control arm will be directly referred for upper endoscopy examination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Liver cirrhosis is an advanced stage of chronic liver diseases, which is often associated with various complications, namely esophageal and/or gastric varices, ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is well known that the risk of complications varies even among cirrhotic patients, as those with more advanced disease would have more complications and poorer survival rates. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with transient elastography is found useful to identify cirrhotic patients with higher risk of portal hypertension and presence of varices at cross-sectional basis. LSM cutoff values of 17.6 kPa and 21.0 kPa would have the sensitivity ≥ 90% in order to detect patients with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) above 10-12mmHg , while the presence of varices could be confidently excluded with a liver stiffness below 12.5-19.8 kPa. However, these suggested cutoff values overlap with those for detecting histologic cirrhosis in most chronic liver diseases. Hence there seems no significant additional information provided by LSM regarding screening endoscopy for varices among cirrhotic patients. Recently, spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) with the same machine was found accurate to predict portal hypertension and esophageal varices. An SSM cutoff value &lt;41.3 kPa is sensitive and seems able to accurately rule out the presence of varices. This supports a possible screening strategy, reserving upper endoscopy only for patients with an SSM ≥41.3kPa.</detailed_description>
