	<brief_summary>This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center study of adipose stem cell (ASC) implantation. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose or fat. Liposuction using local anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The cells will be delivered via needle injection into the eye.</brief_summary>
