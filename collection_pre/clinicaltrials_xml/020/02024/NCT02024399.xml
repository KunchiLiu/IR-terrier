	<brief_summary>This project will address the important area of childhood obesity and the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with obesity. This is a serious health concern since children who are overweight or obese are prone to other medical conditions including high blood pressure, abnormal lipid profiles,and type 2 diabetes. Although exercise and nutrition programs are recommended, evidence for the efficacy of these programs in improving cardiovascular health is lacking. Specific Aims: a) improve cardiovascular risk factors, b) increase physical fitness levels, c) improve lean body mass, d) enhance QOL of the child e) influence adherence rates to exercise and a healthy lifestyle change both during and beyond the conclusion of the program. Hypothesis 1a: Compared to baseline and matched controls, children randomized to a 10 week multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program will show significant improved levels of cardiovascular risk factors. Specific Aim 2: To determine if a multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program, when compared with a matched, WLC group will show a change in whole body assessment including a decrease in fat mass, an increase in percent lean body mass, and a decrease in percent body fat, as measured utilizing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry Hypothesis 2a: Compared to baseline and matched controls, children randomized to a 10 week multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program will show improved whole body assessments including. Specific Aim 3:To determine if a multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program, when compared with a WLC group will show improved levels of fitness. Hypothesis 3a: Compared to baseline and matched controls, children randomized to a 10 week multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program will show significant improvements in fitness including.</brief_summary>
