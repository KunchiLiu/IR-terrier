	<criteria>1) the infant's gestational age at birth was less than 32 weeks; 2) the infant was receiving enteral feedings every three hours; 3) the infant was able medically to feed orally by 32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA); and 3) the parents gave consent for the infant's participation. 1) they were unable to begin oral feeding at 32 weeks PMA due to gastrointestinal, craniofacial, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and/or genetic defects; 2) had surgical necrotizing enterocolitis; or 3) needed ventilator support, including nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), beyond 32 weeks PMA. Infants receiving oxygen by cannula were included.</criteria>
