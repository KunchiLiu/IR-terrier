	<brief_summary>The purpose of this multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the EYEFILL速 C.-US Viscoelastic in patients undergoing cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation surgery. EYEFILL速 C.-US Viscoelastic is designed to create and maintain space, to protect the corneal endothelium and other intraocular tissues, and to manipulate tissues during surgery. EYEFILL速 C.-US Viscoelastic may also be used to coat intraocular lenses and instruments during cataract extraction and intraocular lens insertion.</brief_summary>
