	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide and ixazomib when given together with dexamethasone and to see how well pomalidomide and dexamethasone with or without ixazomib works in treating patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Biological therapies, such as pomalidomide and dexamethasone, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Ixazomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether pomalidomide and dexamethasone are more effective with or without ixazomib in treating multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone With or Without Ixazomib in Treating Patients With Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pomalidomide, dexamethasone and ixazomib followed by a phase II study. The primary purpose of the Phase I portion of the study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose for combination therapy pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib. Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, dexamethasone PO QD on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and ixazomib PO QD on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. About 24 patients will take part in this portion of the study. The primary purpose of the Phase II portion of the study is to assess whether the combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves progression free survival relative to pomalidomide/dexamethasone. Please see the "Arms" section below for a detailed description of the treatment arms for Phase II of the study. The dose for pomalidomide and ixazomib will be determined in phase I of the study. About 108 patients will take part in this portion of the study. The secondary objectives are listed below. Secondary Phase I Objectives: 1. To determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) 2. To analyze type and grade of all serious adverse events (SAEs) 3. To analyze type and grade of all adverse events (AEs) 4. To analyze the reason for and incidence of dose modifications/omissions/delays 5. To assess preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy Secondary Phase II Objectives: 1. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR), partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR) and stringent CR (sCR) rate for pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone 2. To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR: minimal response (MR) + ORR) for pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone 3. To assess the disease control rate (DCR: stable disease (SD) + CBR) for pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone 4. For those patients achieving a PR or better, we will assess whether the combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib increases the duration of response (DOR) compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone. 5. To assess whether the combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves overall survival (OS) compared to those taking pomalidomide/dexamethasone alone. 6. To assess time to next treatment (TNT) for patients taking pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to those on pomalidomide/dexamethasone. 7. To evaluate the safety of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared with pomalidomide/dexamethasone. 8. For patients on the pomalidomide/dexamethasone arm who opt to cross-over to the pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib arm, assessment of response rate (ORR, CBR, DCR) DOR, TNT, PFS, and OS will be evaluated from date of cross-over. 9. To determine if baseline level of perceived fatigue and overall quality of life (QOL) is associated with OS. Patients are followed up every 4 weeks until disease progression, death or the withdrawal of informed consent.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria: 1. Documentation of Disease: Histologically confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma. 2. Measurable disease: 1. Serum Mprotein ≥ 1.0 g/dL and/or 2. Urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours and/or 3. Involved serum free light chain level ≥ 10 mg/dL and an abnormal serum free light chain ratio and/or 4. Baseline marrow burden of myeloma of at least 30% 3. Prior Treatment: 1. Previously treated symptomatic multiple myeloma 2. Lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitorrefractory multiple myeloma (dual refractory disease) Lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitorrefractory disease is defined as disease progression on or progression within 60 days of the last dose of a lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitorbased treatment. Patients should have received at least 2 cycles of a lenalidomide or proteasome inhibitorbased regimen at standard doses to be evaluable for refractoriness. Patients can be refractory to either bortezomib or carfilzomib they do not need to be refractory to both. Patients can be refractory to lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitors given sequentially as part of different lines of therapy or therapy that includes a combination of lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. 3. At least 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy for multiple myeloma A line of therapy for myeloma is defined as 1 or more planned cycles of single agent or combination therapy, as well as a planned series of treatment regimens administered in a sequential manner (e.g. lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone induction therapy for 4 cycles followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and then lenalidomide maintenance therapy would be considered 1 line of prior therapy). A new line of therapy begins when a planned therapy is modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result of disease progression, disease relapse or treatmentrelated toxicity (e.g. a patient is progressing in the face of lenalidomide maintenance therapy and has bortezomib and dexamethasone added into their regimen). A new line of therapy also begins when a planned treatmentfree interval is interrupted by the need to start treatment due to disease relapse/progression (e.g. a patient with relapsed myeloma achieves a partial response after a planned 8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone, enjoys an 8month period off therapy but then experiences disease progression requiring reinitiation of therapy). 4. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is allowed provided the patient is ≥ 1 year from transplant, is not on immunosuppressive therapy to treat/prevent graftversushost disease, has no evidence of active graft versus host disease, no evidence of active infection and meets all other criteria for participation. 5.
