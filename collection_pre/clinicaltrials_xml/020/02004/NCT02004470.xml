	<brief_summary>The use of laparoscopy in gynecologic surgery has been well established to decrease morbidity, blood loss, hospital stay, and post-operative pain when compared to traditional open abdominal surgery. However, the laparoscopic technique is associated with post-operative shoulder pain. We hypothesize that a combination of intraperitoneal saline lavage and active suction removal of carbon dioxide gas from the right upper quadrant of the abdomen will decrease incidence of post-laparoscopic shoulder pain when compared to passive exsufflation of carbon dioxide gas.</brief_summary>
