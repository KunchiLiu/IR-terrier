	<brief_title>Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS) Over Fronto-temporal Cortex Improves Verbal Fluency and Empathy in Autism Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventional, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel assignment study, in which patients receive three types of intervention tRNS: one group received 35 sessions focused on the fronto-temporal cortex, another group received 35 sessions focused on the temporal fusiform cortex and last placebo group was operated with 35 sessions tRNS. After brain noninvasive stimulation sessions, a blind analysis of the improvement in verbal fluency and empathy in patients with autism spectrum disorder is made. For each patient included a follow up period of three months will be established.</detailed_description>
