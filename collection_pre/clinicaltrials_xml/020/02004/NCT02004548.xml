	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of daily oral administration of metatinib tromethamine in subjects with solid tumors; Investigate the influence of food on pharmacokinetic parameters. Secondary Objective: To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of daily oral administration of metatinib tromethamine in subjects with solid tumors; To observe preliminary anti-tumor efficacy; To evaluate potential pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers at MTD.</brief_summary>
