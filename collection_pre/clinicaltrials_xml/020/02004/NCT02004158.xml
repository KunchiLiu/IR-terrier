	<brief_summary>In this proof-of-concept study, the investigators will assess the ease and usefulness of a positive psychology program in patients with acute coronary syndrome and less-than-optimal adherence to health behaviors. The investigators believe that positive psychology (a field that studies boosting positive emotions rather than simply reducing negative emotions) will help this cardiac population to be more healthy. The investigators want to determine whether this positive psychology program has the potential to be an adjunctive treatment for cardiac populations.</brief_summary>
