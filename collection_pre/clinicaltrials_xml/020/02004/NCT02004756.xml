	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To determine if impairments in cardiac and musculoskeletal function and metabolism exist in Fontan children. Secondary Objectives: 1. To determine if impairments do exist, are they related to exercise capacity. 2. To determine if a 12-week exercise training intervention improves cardiac and/or musculoskeletal metabolism. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that abnormalities in cardiac and skeletal function are evident, influence exercise capacity, and can be improved with exercise training.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposed research provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding exercise intolerance by examining cardiac and musculoskeletal metabolism in a unique cohort of children with congenital heart disease. Study findings may more importantly lead to evidence-based exercise interventions that promote improvements in overall physical health, quality of life, and functional status for Fontan children. Furthermore, this pilot study will lead to the development of a novel research protocol which may be applied to larger Fontan and other congenital heart disease cohorts. This study will also provide preliminary data to develop and conduct a larger clinical research project.</detailed_description>
