	<brief_summary>Health care has an increasingly demand for mobile applications (App), but studies are rare, which explore the added value and benefits for patient and physician. Patients in different disease groups or physicians from different specialties are likely to have different demands. Research should focus on selected groups to better understand their individual demands. Our study intends to identify the added value of mobile symptom tracking in a selected subgroup of patients. We designed an App for breast cancer patients, who receive ambulant chemotherapy in a breast center. The patients track regularly their well-being and adverse events (AE) with the smartphone- or web-app and share it with the physician in the medical consultation. The data entry was designed to meet patient needs based on previous usability testing. The reporting of AE and well-being are standardized according to the definitions by CTCAE 4.0 and ECOG-Index to ensure the reliability of patient self-reporting. The primary outcomes are the number of reported AE, the influence on their subjective well-being and the acceptance of context specific information. We will include 150 participants in this study. The calculated power is 91% respectively 80% for a 10 % improvement of well-being and a 2.2 increase of detected AEs. The results will be compared to patients without App and to patients with App but without shared information. - Trial with medical device</brief_summary>
