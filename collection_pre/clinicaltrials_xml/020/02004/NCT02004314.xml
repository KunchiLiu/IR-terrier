	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of chloroquine in individuals infected with HIV. Researchers will aim to determine if chloroquine treatment in participants whose viral loads are suppressed on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), results in improved immune activation and CD4 cell recovery. The study will recruit 20 individuals and will last approximately 44 weeks. Eligible participants will receive an oral dose of chloroquine (250 mg) once daily from week 8 through week 32. All participants will be asked to have rectal biopsy samples (week 0 and week 32) to study T cell immune activation in the mucosa rectal site.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chloroquine as a Modulator of T Cell Immune Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical data has identified chloroquine as a potential modulator of immune activation. The study's dose of chloroquine is the same as the dose recommended for patients having autoimmune diseases. In these autoimmune cases, a daily dose of chloroquine at 250 mg for 12 weeks has shown improvement in symptoms and decreases in inflammatory cytokines synthesis and a reduction in TLR -mediated immune activation. Study findings could help provide information about where and under what circumstances chloroquine treatment may reduce T cell activation and help restore circulating CD4 T cells.</detailed_description>
