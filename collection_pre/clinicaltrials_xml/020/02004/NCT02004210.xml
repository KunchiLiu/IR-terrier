	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Trial Comparing TACE and TARE in Unilobar Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potentially curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include surgical resection, liver transplantation, and local ablative therapy. However, HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages in Korea. Unresectable advanced HCCs are not suitable for other curative therapies. For these patients, the optimal treatment remains largely controversial. As a palliative treatment, the benefit of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) had been shown in patients with unresectable HCC by several trials. Recently,transarterial radioembolization (TARE) has been introduced for the treatment of advanced HCC. However, the efficacy of TARE compared to TACE is uncertain. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of conventional transarterial chemoembolization(TACE) and transarterial radioembolization in patients with unilobar advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.</detailed_description>
