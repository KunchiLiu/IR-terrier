	<brief_title>Proof of Concept of VLY-686 in Subjects With Treatment-Resistant Pruritus Associated With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to be conducted at two sites in Germany. Sixty-eight (68) subjects with chronic pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis, will be randomized to either the placebo group or the active treatment group with VLY-686. The study is divided into three phases: the screening phase, the evaluation phase, and the post-therapy follow-up phase. The screening phase comprises a screening visit when subjects' preliminary eligibility for the study will be evaluated and a wash-out period when subjects will stop use of any current topical or systemic treatment. The evaluation period comprises 4 weeks of randomized double-blind treatment. The post-therapy follow-up period consists of a wash-out followed by a clinic visit for safety assessments and to check for residual efficacy of the treatment.</detailed_description>
