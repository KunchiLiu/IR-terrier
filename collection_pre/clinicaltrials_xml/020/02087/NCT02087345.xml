	<brief_summary>Dental erosions, the chemical dissolution of enamel without bacterial involvement, are considered to be an established complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by the Montreal global consensus statement. Given the high prevalence of dental erosions and the absence of any pH-impedance data or medical management guidelines for GERD-associated dental erosions, reflux characteristics will be characterized using questionnaires, endoscopy and esophageal pH-impedance testing, in successive patients dental erosions referred by dentists for evaluation of GERD. For assessment of the role of additional factors besides H+ activity in the refluxate, a sample of gastric juice will be aspirated during endoscopy and frozen for analysis of pepsin and other proteases. Prognostic factors for progression of dental erosions will be determined by repeating the evaluation after chronic dosing with esomeprazole 20mg twice-daily, which is prescribed to all patients.</brief_summary>
