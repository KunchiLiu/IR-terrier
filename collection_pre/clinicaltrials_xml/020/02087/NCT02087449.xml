	<brief_title>Evaluate E1 Wear, Clinical Performance of E1 Liner in THA in Korean Patient Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful surgical procedures in general. Yet, a few problems remain unsolved, and aseptic loosening is probably the most important of them. One of the main reasons for aseptic loosening in THA is the foreign body reaction caused by the wear particles. Since the late 1990s, the orthopedic industry has been developing highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) materials to capitalize on the increased wear resistance. In 2007, E1Â® Antioxidant Infused Technology was developed to reduce wear rate, maintain mechanical properties and prevent oxidative degradation.</detailed_description>
