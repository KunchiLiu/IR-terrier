	<brief_title>Use of Corticosteroids in Children With Cellulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cellulitis is a common skin and soft tissue infection in the pediatric population. Although most of the time treatment could be administered on an ambulatory setting , sometimes it may require hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic administration. Using corticosteroids during antibiotic treatment may reduce inflammation and length of stay. Objective: to evaluate the efficacy of using corticosteroids as adjuvant treatment during the first 48 hours of treatment after hospitalization in patients with cellulitis. Patients and methods: this is a double blind, randomized, controlled trial that will take place at pediatric hospital, during one year. It will include children aged 1 month to 18 years, admitted due to cellulitis. Once included in the clinical trial, the patients will be randomized to receive dexamethasone 0,6 mg/kg/day or placebo (saline solution) during the first 48 hours. Considering an average stay of 4 Â± 2 days, we calculated a sample size of 124 children (62 children per group) to detect a 25% difference (1 day reduction) in the length of stay, with a power of 80% and a confidence of 95%.</detailed_description>
