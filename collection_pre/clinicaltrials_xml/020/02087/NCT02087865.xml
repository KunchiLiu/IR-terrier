	<brief_summary>This 24-week study will examine the sensitivity of functional MRI to detect brain changes caused by donepezil HCL (a cholinesterase inhibitor) in healthy older adults at genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease. Participants with a family history of Alzheimer's Disease will be eligible for this study. Participants without a family history of AD will also be enrolled to serve as a control group.</brief_summary>
