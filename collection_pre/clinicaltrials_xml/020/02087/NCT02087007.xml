	<brief_title>A Therapeutic Confirmatory Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Cilostazol in Subjects With Vasospastic Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel group, Therapeutic confirmatory Study. The subject who has at least one episode of chest pain weekly and at least two episodes of chest pain during last week despite Amlodipine 5mg qd taking during 2 weeks will have treatment of Pletaal(Cilostazol) or Placebo for 4 weeks. Pletaal(Cilostazol) is taken 100mg oral tablets bid during 2 weeks after dosing of Pletaal(Cilostazol) 50mg oral tablets bid during 2 weeks. Placebo of Pletaal(Cilostazol) is used as the control medication.</detailed_description>

Patients showing angina attack even while resting during the screening, diagnosed with vasospastic angina within the previous 3 months by meeting at least one of the 3 definitions, and accompanying insignificant (stenosis rate &lt;50%) coronary artery disease documented by coronary angiography within the last 3 months [temporary antispastic agents (monotherapies or a combination of Verapamil and Nitroglycerin, anticoagulants) for coronary angiography are allowed] Chest pain accompanied by at least 2 temporary, closely located ST elevations or depressions of 0.1mV or greater in the absence of ergonovine provoked coronary angiography. Positive Intracoronary (IC) or Intravenous (IV) Ergonovine provocation test; ischemic ECG change accompanied by chest pain and spasm reducing the coronary diameter by 90% or more (at least 2 temporary, closely located ST elevations or depressions of 0.1mV or greater on 12lead ECG) 3. Patients who reported at least 1 episode of chest pain in a week during amlodipine runin period and at least 2 episodes in the final week. 4.

Hemorrhage (hemophilia, capillary fragility, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract bleeding, hemoptysis, vitreous hemorrhage, etc.) or such predisposition (active peptic ulcer, hemorrhage suspected at Cilostazol administration for surgical wound within the last 3 months, proliferative diabetic retinopathy) 9. History of hypersensitivity to the ingredients of Cilostazol, amlodipine, dihydropyridines such as nitroglycerine, and nitrates 10. Severe aortic stenosis 11. History of shock 12. Hypotension with systolic pressure of below 90mmHg at screening 13. Severe anemia with hemoglobin 6.5g/dl or below at screening 14. History of glaucoma 15. ST change abnormality not interpretable on ECG at screening 16. Congestive heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% on echocardiography at screening or within the last 3 months 17.

History of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 20. Heart rate &gt;100 bpm at screening via vital sign: tachycardia 21. Uncontrolled hypertension with systolic pressure ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic pressure ≥ 100 mmHg at screening 22. Creatinine level ≥ 1.5 mg/dL at screening 23. AST or ALT &gt; x3 ULN(Upper Limit of Normal) at screening 24. Platelet count &lt; 100,000mm3 at screening 25. QT prolongation of QTcB &gt; 450 msec in male and QTcB&gt;470 msec in female subjects at screening 26. Women of childbearing potential with positive pregnancy test at screening 27.
