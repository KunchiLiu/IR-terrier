	<brief_summary>This study will determine the minimal duration of red blood cell (RBC) storage that leads to increases in circulating non-transferrin-bound iron in healthy human volunteers post-transfusion. The results from this study will help guide national guidelines for appropriate duration of RBC storage prior to transfusion, which is currently 6 weeks by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria. The overall objective of this research is to improve the safety of refrigerated storage of red blood cells before transfusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duration of Red Blood Cell Storage Prior to Transfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies suggest that older stored blood is associated with worse outcomes in certain hospitalized patients. Red cells may be stored in a refrigerator prior to transfusion for up to 42 days by current FDA standards. Refrigerator storage of red cells is associated with a storage lesion and the survival of transfused red cells decreases with increasing storage time, thus older blood is associated with an increased delivery of hemoglobin-iron to certain parts of the body. The investigators have preliminary data in mice and humans suggesting that delivery of a significant iron load from aged red cells leads to the production of a potentially toxic form of circulating iron called non-transferrin-bound iron. In this prospective study of healthy volunteers, each subject will be randomized to receive transfusion of one RBC unit after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks of storage. The primary outcome will be the 24 hr area under the curve (AUC) of the serum non-transferrin bound iron concentration calculated from samples collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours after transfusion.</detailed_description>
