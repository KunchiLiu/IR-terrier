	<brief_summary>Food allergy (FA) derives from a dysregulation of oral tolerance mechanisms. Studies suggest a crucial role for enteric microflora in oral tolerance development. An altered composition of intestinal microflora results in an unbalanced local and systemic immune response to food allergens. There are qualitative and quantitative differences in gut microbiota composition in children with food allergy. These findings support the concept that specific beneficial bacteria from human intestinal microflora, designated probiotics, could restore intestinal microflora homeostasis and prevent or treat FA. The investigators demonstrated that it is possible to stimulate oral tolerance acquisition in children with cow's milk allergy using the most studied probiotic in the pediatric field, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). The main study aim is to identify an innovative strategy to induce oral tolerance acquisition by a selective manipulation of intestinal microflora.</brief_summary>
