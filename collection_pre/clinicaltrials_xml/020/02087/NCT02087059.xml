	<criteria>1. ≥18 years of age 2. Diagnosis of PMF, PPVMF, or PETMF, regardless of JAK2 mutational status. The diagnostic of PMF will be according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (Thiele et al., 2008) and PPVMF and PETMF according to the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWGMRT) criteria (Barosi et al., 2008). 3. At least one risk factors provided in the definition of IWGMRT (Cervantes et al., 2009; classified as intermediate risk1, intermediate risk2, or high risk) 4. Patients with intermediate risk1 (patients who have only one of the IMGMRT risk factors indicated above ) must have palpable splenomegaly with a length of ≥5 cm from the costal margin to the point of the greatest spleen protrusion. 5. Proportion of blasts in peripheral blood &lt;10% 6. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 7. The following values for bone marrow function prior to treatment: 1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/μL, and 2. Platelet count ≥50,000/μL without administration of a growth factor, thrombopoietin, or platelet transfusion 8. Stem cell transplantation is not a treatment option at present because it is not indicated or because there are no suitable donors. 9. All drugs used to treat MF were discontinued at least 28 days before treatment initiation. 10. Informed consent form should be signed before any screening procedures is performed 1. Hepatic or renal impairment as indicated by the following: Direct bilirubin ≥2fold than the upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5fold ULN Creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL 2. Clinically significant infection by bacteria, fungus, mycobacteria, parasite, or virus (screening and enrollment postponed until completion of antibiotic treatment in patients with an acute bacterial infection that requires antibiotic use) 3. Active hepatitis A, B, or C or HIV infection defined by a positive IgMHA Ab test [hepatitis A virus antibody (immunoglobulin M [IgM])], HBs Ag test (hepatitis B surface antigen), HCV Ab test (hepatitis C virus antibody), or HIV Ab (human immunodeficiency virus antibody) at screening. 4. History of malignancy within the previous 3 years, except for earlystage squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. 5. History of serious congenital or acquired hemorrhagic disease 6. Previous platelet count &lt;25,000/μL or absolute neutrophil count &lt;500/μL, except for patients currently undergoing treatment for a myeloproliferative neoplasm or cytotoxic therapy for any other reason. 7. Splenic irradiation within 12 months before screening 8. Administration of hematopoietic growth factor receptor agonists (erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, romiplostim, eltrombopag) within 14 days before screening or 28 days before treatment initiation. 9. Currently receiving another investigational drug, or received another investigational drug within 30 days before the start of treatment. 10. History of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months before screening 11. Poorly controlled or unstable angina at present 12. Rapid or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at present 13. Active alcohol or drug addiction that could hinder the patient's ability to comply with the study's requirements 14. Pregnant or currently breastfeeding woman 15. Women of childbearing potential or men with reproductive ability who are unwilling to take appropriate contraception measures 16. Patient with any concurrent condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, would jeopardize the safety of the patient or compliance with the protocol 17. History of hypersensitivity to the study drug or a drug with a similar chemical structure</criteria>
