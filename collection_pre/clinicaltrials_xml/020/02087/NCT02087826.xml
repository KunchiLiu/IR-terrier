	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to examine whether specific genes (e.g. SLC16A11) affect how human beings respond to food and a medication that is commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. The food the investigators will be studying is specially prepared to contain protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The drug the investigators are studying is metformin. The investigators hypothesize that physiological responses to the meal and to the medication will differ between carriers and non-carriers of genes associated with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
