	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to measure the postoperative changes in bone mineral density, comparing the Taperloc Complete Reduced Distal Microplasty stem and the standard length Taperloc Complete Reduced Distal stem.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Taperloc Complete Microplasty vs Taperloc Complete Standard: Randomized Controlled Study on Bone Mineral Density</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Taperloc Microplasty cementless stem is designed to transmit load to the proximal femur, thereby preserving bone density, and preventing long term instability and loosening secondary to proximal bone resorption. The primary aim of this study is therefore to compare the postoperative changes in bone density with the Taperloc Microplasty stem, using the standard length Taperloc stem as a control. In addition, the Taperloc stem has historically had a neck angle of 138°. There have been criticisms that this neck angle is too high for the typical Korean population. The newer Taperloc Complete system (both Microplasty and standard length) has a neck angle of 133°. A secondary aim is Occurrence ratio of thigh pain difference between Microplasty and standard stem in Korean Population</detailed_description>
