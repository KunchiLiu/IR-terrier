	<brief_summary>Introduction: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a common cause for reoperation after knee and hip arthroplasty surgery. Debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) is recommended in early infections (&lt; 4 weeks) and stable implants. Aims: To define the success rate of DAIR in early infections and to identify predictors for success. Material and methods: In a retrospective cohort study we included patients with hip- or knee arthroplasties reoperated for an early PJI at Danderyd Hospital 2007-2012. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors affecting success rate. Primary outcome variable was the success of the DAIR treatment. Secondary outcome variable vas risk factors for treatment failure.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients treated with DAIR for early postoperative periprosthetic joint infection after knee or hip arthroplasty surgery (&lt;46 weeks postoperatively) at our institution between 20070101 and 20121201. Chronic or late presenting periprosthetic joint infection (&gt;6 weeks postoperatively), acute hematogenous periprosthetic joint infection, when the periprosthetic joint infection diagnosis criteria according to American Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) 2011 definition of PJI definitions were not fulfilled and when the initial surgical treatment was with other treatment protocol than DAIR including onestage revision and two stage revision</criteria>
