	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the shape, size and appearance of the inside of the uterus six months following an endometrial ablation procedure. Half of the participants will have their ablation performed with a hydrothermal ablation device and the other half will have their ablation performed with a device that uses radiofrequency energy. Participants are randomly assigned to one or the other device. A vaginal ultrasound will be performed before the procedure and again at six months post-procedure. The inside of the uterus will be visualized via hysteroscopy before the procedure and again at six months post-procedure. Measurements will be taken and the investigator will compare photos taken pre-procedure and six months post-procedure.</detailed_description>
