	<criteria>Male or female who has received a single dose of HUMIRA prior to a confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL. Confirmed diagnosis of CD or UC as documented by a Gastroenterologist or physician who diagnosed the CD or UC. Confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL as determined by a biopsy performed on a specimen taken from the patient. Patients 18 years old and older must voluntarily sign and date an IRB/EC approved Informed Consent Form. For patients younger than 18 years old, a parent or legal guardian is required to voluntarily sign and date an IRB/EC approved Informed Consent Form. Pediatric patients will be included in all discussions if possible, in order to obtain their assent. Male or female who has not received at least a single dose of adalimumab prior to a confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL. Unconfirmed diagnosis of HSTCL, CD or UC, respectively. The patient or the patient's HCP is unwilling to participate in this study. The parents or legal guardians (in the case of patients younger than 18 years of age), who are unable and/or unwilling to consent to the patient's participation in this study.</criteria>
