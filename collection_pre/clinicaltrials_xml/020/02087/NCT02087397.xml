	<brief_summary>This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, patient sponsored study of Adipose-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction cells (AD-SVF) implantation delivered into the corpus cavernous in patients with Erectile Dysfunction. The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with diagnosed Erectile Dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells Delivered Into the Corpus Cavernous in Patients With Erectile Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AD-SVF will be collected from the patient's adipose-derived tissue (body fat). Using local anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The adipose tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of the adipose tissue derived stem cells. In addition, peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of platelet rich plasma, which are then combined with the ASC's for direct injection to the Corpus Cavernosum (Penis).</detailed_description>
