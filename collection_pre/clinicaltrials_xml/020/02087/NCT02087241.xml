	<brief_title>Ph II Trial of Carboplatin and Pemetrexed With or Without AZD1775 for Untreated Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised, phase II trial comparing AZD1775 plus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by maintenance AZD1775 and pemetrexed versus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by maintenance pemetrexed in patients with previously untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with TP53 mutations. The primary endpoint of the trial is assessment of progression-free survival (PFS).</detailed_description>
