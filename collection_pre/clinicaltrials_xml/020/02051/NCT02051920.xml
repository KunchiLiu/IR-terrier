	<brief_summary>Since 20 years, the techniques of direct measurement of cardiac stiffness in the diagnosis of myocardial diseases do not exist. We propose a human study evaluating the direct measurement of cardiac ultrasound stiffness by elastography. This study will include 30 patients with cardiac disease whose rigidity varies with underlying disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the stiffness during open heart surgery.</brief_summary>
