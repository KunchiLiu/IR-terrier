	<brief_summary>Predictive factors and biomarkers of response to antidepressants in major depressive disorder are scarce. Beta-arrestins are proteins which inhibit G Protein Coupled Receptors and desensitize serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors. The study hypothesis is that Beta-arrestins 1 and 2 are predictive factors and biomarkers of response to antidepressants in major depressive disorder. In a controlled prospective open naturalistic monocentric 3-month study, 60 patients with a major depressive disorder requiring a treatment with venlafaxine will be included and assessed before treatment, 1 month and 3 months post-treatment. 20 controlled healthy subjects matched for age and gender will also be assessed. The Beta-arrestin pathway will be assessed using genetic polymorphisms, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell measures and functional pathway. Antidepressant response will be assessed using depression scales, olfaction and memory as surrogate markers of neurogenesis.</brief_summary>
