	<brief_summary>Behaviorally and cognitive-behaviorally based therapeutic techniques (BT; CBT) that incorporate exposure therapy useful for treatment of anxiety disorders among typically developing children. Although a large amount of data demonstrate the effectiveness of of BT and CBT approaches for treating anxious youth, there is a gap in the literature for the effectiveness of these approaches for children under the age of seven. Evidence increasingly suggests that family factors such as accommodation and parenting style contribute significantly to the presence of anxiety symptoms as well as treatment outcomes, particularly in young children. These findings stress the importance of using a treatment approach in which parents are directly involved in education, parent training, and generalization of treatment effects. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate a new treatment program, parent-led behavioral treatment, for children ages 3 to 7 years of age who have a principal anxiety disorder diagnosis.</brief_summary>
