	<brief_title>Long-term Safety Follow-up Study of Patients Having Received HepaStem (SAF001)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the SAF001 study is the long-term safety surveillance of the patients post infusion with HepaStem. Furthermore, the evolution of both the metabolic condition and the quality of life are followed. As much as possible, the surveillance will mimic the standard follow-up of the respective diseases (standard of care). The surveillance will end when the patient is undergoing an organ transplant or takes part in another research study. This surveillance will last up to a maximum of 48 months.</detailed_description>
