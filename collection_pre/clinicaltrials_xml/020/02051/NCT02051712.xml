	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is I. To assess whether an individualized exercise training program is superior as compared to usual care with respect to exercise tolerance, II. to assess whether intervention tools that aim to increase exercise adherence are superior to an individualized exercise training alone with respect to exercise tolerance and long-term effects, and III. to identify biomarkers that that may be implemented into novel intervention tools aiming to increase exercise adherence in patients with chronic heart failure.</brief_summary>
