	<brief_summary>- Aging is associated with a progressive and generalized deterioration of physiologic systems and greater incidence of chronic conditions, which ultimately translates into functional impairment, disability and dependency. - Physical activity and exercise have been recognized as key pillars for the management of chronic diseases in support of medical treatment, and essential to increase physiologic function, but there is only limited evidence indicating increased physical function, following exercise interventions. One of the greatest challenges in the science of aging and exercise is to understand whether and to which extent exercise and active life-style may postpone the onset of disability and/or reverse physical impairments. - Maintenance/improvements of physical function and mobility should be considered as primary targets for independent living, active engagement in societal challenges, and, more in general, when promoting "active ageing". - The aim of this study is to collect preliminary data to identify the feasibility and sustainability of an "active life-style intervention" in older adults with reduced mobility receiving a preventive home visit from the public health care authority. - This study will represent the base for a larger phase III parallel group study implemented in the public health care setting, with the specific aim of improving physical function and delay the onset of functional impairment in older adults.</brief_summary>
