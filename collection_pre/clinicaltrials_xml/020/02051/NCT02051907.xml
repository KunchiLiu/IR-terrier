	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of KAM1403 GEL in reducing the symptoms of mild to moderate Radiation Dermatitis. Efficacy will be evaluated by comparing symptoms assessment during and post radiotherapy: erythema, desquamation, edema, moist desquamation and ulceration in the KAM1403 Gel treated group versus a group of subjects treated with the Aloe vera Gel (the control group). In addition, a comparison will be made between subjects' self evaluation in the treatment group versus the control group. Safety will be determined by the number and severity of Adverse Events Device-Related.</brief_summary>
