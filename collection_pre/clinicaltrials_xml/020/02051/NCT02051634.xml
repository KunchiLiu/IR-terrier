	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to explore the effects of fermented papaya preparation (FPP) on whole body inflammation, physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. The investigators will conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study on FPP in older adults. If FPP is found to have a beneficial impact on systematic inflammation in this study population (adults aged 70-100 years old), then this supplement may be a potential treatment option to combat aging.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All of the participants in this research study will be divided randomly into one of two groups: (1) a group taking fermented papaya preparation (FPP) for 8 weeks then taking placebo for 8 weeks or (2) a group taking placebo for 8 weeks then taking FPP for 8 weeks. Placebo sachets do not contain any treatment product. Participants will be assigned randomly to be in one of these two groups. Participants will be asked to take study product for 8 weeks each, and participation in the study will last for a total of approximately 22 weeks. Participants will be asked to attend five study visits at the University of Florida's Institute on Aging - Clinical &amp; Translational Research Building (IOA - CTRB): Screening Visit, Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 3, and Visit 4. Visit 1 will take place approximately 30 days after the Screening Visit. Visit 2 will take place approximately 8 weeks after the Screening Visit. Visit 3 will take place approximately 16 weeks after the Screening Visit. Visit 4 will take place approximately 20 weeks after the Screening Visit. Participants will be asked to fast (i.e., no food or liquids except water) for 8 hours prior to all clinic visits. Each visit will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours. Participants will also be called weekly during the study to ask how they are feel and to find out and if they remembered to take all of their study product. Finally, investigators will call approximately two weeks after participants stop taking the study product to ask how they are feeling.</detailed_description>
