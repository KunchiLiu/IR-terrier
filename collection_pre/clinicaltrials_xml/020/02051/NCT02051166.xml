	<brief_title>Clinical Practice of AECOPD Management in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is widely recognized that the global social and economic burden of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is high; affecting an estimated 64 million people worldwide. It was reported the prevalence of COPD in China population over 40 years old is about 8.2% (Zhong Nanshan et al, 2007). According to the report on China Chronic Disease, COPD is the second disease of Disability Adjusted Life Years. The economic burden of COPD is tremendous in China. Cost analysis in 2006 showed that every COPD patient in urban would pay 1732.24 $ on medical cost every year, indirect cost on nurse and traffic is 231.6 $, total cost would account for 40% of average family income in 2006(Chiang CH.,2008).AECOPD is one of most important cause leading to COPD death. Corticosteroid is essential for AECOPD management and recommended by domestic and international guidelines. But it shows that corticosteroid use for treating AECOPD in China is around 70% from market research in big hospitals, and less report about how steroid is used for AECOPD management was published, including distribution, dosage, treatment duration, etc. The healthcare resources utilization for treating AECOPD in China is also unclear.</detailed_description>
