	<brief_summary>- Phantom limb pain (PLP) refers to pain in a limb that has been amputated or deafferented. Phantom limb pain might be related to brain cortical plastic changes. - The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a series of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) sessions, a non-invasive and focal brain stimulation method, in producing long-term reduction of phantom limb pain among amputees who experience such pain. This is a Crossover sham control.</brief_summary>
