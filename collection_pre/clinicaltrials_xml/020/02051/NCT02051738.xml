	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effect of Food on the Bioavailability of Mebendazole From a Fast-Disintegrating Chewable Formulation of Mebendazole in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (the participant and the study physician know what the participant is getting), randomized (like the flip of a coin), single-center, single-dose, 2-way crossover (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study) study in approximately 16 healthy adult participants. Participants will receive study medication under fed state first and later under fasted state or vice versa. The study consists of 3 phases: screening phase of approximately 3 weeks, an open-label treatment phase consisting of two 6-day treatment periods (Treatment period 1 and 2) with a 7- to 10 day washout between Day 1 of each treatment period, and a safety follow-up phase occurring 7 to 10 days after the last study-related procedure on Day 5 of Treatment Period 2. The study physician will check participant's general health during the study. Total duration of study for each participant will be approximately 48 days.</detailed_description>
