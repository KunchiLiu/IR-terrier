	<brief_summary>Ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) in the right atrium is currently the therapy of choice for the treatment of typical atrial flutter (3,4). It is a curative approach and has a high success rate (5). It has been recognized that patients with typical atrial flutter often complain of atrial fibrillation (1,2). Current clinical and experimental studies confirm the close relationship between atrial flutter (AFL) and atrial fibrillation (AF) and raise a question, if both arrhythmias are different forms of a common electrical phenomenon with atrial fibrillation being the underlying clinical problem (6).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapy of Atrial Flutter by Afib Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current clinical and experimental studies confirm the close relationship between atrial flutter (AFlut) and atrial fibrillation (Afib). After initiation of Afib this may organize under special intrinsic conditions or due to antiarrhythmic medication to AFlut so Afib may be supposed the underlying arrhythmia. Therefore after successful ablation of AFlut this reentrant circuit is not longer possible and Afib persists. After new occurrence of Afib a long diagnostic and therapeutic marathon begins with AF ablation at the end of all therapeutic efforts. This double burden for the patient and the health system can probably be avoided by directly and effectively treating the underlying arrhythmia AF.</detailed_description>
