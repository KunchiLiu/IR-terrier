	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Fluorometholone (FML) 0.1% eyedrops topically applied 4 times a day for 22 days is more efficient than artificial tears (Liquifilm) in dry eye disease (DED) and ameliorates the worsening of the disease after exposure to an adverse controlled environment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Fluorometholone (FML) in Dry Eye Disease (Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca)</brief_title>

Data collected in NCE Visit 3 (V3). 21 days post-treatment. Data collected in adverse controlled environment (ACE) Visit 4 (V4). 22 days post-treatment. Recovery visit in ACE.
