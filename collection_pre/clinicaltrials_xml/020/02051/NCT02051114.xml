	<detailed_description>80% of patients living with rheumatoid arthritis can expect fluctuations in their symptoms over time. Dramatic increases in disease activity are considered flare. This study will follow patients with increased risk for flare prospectively for one year. Serial questionnaires and disease activity scores will be compared to blood samples to better understand the molecular phenotype of rheumatoid arthritis flares.</detailed_description>
