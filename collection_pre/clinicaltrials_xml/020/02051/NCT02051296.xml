	<brief_title>Minocycline to Reduce Pain After Carpal Tunnel Release</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blinded randomized controlled trial. Patients are given 100mg of minocycline 2 hours prior to their procedure and then 100mg two times a day for 5 days. The subjects are then contacted daily to check their level of pain. The investigators' outcome of interest is time to pain resolution. The investigators will perform a futility analysis to assess if a larger trial would be a reasonable next step after this pilot study.</detailed_description>
