Patients who belong to conventional therapy group will be treated with conventional therapy only, and they can receive moxibustion therapy after the clinical trial is finished. IPSS, post void residual volume (PVR) and peak urine flow (Qmax) will be checked to evaluate the effectiveness and safety.</detailed_description>
