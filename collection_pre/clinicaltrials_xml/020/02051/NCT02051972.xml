	<criteria>Subject must have one of the following clinical indications: Chronic atrial fibrillation with 2 or 3° AV or bifascicular bundle branch block (BBB block) ; or Normal sinus rhythm with 2º or 3° AV or BBB block and a low level of physical activity or short expected lifespan (but at least one year); or Sinus bradycardia with infrequent pauses or unexplained syncope with EP findings; and Subject ≥18 years of age; and Subject has life expectancy of at least one year and is a suitable candidate based on overall health and wellbeing; and Subject is not enrolled in another clinical investigation with a treatment arm or that could confound the results of this study; and Subject is willing to comply with clinical investigation procedures and agrees to return for all required followup visits, tests, and exams; and Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent, approved by the EC; and Subject is not pregnant and does not plan on getting pregnant during the course of the study. Known pacemaker syndrome, have retrograde VA conduction or suffer a drop in arterial blood pressure with the onset of ventricular pacing; or Hypersensitivity to &lt; 1 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate; or Mechanical tricuspid valve prosthesis; or Preexisting pulmonary arterial (PA) hypertension (PA systolic pressure exceeds 40mmHg or RV systolic pressure (RVSP) as estimated by echo exceeds 40mmHg) or significant physiologicallyimpairing lung disease (has severe pulmonary disease producing frequent hospitalization for respiratory distress or requiring continuous home oxygen); or Preexisting ventricular pacing or defibrillation leads; or Current implantation of either conventional or subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT); or Presence of implanted vena cava filter; or Evidence of thrombosis in one of the veins used for access during the procedure; or Cardiovascular or peripheral vascular surgery/intervention within 30 days of enrolment; or Presence of implanted leadless cardiac pacemaker</criteria>
