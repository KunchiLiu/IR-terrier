	<brief_summary>As part of the global clinical development program for Dacomitinib, studies are planned in cancer patients in China. An assessment of Dacomitinib pharmacokinetics in Chinese subjects, as required by the Chinese Health Authorities, is therefore warranted. The single 45 mg oral dose pharmacokinetics of Dacomitinib will be characterized.</brief_summary>
