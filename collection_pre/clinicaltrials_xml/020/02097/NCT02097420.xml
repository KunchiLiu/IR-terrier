	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to provide evidence of safety and effectiveness of the study valve. The rationale is to offer a replacement mitral valve for patients with anatomy that is too small for the currently commercially available valves ranging in size from 16mm to 37mm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HALO: A Single Arm Prospective Investigation of the SJM™ Masters HP™ 15mm Rotatable Mechanical Heart Valve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a single arm, prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical investigation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 15mm MHV in subjects five years or less of age with a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning mitral heart valve. The objective will be evaluated by assessing valve-related adverse events, subject survival, subject growth, and echocardiogram assessment of hemodynamic function through the five year follow-up visit as long as the valve remains implanted.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Subject requires mitral valve replacement.* *Subjects undergoing concomitant procedures (e.g. valve repair) are eligible for this study other than those noted in the exclusion criteria. 2. Subject's legally authorized representative gives written consent to participate in the clinical study. 3. Subject is willing and able to return for data collection and followup for the duration of the clinical study. 1. Subject is &gt; 5 years of age. 2. Subject has a contraindication to anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication. 3. Subject has a prosthetic valve(s) at a site other than the mitral valve prior to the study procedure.* *Subjects who have undergone a previous Ross procedure of the pulmonary valve are eligible for this study. 4. Subject requires concomitant replacement of the tricuspid, pulmonary, or aortic valve. 5. Subject has active endocarditis. 6. Subject has active myocarditis. 7. Subject has an acute preoperative neurological deficit that has not returned to baseline or stabilized ≥ 30 days prior to the study procedure. 8. Subject has had an acute cardiac adverse event that has not returned to baseline or stabilized ≥ 48 hours prior to the study procedure. 9. Subject has a noncardiac illness resulting in a life expectancy of &lt; 1 year. 10. Subject has a known requirement for additional cardiac surgery within 12 months after the study procedure. 11. Subject has been previously enrolled and implanted in this study. 12. Subject is participating in another study for an investigational drug and/or device. 13. Subject has any other medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator will interfere with the study results.</criteria>
