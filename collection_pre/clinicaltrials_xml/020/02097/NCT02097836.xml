	<brief_summary>If a child with cerebral palsy does not develop independent sitting balance by 4 years of age, their prognosis for walking is very poor. Surprisingly little is known about how to facilitate head control or upright sitting balance and functional mobility in the child who is not developing these skills. This is one of the first studies that will examine intermediate stages in the development of the postural control system in children with neurologic deficits. Clinical researchers at The Movement Centre in Oswestry, England have developed a method called Targeted Training in which trunk control is trained in children segment by segment using a specific training device. This study aims to examine kinematic and electromyographic changes in a case series of children who undergo a 6-month Targeted Training intervention.</brief_summary>
