	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how an antibiotic, rifampin, may change the blood levels of another antibiotic, daptomycin, in the body. In addition, the effect of polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein (a protein involved in the removal of daptomycin from the body) on the blood levels of daptomycin will be evaluated. The hypotheses are that rifampin will decrease the blood levels of daptomycin and that the effect will be greater for certain P-glycoprotein polymorphisms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, sequential pharmacokinetic study in 12 healthy volunteers. After providing informed consent, participants meeting inclusion criteria will be administered daptomycin 6 mg/kg over 2 minutes and blood and urine samples will be collected over a 24 hour period after infusion. Following this, participants will be given a 13 day supply of rifampin 600 mg/day to be taken at home. After completion of the rifampin course, a second pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed (day 15 overall). Participants will be administered a dose of rifampin 600 mg then once again be administered daptomycin 6 mg/kg over 2 minutes and blood and urine samples will be collected over a second 24 hour period. A blood sample will be obtained at the first study visit for determination of each participant's P-glycoprotein genotype.</detailed_description>
