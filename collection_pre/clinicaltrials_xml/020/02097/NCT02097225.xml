	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of heat shock protein (Hsp)90 inhibitor AT13387 when given together with dabrafenib and trametinib in treating patients with melanoma or solid tumors that have spread to another place in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery and have come back after previous treatment (recurrent). Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387, dabrafenib, and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hsp90 Inhibitor AT13387, Dabrafenib, and Trametinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent Melanoma or Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity, and safety profile of AT13387 (Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387) given weekly in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) and document the 6-month PFS and 1-year overall survival (OS) of patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable melanoma treated with AT13387 given weekly in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib. II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, and AT13387. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387. Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28, and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed, BRAFmutant (V600E/K) solid tumor (dose escalation) (molecularly confirmed using Cobas assay or a comparable Food and Drug Administration [FDA]approved assay) that is metastatic or unresectable, have received and tolerated prior BRAF or BRAF and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor (BRAF targeted) therapy at full dose or not previously received BRAF targeted therapy, and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective; for the dose expansion cohort, patients will be required to have BRAFmutant melanoma as otherwise defined above If test at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)certified laboratory (lab) used a nonFDA approved method, information about the assay must be provided; (FDA approved tests for BRAF V600 mutations in melanoma include: THxID BRAF Detection Kit and Cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test) Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam Prior therapy is allowed; patients may have received any number of prior lines of therapy, including treatment with a BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor; all prior anticancer treatmentrelated toxicities must be less than or equal to grade 1 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE version 4.0;

hormonal contraception is not allowed) from 14 days prior to randomization, throughout the treatment period, and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by the site; exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR; consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate;
