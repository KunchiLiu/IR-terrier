	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare volume- and pressure- controlled ventilation with laryngeal mask airway Guardian in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery in terms of ventilatory efficacy, airway leak pressure (airway protection), ease-of-use and complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Ventilation Modes With Laryngeal Mask Airway Guardian</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Guardian Laryngeal Mask (Ultimate Medical Pty Ltd, Richmond, Vic, Australia) is a new silicone-based single-use extraglottic airway device that forms a seal with the glottis for ventilation and with the hypopharynx for airway protection, and provides a gastric drainage port. The aim of the following perspective, randomized, blind trial study id to compare how the volume-controlled ventilation and pressure-controlled ventilation modes using the Laryngeal Mask Guardian affect the pulmonary mechanics, the gas exchange and the cardiovascular responses particularly in obese patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopy.</detailed_description>
