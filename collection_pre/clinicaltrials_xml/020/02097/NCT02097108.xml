	<brief_summary>This is a 24-week, one arm, open-label, interventional, non-comparative multicenter study to evaluate lipid changes in HIV infected women with hyperlipidemia on boosted PI based regimen after switching their boosted PI to raltegravir at standard dosage with 400mg twice daily. This study aims to study the effect on metabolic profiles by switching hyperlipidemic HIV infected women from a PI based regimen to raltegravir.</brief_summary>
