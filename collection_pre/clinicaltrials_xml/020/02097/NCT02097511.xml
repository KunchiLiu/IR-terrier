	<brief_title>Sarpogrelate Drug Interaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligibility for participation of this study will be determined from demographic information, medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests within 4 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study will be admitted to the Clinical Trial Center of Ajou University Medical Center on the day before dosing (Day -1). On Day 1, Subjects will be dosed study drug (metoprolol tartrate 100 mg once a day only, or metoprolol tartrate 100 mg once a day with sarpogrelate hydrochloride 100 mg three times a day, sarpogrelate hydrochloride 100 mg three times a day pretreatment for three days and metoprolol tartrate 100 mg once a day with sarpogrelate hydrochloride 100 mg three times a day). Pharmacokinetic samplings and blood pressure/pulse rate measurement will be done upto 12 hours after metoprolol tartrate 100 mg dosing. After one week of washout period (Day 8), Subjects will be dosed study drug by crossover manner, and pharmacokinetic samplings and blood pressure/pulse rate measurement will be done upto 12 hours after metoprolol tartrate 100 mg dosing. After one week of washout period (Day 15), Subjects will be dosed study drug by crossover manner, and pharmacokinetic samplings and blood pressure/pulse rate measurement will be done upto 12 hours after metoprolol tartrate 100 mg dosing.</detailed_description>
