	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Daily Disposable Contact Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double-masked, randomised, controlled crossover trial. Subjects were randomized to wear one or the other of the conventional hydriogel lenses; all subjects wore the filcon II 3 lenses. The first randomly assigned lens type was worn for 3 days, with daily replacement, followed by 3 days of wear of the other lens type, with daily replacement.</detailed_description>
