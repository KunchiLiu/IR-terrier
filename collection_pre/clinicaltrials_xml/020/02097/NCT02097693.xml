	<brief_summary>There are limited therapeutical options for patients with secondary dystonia due to cerebral palsy. Pharmacotherapy is often without effect, or side effects are severe. Meanwhile deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be a safe and effective therapy for patients with parkinson´s disease or primary / idiopathic dystonia. Experiences with DBS in patients with dyskinetic cerebral palsy are limited with heterogeneous data. With STIM-CP we investigate the effect of DBS on quality of life in young patients with a dyskinetic movement disorder (dyskinetic cerebral palsy) due to perinatal hypoxic brain injury. Additionally, the effect of DBS on motor development, speech, memory, attention, cognition and pain perception will be assessed. In total, 20 patients aged 7-18 years diagnosed with dyskinetic cerebral palsy, who will receive DBS, should be included. 11 German DBS-centres will participate in the trial. We assume that DBS reduces the severity of dystonia and improves the quality of life in these patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The treating physician has chosen GPiDBS for the treatment of the secondary dystonia caused by cerebral palsy in this patient Patient and/or legal representative, if the patient is underaged or not capable to give consent himself, have chosen GPiDBS as treatment The consent to participate in the trial of the underaged patient, if he is capable to understand the study requirements, is required Age at enrolment 718 years Diagnosis of secondary dystonia due to cerebral palsy caused by perinatal hypoxic injury Antidystonic pharmacotherapy insufficient (e.g. Jankovic J. Medical treatment of dystonia. Movement disorders, Vol. 28, No. 7, 2013) 67 Stable antidystonic medication over the last 30 days Globus pallidus internus (pars posterior) and thalamus (motor part) intact on MRI (not older than 2 years if possible) No fixed severe skeletal deformations with loss of function, which need immediate orthopaedic surgical intervention Sufficient compliance of the patient or the legal representative if the patient is underaged or not capable to give consent himself to take part in the study Informed consent to take part in the study from patient and/or legal representative if the patient is underaged or not capable to give consent himself Patient and/or legal representative if the patient is underaged or not capable to give consent himself, understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides written informed consent before any studyspecific tests or procedures are performed • Patients with known primary (e.g. DYT1) or idiopathic dystonia Severe axial hypotonia with total loss of head control (e.g. absence of control at "upper thoracic level" in the SATCo score) (medication effect excluded) Fixed hemidystonia Severe spasticity in knee and elbowflexors and extensors (Modified Ashworth Scale &gt;3) Fixed severe skeletal contractions with loss of function which require immediate orthopaedic surgical intervention Patients with other severe concurrent neurological disease (e. g. brain tumor, neurodegenerative diseases, trauma etc.) Condition likely to require use of MRI in the future Any intracranial abnormality or medical condition that would contraindicate DBS surgery Any findings in neuropsychological screening assessments that would contraindicate DBS surgery Any current drug and / or alcohol abuse Any history of frequent grandmal seizures without response to anticonvulsive treatment Any other active implanted device (e.g. Cochlear implant, pacemaker), whether turned on or off, would be allowed provided that they do not interfere with functioning of the device. Any previous brain surgery that would interfere with the placement of the leads or the functioning of the device. A history of neurostimulation intolerance in any area of the body. Currently on any anticoagulant medications that cannot be discontinued during perioperative period. Any significant medical condition that is likely to interfere with study procedures or likely to confound evaluation of study endpoints, including any terminal illness with survival &lt;12 months. Participation in another drug, device, or biologics trial concurrently or within the preceding 30 days; any other trial participation should be approved by the Principal Investigator. A female that is breastfeeding or of child bearing potential with a positive urine pregnancy test or if a person is sexually active not using sufficient contraception with a Pearl Index of less than 1% including all forms of hormonal contraception ("antibabypill", hormonal plaster, NuvaRing®, Implanon®, hormonal depot injections, contraceptive coil), the tubal ligature (female sterilization). Alternatively, the female of child bearing potential is sexually abstinent.</criteria>
