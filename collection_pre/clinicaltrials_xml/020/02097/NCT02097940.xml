	<brief_title>Influence of Sensorimotor Treatment in the Balance of Soccer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: To investigate the influence of the sensorimotor treatment in balance, agility and functionality soccer players assessed using force platform, functional tests and questionnaires. Methods: This study was characterized as a randomized clinical trial. 20 male soccer players was assessed by means of questionnaires, force platform in one foot, and functional tests of balance and agility (Side Hop Test, Figure of Eight Hop Star Excursion Balance Test and Test). To the platform, the parameters of the center pressure (COP) in the anterior- posterior and medial -lateral directions was used for analysis, to functional tests the time-second performance was analyzed. Initially all athletes respond to the questionnaires, was evaluated on the force platform and through functional testing by blind evaluators. Following, they were randomized to treatment groups (n=10) and control (n=10). The treatment group performed 6 weeks of proprioceptive exercises with shifts and one-leg jumps and bipedal support. The control group remained in soccer training. At the end of the treatment protocol and all were reassessed following the cross-over, where the control group performed the same treatment sensory motor was developed.</detailed_description>
