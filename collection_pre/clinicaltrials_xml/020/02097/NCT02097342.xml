	<brief_title>Effect of Linagliptin on Insulin Sensitivity and Pancreatic Beta Cell Function in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study of 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) . Patients with T2DM in the age group 30-65 years and duration of diabetes less than five years will be screened. After exclusion, those who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the study. Once eligibility criteria are confirmed, patients will be educated about their disease and will be advised weight maintenance diabetic diet and exercise throughout the study period. Patients will be randomized to three groups - linagliptin (5mg OD) or voglibose (0.2mg TDS) or placebo OD. Metformin will be continued in all patients. To evaluate the effect of linagliptin on insulin sensitivity and beta cell function, independent of changes in HbA1c, the voglibose group is included. Each group will have 10 patients and will be followed up for 6 months. Both patients and physicians will be blinded to the treatment. After having written informed consent, a detailed history and a thorough clinical examination will be done in all subjects including measurement of height, weight, body mass index and waist circumference. Hemoglobin, liver function tests, renal function tests, lipid profile, HbA1c, fasting plasma insulin , C-peptide, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index(HOMA-1R) and homeostasis model assessment-beta cell function index (HOMA-Î²) will be done at baseline. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study and a mixed meal test will be performed in all patients (on different days) at baseline and after 6 months of follow up. Biochemical parameters will be measured again 6 months after therapy. Fasting and post-prandial blood glucose will be done monthly for 6 months.</detailed_description>
