	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To quantify the benefits of the SENATOR decision support software on the reduction of ADR rates in older hospitalized patients. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the effect of SENATOR with regard to use of appropriate non‐pharmacological therapies in subjects with one core geriatric syndrome. Tertiary Objectives: to examine the association of SENATOR use with subject survival, morbidity and health related quality of life. Health Economic Objective: To examine the potential health economic consequences of using SENATOR. There are two study periods: Period I: Prospective multinational, multicentre observational study to estimate the baseline adjudicated medical and surgical ADR rates by clinical sub speciality in 6 international sites. Period II: Prospective multinational, multicentre, cluster randomized, two parallel arm, open label, controlled trial, with blinded outcome ascertainment, of the efficacy of SENATOR software in reducing ADRs in older hospitalized subjects.</brief_summary>
