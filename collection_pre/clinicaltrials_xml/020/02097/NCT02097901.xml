	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that microfractures in the footprint of the humerus will aid to improve the tendon healing to the bone. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the use of microfractures at the footprint of the rotator cuff will improve the tendon healing when reinserted. Patients undergoing surgery for a rotator cuff injury will be randomised to repair with or without microfracture.</brief_summary>
