	<brief_summary>Primary objective is to evaluate the immune response to vaccination with tetanus diphtheria toxoids vaccine (Td) in participants with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) who have been treated with Tecfidera (BG00012) versus those treated with non pegylated interferon (IFN). Secondary objective is to evaluate the immune response to vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) [a mostly T cell-independent humoral response] and meningococcal polysaccharide diphtheria conjugate vaccine, quadrivalent (MCV4) [T cell-dependent neoantigen response].</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Must have a confirmed diagnosis of RRMS per the 2010 McDonald criteria. Must have a known tetanus immunization history with most recent tetanus vaccination given 2 to 15 years prior to Screening and an antitetanus IgG titer at Screening that is less than or equal to onehalf the upper limit of detection for the assay. Must have been on a stable approved dose of Tecfidera (240 mg twice daily [BID]) [Group 1] for ≥6 months or on a stable approved dose of a nonpegylated IFN (e.g., Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, Extavia) [Group 2] for ≥3 months prior to Day 1. Key Clinical relapse requiring treatment within 30 days prior to Day 1. Pneumococcal vaccination within 5 years prior to Screening. Previous exposure to meningococcal vaccines. Known hypersensitivity to Td, PPSV23, or MCV4 or their components. NOTE: Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
