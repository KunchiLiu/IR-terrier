	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a larger trial comparing olanzapine and aprepitant and to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of these two medications to treat nausea and vomiting in children receiving chemotherapy. Children receiving 2 cycles of chemotherapy with a high risk of causing nausea and vomiting will receive olanzapine in one cycle and aprepitant in another cycle. Children will be randomized to see which medicine they receive first. The investigators will record the number of extra medications used for nausea, the number of times a child vomits, and the amount of nausea the child feels each day.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Olanzapine and Aprepitant to Prevent Nausea and Vomiting in Children Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a pilot study, designed as a randomized, crossover study comparing olanzapine and aprepitant in pediatric oncology patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of recruitment and data collection for conducting a larger trial aimed at comparing olanzapine and aprepitant as antiemetic regimens and establishing efficacy of this regimens for pediatric patients receiving HEC. Secondary objectives are to obtain preliminary data regarding the effectiveness of olanzapine and aprepitant as well as the tolerability of olanzapine in the pediatric oncology population. Each patient must be planned to undergo at least 2 cycles of the same cycle of HEC. Each patient will be randomized to receive olanzapine or aprepitant in the first cycle of chemotherapy, and then will receive the other agent in a second cycle of chemotherapy. Patients will also receive ondansetron and dexamethasone with each cycle. Patients with CNS tumors will not receive dexamethasone. Response will be measured objectively recording number of emesis and use of breakthrough medications. The medications chosen for breakthrough medications will be at the treating physicians discretion. A complete response will be no episodes of emesis or use of breakthrough medications. A partial response is one or less episodes of emesis and one or less use of breakthrough medications. Nausea will be measured based on parent and patient scales and will be a separate measure, not included in the compete or partial response.</detailed_description>
