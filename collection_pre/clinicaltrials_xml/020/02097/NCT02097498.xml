	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the present proposal is to assess whether medical simulation can enhance the safety and proficiency profile of paramedics performing prehospital endotracheal intubation, and whether feedback from an airway management expert observing the simulation enhances skill retention after 12 and 24 months. Since no validated proficiency assessment tool currently exists to measure the skill of paramedics in airway management, one will be developed and tested. Using this tool, 250 paramedics in central Ohio, will undergo simulation training similar to that required for certification. A baseline assessment of proficiency will be obtained. One group will be randomized to receive simulation training similar to that required for certification, while the other group will receive feedback from an airway management expert linked to the simulation test site via a 2-way audio-video feed. Both groups of paramedics will be reassessed at 12, and 24 months to determine whether skill level was maintained or whether skills deteriorated, and whether expert intervention had any impact on skill retention.</brief_summary>
