	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether high-volume nasal rinses with a manuka honey/saline mixture will improve symptom scores, nasal endoscopic findings and CT scan findings compared to nasal saline rinse without manuka honey in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Manuka honey is a honey made from bees that drink the nectar from tea (manuka) trees in New Zealand. It has been shown to have antibacterial activity against common bacteria that cause chronic sinusitis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If the subject chooses to participate in the study, the subject will be asked to fill out a symptom questionnaire at the beginning of the study and at each follow-up visit. The subject will be randomly assigned (much like the flip of a coin) to one of two treatment arms in addition to the prescribed medical treatments: 1) nasal rinses twice daily with a saline solution (standard therapy) or 2) nasal rinses with a saline solution mixed with manuka honey (the experimental therapy.) Subjects in the manuka honey/saline rinse arm will perform the experimental rinses twice daily for one month, and then will continue with saline rinses twice daily, with manuka honey added to the rinses only as needed. Nasal rinsing of some kind will be continued through the entire study period.</detailed_description>
