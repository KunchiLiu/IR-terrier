	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Age &gt; 18 years. 2. De novo stenotic lesion(s) in the superficial femoral artery located at least 1 cm distal to the femoral bifurcation and &gt; 5 cm above the joint space of the knee. 3. Patient has symptomatic intermittent claudication affecting at least the target leg (Rutherford Class 23). Patients should have first received conservative medical management of their symptoms prior to study inclusion. The symptoms can be bilateral. 4. The study patient has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by the ethics committee of the respective clinical site. 5. The study patient agrees to comply with all required postprocedure study requirements. Baseline Inclusion Criteria 1. Reference vessel diameter (RVD) 5.0 6.0 mm measured by an objective measurement such as online Quantitative Vessel Analysis (QVA). 2. Target lesion length ≤ 90 mm; total occlusion length &lt; 40 mm. 3. Target lesion has a ≥70% diameter stenosis. 4. Angiographic evidence of at least one runoff vessel to the ankle/foot without hemodynamically significant stenosis (&gt;50% diameter stenosis) that does not require any treatment within 3 months of the index procedure. 5. Procedural access can be accomplished via contralateral vascular access or if antegrade access no closure device can be utilized and closure has to occur via manual pressure. 6. Patent common and external iliac: TASC A &amp; B iliac lesions may be treated at the time of index procedure (before treatment of the target lesion) if residual stenosis is ≤30%. Exclusion Criteria 1. Previous vascular surgery/endovascular treatment of the target lesion. 2. Revascularization of target vessel within 30 days of study procedure. 3. Critical limb ischemia defined as Rutherford Becker Category 46. 4. Known coagulation disorders or intolerance or allergies to aspirin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine, heparin, any scaffold components, contrast agents which cannot be adequately premedicated. 5. Life expectancy ≤12 months. 6. Planned procedure that necessitates the discontinuation of antiplatelet medications used in conjunction with the investigational device within 3 months postprocedure. 7. Inability to walk due to orthopedic or other nonvascular complications. 8. Pregnancy or breast feeding or patient desires to become pregnant. 9. Nonatherosclerotic lesion (e.g. vasculitis). 10. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level &gt; 220 µmol/L or &gt; 2.5 mg/dl, or patient is on dialysis). 11. Patient has medical condition(s) which could affect study assessments or may adversely affect the safety and/or success of the study treatment. 12. Active systemic infection or lower limb infection of any nature. 13. White Blood Cells (WBC) ≤ 3,000 cells/mm3. 14. Myocardial infarction within 30 days prior to the study procedure. 15. Stroke within 90 days prior to the study procedure. 16. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation. 17. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study. Note: Trials requiring extended followup for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials. 18. Prior use of paclitaxeleluting products in the target limb less than 6 months prior to index procedure. 19. Patient has known unstable angina. Baseline Exclusion Criteria 1. Target lesion treatment with a drug eluting balloon. 2. Target lesion treatment with atherectomy, laser, or cryoplasty (use of a cutting or scoring balloon is permitted prior to scaffold implantation only). 3. Suspicion for or evidence of subintimal passage of guidewire. 4. Severely calcified lesion(s). 5. Target lesion which, based on two angiographic orthogonal views, exhibit a persistent balloon deformity during predilatation with a nominally sized balloon. 6. Target vessel (superficial femoral artery) has an angiographically significant (&gt; 50% diameter stenosis) lesion located distally or proximally to the target lesion. 7. Acute embolic complication following predilatation. 8. Target vessel contains an acute thrombus. 9. Aneurysm in target vessel or coexisting clinically significant aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta, iliac or popliteal arteries. 10. Intervention in the infrainguinal arteries outside of the target lesion. 11. Planned procedure within 30 days after the index procedure. 12. Positive pregnancy test for females of child bearing potential.</criteria>
