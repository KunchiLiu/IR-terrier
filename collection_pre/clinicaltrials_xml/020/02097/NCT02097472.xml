	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of PATH-wSP, administered intramuscularly to healthy Kenyan adults and toddlers who have been primed with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). Additionally, the study will explore whether a measurable immune response is elicited when PATH-wSP is administered to healthy Kenyan adults and toddlers who have been primed with PCV.</brief_summary>
