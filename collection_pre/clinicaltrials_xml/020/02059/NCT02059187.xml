	<brief_summary>This 24-week study is a safety and efficacy comparison of MK-1293 and Lantus™ in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the mean change in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) from baseline is non-inferior (with margin of 0.4%) in participants treated with MK-1293 compared with that in participants treated with Lantus™.</brief_summary>
