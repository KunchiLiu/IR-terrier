	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of MK-1293 to Lantus™ in participants with T1DM. The primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the mean change in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) from baseline is non-inferior in participants treated with MK-1293 compared with participants treated with Lantus™.</brief_summary>
