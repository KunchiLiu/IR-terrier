	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study evaluate the effect of the method of administration of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells for the duration of of functioning aorto-coronary bypass grafts in the surgical treatment of coronary heart disease, to assess the degree of effectiveness depending on the method of transplantation (intramyocardial, intracoronary).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Additional estimation of safety: 1. Assessment of EuroScore II. 2. The duration of stay in the intensive care unit. 3. Restoration of cardiac rhythm at the end of the main stage of operation (defibrillation / self-recovery). 4. The time of extracorporeal circulation. 5. Time of anoxia. 6. The amount of blood loss by drainage in the 1st day. 7. The amount of discharge during the second day. 8. Troponin I at 1, 2, 3 postoperative days. 9. Postoperative complications (hydrothorax, hydropericardium, arrhythmias). Predicting the results of treatment (the effect of a number of parameters): 1. Age. 2. Gender. 3. The body mass index. 4. Diabetes. 5. Smoking. 6. Family history of cardiovascular events. 7. Duration of ischemic heart disease. 8. Serum total cholesterol (+ fractions). 9. Leukocytosis and CRP level (initial level and rate of decrease in the postoperative period). 10. The level of creatinine. 11. The presence / absence of extracardiac arteriopathy. 12. The intramyocardial or intracoronary injection of BM-MNCs. 13. Assessment of the bone marrow: the number of nucleated cells, CD34 +, CD133 +.</detailed_description>
