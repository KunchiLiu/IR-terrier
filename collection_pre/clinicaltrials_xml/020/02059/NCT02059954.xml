	<brief_summary>Hysterectomy for benign indication is one of the most common surgical procedures in women. Numerous reviews and guidelines recommend the vaginal approach for benign hysterectomy, but the proportion of laparoscopic (and robotic) hysterectomies is increasing. This study will compare a range of clinical and subjective outcomes of vaginal vs. total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Outcomes include operating time, postoperative recovery, return to work as well as cosmesis, quality of life and sexual health.</brief_summary>
