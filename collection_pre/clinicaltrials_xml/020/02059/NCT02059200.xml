	<brief_summary>Since a few years, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been used as treatment for patients suffering from recurrent depression. Though a number of studies show that MBCT is effective in this population and MBCT reduces the chances of relapse/recurrence in recurrent depressive patients, the chance of a new depression developing after end of treatment is still considerable. Ergo, there is room for improvement. Especially the development of a non-judging or compassionate attitude towards all experience seems to mediate the treatment effect. It is therefore our expectation that a follow-up intervention that focuses specifically on self-compassion could prove very useful in elaborating on the effects of MBCT. The research question of this research is therefore: what is the effect of compassion training in people suffering from recurrent depression who have already received MBCT training?</brief_summary>
