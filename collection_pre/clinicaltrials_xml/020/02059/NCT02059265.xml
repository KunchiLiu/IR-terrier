	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well dasatinib works in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, endometrial, or peritoneal cancer that has come back or is persistent. Dasatinib may shrink patients' tumors by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Endometrial or Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the clinical activity of dasatinib in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, and endometrial clear cell carcinoma using objective tumor response (complete and partial): in patients without loss of BRG-associated factor 250a (BAF250a) expression and in patients with loss of BAF250a expression. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the nature and degree of toxicity in this patient population treated with this regimen in patients with and without loss of BAF250a expression. II. To examine the progression-free survival and overall survival for this patient population receiving dasatinib in patients with and without loss of BAF250a expression. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the agreement between BAF250a immunohistochemistry and AT rich interactive domain 1A (SWI-like) (ARID1A) mutation status using next generation sequencing performed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. OUTLINE: Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent or persistent ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneum, and endometrial clear cell carcinoma; primary tumors must be at least 50% clear cell histomorphology in order to be eligible or have a histologically documented recurrence with at least 50% clear cell histomorphology; in addition, the tumors should be negative for expression of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) antigen (with the exception of endometrial cancers where WT1 stains are not required) and estrogen receptor (ER) antigen by immunohistochemistry; focal, weak, ER staining of tumor cells (&lt; 5%) is permitted; appropriate tissue sections must be available for histologic evaluation for central pathology review by Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG); immunohistochemical stained slides for ER and WT1 antigen must be available for review by GOG If the primary tumor had at least 50% clear cell histomorphology, a biopsy of the recurrent or persistent tumor is not required; however, immunohistochemical studies of the primary tumor for ER and WT1 antigens should be performed and the slides submitted to the GOG for review; the percentage of clear cell histomorphology must be documented in the pathology report or in an addendum to the original report; if slides of the primary tumor are not available for review due to disposal of slides by the histology laboratory (typically 10 years after diagnosis), biopsy of recurrent or persistent disease is required If the primary tumor had less than 50% clear cell histomorphology (or if slides of the primary tumor are not available for review), a biopsy of the recurrent or persistent tumor is required to confirm at least 50% clear cell histomorphology and lack of immunoreactivity for ER and WT1 antigens by immunohistochemistry; the percentage of involvement must be documented in the pathology report or in an addendum to the original report Patients must have results from the determination of BAF250a immunohistochemistry (IHC) status and must have a BAF250a expression status that is currently open to enrollment All patients must have measurable disease; measurable disease is defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1); measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt; 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Patients must have had one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease Patients must be &gt;= 3 weeks from last chemotherapy or radiation (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) Patients must have progressed on, be ineligible for, or have declined participation in GOG0254 provided that protocol is actively accruing patients Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 Bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase ALT (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 3 x ULN Patients who are on concomitant medications that are STRONG inducers or inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) enzyme should stop 2 weeks prior to first dose of dasatinib, if all other eligibility has been confirmed Corrected QT (QTc) interval on electrocardiogram must be =&lt; 480 msec (Fridericia correction) Patients who have received one prior regimen must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2; patients who have received two or more prior regimens must have GOG performance status of 0 or 1 Patients who have met the preentry requirements Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information Prior treatment with dasatinib, imatinib or nilotinib Patients with symptomatic effusions (pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal) and/or those who have required a procedure for symptomatic effusions within 4 weeks of start of dasatinib are ineligible Patients with a history of cardiac disease including: (1) uncontrolled angina, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within six months prior to study entry, (2) congenital long QT syndrome, (3) clinical significant ventricular arrhythmias The concomitant use of histamine (H)2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) with dasatinib is not recommended; the use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving dasatinib therapy; if antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered two hours before or after the dose of dasatinib; patients who cannot tolerate discontinuation of H2 blockers or PPIs are ineligible Therapeutic anticoagulation is not contraindicated, but for those patients on therapeutic anticoagulation, alteration in coagulation parameters is expected following initiation of dasatinib; for patients on therapeutic anticoagulation, coagulation parameters should be assessed weekly for the first cycle following initiation of dasatinib, weekly for the first cycle following a dose reduction, and weekly for a minimum of two weeks after stopping dasatinib Patients whose circumstances do not permit completion of the study or the required followup Patients who are pregnant or nursing; women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for 3 months after completion of therapy; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours of starting drug is required Patients who have a major surgical procedure, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to the first date of treatment on this study, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study; patients with placement of vascular access device or core biopsy within 7 days prior to the first date of treatment on this study Patients with other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, who had (or have) any evidence of other cancer present within the last 5 years or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible Patients who are unable to swallow pills</criteria>
