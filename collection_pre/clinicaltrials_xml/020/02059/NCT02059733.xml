	<detailed_description>Study duration is expected to be completed in a period of 4 year. This study is a uncontrolled, open-label, non-randomized, parallel, and cross-sectional study. Total 130 subjects, including 20 patients with PD, 20 patients with MSA, 20 patients with PSP, 20 patients with CBS, 20 patients with VaP, 20 patients with ET, and 10 patients with DT, will be enrolled. Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion criteria according the subject grouping, each subject will have 3 visits in this study, as one screening visit, one imaging visit, and one safety evaluation visit. Safety measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.</detailed_description>
