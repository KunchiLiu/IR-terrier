	<brief_summary>The Belmont Rapid Infuser is a device currently approved to replace larger volumes of necessary fluids such as blood in a fast and safe manner. The purpose of the study is to evaluate proficiency and the retention of knowledge of how to use the device based on current methods of training compared to revised training methods. Hypotheses: 1. The use of the traditional method of training is not effective, predicting less then half of staff will pass on the first attempt. 2. Restructured test with hands-on training as opposed to oral presentation only with a written test will result in a pass rate of &gt; 80%. 3. Staff members who work in pairs will perform better than working alone when setting up the Belmont Rapid Infuser (BRI). 4. Retention at 3 months will be higher with the restructured training method than with the traditional training method.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Training Model for the Proficient Use of the Belmont Rapid Infuser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be recruited to complete a test after undergoing either the traditional or the restructured training method. This training will be completed on one day and takes about 1 hour. All participants who pass via either method of training are evaluated again to test retention 3-4 months later .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participants will be recruited from the faculty, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists, and fellows from the Department of Anesthesia at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. They may have had educational exposure or use of the Belmont Rapid Infuser without independent assembly.</criteria>
