	<brief_summary>ThIS study is to determine whether canakinumab is able to induce and maintain a clinically meaningful reduction of disease activity in participants with Hereditary Periodic Fevers (HPF) compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Efficacy and Safety of Canakinumab in Patients With Hereditary Periodic Fevers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of 3 randomized cohorts (one per condition of colchicine resistant/intolerant Familial Mediterranean Fever (crFMF), Hyper Immunoglobulin D Syndrome (also known as mevalonate kinase deficiency (HIDS/MKD), and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), and 4 study epochs: 1. Epoch 1: a screening epoch to assess participant's eligibility; 2. Epoch 2: a randomized treatment epoch of 16 weeks where participants are randomized to canakinumab 150 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) or to placebo to obtain efficacy and safety data in a double-blind placebo controlled parallel-arm setting. This epoch contained 2 possible escape options : 1. early blinded escape option for non responders from Day 8 to Day 28 with here an add-on dose of 150mg canakinumab followed by blinded uptitration at the next scheduled visit (Day 29) 2. late unblinded escape option for non responders from Day 29 to Day 112; with open-label uptitration 3. Epoch 3: a randomized withdrawal epoch of 24 weeks where canakinumab responders from the randomized treatment epoch were re-randomized to canakinumab 150mg q8w or placebo to assess the potential for canakinumab to maintain clinical efficacy at a reduced dosing frequency; 4. Epoch 4: an open-label treatment epoch of 72 weeks to collect long-term</detailed_description>
