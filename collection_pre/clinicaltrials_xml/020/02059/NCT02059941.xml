	<brief_summary>Management of intracranial hypertension (ICH) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is crucial to their survival and optimal recovery. The evidence-based Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, 3rd Edition recommends use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors to assess ICH and guide intervention. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of the world has the resources and capability to routinely monitor ICP. The objective of this proposal is to create and test guidelines for the treatment of severe TBI in the absence of ICP monitoring.</brief_summary>
