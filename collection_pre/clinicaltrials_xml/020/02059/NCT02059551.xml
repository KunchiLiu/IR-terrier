	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents a promising technique but can not be used as an alternative test to multidetector CT in patients with suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) due to its low sensitivity and high proportion of inconclusive MRI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate diagnostic performances of MRI combined with venous ultrasonography of the legs in patients with suspicion of PE.</brief_summary>
