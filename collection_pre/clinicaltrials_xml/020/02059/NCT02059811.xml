	<brief_summary>More than two-thirds of US adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have uncontrolled hypertension. Both hypertension and CKD are major independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the US. Fortunately, lowering blood pressure to recommended treatment targets not only slows the progression of CKD, but also improves cardiovascular outcomes. Controlling hypertension in this patient population, however, can be quite challenging. A lifestyle modification that effectively reduces blood pressure in both pre-hypertensive and hypertensive adults is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. The purpose of this pilot study is to (1) determine the extent to which the DASH diet lowers blood pressure in hypertensive adults with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30-59 ml/min/1.73m2) and (2) establish that the DASH diet can be safely consumed by this patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of the DASH Diet in Adults With Moderate Chronic Kidney Disease: Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During a 7-day run-in phase, participants will first consume a control diet similar in nutrient composition to the control diet of previous DASH studies. The control diet, which is a diet typical of most Americans, is reduced in servings of fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy products and relatively high in total and saturated fat. Immediately following the run-in phase, participants will receive the DASH diet during a 14-day intervention phase. Both diets will have the same sodium content and caloric intake will be adjusted for each participant to keep weight stable. All study meals and snacks will be provided.</detailed_description>
