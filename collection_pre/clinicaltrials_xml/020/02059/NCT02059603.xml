	<brief_summary>Background: Our previous study demonstrated that electroacupuncture at Zusanli, Sanyinjiao, Hegu, and Zhigou reduces the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay after laparoscopic colorectal surgery within a traditional perioperative care setting. Recent evidence also suggested that a 'fast-track' perioperative program may help accelerate recovery after colorectal surgery. As electroacupuncture is simpler to implement and less labor intensive, it may be the preferred adjunct therapy if it is proven to be noninferior to fast-track program in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Objectives: To compare the efficacy of electroacupuncture and fast-track program in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Design: Prospective, randomized, noninferiority trial. Subjects: One hundred sixty-four consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic resection of colonic and upper rectal cancer will be recruited. Interventions: Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either: (A) electroacupuncture with traditional perioperative care; or (B) fast-track program without acupuncture. Outcome measures: Primary outcome: time to defecation. Secondary outcomes: duration of hospital stay, time of first passing flatus, time to resume diet, pain scores, analgesic requirement, morbidity, and medical costs. Conclusions: This study will determine if electroacupuncture is noninferior to fast-track program in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Electroacupuncture may be the preferred perioperative adjunct therapy to laparoscopic colorectal surgery because it is simpler to implement and less labor intensive than fast-track program.</brief_summary>
