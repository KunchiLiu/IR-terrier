	<brief_summary>While there is a consensus to perform pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as a cornerstone for paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), different additional ablation approaches are used for substrate modification: linear lesions, ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) or a combination of both. The aim of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in terms of freedom from arrhythmia recurrence between PVI with CFAE ablation in combination or not with linear lesions in patients with persistent AF.</brief_summary>
