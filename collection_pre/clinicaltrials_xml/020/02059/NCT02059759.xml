	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate in ALS patients the regulatory T cell early response to two low-doses of IL-2 at 1 and 2 MIU per day after one course of 5 consecutive days comparatively to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immuno-modulation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis- a Phase II Study of Safety and Activity of Low Dose Interleukin-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II study on ld-IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for ALS which aims at defining the activity and safety of a range a doses for subsequent use of the best dose in a phase II/III trial. For ethical reasons, ld-IL-2 must be tested as an add-on therapy to riluzole hence all patients will need to be treated with riluzole for at least three months prior to entry. A randomized (1:1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial will be carried out to assess ld-IL-2 activity on regulatory T cells and immuno-inflammatory markers in ALS patients treated for 3 months (5 days every four weeks repeated three times). The secondary objectives of this study are: A. To evaluate maintenance of Tcell response after three repeated 5-day courses at one course every four weeks for 12 weeks. B. To evaluate the safety of ld-IL-2 therapy in an ALS population, with an overall follow-up of 6 months (up to 15 weeks after last administration); C. To evaluate functional changes throughout the study; D. To evaluate changes in other pre-defined blood cytology parameters, and a blood biomarker for axonal damage.</detailed_description>
