	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies imiquimod or fluorouracil to see how well they work compared to observation in treating patients with high-grade anal squamous skin lesions who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Biological therapies, such as imiquimod, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether imiquimod or fluorouracil is more effective than observation in treating high-grade anal squamous skin lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imiquimod, Fluorouracil, or Observation in Treating HIV-Positive Patients With High-Grade Anal Squamous Skin Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the efficacy of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% for treatment of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) compared to observation only. II. To assess the efficacy of intra-anal topical 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil) 5% for treatment of anal HSIL compared to observation only. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and tolerability of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% and topical 5-fluorouracil 5%. II. To compare the efficacy of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% and topical 5-fluorouracil 5%. III. To assess for partial response of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% or topical 5-fluorouracil 5% as compared to observation only. IV. To evaluate the effect of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% and topical 5-fluorouracil 5% on human papilloma virus (HPV) persistence. V. To evaluate anal HSIL outcomes at week 44. VI. To evaluate the effect of behavioral patterns including tobacco smoking and sexual activity on treatment efficacy, tolerability and HPV. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients apply imiquimod intra-anally once daily (QD) for 16 weeks. ARM B: Patients apply fluorouracil intra-anally twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM C: Patients receive no treatment. Patients who still have HSIL at week 20 and who agree to randomization may cross-over to Arm A or B. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 20, 24, 26, 32, 40, and 44.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIVpositive; documentation of HIV infection must be based on a federally approved, licensed HIV test performed in conjunction with screening (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], western blot, or other test); alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician has documented that the patient has HIV based on prior ELISA and western blot; an approved antibody test will be used to confirm diagnosis; if the physician is treating a patient with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with a history of HIV positivity based on an approved antibody test then repeat antibody confirmation is not necessary Biopsyproven HSIL (anal intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (AIN2) and/or AIN3) of the anal canal at either the squamocolumnar junction or distal anus, documented within 60 days prior to enrollment, but not less than 1 week prior to enrollment HSIL occupies at least 25% of the circumference of the anal canal at either the squamocolumnar junction or distal anus on highresolution anoscopy (HRA) at screening or entry based on available biopsy results and visual appearance Anal HSIL lesions are visible at study entry and no lesions are suspicious for invasive cancer Ability to understand and willing to provide informed consent Participants must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be capable of complying with the requirements of this protocol including selfadministration of study treatment Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 70% Cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count &gt;= 200 within 120 days prior to enrollment or plasma HIV1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; 200 copies/mL within 120 days prior to enrollment For females, cervical cytology (if having a cervix) and gynecologic evaluation within 12 months prior to enrollment Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 750 cells/mm^3 within 90 days prior to enrollment Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL within 90 days prior to enrollment Platelet count &gt;= 75,000/mm^3 within 90 days prior to enrollment History of anal cancer Prior intraanal use of topical 5fluorouracil 5% or imiquimod 2.5%, 3.75% or 5% at any point, or use of perianal imiquimod 2.5%, 3.75% or 5% or topical 5fluorouracil 5% within 6 months prior to enrollment Extensive concurrent perianal or lower vulvar HSIL or condyloma requiring a different treatment modality than the study treatment, or treatment that cannot be deferred in observation arm, per examining provider Condyloma occupying more than 50% of the circumference of the anal canal or that obscures a satisfactory exam Ongoing use of anticoagulant therapy other than aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Acute treatment for an infection (excluding fungal infection of the skin and sexually transmitted infections) or other serious medical illness within 14 days prior to study entry Malignancy requiring systemic therapy; note: Kaposi's sarcoma limited to the skin is not exclusionary unless requiring systemic chemotherapy Concurrent systemic corticosteroids, cytokines, and immunomodulatory therapy (e.g. interferons) Prior history of HPV vaccination Treatment for anal or perianal HSIL, lowgrade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or condyloma within 4 months of entry; please note that infrared coagulation (IRC) or electrocautery of a biopsy site to stop bleeding does not constitute treatment Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding; women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to initiating study treatment; all women of childbearing potential must be willing to comply with an acceptable birth control regimen to prevent pregnancy while receiving treatment and for 3 months after treatment is discontinued as determined by the Investigator; postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential; (note: a woman of childbearing potential is one who is biologically capable of becoming pregnant; this includes women who are using contraceptives or whose sexual partners are either sterile or using contraceptives)</criteria>
