	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 14C-labeled cleavage product (BAL8728), in particular the routes of excretion and extent ot metabolism of the cleavage product following administration of a single intravenous dose of pyridinylmethyl-14C-labeled prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate (BAL8557). In addition, identify the metabolic profile of BAL8728 in human plasma, urine and/or feces after a single intravenous dose of pyridinylmethyl-14C-labeled BAL8557 and evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BAL8728 and BAL4815. Safety and tolerability after a single intravenous dose of pyridinylmethyl-14C-labeled isavuconazonium sulfate will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject has a body weight of at least 45 kg and a body mass index of 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive. The subject's 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal at Screening and Day 1; or, if abnormal, the abnormality is not clinically significant. The ECG for the subject has a QTcF of at least 360 but not more than 430 msec. The subject has any clinically significant disease history of the following systems: pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular (including a history of clinically significant arrhythmia), hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, renal, genitourinary, endocrine, metabolic, dermatologic, immunologic, hematologic, or malignancy excluding non melanoma skin cancer. The subject has a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibodies at Screening or is known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus. The subject has a known or suspected allergy to any of the azole class of compounds, or a history of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions. The subject has used tobacco or nicotine containing products in the last 6 months prior to Day 1. The subject has had treatment with prescription drugs, overthecounter medication, or complementary and alternative medicines within 14 days prior to Day 1, with the exception of occasional use of acetaminophen up to 2 g/day. The subject has participated in any interventional clinical study or has received any investigational agent within 28 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to Screening. The subject has had any significant blood loss, donated one unit (450 mL) of blood or more, or received a transfusion of any blood or blood products within 60 days or donated plasma within 7 days prior to clinic admission on Day 1.</criteria>
