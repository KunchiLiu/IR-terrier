	<brief_title>Analgesic Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for Central Neuropathic Pain in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On the one hand, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent chronic disease generating neurological disability in young adults. Among the many types of disabilities associated with MS, chronic pain is very frequent, especially neuropathic pain. This type of pain is often treatment resistant. Moreover, abnormal intra-cortical excitability has been described in MS patients. On the other hand, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has shown an analgesic effect in various chronic pain conditions (fibromyalgia, post-stroke, peripheral neuropathic pain). Three groups have shown that analgesia was correlated to defective intra-cortical excitability restoration. The goal of this study is to compare the analgesic effects of two types of primary Motor cortex (M1) rTMS, namely 10Hz and prolonged continuous Theta-Burst Stimulation (pcTBS), with sham stimulation. Patients will benefit from 1 daily session per day for 5 consecutive days and from a total follow up of 4 weeks. Pain will be assessed each day and several other signs and symptoms will be repeatedly assessed.</detailed_description>
