	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of MK-1293 compared with a basal insulin (EU-Lantusâ„¢) in participants with Type 1 Diabetes. The primary hypotheses are that the duration of action, pharmacodynamic profile, and pharmacokinetic profile of MK-1293 and the comparator basal insulin are similar.</brief_summary>
