	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the dose-proportionality of palbociclib pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects of Japanese descent. Approximately fourteen healthy Japanese subjects will receive four single doses of palbociclib (PD-0332991) with a minimum washout of 10 days between doses. Additionally, this study will investigate the effect of Japanese ethnicity of palbociclib pharmacokinetics by comparing palbociclib pharmacokinetics at a single dose-level between healthy subjects of Japanese descent and approximately fourteen healthy non-Asian subjects.</brief_summary>
