	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the Post-Randomization Phase Cohort Study is to continue to assess the safety of non-emergency PCI performed at hospitals without cardiac surgery on-site in patients with myocardial ischemia (other than ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The MASS COMM Post-Randomization Phase Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MASS COMM Post-Randomization Phase Cohort Study ("Cohort Study" is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study of non-emergency PCI performed at non-SOS hospitals in patients with myocardial ischemia (other than STEMI). The Cohort Study is designed to allow non-SOS hospitals to continue to perform non-emergency PCI after enrollment to the MASS COMM trial is completed and before the 30-day and 12-month results are available. Specifically, all eligible subjects, after enrollment to the MASS COMM randomized controlled trial is completed and before the final results are available and a decision is reached by the MA-DPH, will be consented and enrolled into this Cohort Study. Subjects will be followed through 30 days post procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Candidates for this study must meet ALL of the following criteria: Subject is at least 18 years old. Subject requires single or multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of de novo or restenotic target lesion (including instent restenotic lesions). N.B. staged procedure will not be considered to meet the endpoint component of repeat revascularization if either of the following precatheterization procedure qualifying clinical laboratory values are met: eGFR is less than 60 ml/min or creatinine is greater than 1.5 mg/dl Subject's lesion(s) is (are) amenable to stent treatment with currently available FDAapproved bare metal or drug eluting stents. Subject is an acceptable candidate for nonemergency, urgent or emergency CABG. Subject has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease in terms of a positive functional study, or documented symptoms. Documented stable angina pectoris [Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS) 1, 2, 3, or 4], unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia (Braunwald Class IBC, IIBC, or IIIBC), nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia. Subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will comply with all followup evaluations. Subject has been informed of the nature and purpose of the study and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site. Angiographic Inclusion Criteria The target lesion(s) is (are) de novo or restenotic (including instent restenotic) native coronary artery lesion(s) with greater or equal to 50 and less than 100% stenosis (visual estimate), or the target lesion is an acute (less than 1 month) total occlusion as evidenced by clinical symptoms. If Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is measured, target lesion(s) has (have) evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis determined by FFR measurement (FFR less than or equal to 0.8). Target lesions(s) is (are) located in an infarct (if not treated with primary PCI) or noninfarctrelated artery with a 70% or greater stenosis (by visual estimate) greater than 72 hours following the STEMI. Lesions treated with PCI greater than 72 hours following STEMI would be subject to the same protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above and below with the exception that a target lesion of 70% or greater stenosis may be treated with or without symptoms or abnormal stress test). Subjects will be excluded from participation in the Cohort Study (and nonemergency PCI may not be performed in these patients at the nonSOS site) if ANY of the following conditions apply: The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. Evidence of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the intended treatment on infarct related or noninfarct related artery. Cardiogenic shock on presentation or during current hospitalization. Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 20%. Known allergies to: aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticlopidine (Ticlid), heparin, bivalirudin, stainless steel, or contrast agent (which cannot be adequately premedicated). A platelet count less than 75,000 cells/mm3 or greater than 700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC less than 3,000 cells/mm3. Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine less than 2.5 mg/dl or less than 150Âµmol/L). Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study endpoints. (Note: Trials requiring extended followup for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials). Prior participation in the MASSCOMM Trial, unless the patient has completed the 12month followup for the Trial, and/or prior participation in the Cohort Study, unless the patient has completed the 30day followup for the Cohort Study. Within 30 days prior to the index Cohort Study procedure, the subject has undergone a previous coronary interventional procedure of any kind. Note: This exclusion criterion does not apply to postSTEMI patients. Stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 3 months. Active peptic ulcer or upper GI bleeding within the prior 3 months. Subject has active sepsis. Unprotected left main coronary artery disease (stenosis greater than 50%). Subject has evidence of a hemodynamically insignificant stenosis determined by FFR measurement (FFR greater than 0.8). In the investigator's opinion, subject has a comorbid condition(s) that could limit the subject's ability to participate in the study or comply with followup requirements or impact the scientific integrity of the study. Angiographic Exclusion Criteria Subject has normal or insignificant coronaries (i.e., coronary lesion(s) less than 50% stenosis). Any target vessel has evidence of: 1. excessive thrombus (e.g., requires target vessel thrombectomy) 2. tortuosity (greater than 60 degree angle) that makes it unsuitable for proper stent delivery and deployment, 3. heavy calcification. Any target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent placement (e.g. but not limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, etc.). Any lesion that is located in a saphenous vein graft, however, lesions located within the native vessel but accessed through the graft are eligible. The target vessel is in a "last remaining" epicardial vessel (e.g., &gt;2 nontarget epicardial vessels and the bypass grafts to these territories [if present] are totally occluded).</criteria>
