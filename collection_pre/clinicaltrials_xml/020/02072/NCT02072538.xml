	<brief_summary>New high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays allow earlier detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Furthermore, elevated values were associated with an increased risk of recurrent AMI or death. Therefore, guidelines recommend an early invasive strategy in patients with elevated admission values and kinetic changes. Other criteria for an early invasive strategy include a GRACE risk score &gt;140 points or other cardiovascular risk factors. Hs-cTn assays allow discrimination of patients at very low and high risk. Studies confirmed safety of early discharge protocols in patients with unstable angina (UAP). The aim of this study is to 1) confirm the safety of early discharge without invasive strategy in patients with UAP and to 2) review the optimal timing of stress-testing. Therefore, patients are being randomized into 2 groups with pre-discharge and early post-discharge stress-testing. Endpoints are major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 and 90 days.</brief_summary>
