	<brief_summary>Permanently implantable venous ports (Port-A) is very important to patients receiving chemotherapy. It not only provides a reliable route to administrate intravenous drugs, and it also requires minimal care when it is not in use. However, catheter related blood stream infection(CRBSI) is one of the serious complications of Port-A. The diagnosis of CRBSI relies on limited tools, including blood culture or symptoms and signs of active infection. In the stage of CRBSI, Port-A removal is necessary and pose the risk for the patients to re-implant the Port-A. Thus, it is crucial to early detect the infection and give appropriate treatment. Among the pathogens, some pathogens are related to skin contaminants. Before systemic spreading, these pathogens may colonize or cause minor infection subcutaneously. This investigation is to utilize a non-invasive dual spectrum infrared imaging system to evaluate the Port-A wound and to detect the infection. Aim: 1. To build the database of infra-red thermal images of Port-A wound healing. 2. To investigate the thermal images of skin contamination related CRBSI and to compare with the thermal images of the CRBSI of unknown foci</brief_summary>
