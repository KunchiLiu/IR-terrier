	<brief_summary>In this study, we studied lipoprotein abnormalities-related variables as risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease in patients on renal replacement therapies.We studied 96 dialyzed patients, 62 males and 34 females, on mean age 62.1 years old and 24 healthy controls.We concluded that metabolic acidosis activating the inflammation and lipoprotein oxidation influences the dyslipidemia and cardiovascular morbidity of patients on renal replacement therapies.Dialysis adequacy was positively associated to cardioprotective HDL.Peritoneal dialysis holds a better acidosis level and lower oxidized lipids than hemodialysis modalities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture in the peritoneal dialyzed patients and control group in a twelve hours fasting state.In hemodialyzed patients blood was drawn just before the start of the mean weekly dialysis session also in a twelve hours fasting state from the vascular access. All samples were received once at baseline time ( in the start of the study ). Peripheral systolic and diastolic blood pressures were calculated as an average of 10 measurements during a renal replacement treatment month in the starting time of the study. Also, electrocardiographic examination, echocardiography and the calculation of ankle-brachial blood pressure index became once in the start of the study.</detailed_description>
