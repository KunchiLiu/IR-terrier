	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see how ETC-1002 is tolerated in the body and how ETC-1002 affects the levels of LDL-C (bad cholesterol) in patients receiving ongoing statin therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of ETC-1002 vs Placebo in Patients Receiving Ongoing Statin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 132 hypercholesterolemic patients already taking statin therapy to treat elevated LDL-C will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive either ETC-1002 (120 mg or 180 mg dose), or placebo for 12 weeks in addition to ongoing statin therapy. This study will explore the safety and efficacy of ETC-1002 when given to patients receiving statin therapy.</detailed_description>
