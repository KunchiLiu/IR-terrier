	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether TissueGene-C, an allogeneic human chondrocytes expressing Transforming Growth Factor(TGF)-b1, is effective and safe in patients with degenerative arthritis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of TissueGene-C to Degenerative Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TissueGene-C is a biological new drug which consists of normal chondrocyte cells and transduced chondrocyte cells that express growth factor to modify osteoarthritis symptom for long term period. During the Phase 3 clinical trial , we will compare TissueGene-C to placebo in 26, 52 weeks trial with 156 outpatients who have osteoarthritis. The outpatients are randomized to TissueGene-C or placebo in 1:1 ratio, and they will be monitored and recorded in terms of alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee, and the presence of adverse events.</detailed_description>
