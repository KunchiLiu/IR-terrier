	<mesh_term>Penile Induration</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Have symptom(s) of Peyronie's disease (pain, curvature or plaque) 2. Be judged to be in good health, based upon the results of a medical history, physical examination, and laboratory profile 3. Voluntarily sign and date an informed consent agreement approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). The subject must also sign an authorization form to allow disclosure of his protected health information (PHI). The PHI authorization form and informed consent form may be an integrated form or may be separate forms depending on the institution 4. Be able to read, complete and understand the informed consent and various rating instruments in English 1. Inability to understand study goals and risks 2. Inability to understand the informed consent 3. Inability to achieve erection with or without PDE5 inhibitor use adequate for penetration if penile curvature is not a limiting factor 4. Peyronie's disease symptoms greater than one year duration 5. Chordee in the presence or absence of hypospadias Thrombosis of the dorsal penile artery or vein Infiltration by a benign or malignant mass resulting in penile curvature Infiltration by an infectious agent, such as lymphogranuloma venereum Ventral curvature from any cause Presence of an active sexually transmitted disease Known active hepatitis B or C Known immune deficiency disease or be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 6. Has previously undergone surgery for Peyronie's disease 7. Fails to have an erection which in the opinion of the investigator is sufficient to accurately measure the subject's penile deformity 8. Has an isolated hourglass deformity of the penis (curvature caused by a plaque that is noncontiguous with the hourglass deformity may be treated) 9. Has the plaque causing curvature of the penis located proximal to the base of the penis 10. Has previously received alternative medical therapies for Peyronie's disease administered by the intralesional route (including, but not limited to, steroids, verapamil, and the naturally occurring low molecular weight protein, interferonÎ±2b) within 3 months before the first dose of study drug or plans to use any of these medical therapies at any time during the study 11. Has received alternative medical therapies for Peyronie's disease administered by the oral (including, but not limited to, vitamin E [&gt;500 U], potassium aminobenzoate [Potaba], tamoxifen, colchicine, pentoxifylline, overthecounter erectile dysfunction medications, or steroidal antiinflammatory drugs) or topical routes (including, but not limited to, verapamil applied as a cream) within 3 months before the first dose of study drug or plans to use any of these medical therapies at any time during the study 12. Has had extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for the correction of Peyronie's disease within the 6 month period before screening or plans to have ESWT at any time during the study 13. Has used any mechanical type device for correction of Peyronie's disease within the 2week period before screening or plans to use any these devices at any time during the study 14. Has used a mechanical device to induce a passive erection within the 2week period before screening or plans to use any of these devices at any time during the study 15. Has significant erectile dysfunction that has failed to respond to oral treatment with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors 16. Has uncontrolled hypertension, as determined by the investigator 17. Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other significant medical condition, which in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in the study 18. Is unwilling or unable to cooperate with the requirements of the study including completion of all scheduled study visits 19. Has received an investigational drug or treatment within 30 days before the first dose of study drug 20. Has a known systemic allergy to any H100 component 21. Has received any collagenase treatments within 30 days of the first dose of study drug</criteria>
