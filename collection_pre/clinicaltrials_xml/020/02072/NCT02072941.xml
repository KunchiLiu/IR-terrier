	<brief_summary>In partnership with patients, caregivers, advocacy groups and clinicians, the investigators plan to: Aim 1: Adapt and refine PREPARE in Spanish through cognitive interviews with Spanish-speaking Latinos and stakeholders. Aim 2: Conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of PREPARE plus a previously-tested, easy-to-read- AD (intervention) versus the AD alone (control) to: 2a. Engage older Spanish-speaking Latinos in multiple ACP behaviors (i.e., identify and discuss wishes with surrogates and clinicians and complete ADs) measured by self-report, chart review, surrogate reports, and 2b. Direct observation. 2c. Improve self-efficacy and satisfaction with medical decision making. 2d. Determine whether PREPARE efficacy varies by literacy, decision control preferences, and clinician-patient language concordance. Aim 3: Disseminate PREPARE with input from patients, surrogates, and stakeholders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preparing Spanish-speaking Older Adults for Advance Care Planning and Medical Decision Making (PREPARE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PREPARE is a website (www.prepareforyourcare.org) that teaches patients how to identify what is most important in life, how to communicate their preferences to clinicians and loved ones, and how to make informed decisions. It is written at a 5th grade level and includes voice-overs of text and closed captioning of videos that model advance care planning behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of PREPARE plus an easy-to-read advance directive, versus an advance directive alone, to improve patient engagement in multiple advance care planning behaviors including discussions with surrogate decision makers and clinicians in addition to advance directive completion. The investigators will also determine whether PREPARE can empower and activate patients within clinical encounters with their clinicians and help to decrease health disparities in advance care planning.</detailed_description>
