	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if zinc therapy: (1) strengthens your intestine's defensive barrier preventing damaging substances from reaching your liver, (2) decreases liver injury (inflammation, oxidative stress, cell death) and scarring, and (3) improves your liver-related health. Based on our preliminary animal data and other published reports, we expect zinc therapy to achieve all of these goals. Zinc is affordable, available over the counter or by prescription, and has an excellent safety profile. Positive results from this study will show that zinc is a significant therapy for millions of Americans with alcoholic liver disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zinc Supplementation in Alcoholic Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two-thirds of Americans consume alcohol, and an estimated 14 million Americans are alcoholics. It has been estimated that 15%-30% of heavy drinkers develop advanced Alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The prevalence of ALD in the United States is conservatively estimated at 2 million persons. Nearly 50% of liver-related deaths and 30% of hepatocellular carcinomas in the US are due to alcoholic cirrhosis. Despite recent advances in our understanding of ALD, there is currently no FDA approved medication for any stage of ALD. Zinc sulfate is inexpensive, available over the counter, and has an excellent safety profile. If zinc positively influences the mechanisms postulated to play a role in human ALD, this affordable treatment would become relevant to millions of people worldwide.</detailed_description>
