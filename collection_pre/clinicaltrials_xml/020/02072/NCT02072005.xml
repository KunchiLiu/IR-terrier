	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to conduct a 9-patient feasibility and acceptability study of mSMART (with future studies focusing on improved medication adherence). The sample will include daily smokers who are already taking a prescribed medication. There will be no change in any medication regimen in this study, and the sample will include smokers either with or without a psychiatric disorder. Subjects will be asked to use a smartphone application, or "app" (i.e. mSMART) that will provide information about their medication and when to take it. Along with smart phone, the participants will be asked to utilize an electronic pillbox (i.e. GlowCap) to further assist with medication compliance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will be 9 nicotine dependent male and female smokers who take at least one prescribed medication regularly. This sample will allow for psychiatric comorbidity, though is not required. They will be asked to carry a smartphone for 7 days and use a smartphone application, also called an "app," (i.e. mSMART) that will provide information about their medication and when to take it. Along with smart phone, the participants will be asked to utilize an electronic pillbox (i.e. GlowCap) to further assist with medication compliance. The study consists of a Screening Visit (~4Â½ hours), Training Visit (~1 hour), and 1 Follow-Up Session (~2 hours). Post the Training visit, subjects will then complete the week observation period. During that time, subjects will complete experimenter-prompted assessments to assess factors that may interfere with medication adherence (e.g., psychiatric symptoms, such as forgetfulness). As part of the 'app', reminders will be sent to subjects to take their medication (e.g., the reminders will be programmed to accommodate multiple times a day dosing within dosage schedule windows). Subjects will also be provided with an electronic pillbox that will dispense the subject's medication over the 7 day observation period. After the 7 day period, subjects will return the smartphone at the follow-up visit. Primary outcome variable measured will be medication adherence as an indicator of feasibility and acceptability of the mSMART app. This study is an observational study since participants will already be taking a medication prescribed by their own physician. The sample is a non-treatment seeking sample of adult cigarette smokers. Participants will not be asked to modify their smoking behavior or medication use in any way. Participants will receive two devices (i.e., [1] the smartphone with mSMART and [2] GlowCap) over the seven day observation period of smoking behavior and medication adherence. The ultimate goal of mSMART is to assist with medication adherence and is thus an intervention, although the goal of this study is to assess how acceptable and feasible it is in a sample already adherent to their medications. We do not predict any changes in smoking behavior or medication adherence once participants are provided with mSMART or GlowCap. GlowCap is being used to allow the investigators to measure times at which the medications were taken.</detailed_description>
