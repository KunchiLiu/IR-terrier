	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Efficacy of Anaferon for Children® in the Treatment of Influenza and Acute Respiratory Viral Infections in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study shall enroll outpatient subjects of both sexes aged 3-12 years with clinical manifestations of influenza/Acute Respiratory Viral Infections (ARVI), including fever of at least 38.0 С, who sought medical aid within the first day of the illness onset. Тhe doctor shall collect medical history information, perform an objective examination, record the concomitant therapy, and obtain nasal swab specimens for a rapid diagnostic influenza test. If the swab is positive, the doctor shall obtain swab specimens from the nasal cavity and oropharynx (nasopharyngeal swab) for a subsequent real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the viral load of influenza A and/or B virus. If the swab is negative for influenza the doctor shall collect a nasopharyngeal swab for a subsequent PCR test for other respiratory viruses. If inclusion criteria are met and non-inclusion criteria are absent at visit 1 (Day 1), the patient will be enrolled in the trial and randomized into one of the two groups: group 1 patients will take Anaferon for children® following a 5-day regimen; group 2 patients will receive Placebo using the Anaferon for children® 5-day regimen. The parent/adopter of patient will receive a diary where they should record the child's axillary temperature data in the morning and at bed time, and score the severity of symptoms. The subject will be monitored for 14 days (screening, randomization - 1 day, treatment - 5 days, follow-up − 1 day; late-scheduled "telephone" visit − day 14). At Visits 2-4, the doctor will document objective examination data; obtain nasopharyngeal swabs from subjects with positive influenza tests for subsequent real time RT-PCR to determine the viral load and its reduction in the course of treatment; monitor the prescribed and concomitant therapy, and check the patient's diary data. The "telephone" visit will be made to elicit information from the parents regarding the patient's general health, presence/absence of secondary bacterial/viral complications, and use of antibacterial drugs. Interim statistical analysis is stipulated by the study protocol. Interim analysis will be performed using the data obtained from the examination and treatment of the protocol-defined number of patients who completed the study. Based on the expected effect, the minimum required Particular Per Protocol (pPP) sample size will be 254 patients (127 subjects in each group - Anaferon for children and Placebo).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients of both sexes aged 312 years inclusively. 2. Diagnosis of influenza/ARVI: patients with body temperature at least 38.0°C when visiting a doctor + intensity of influenza symptoms scored ≥4 (presence of at least 1 general symptom scored ≥2 and 1 nasal/ throat/ chest symptom scored ≥ 2, or greater number of symptoms with the intensity scored ≥1). 3. The first 24 hours from the beginning of manifestations of influenza/ARVI. 4. The possibility to start therapy within 24 hours of the onset of influenza/ARVI symptoms. 5. Availability of a patient information sheet (Informed Consent form) signed by the patient's parents/adopters to confirm the child's participation in the clinical trial signed by one parent/adopter of patient. 1. Suspected pneumonia, bacterial infection or the presence of a severe disease requiring usage of antibacterial drugs (including sulfonamides) starting from Day 1 of the illness onset. 2. Clinical symptoms of severe influenza/ARVI requiring hospitalization. 3. Suspected initial manifestations of diseases that have symptoms similar to influenza/ARVI symptoms (other infectious diseases, influenzalike syndrome at the onset of systemic connective tissue disorders, oncohematology and other pathology). 4. Medical history of primary and secondary immunodeficiency: а) lymphoid immunodeficiency (Tcell and/or Bcell immunity chain, immunodeficiencies with predominant antibody deficit; b) phagocyte deficits; c) complement factor deficit; d) combined immunodeficiency including AIDS secondary to HIV infection; toxic, autoimmune, infectious, or radial panleukopenia syndrome; general lymphocytopenia syndrome; syndrome of lymphocyte polyclonal activation; postsplenectomia syndrome; congenital asplenia; syndrome of immune complexes pathology associated with infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases. 5. Medical history of sarcoidosis. 6. Oncological disease. 7. Exacerbation or decompensation of chronic diseases affecting ability to participate in the clinical study. 8. Medical history of polyvalent allergy. 9. Allergy/ intolerance to any of the components of medications used in the treatment. 10. Malabsorption syndrome, including congenital or acquired lactose deficiency or any other disaccharide deficiency. 11. Intake of medicines listed in the section "Prohibited concomitant treatment" for 1 month prior to the inclusion in the trial. 12. Drug addiction or alcohol usage at more than 2 alcohol units per day by the subject's parents/adopters. 13. Mental disorders of the subject, their parents/adopters. 14. Subjects whose parents/adopters, from the investigator's point of view, will fail to comply with the observation requirements of the trial or with the intake regimen of the investigated medicines. 15. Participation in other clinical studies in the course of 3 months prior to the inclusion in the trial. 16. Patient's parents/adopters are related to the research personnel of the investigative site who are directly involved in the trial or are the immediate family member of the researcher. The immediate family members include husband/wife, parents, children or brothers (or sisters), regardless of whether they are natural or adopted. 17. The patient's parent/adopter works for OOO "NPF "MATERIA MEDICA HOLDING" (i.e., is the company's employee, temporary contract worker or appointed official responsible for carrying out the research) or the immediate relative.</criteria>
