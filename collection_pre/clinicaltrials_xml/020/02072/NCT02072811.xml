	<brief_summary>In view of the diversity of the biology of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy in individual patients must be individualized. One of the tools for this is molecular-cytogenetic stratification. It divides patients into five categories (prognostic groups): Favorable, Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, Adverse and Very adverse risk. After remission proceedings are tailored depending on prognostic determined groups. Research of PALG group in the application in the second line regimen CLAG and CLAG-M proved high effectiveness of this treatment with low toxicity. Considering experience of PALG groups, it seems that the use of the schema CLAG early as the second induction therapy is a viable treatment option.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of the Therapy Tailored to Risk Factors in Treating Adult Patients (≤60) With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with AML with one of 5 prognostic categories based on modified cytogenetic-molecular stratification (European Leukemia Net Prognostic System - ENL) Favorable risk t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11 Mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (NK) Mutated CEBPA (NK) Intermediate I risk Mutated NPM1 with FLT3-ITD (NK) Wild-type NPM1 and FLT3-ITD (NK) Wild-type NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (NK) Intermediate II risk t(9;11)(p22;q22); MLLT3-MLL cytogenic abnormalities other than favorable or adverse Adverse risk Inv(3)(q21q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21;q26.2); RPN-EVI1 Very adverse risk monosomal karyotype (MK): -5 or del(5q); -7; abnl(17p); complex karyotype Goals: - Evaluation of the impact of therapy tailored to the risk factors on outcome of AML patients aged ≤ 60. - Evaluation of the possibility to improve the results of induction therapy through the use of early 2nd induction in patients with persistent leukemic infiltration of the bone marrow at the 14th day, - Evaluation of the impact of the minimal residual disease (MRD) presence assessed by Immunophenotyping method, on the results of treatment of AML patients aged ≤ 60, - Assessing the significance of monitoring the number of leukemic stem cells (LSC) in bone marrow and peripheral blood and their influence on clinical course and outcome of AML treatment, - Assessment of the LSC determination usefulness in MRD monitoring in patients with AML, - Evaluation of the prognostic significance of the expression of CXCR-4 on the surface of leukemic cells and their impact on the clinical course and outcome of AML - trying to select a group of patients who potentially would benefit from the use of chemosensitization with plerixafor, - Evaluation of autologous HSCT effectiveness in consolidation therapy in AML patients from 3 following cytogenetic-molecular risk groups: Favorable, Intermediate I, Intermediate II, - Comparison of the overall survive (OS) and leukemia-free survival after autologous and allogeneic HSCT in AML patients from Intermediate I and Intermediate II cytogenetic-molecular risk groups (biological randomization donor vs. donor).</detailed_description>
