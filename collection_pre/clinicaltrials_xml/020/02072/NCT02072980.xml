	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that the lubricity of DAILIES TOTAL1® (DT1) lenses after 16 hours of wear is equivalent to the lubricity of unworn DT1 lenses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study, participants wore study lenses for 2 specified time periods (16 hours and 15 minutes, treatment sequence randomized) following which lenses were collected for ex vivo lubricity analysis. The ex vivo lubricity analysis was evaluated under a separate non-clinical protocol.</detailed_description>
