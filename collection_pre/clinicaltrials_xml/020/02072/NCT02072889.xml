	<brief_summary>Measurements will be made between the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery using an ultrasound machine as the subjects is asked to move and position his or her neck in various positions. It is hypothesized that by movements of the neck the investigators can maximize the distance between the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery to decrease inadvertent cannulation of the carotid artery to improve patient safety</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be asked to participate in this trial if they are scheduled for surgery and they will have their neck repositioned in several ways using an ultrasound machine to measure the distance between the internal jugular vein and the carotic artery to determine maximal distance in order to insert a catheter prior to surgery</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male and Females 18 years through 98 Scheduled for cardiac surgery Requires internal cannulation for their scheduled operative procedure Individuals who refuse participation Subjects who already have had the internal jugular cannulated (line already present) History of carotid surgery History of Neck Surgery Individuals under 18 years of age</criteria>
