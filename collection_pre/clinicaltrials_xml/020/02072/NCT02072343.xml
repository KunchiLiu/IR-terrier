	<brief_summary>Capnometer has been used to assess the success of intubation and the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, capnometers can malfunction under the conditions such as pulmonary edema and hemorrhage due to the vulnerability of capnometers for water. Investigators hypothesized that the use of 10cm catheter mount will reduce the malfunction of capnometers under the conditions of water.</brief_summary>
