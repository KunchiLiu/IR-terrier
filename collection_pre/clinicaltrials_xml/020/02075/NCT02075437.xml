	<brief_summary>This study will provide tools to develop and pilot an intervention for Functional Abdominal Pain (FAP) using a ten session intervention with children ages 5-8. Investigators will train the subjects to be "Feeling and Body Investigators". During treatment phases the following will occur 1) gather clues (learn), 2) investigate (experience: perform interoceptive mystery missions to explore a body sensation), 3) organize body clues (contextualize: recall other contexts that evoke similar sensations), and 4) go on increasingly daring missions (challenge: decrease avoidance and safety behaviors). The FBI intervention will be developed and refined in 26 child-caregiver dyads during the current R21 phase. In the R33 phase investigators will randomize 100 subjects with FAP to FBI or an active control group in order to conduct a pilot-test of the feasibility, acceptance, and clinical significance of FBI. Young children with FAP who complete the FBI early intervention will learn to experience changes in the viscera as fun and fascinating, rather than scary, and will develop new capacities for pain management, adaptive functioning, and emotion regulation. For the R21 Phase (assessing initial feasibility) investigators hypothesize that ≥ 80% of participants enrolled in FBI will complete treatment and that ≥ 80% of participants will complete home-based practice assignments.</brief_summary>

Based on pediatric medical assessment, child meets criteria for functional abdominal pain (FAP) based on absence of other organic causes of recurrent abdominal pain.
