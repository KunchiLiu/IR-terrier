	<brief_summary>This randomized, active controlled, multicenter phase III open-label study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alectinib compared with crizotinib treatment in participants with treatment-naive anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK-positive) advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either alectinib, 600 milligrams (mg) orally twice daily (BID), or crizotinib, 250 mg orally BID. Participants will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal or death. The study is expected to last approximately 42 months.</brief_summary>
