	<brief_summary>Use of an investigational oximetry system to evaluate the triggering of the "sensor off" status with the marketed off-the-shelf sensors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bedside Respiratory Patient Monitoring System - Sensor Off Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Multi-functional Patient Monitoring PCBA is an electronic circuit board in the monitoring system that performs calculations. The study will evaluate the performance of the Sensor Off New Patient Monitoring system by exposing the sensor to an ambient light source, sensor slipping off the finger with the light emitter and detector facing each other or a sensor slipping off under a blanket.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male or female subjects 18 years or older (inclusive) Subject is able to participate for the duration of the study Subject is willing to sign an informed consent Previous injury or trauma to fingers or hands that may change blood flow or vascular supply and affect our ability to test sensors. Physiologic abnormalities that prevent proper application of pulse oximetry sensor. Severe contact allergies that cause a reaction to standard adhesive materials such as those found in medical sensors and electrodes</criteria>
