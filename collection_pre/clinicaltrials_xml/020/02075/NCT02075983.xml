	<brief_summary>Our research is part of the global effort to develop a vaccine against HIV. We aim to develop a non-invasive, needle-free 'transcutaneous' vaccine. It will be a water-based solution which is placed on the surface of the skin of the upper arm, after the hairs have been stripped away. The active component of the vaccine - DNA which contains genes derived from the virus - will enter through the hair follicles from which the hair has been stripped. The DNA will get into cells, which will use the HIV genes to make copies of virus proteins. These proteins will stimulate the body's immune system and, we hope, make it able to protect against HIV infection. The research is to assess the safety of this approach, and how good it is at stimulating the immune system. We will combine the 'transcutaneous' vaccine with an 'intramuscular' version which is injected into the muscle of the thigh, and compare this combination with: intramuscular plus 'intradermal' (injection into the skin); and intramuscular with added 'electroporation' - use of a pulse of electricity to increase uptake of DNA vaccines. We will invite healthy men and women to take part in this research. Volunteers will first be assessed to ensure they are eligible to participate. A total of 30 will be enrolled and each will receive three vaccinations over the course of 12 weeks. We will assess the effects of the vaccinations by recording any symptoms experienced by the volunteers, and by analysing samples of their blood. The research will take place at the St Mary's Hospital campus of Imperial College London, UK. The DNA component of the vaccine is an experimental substance, so we will monitor very closely the wellbeing of the men and women who participate in the research.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity of Three HIV GTU® MultiHIV DNA Immunisations Administered Via Intramuscular, Intradermal and Transcutaneous Routes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CUTHIVAC 001 is a randomised Phase I study aimed at exploring the safety and immunogenicity of different modes of delivery of a GTU® DNA plasmid vaccine (GTU®-multiHIV B clade) in healthy volunteers. Within the study Transcutaneous (TC) delivery and intramuscular (IM) delivery with electroporation will be compared to more conventional intradermal (ID) and intramuscular (IM) routes. The investigational HIV-1 vaccine GTU®-MultiHIV B clade encodes for a MultiHIV antigen which is a synthetic fusion protein consisting of full-length polypeptides of Rev, Nef, Tat, p17 and p24 and containing more than 20 Th and CTL epitopes of protease, reverse transcriptase (RT) and gp160 regions of the HAN2 HIV-1 B clade. 30 healthy male and female volunteers 18 to 45 years old who are at low risk of HIV infection are to be recruited. Group 1 will serve as the reference for the proportion with T-cell responses. Preclinical data using lower doses suggest that there may also be antibody (Ab) responses. Electroporation (EP) has been shown to significantly increase the immunogenicity of DNA. Vaccine is provided in sealed vials at 2.0mg/ml and there are practical limitations on the volumes that can be administered via each route. To deliver 4mg at each timepoint, participants will all individuals will be given two IM injections of 2.0mg GTU®-MultiHIV DNA IM (one into each leg) at each visit. The dose will be given in 1.0ml of sterile PBS injected into the upper thigh muscle. The maximum volume that can be given ID is 0.1ml per injection, and therefore the maximum dose that can be administered ID is 0.2ml. Individuals in Group 2 will receive 0.2ml by TC, a novel needle-free method of vaccine delivery which has previously been shown to favour CD8+ T-cell and IgA Ab responses without compromising overall immunogenicity. The objective of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity in response to three immunisations with a DNA- GTU® MultiHIV B clade vaccine administered via the ID, TC and IM routes, with and without electroporation in a variety of combination regimens.</detailed_description>
