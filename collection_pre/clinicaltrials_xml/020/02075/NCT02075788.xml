	<brief_title>Millet Products Study - Investigation of Glycemic Index and Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate how millet incorporation into different baked product types (i.e. an extruded snack versus a biscuit) influences glycemic response and satiety. This project will examine the effect of millet, on glycemic response and satiety. To determine the effect of product matrix and processing methods, testing will be done using an extruded snack, porridge, a couscous-like product and a biscuit. All product servings will provide 50 g of available carbohydrate and will be consumed by participants within 10 minutes.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Hyperglycemia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Men, age 1940, nonsmoking Normal fasting plasma glucose (&lt;5.6 mmol/L but not below 3.6 mmol/L) Normal glucose tolerance (evaluated by a 75 g oral glucose test, i.e. &lt;7.8 mmol/L but not below 3.6 mmol/L) BMI ranging from 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 Insulin resistance (IR) will be calculated from fasting glucose and insulin values using the Homeostasis Assessment Model 2 (HOMA2). A HOMA2IR value of greater than 1.0 will be considered indicative of insulin resistance (Levy J.C. et al. 1998). Regular consumption of millet as defined by questionnaire at screening defined as more than 1x per week Smoking or use of recreational drugs Heavy alcohol use (defined as typically &gt;14 drinks per week or &gt;4 drinks on one occasion) Very low fibre consumption as assessed by 24 hour food diary and selfreported fruit/vegetable/whole grain servings. Restrained eater as defined by the questionnaire at screening (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, Stunkard et al.,1985) Food neophobic defined by Food Neophobia Scale questionnaire Unusual sleep patterns or irregular breakfast consumption Recent (i.e. &gt;4 kg in previous 3 months) or intended weight loss or gain Food allergies or any lifethreatening allergy (food or otherwise) Inflammatory bowel disease or other gastrointestinal disorders Use of drugs which influence carbohydrate metabolism Training or elite athletes Inability to adhere to Study Protocols</criteria>
