	<criteria>History of moderate to severe rhinoconjunctivitis consistent with allergy to grass for at least 2 years. Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) of at least 70% of predicted value or personal best if available at the Screening Visit. Perennial Rye grass or Timothy grassspecific IgE ≥ 0.35 kU/L as measured by ImmunoCAP®. Positive skin prick test to Perennial Rye grass or Timothy grass allergen Positive skin prick test ≥ 5 mm to any confounding, coexisting seasonal allergens likely to be present during the preseason baseline and grass pollen period. Medical records of symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or asthma or a positive skin test ≥ 5 mm due to a perennial allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed (moulds, dust mites, cockroaches, and animal dander) and which cannot be avoided during the course of the study. Previous immunotherapy treatment with any grass allergen for more than 1 month within 5 years prior to screening. Subjects who had been treated with any nongrass licensed allergen immunotherapy extracts or nongrass investigational immunotherapy for more than 1 month within 1 year.</criteria>
