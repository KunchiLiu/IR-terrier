	<brief_summary>A multi-centre prospective cohort study, which examines the effect of a team training educational intervention for pediatric resuscitation team members. The study uses simulation-based training as the primary teaching method to evaluate the effect of team training on team performance, as measured by adherence to PALS guidelines. By re-testing participants again after 6-12 months, the study will examine long-term retention of these skills. Hypothesis: adherence to PALS guidelines is improved following team training of pediatric resuscitation team members.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A multi-centre prospective cohort study, which examines the effect of a team training educational intervention for pediatric resuscitation team members. The study uses simulation-based training as the primary teaching method to evaluate the effect of team training on team performance, as measured by adherence to PALS guidelines. By re-testing participants again after 6-12 months, the study will examine long-term retention of these skills. The investigator anticipates sustained, improved team performance after team training. If this proves to be true, the long-term goal is to disseminate this training widely across Canada, in order to benefit all paediatric resuscitation teams, and ultimately their patients.</detailed_description>
