	<brief_title>Identification by Microarrays of the Risks of Metastatic Relapse, Toxicity and Resistance to Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Completely Resected Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- A first blood sample will be taken during the week before the operation. A second blood sample will be taken 4 to 8 weeks after the operation. And in case of relapse, a third sample will be taken. These samples are going to be stored in the collection of biological resources of Angers. - Concerning the biopsy of the resected NSLCL, it will be sent to the collection of biological resources of Angers for conservation directly next to the surgery.</detailed_description>
