	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to determine the effect of a community-based walking exercise program with detailed training, monitoring, and coaching (TMC) exercise components enhanced by community-based participatory research (CBPR) practices (TMC+) on the primary outcome of peak walking time (PWT) in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community Walking Exercise for Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will test the hypothesis that PAD patients randomized to the exercise program in the community setting incorporating TMC+ will improve walking ability compared with patients who receive the standard of care (exercise advice). Secondary hypotheses include a significant improvement in patient-reported outcomes, an improvement in functional ability or a significant increase in volume of physical activity for patients who complete community-based walking exercise when compared with patients receiving the standard of care. Exploratory hypotheses include a significant improvement in PWT for 1) patients receiving a combination of lower extremity endovascular therapy (ET) and community-based walking exercise or 2) open peripheral intervention and community-based walking exercise compared to patients who do not receive endovascular therapy or open intervention and receive only the standard of care.</detailed_description>
