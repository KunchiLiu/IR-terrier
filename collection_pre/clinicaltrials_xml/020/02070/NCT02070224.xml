	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to assess the prognostic value of serum and urinary biomarkers Coll2-1 and Coll2-1NO2 at baseline, and their change over the first year, on the progression of knee osteoarthritis MRI scores at 12 months, on the progression of knee osteoarthritis clinical score at 12 months. Additionally, this study will search for correlations between serum and urinary biomarkers Coll2-1 and Coll2-1NO2 at baseline with the radiographic, MRI and clinical severity of knee osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
