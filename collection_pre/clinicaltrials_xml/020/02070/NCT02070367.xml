	<brief_summary>This pilot study will test a new therapy, somatosensory rehabilitation, for the painful sensitivity experienced by persons with nerve injuries and/or complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Several methods for measuring pain and sensitivity that emphasize the person's evaluation of their own symptoms and the impact of these symptoms on their daily activities will also be tested to make sure they are consistent and accurate. Previous research has suggested one of the assessments may also be used to assist in the identification of CRPS: this simple test will be evaluated to see if it can accurately identify persons with this disorder (for which there is currently no diagnostic test). Together, this will improve treatment of CRPS through early, accurate diagnosis and the ability to measure important changes in this painful condition, and set up future studies for this new rehabilitation treatment method.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Somatosensory Assessment and Rehabilitation of Allodynia (SARA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will test four groups: persons with CRPS of one upper extremity, persons with recent hand fractures (&lt;12 weeks) or peripheral nerve injuries with residual sensory deficits at the time of the study, and healthy normal volunteers with a battery of assessments for CRPS, including a technique to precisely localize and quantify static mechanical allodynia.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of a) Complex Regional Pain Syndrome or b) Peripheral Nerve Injury or c) recent hand trauma without peripheral nerve injury in a single upper extremity confirmed by physician or medical record. Participant and most responsible physician give consent to exclusive focus on somatosensory rehabilitation for the duration of the trial (6 months). The participant may continue any oral medications but any planned use of topical medication, injections or IV medication in the affected limb is contraindicated. Use of these modalities in an emergency situation would of course take priority. History of cardiac or vascular disease or known sensitivity to sympathetic stress or cold intolerance or medically unstable Confounding diagnoses: whiplash, nerve root compression, metabolic diseases such as diabetes or thyroid problems, and/or peripheral neuropathy Open wounds on testing sites Unable to provide informed consent</criteria>
