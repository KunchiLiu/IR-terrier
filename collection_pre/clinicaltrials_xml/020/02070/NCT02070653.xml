	<brief_summary>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a major health problem and ruptured AAA is a common cause of death in Europe and North America. A key limitation of contemporary treatment strategies of AAA is the lack of therapy directed at reducing expansion. Although surgical repair is an effective treatment for large AAA, it is associated with significant mortality and morbidity as well as substantial cost. The rationale for this randomized controlled study is to investigate whether treatment with Ticagrelor inhibits growth of small abdominal aortic aneurysms.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provision of written informed consent Male and female patients Age 5085 years Documented infrarenal aortic aneurysm between 3549 mm Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)na√Øve Short expected survival. On antiplatelet therapy. On longterm oral or parenteral anticoagulant treatment. On strong inhibitors of CYP3A enzyme (Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Voriconazole, Telithromycin, Clarithromycin, Ritonavir, Saquinavir, Nelfinavir, Indinavir, Atazanavir). On CYP3A (Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A) substrates or inducers &gt;40mg daily doses (Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Rifampin/rifampicin, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital). Known or suspected connective tissue disorder (Marfans syndrome, etc), infected or inflammatory aneurysm, aneurysm post aortic dissection or previous surgery of the infrarenal aorta. Increased risk for bradycardia or ongoing treatment with any bradycardia inducing drug. Contraindication for Ticagrelor; hypersensitivity to Ticagrelor or any of the excipients, active pathological bleeding, history of intracranial hemorrhage, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (eg, ascites and/or clinical signs of coagulopathy), on haemodialysis. Known haemostatic or coagulation disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or increased bleeding risk due to surgery or trauma within 30 days. MRI exclusion criteria, such as: severe claustrophobia, pacemaker, metallic implants in brain, cochlear implants. Metallic implants in aortic region. Enrolled in either another investigational drug or medical device study or another investigational study of an approved drug or medical device within 30 days prior to visit 1 of the current study. Any condition or laboratory finding which in the opinion of the Investigator makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion (eg, active malignancy other than squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer, longterm concomitant treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</criteria>
