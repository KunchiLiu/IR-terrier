	<brief_summary>Motion limitations have been previously reported in people with headaches originating from the neck/cervicogenic headaches. A test involving flexing and rotating the neck has been found useful to diagnose this type of headache. This observational study investigates this neck motion test when performed actively by the patient and passively by the examiner, then compares the results of motion attained.</brief_summary>
