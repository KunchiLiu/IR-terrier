	<brief_summary>The overall aim is to study the multiple factors determining the variation of weight loss after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve surgery. The specific aims are to evaluate: a) what explains the large individual differences in weight loss seen after RYGB and Sleeve surgery, b) if it is possible pre-operatively to identify which patients will not obtain beneficial effects of bariatric surgery in relation to weight loss and quality of life and c) if patients in need of improved care can be identified pre- and/or early post-operatively.</brief_summary>
