	<brief_summary>Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) affects up to 43% of women in the United States and Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) is the most common form. There is no standardized treatment for this condition. We know that alternative therapies such as acupuncture have been beneficial to women suffering from urinary incontinence, chronic lower back pain, and migraines. We hypothesize that the quality of life for premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) will improve with initiation of acupuncture therapy for a duration of 5-weeks. Validated questionnaires are administered at the time of enrollment and 1 week after the final acupuncture session as the method of analyzing our primary outcome.</brief_summary>
