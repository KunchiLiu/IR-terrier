	<brief_summary>Physical exercise triggers various physiological responses including a marked increase in muscle blood flow and oxygen delivery in order to support muscle activity. How muscle blood flow is controlled is currently unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to establish the respective contribution of metabolic (linked to energy requirements) and mechanical (linked to muscle tensions) signals in the exercise hyperemia and the possible role of the red blood cells. Vasodilation and muscle blood flow during exercise are controlled by ATP released in the plasma from the red blood cells in response to a combination of metabolic and mechanical signals applied on the vasculature.</brief_summary>
