Anticipated concomitant use of any of the following medications during the course of study therapy: valproic acid or divalproex sodium, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or serotonin 5HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), meperidine, or buspirone. Receipt of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug or anticipated concomitant use during the course of study therapy.</criteria>
