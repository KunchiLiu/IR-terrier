	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies an imaging technique known as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) in identifying the presence of pancreatic cancer. DCE MRI is a procedure that takes detailed pictures of functional and structural properties inside the body using magnetic field and radio frequency pulses. These pictures may help identify underlying malignancy in patients at high risk or active malignancy in patients who have undergone chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DCE MRI in Diagnosing Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the ability of DCE MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients at high risk for hereditary pancreatic cancer. II. Assess the ability of DCE MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients with cystic lesions of the pancreas. III. Assess the ability to DCE MRI to accurately predict tumor margins in patients who have undergone chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. In each of the three groups listed above clinical factors associated with the presence of pancreatic cancer will be analyzed; in addition, disease free survival and overall survival will be analyzed in each group. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups. ARM I (High-risk for familial or hereditary pancreatic cancer): Patients undergo DCE MRI for up to 3 scans. ARM II (Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMN)): Patients undergo DCE MRI prior to surgery. ARM III (Unresectable pancreatic cancer): Patients undergo DCE MRI before and after neoadjuvant therapy.</detailed_description>
