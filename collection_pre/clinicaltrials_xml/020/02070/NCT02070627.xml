	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate an imaging system using Indocyanine Green (ICG) to assist in real-time identification of anatomy during cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) in patients with acute cholecystitis and cholangitis. We propose to define the effectiveness of NIRF-C in identifying the cystic duct junction during cholecystectomy.</brief_summary>
