	<brief_summary>To evaluate in patients with stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) the efficacy of statins (simvastatin) on: (1) endothelial function; (2) systemic inflammation; (3)BODE (B: body mass , O: bronchial obstruction, D: dyspnea and, E: exercise tolerance) index; (4) Uric acid; and, (5)vascular growth factors. Design: a 12 weeks randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo control study. Population: 18 males with stable COPD between 40-80 years of age, exsmokers, with Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) between 30 and 80% predicted post-bronchodilation.</brief_summary>
