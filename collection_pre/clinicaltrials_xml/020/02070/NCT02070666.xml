	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesis is that patients at risk of ARDS, detected by LIPS (Lung Injury Prediction Score), under mechanical ventilation could benefit from a protective ventilatory strategy (used in ARDS treatment) in order to avoid or decrease the ARDS development. This would lead to a decrease in incidence, mortality and health care costs associated to this syndrome. This study will help to confirm the current evidence about low tidal volumes, evaluating adverse events of this strategy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective is to evaluate the effect of a protective ventilatory strategy by using lower tidal volumes compared to the use of traditionally volumes in ARDS development.</detailed_description>
