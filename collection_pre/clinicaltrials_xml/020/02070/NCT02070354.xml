	<brief_title>Physical Fitness and Nutrition Intake in Bariatric Surgery Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two-pronged study. The first phase is a cross-sectional study design meaning each participant will only be tested once. The investigators wish to test patients from each of the groups listed below to determine CR fitness, activity level, and nutrient intake. The investigators wish to determine if any improvements from bariatric surgery can be maintained over a 2-year period following surgery. If this is the case, our next project will be to track the patients recruited at their new visit longitudinally at all of the five time points listed below. 1. New visit with GI Nutrition 2. 1 month prior to bariatric surgery (at the time of the patient's initial visit with the surgeon (6-7 months after their new visit)) 3. 6 months after bariatric surgery 4. 12 months after bariatric surgery 5. 24 months after bariatric surgery</detailed_description>
