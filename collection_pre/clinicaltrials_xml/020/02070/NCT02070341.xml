	<brief_summary>Introduction: Colonoscopy is an important tool for colon cancer screening. Proper colon cleansing is essential to ensure adequate mucosal examination. Timing of bowel preparation administration is now recognized as an important component for achieving superior cleansing. Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have found split-dosing to be superior than day-before dosing. Objective: This study aims to compare two types of bowel preparations in split-doses to assess for differences in patient tolerability, as well as efficacy of colon cleansing. Methods: This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized-controlled trial. Patients who are being referred for a colonoscopy will be recruited to participate in the study. They will be randomly assigned to receive either a split-dose polyethylene glycol (PEG) or picosalax (P/MC) bowel preparation. Patient tolerability will be examined through questionnaires. The endoscopist performing the colonoscopy will use two standardized bowel preparation scoring systems to evaluate the quality of the cleansing. The investigators propose that P/MC will be superior to PEG in patient tolerability and non-inferior in bowel cleansing effects.</brief_summary>
