	<brief_summary>No more than 56% of subjects at the Robley Rex Louisville Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) prescribed boceprevir-based triple therapy, will complete Hepatitis C (HCV) treatment as prescribed. Of patients who did not complete therapy, the primary reasons for discontinuation were side effects (48%) and non-adherence (32%). An intervention is needed to improve the treatment completion rate in subjects so they can achieve the high SVR rates noted in SPRINT-2 and RESPOND-2</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Technology-Based Application To Improve The Triple Therapy Adherence Rate In Subjects With Hepatitis C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol is a Phase II Open Label Clinical Trial of a technology-based application "On-Plan" (OP) which is expected to improve adherence to boceprevir-based triple therapy in subjects with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C infection compared to historical controls from the University of Louisville. OP uses a combination of smart phone and computer-based social support to correct non-adherence and manage side effects as well as contingency management (positive reinforcement) when patient-reported compliance is documented by pill counts and/or electronic compliance monitors. 52 consenting subjects prescribed boceprevir-based triple therapy for chronic genotype 1 HCV according the U.S. prescribing information will be enrolled and all will receive the OP application. A Simon's two stage procedure will be utilized to minimize risk while preliminary efficacy/safety data are collected on this innovative "app" for HCV therapy.</detailed_description>

Patients may be either treatment naïve or previously treated as long as they have not been treated with a protease inhibitor. Patients may have compensated cirrhosis. 6. Subject and subject's partner(s) must each agree to use acceptable methods of contraception for at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and continue until at least 6 months after last dose of study medication, or longer if dictated by local regulations. Postmenopausal women are not required to use contraception. Postmenopausal is defined as at least 12 consecutive months without a spontaneous menstrual period.

Subject is under the age of legal consent, is mentally or legally incapacitated, has significant emotional problems at the time of prestudy screening visit or expected during the conduct of the study or has a history of a clinically significant psychiatric disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study procedures. 2. Subjects coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus (Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or HIV positive. 3. Treatment for hepatitis C with any investigational medication. Prior treatments with herbal remedies with known hepatotoxicity are exclusionary. All herbal remedies including but not limited to St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) used for hepatitis C treatment must be discontinued before Day 1. Only silibinin based products such as silymarin (milk thistle) are allowed during the trial. 4. Subjects receiving any of the following medication(s) within 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit that are highly dependent on CYP3A4/5 for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations could be associated with serious and/or lifethreatening events such as orally administered midazolam, pimozide, amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, and ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine). The following medications are also exclusionary if taken within 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit: alfuzosin, cisapride, triazolam, sildenafil, and tadalafil (the latter 2 only if they are used for the indication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 5. Participation in any other clinical trial within 30 days of the screening visit in this trial or intention to participate in another clinical trial during participation in this trial. Collection of additional blood, urine, or tissue samples or additional data, beyond that specified in this protocol, is prohibited (other than that related to the subject's medical care). 6. Evidence of decompensated liver disease. 7. Subject has evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or is under evaluation for HCC. 8. Subject is diabetic and/or hypertensive with clinically significant ocular examination findings within 6 months prior to the screening visit or between the screening visit and Day 1: retinopathy, cotton wool spots, optic nerve disorder, retinal hemorrhage, or any other clinically significant abnormality. 9. Subject has preexisting psychiatric condition(s) including but not limited to: Current moderate or severe depression or history of severe psychiatric disturbance. 10. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of substance abuse which the investigators of the following specified drugs within specified timeframes: 1.
