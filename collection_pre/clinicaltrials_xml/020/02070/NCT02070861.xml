	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that exhaled CO2 reflect changes in blood circulation due to changes in lung circulation, provided CO2-production in the tissues and ventilation from the lungs are stable. The investigators want to investigate this in patients using different devices: a finger cuff measuring blood pressure and cardiac output (the amount of blood being pumped out of the heart each minute), an esophagus ultra sound device measuring cardiac output, and exhaled carbondioxide in the patients` breath measured by the ventilator. The investigators investigate patients undergoing bypass surgery on the heart, as they undergo relevant changes in blood circulation during their operation.</brief_summary>
