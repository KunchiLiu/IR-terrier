	<brief_summary>Studies suggest that kappa agonists (KA) and peripherally restricted kappa agonists (PRKAs) may affect thermoregulation. This pilot study has the aim to establish proof of concept regarding efficacy of an oral kappa agonist (KA) for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Kappa Agonist on Hot Flashes in Menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish proof of concept regarding efficacy of an oral kappa agonist (KA), Pentazocine/ Naloxone 50/0.5 mg, for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes. To gather data in support of a future proposal to study the safety and efficacy of a PRKA, a type of KA, for amelioration of menopausal hot flashes.</detailed_description>
