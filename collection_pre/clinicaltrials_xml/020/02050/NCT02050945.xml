	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present project is to investigate the physiological effects of two different types of exercise training in COPD patients. The patients will be examined before, during and after 8 weeks of training to evaluate the effect of different types of skeletal muscle stimulation on health related quality of life, 6 min walking distance, flow mediated dilation, and histological properties of skeletal muscle cells, regarding oxidative capacity, fiber type, purinergic receptor amounts and measures of systemic inflammation. The study will test the hypothesis that: Resistance training is superior to endurance training in patients with COPD</brief_summary>
