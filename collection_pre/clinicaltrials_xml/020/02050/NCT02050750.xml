	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory, translational, non-interventional and multi-centre biobank. The aim of the development of such a biobank is to identify potential biomarkers that are indicative of disease relapse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TAILORx Tissue Bank</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to develop a biobank, tissue microarrays (TMAs) and full face sections, which will be used to identify candidate/ novel biomarkers prognostic for disease relapse and predictive for endocrine and/or chemotherapy resistance. The secondary objectives are: - To validate emerging signatures/biomarkers identified. - To develop new assays for the breast cancer clinic.</detailed_description>
