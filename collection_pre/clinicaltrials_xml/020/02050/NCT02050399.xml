	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) may promote alterations in heart responses during exercise or postural maneuver. Thus, the purpose of this study is to observe the influence of different postures (supine, seated and standing) and different percentages (15, 30, 45 and 60%) of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of handgrip in the responses of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) in coronary patients with and without type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
