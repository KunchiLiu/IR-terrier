	<brief_summary>Transfusion of stored blood has been associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance in lambs. The investigators hypothesize that transfusion of one unit of red blood cells stored under standard conditions in intensive care patients will increase pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance to a greater extent than will one unit of fresh red blood cells.</brief_summary>
