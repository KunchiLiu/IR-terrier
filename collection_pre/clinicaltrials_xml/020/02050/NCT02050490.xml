	<brief_summary>This study investigates whether the implementation of a symptom diary for reporting and communicating chemotherapy-related symptoms improves symptom care and decreases symptom burden in adult patients treated with chemotherapy. The hypothesis is studied using a before-and-after design. First, symptom care and symptom burden will be observed in a sample of patients not being offered a symptom diary. Next, the symptom diary will be implemented at the participating hospital and symptom care and symptom burden will now be observed in a new sample of chemotherapy patients.</brief_summary>
