	<brief_summary>Measurement of skin reactivity of cat dander samples obtained by different methods. Subjects will be assessed for the study by of a conventional skin prick test with a positive (histamine), a positive (standardized cat dander extract) and a negative allergen control (a diluent) if they fulfil all other in- and exclusion criteria, too. A screening prick test will be performed in order to confirm positivity (cat dander allergy). A scratch test will be performed in participants after a positive screening prick test, in order to measure skin reactivity to cat dander, originating of three different body areas of the cat. For this purpose, a small amount of cat fur in solution with distilled water will be placed onto the volar aspect of both forearms after the skin has been scratched with a scratch lancet. The distilled water in which the cat hair was solved before will serve as negative control. This procedure will be repeated with fur of the three different areas of the cat, always using triplicates (nine samples per cat). From each of the 20 cats, nine samples will be tested on 20 subjects (one cat/subject).</brief_summary>
