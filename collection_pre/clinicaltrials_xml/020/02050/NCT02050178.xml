	<brief_summary>This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of OMP-54F28 when combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. OMP-54F28 will be administered IV on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) will be administered IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. The planned dose levels of OMP-54F28 are 3.5 mg/kg and 7.0 mg/kg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of OMP-54F28 in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in Patients With Previously Untreated Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depending on safety in this study, additional lower or intermediate dose levels may be evaluated. Depending on emerging safety data from the Phase 1a study 54F28-001 with continuing dose escalation, additional higher dose levels of OMP-54F28 may be evaluated in this study. No dose escalation of OMP-54F28 will be allowed within a dose cohort. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined, up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of OMP-54F28 combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Up to approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study.</detailed_description>
