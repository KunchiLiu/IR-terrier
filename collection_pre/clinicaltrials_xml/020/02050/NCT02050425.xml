	<brief_title>Breath Analysis in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomised placebo-controlled trial (therapeutic vs. subtherapeutic continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) including 30 OSA patients to define the effects of CPAP withdrawal (subtherapeutic CPAP) on the composition of exhaled breath analysed by mass spectrometry for identification of OSA specific markers.</detailed_description>
