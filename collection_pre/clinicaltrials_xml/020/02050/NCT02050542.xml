	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to show that 3 targeted biopsies on the suspicious image detected by IRM, guided by a fusion of MRI and ultrasound- images with the Koelis ® system, will get no lower rate of cancer detection than those obtained by 12 systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Current Practice Which Compare the Rate of Prostate Cancer by Using 2 Kind of Transrectal Biopsies: 3 by IRM-echography Image Fusion and 12 Systematized Guided Echographies.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The act of current practice evaluated by this research is the act of prostate biopsies : the patient will have to undergo 12 systematized transrectal echography guided biopsies of the prostate and 3 additional biopsies targeted on the suspicious lesion detected with MRI, which are both done in current practice. - A first operator is not informed of the location of the target. He will perform a series of 12 systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate. - Immediately after the second operator will perform 3 additional targeted biopsies on the suspicious image detected by IRM, guided by a fusion of MRI and ultrasound- images with the Koelis ® system Act added by the research: Using a fusion of MRI - ultrasound images software system (Koelis ®).</detailed_description>
