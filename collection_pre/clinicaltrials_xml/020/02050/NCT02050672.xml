	<brief_summary>In the present trial, the investigators aim to evaluate whether semen myo-inositol (MI) treatment is able to improve IVF outcomes. In particular, retrieved oocytes will be randomly divided in two groups, one group will be inseminated with MI treated semen while the other will be inseminated with untreated semen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Myoinositol Treatment of Spermatozoa on in Vitro Fertilization Outcome: a Prospective, Randomized Sibling-oocyte Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myo is synthesized from glucose-6-phosphate, it is a precursor of second messengers in the cell signaling pathways and it is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium. Literature data have demonstrated the MI play a crucial role in reproduction, indeed, oocyte and spematozoa are nursed in a medium congaing hig MI concentration. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that, in oligoasthenoteratozoospermic patients, in vitro incubation with 2 mg/ml of myo increase significantly the number of spermatozoa with high mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Moreover, it has been found that the in vitro fertilization rate is correlated with the percentage of high MMP spermatozoa.</detailed_description>
