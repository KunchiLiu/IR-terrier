	<brief_summary>The Virtual Physiological Human: DementiA Research Enabled by IT (VPH-DARE@IT) is a four-year IT-project funded through the European Union (EU). The project consortium involves a total of 21 universities and industrial partners from 10 European countries. The project delivers the first patient-specific predictive models for early differential diagnosis of dementia and their evolution. An integrated clinical decision support platform will be validated / tested by access to a dozen databases of international cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. As a part of the VPH-DARE@IT project, a new prospective cohort will be collected in Kuopio. This prospective cohort will be used to test further the modeling approaches and tools developed by using the retrospective databases.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Virtual Physiological Human: DementiA Research Enabled by IT (VPH-DARE@IT) is a four-year IT-project funded through the European Union (EU). The project will develop multiscale models of the ageing brain in order to account simultaneously for the patient-specific biochemical, metabolic and biomechanical brain substrate, as well as for genetic, clinical, demographic and lifestyle determinants. An integrated clinical decision support platform will be validated and tested by access to a dozen databases of international cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Modeling approaches developed by using the retrospective databases will be tested using a new prospective cohort that will be collected in Kuopio as a part of the VPH-DARE@IT project. The study population at university of Eastern Finland (UEF) will be a total of 120 subjects: 20 healthy controls (HC), 20 mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 20 vascular dementia (VAD) patients, 20 fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) patients and 40 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study is referred as VPH-DARE@IT Prospective study in Kuopio or "ProsKuopio".</detailed_description>
