	<brief_summary>An open-label, non-randomized study to assess the titration, safety and efficacy of intranasal fentanyl pectin nasal spray for the treatment of secondary breakthrough pain secondary to radiation-induced mucositis in patients with confirmed tolerance of opioid therapy for chronic pain. Study objectives include assessment of breakthrough pain episodes related with food intake in patients with mucositis secondary to radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy for head and neck tumors</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An open, non-randomized study design was used to assess the titration, safety and efficacy of intranasal fentanyl in pectin for the treatment of secondary breakthrough pain in patients with confirmed tolerance of opioid therapy for chronic pain secondary to radiation-induced mucositis. The study plans to include 30 evaluable patients from multiple centers throughout the country. The trial comprises a screening period, an open titration period, and an open-label treatment period in which at least 12 breakthrough pain episodes are to be treated.</detailed_description>
