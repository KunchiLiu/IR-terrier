A variety of studies showed that it cause significant weight loss, recovery from diabetes and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure. The recent guidelines suggest that patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 with co morbidities is a candidate for bariatric surgery.

Therefore, this research is designed to observe whether bariatric surgery reduce blood pressure in patients with diabetes and relatively lower BMI.</brief_summary>
