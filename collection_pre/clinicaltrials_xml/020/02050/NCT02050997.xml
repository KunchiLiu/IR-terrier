	<detailed_description>This study will involve two cohort groups, all patients involved will have PDAC. Cohort A: Target is 80 resectable PDAC patients who will receive standard treatment of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy Cohort B: - Cohort B1 = Target is 80 unresectable locally advanced PDAC patients who will receive standard treatment of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy. - Cohort B2 = Target is metastatic PDAC patients who will receive standard treatment of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy. Control patients: Target is 50, with acute pancreatitis admitted to hospital for observation/treatment. Blood samples will be taken at the following time points: - prior to resection, whenever feasible for cohort A - prior to CT, for both cohort A and B - during CT, for both cohort A and B - follow-up, approximately every 3 to 6 months for two years for cohort A</detailed_description>
