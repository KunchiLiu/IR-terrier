	<brief_summary>Extremely low birth weight infants have significant water loss through their skin immediately after birth. This significant fluid loss is because they have large amounts of fluids, have immature skin and large surface area. Loss of fluids is associated with many complications. The investigators hypothesize that application of sterile water to the skin of these infants is associated with decreased fluid requirements in the first week of life , improve skin integrity and decrease some complications of prematurity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Application of Sterile Water to the Skin of Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW) Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants have significant transepidermal water loss immediately after birth. This significant fluid loss is related to proportionally large extracellular pool of fluids, the immaturity of the skin barrier, and the relatively large surface area exposed to evaporation. Water depletion in this population is associated with development of significant electrolyte imbalance in the form of hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. In order to compensate for these losses, clinicians have to progressively increase fluid intake. Excessive fluid intake in the first days of life is associated with worsening patent ductus artriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality. Also skin integrity is important to protect against skin infection and secondary sepsis. Based on recent studies and relevant data, the risk of sepsis in ELBW is up to 40% nationwide, but only about 25% at GWUH Water application is a benign treatment that is routinely applied to the skin of premature babies and was shown to decrease skin colonization. The current practice at GWUH is to clean the bodies of premature infants using a piece of damp cloth with warm water. This is performed at birth and consequently every other days. The study group will receive more frequent and standardized applications. The investigators hypothesize that application of sterile water in ELBW infants is associated with decreased fluid requirements in the first week of life. As a secondary outcome, the investigators hypothesize that sterile water application is associated with improved skin integrity, decreased incidence of BPD with no increased incidence of skin or systemic infections.</detailed_description>
