	<brief_title>Egg Ingestion in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Inclusion of eggs in the diets of individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus will improve glycemic control, anthropometric measures and overall diet quality. Restriction of dietary cholesterol, and thus the avoidance or restriction of egg intake, is routinely recommended to patients at increased risk for CVD, including those with diabetes. However, the relative importance of dietary cholesterol to serum lipids and the role of egg ingestion in cardiovascular risk are increasingly suspect. Further, the exclusion of eggs from the diet may lead to increased consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrate foods of particular potential harm to individuals with diabetes. The examination of how food-specific recommendations translate into effects on other food choices and overall diet quality, and in turn health effects, is a neglected area of research. Eggs provide a complete profile of amino acids and an array of micronutrients, and are low in total fat. Although epidemiological and clinical studies largely suggest a lack of association between egg intake and harmful effects, the evidence is somewhat more ambiguous with regard to glycemic control for diabetes, or the risk for CVD among individuals with diabetes. Our own prior work shows no adverse effects of egg ingestion in healthy adults, hyperlipidemic adults, or adults with established coronary artery disease. As a satiating and protein-rich food, eggs have potential to foster calorie and weight control, and to reduce the dietary glycemic load, offering potential advantages in Type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>
