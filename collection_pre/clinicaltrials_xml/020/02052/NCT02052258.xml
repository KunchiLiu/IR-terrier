	<brief_summary>Opiate dependence is a serious problem, and oxytocin has many properties which make it attractive as a treatment for this type of substance dependence. This experiment will test the effects of oxytocin on a variety of brain-based processes in patients with opiate dependence. The investigators hypothesize that intranasal oxytocin in these conditions will enhance emotional processing and will have beneficial effects on stress responses in opiate-dependent patients.</brief_summary>
