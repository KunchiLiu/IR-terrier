	<brief_summary>Primary Objective - To assess the relative efficacy of two dose levels of CINRYZE (500 Units and 1000 Units) administered by intravenous (IV) injection every 3 or 4 days to prevent angioedema attacks in children 6 to 11 years of age with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Secondary Objectives - To assess the safety and tolerability, characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), and assess the immunogenicity of two dose levels of CINRYZE administered by IV injection in children 6 to 11 years of age with HAE.</brief_summary>
