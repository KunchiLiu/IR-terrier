	<brief_summary>This randomized phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of naproxen in preventing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of naproxen may keep cancer from forming in patients with Lynch syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Naproxen in Preventing DNA Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal Cancer in Patients With Lynch Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether treatment with naproxen at a once-daily 220 mg or 440-mg dose, administered for 6 months as compared to placebo reduces the concentration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in normal colorectal mucosa in subjects at risk for a mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer. II. To determine the toxicity profile and tolerability of naproxen at two doses (220 mg or 440-mg once daily) as compared to placebo over 6 months of therapy in subjects at risk for a mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine naproxen concentrations in plasma of patients at risk for DNA mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer taking naproxen once daily, 220 mg, 440 mg or placebo after 6 months of therapy compared to baseline levels. II. To determine naproxen concentrations in normal colorectal mucosa of patients at risk for DNA mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancers (CRC) taking naproxen once daily 220 mg, 440 mg or placebo after 6 months of therapy compared to baseline levels. III. To determine whether urinary prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 metabolite (PGE-M) is significantly higher in patients at risk for DNA mismatch repair deficient CRC taking naproxen one daily, 220 mg, 440 mg or placebo after 6 months of therapy compared to baseline levels. IV. To determine whether 6-months therapy with naproxen once daily, 220 mg, 440 mg or placebo leads to a reduction in the number of polyps observed in the rectosigmoid and rectal area. V. To determine whether naproxen once daily, 220 mg, 440 mg or placebo will significantly change the micro-ribonucleic (RNA) profile of normal colorectal mucosa in patients at risk for DNA mismatch repair deficient CRC compared to the baseline. VI. To determine whether naproxen once daily, 220 mg, 440 mg or placebo will significantly change the gene expression messenger RNA (mRNA) profile of normal colorectal mucosa in patients at risk for DNA mismatch repair deficient CRC compared to the baseline. VII. To determine whether naproxen once daily, 220 mg, 440 mg or placebo will significantly change the mutational rate in patients at risk for DNA mismatch repair deficient CRC compared to placebo. VIII. To determine future candidate biomarkers measured by genomic and transcriptomic platforms in tissue biopsies of normal colorectal mucosa in individuals at risk for mismatch repair deficient CRC pre- and post-treatment with naproxen. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive high-dose naproxen orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months. ARM II: Patients receive low-dose naproxen PO QD and placebo PO QD for 6 months. ARM III: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must have Lynch syndrome defined as meeting any of the following: "Mutationpositive Lynch syndrome": carriers or obligate carriers (by pedigree) of a pathogenic mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (i.e. mutL homolog 1 [MLH1], mutS homolog 2 [MSH2]/epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EPCAM], mutS homolog 6 [MSH6], or PMS2 postmeiotic segregation increased 2 [S. cerevisiae] [PMS2]) or "Mutationnegative Lynch syndrome": patients with a personal history of a nonsporadic MMR deficient premalignant lesion (i.e. polyp) or a nonsporadic MMR deficient malignant tumor (where "nonsporadic MMR deficient" is defined by: microsatelliteinstability high by either immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability [MSI] testing or both, but no evidence of MLH1 promoter methylation in cases with loss of both MLH1 and PMS2, and/or no evidence of vraf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B [BRAF] mutation in cases with loss of both MLH1 and PMS2) but germline MMR genetic testing showed either a variant of unknown significance or mutation negative result or had declined germline MMR genetic testing Participants must not have evidence of active/recurrent malignant disease for 6 months Participants must be at least 6 months from any prior cancerdirected treatment (such as surgical resection, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation) Participants must have endoscopically accessible distal colon and/or rectal mucosa (i.e. participants must have at least part of the descending/sigmoid colon and/or rectum intact) Participants must consent to one standard of care lower gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) with biopsies and one flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies that will be 6 months (+14 days) apart Participants must consent to refrain from using aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase (COX)inhibitors for the duration of the trial Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;
