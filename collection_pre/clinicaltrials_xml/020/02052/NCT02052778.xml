	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of TAS-120 and determine the most appropriate dose for the subsequent phase 2 safety and efficacy study in patients with advanced solid tumors and multiple myeloma with genetic abnormalities. The progression of cancers is caused by a complex series of multiple genetic and molecular events leading to changes in the patients DNA. The fibroblast growth factor/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGF/FGFR) signaling pathway is important for normal organ, vascular and skeletal development. However, FGFR gene abnormalities have been linked to various cancers. TAS-120 is a highly potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of FGFR and is therefore is being studied as a therapy for cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Finding Study Followed by a Safety and Efficacy Study in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Multiple Myeloma With FGF/FGFR-Related Abnormalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and rationale for study: - Activating fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene abnormalities are reported in various cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (FGFR1 amplification), breast (FGFR1 and 2 amplification), gastric (FGFR2 amplification), bladder (FGFR3 activating mutation or gene translocation), endometrial (FGFR2 activating mutation), multiple myeloma (FGFR3 gene translocation), and rhabdomyosarcoma (FGFR4-activating mutation). - TAS-120 is a novel, highly potent and selective small molecule FGFR inhibitor. Phase 1 Dose Escalation: Primary • To investigate the safety and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAS-120 in patients with advanced solid tumors with or without FGF/FGFR abnormalities for whom no available therapy is likely to convey clinical benefit. Secondary - To investigate the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAS-120. - To investigate the clinical pharmacodynamics of TAS-120. - To determine any preliminary antitumor activity observed with TAS-120. Phase 1 Expansion and Phase 2: Primary •To investigate the efficacy of the TAS-120 RP2D in patients with advanced solid tumors or multiple myeloma, with FGF/FGFR abnormalities for whom no available therapy is likely to convey clinical benefit. Secondary •To investigate the safety of TAS-120.</detailed_description>
