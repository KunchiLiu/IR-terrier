	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CetuGEX™ for the treatment of patients with stage III/IV recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN as compared to cetuximab (both in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy) in terms of progression-free survival (PFS).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histologically confirmed recurrent and/or metastatic EGFRpositive SCCHN not eligible for local treatment. 2. Patients with measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. 3. Patients aged at least 18 years at screening. 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 5. Minimum life expectancy of 3 months. 6. Tissue samples available for specific disease and therapy related biological assessments. 7. If female and of childbearing potential, is nonlactating and has negative pregnancy test results at screening and prior to randomization. 8. If female, is either not of childbearing potential or using highly effective contraceptives. 9. Willing and able to comply with the protocol. 10. Willing and able to provide written informed consent. 1. Prior systemic chemotherapy (except if given as part of a multimodal treatment for locally advanced disease which was completed more than 6 months prior to screening). 2. Cetuximab or other EGFR targeting agent treatment (except if given as part of a multimodal treatment for locally advanced disease which was completed more than 6 months prior to screening). 3. Surgery (other than minor interventions like diagnostic biopsy or intravenous port implantation) or irradiation within 30 days before randomization. 4. Concomitant antitumor therapy or concomitant immunotherapy. 5. Concomitant corticosteroid treatment unless specified within the protocol. 6. Clinical evidence of brain metastasis or leptomeningeal involvement. 7. Patients with nasopharyngeal tumors. 8. Concomitant malignant disease, except for adequately treated tumors with high likelihood of being cured (e.g., basal cell cancer of the skin, cervical cancer or breast cancer in situ). Patients with other previous malignancies but without evidence of disease for at least 5 years will be allowed to enter the study. 9. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 10. Clinically active infections ≥ Grade 2 using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 and/or requiring intravenous antibiotics. 11. Known active hepatitis B or C. 12. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 13. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening. 14. Symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Grade 3 or 4), unstable angina pectoris within 6 months prior to screening, significant cardiac arrhythmia, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 1 year prior to screening. 15. History of keratitis requiring medical interventions within the last 5 years. 16. Patients with any other disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the conduct of the study. 17. Patients with an unstable condition (e.g., psychiatric disorder, a recent history of drug or alcohol abuse, interfering with study compliance, within 6 months prior to screening) or otherwise thought to be unreliable or incapable of complying with the requirements of the protocol. 18. Patients institutionalized by official means or court order. 19. Receipt of any other investigational medicinal product within the last 30 days before randomization or any previous CetuGEX™ administration. 20. Prior allergic reaction to a monoclonal antibody, grade 3 infusion related reaction (IRR) or any grade 4 reaction to a monoclonal antibody. 21. Known sensitivity to any component of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) and medication used in this study.</criteria>
