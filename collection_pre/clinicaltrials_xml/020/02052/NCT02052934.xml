	<brief_summary>A Phase 1 dose escalating study of ETEC candidate vaccine to determine safety and immunogenicity of a multi-dose regimen in healthy adult volunteers. The study will be conducted at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). The primary objectives assess the safety and tolerability of dmLT vaccine when administered in three doses sublingually over a range of dosages in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objectives assess long-term safety follow-up from immunization through Month 7 post vaccination, following three SL doses of dmLT vaccine over a range of dosages and comparing with three doses of a comparable dosage of oral vaccine. The study subject population is 52 healthy adult male and female subjects, ages 18 to 45. Subject participation duration is approximately 8 months with study duration of approximately 1.5-2 years, including 6-7 months of follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of Sublingual dmLT for ETEC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the public health burden of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) on travelers, deployed soldiers and, most significantly, young children in the developing world, there is no licensed vaccine against ETEC enteritis.This is a Phase 1 study in healthy adults to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an ETEC candidate vaccine, attenuated recombinant dmLT from ETEC, administered by the SL (Sublingual) or Oral Immunization. The study subject population is 52 healthy adult male and female subjects, ages 18 to 45. Subject participation duration is approximately 8 months with study duration of approximately 1.5-2 years, including 6-7 months of follow-up. Potential risks include subjects could develop varying degrees of diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, abdominal pain or cramping, gas, and decreased appetite). Blood drawing may be associated with pain and bruising at the site and rarely, with fainting or seizure. There is no direct benefit to subjects from participating in this study but the potential benefits to children and adults who may receive a future beneficial vaccine based on the results of this trial justify the more than minimal risk of the subjects who will participate in this trial. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of dmLT vaccine when administered in three doses sublingually over a range of dosages in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objectives are to assess long-term safety follow-up from immunization through Month 7 post vaccination, and following three SL doses of dmLT vaccine over a range of dosages and comparing with three doses of a comparable dosage of oral vaccine.</detailed_description>

Demonstrate comprehension of the protocol procedures and knowledge of study by passing a written examination (passing grade is at least 70 percent). Agrees to complete all study visits and procedures. Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential (as defined as surgically sterile or postmenopausal for more than 1 year), or if of childbearing potential, must be using an effective method of birth control (e.g., use hormonal or barrier birth control such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices [IUDs], cervical sponges, diaphragms, condoms with spermicidal agents must have a vasectomized partner) within 2 months of vaccination, or practice abstinence and must agree to continue such precautions during the study and for 30 days after the Day 29 study visit. Male subjects must agree not to father a child for 30 days after the Day 29 study visit. A woman is eligible if she is monogamous with a vasectomized male. Agrees not to participate in another clinical trial during the study period. Agrees not to donate blood to a blood bank for 12 months after receiving the vaccine. Potential subjects must be willing to adhere to the following prohibitions and restrictions during the course of the study to be eligible for participation: Strenuous exercise (e.g., long distance running &gt; 5km/day, weight lifting, or any physical activity to which the subject is not accustomed) is to be avoided during the overnight stay and for at least 72 hours prior to each study drug administration (and the Followup visit). Subjects should not have donated blood in the 8 weeks prior to study entry. Women who are pregnant or lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test at screening or positive urine pregnancy test prior to vaccination.
