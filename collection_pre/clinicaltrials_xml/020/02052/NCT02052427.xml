	<criteria>1. Males or females &gt; 20 and &lt; 80 years of age 2. Significant multivessel coronary artery disease not amenable to percutaneous or surgical revascularization 3. CCS Angina Functional Class IIIV and/or NYHA Stages of Heart Failure Class II or III 4. On maximal medical therapy for anginal symptoms and/or heart failure symptoms 5. Hemodynamic stability (SBP ≥ 90 mm/Hg, HR &lt;110) 6. Ejection fraction ≥ 20% and ≤ 45% 7. Inducible ischemia using an objective assessment of ischemia within 1 year of screening (i.e. exercise ECG changes, SPECT) 8. Left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 8 mm at the target site for cell injection 1. Atrial fibrillation or flutter without a pace maker that guarantees a stable heart rate 2. Unstable angina 3. LV thrombus, as documented by echocardiography 4. Planned staged treatment of CAD or other intervention on the heart 5. Platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 6. WBC &lt; 2,000/mm3 7.
