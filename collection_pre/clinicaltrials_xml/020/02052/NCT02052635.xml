	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if ticagrelor is as effective as clopidogrel in rate of onset and degree of platelet inhibition for patients with non-ST elevation of acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) undergoing ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bivalirudin.</brief_summary>
