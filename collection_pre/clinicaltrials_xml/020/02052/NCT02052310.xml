	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether FG-4592 (roxadustat) is safe and effective in the treatment of anemia in patients who have just begun dialysis treatment for end stage renal disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study for Treatment of Anemia in ESRD Newly Initiated Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a treatment period of a minimum of 52 weeks and a maximum of approximately up to 3 years after last patient is randomized, and a post-treatment follow-up period of 4 weeks. A total of up to 750 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either open-label FG-4592 or Active Control (Epoetin alfa).</detailed_description>
