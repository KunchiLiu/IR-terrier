	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that computer simulated bony impingement of the bone surrounding the spherical glenoid implant (the glenosphere) along the scapular neck on three-dimensional (3-D) computed tomography (CT) imaging analysis is predictive of the location of clinical scapular notching that develops following reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction of Development of Scapular Notching Following Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Specific Aims are: - Determine the relationship between lateral glenoid offset and the development of scapular notching following reverse TSA - Determine the ability of 3-D preoperative planning tools to define areas of scapular bony impingement on kinematic simulated shoulder range of motion that predict the development of scapular notching - Compare the precision and accuracy of plain radiographs (2-D) versus CT (3-D) for measurement of scapular notching and postoperative implant position following reverse TSA (2-D versus 3-D) - Determine the implant and anatomic factors that best correlate with clinical outcome following reverse TSA by retrospective analysis</detailed_description>
