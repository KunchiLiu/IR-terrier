	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find the optimal treatment method for chronic lateral epicondylosis, and focused on the 'healing mechanism' and 'pain modulation' of degenerated tendon.The hypothesis is that there will be significant difference between treatment groups and control group (physiotherapy) and also there will be significant difference among treatment groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study for the Optimal Treatment Method of Lateral Epicondylosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>231 patients were randomized using a Random Sequence Generator (Random.org) into 4 groups: Group A (physiotherapy as a control, n=58), Group B (ESWT, n=62), Group C (Prolotherapy, n=56) and Group D (PRP, n=55). In group A, patients were educated to do stretching and eccentric strengthening exercise of wrist extensor muscles. In group B patients were treated with 3 sessions of high-energy shock wave therapy ESWT (Evotron, Switech medical, Kreuzlingen, CH) in 2 weeks interval. Total energy flux density ranged from 0.1 to 0.14 mJ/mm2 (1500 impulses). Shockwave was targeted over lateral epicondyle where maximum tenderness was located. In group C, injection of 20% dextrose (3cc mixed with 0.3cc of lidocaine) to ECRB tendon was done under ultrasound guidance and in group D, 3 cc of PRP (Harvest SmartPReP 2 APC 30 Process Kit, Harvest Technologies, Plymouth, MA) was injected into ECRB tendon under ultrasound guidance. 22G needle was used for injection in group C and D. The primary outcome measure is DASH scoring system which is recorded on the initial, 3rd, 6th, 18th and 24th month. Secondary outcome measures were ultrasonography (measured on initial, 6th and 24th month) and SSS (Subjective Satisfaction Score) measured on initial and 24th month. After 24 months from the last procedure, all serial questionnaires and physician-filled-SSS sheets were gathered and analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe post-test. A value of p&lt;0.01 was considered statistically significant.</detailed_description>
