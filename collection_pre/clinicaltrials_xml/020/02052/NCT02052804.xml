	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are: 1) to design new diagnostic criteria used to accurately define heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF); 2) to better define the risk factors associated with HFpEF; 3) to elucidate the clinical, cellular and molecular mechanisms involved with the development and progression of HFpEF; 4) to design and test new therapeutic strategies for patients with HFpEF.</brief_summary>
