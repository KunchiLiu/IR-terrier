	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the safety of intravenous (IV) infusion of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) cryopreserved platelets (CPP) in participants with World Health Organization (WHO) Grade 2 bleed in spite of receiving a transfusion of liquid stored platelets (LSP) in the past 48 hours by collecting adverse events (AEs) and by evaluating coagulation-related parameters to assess the evidence of any thrombotic events after CPP or LSP transfusion.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female, at least 18 years of age. Ability to comprehend the study procedures and signed informed consent. If premenopausal female, must have a negative serum pregnancy test, and, if of child bearing potential, must be using an acceptable method of contraception. Diagnosed with any the following: acute leukemia (ALL or AML), chronic leukemia (CML, CLL, CMML, or hairy cell leukemia), myelodysplasia, aplasia, hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic solid tumor, or therapy (chemotherapy or radiation) induced bone marrow aplasia or hypoplasia. Either autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant or peripheral or cord blood stem cell recipients may be enrolled. WHO grade 2 or greater bleeding. LSP transfusion within the previous 48 hours. Acute or chronic DIC as evidence by Ddimer greater than 8 μg/mL and fibrinogen less than 100 mg (0.1 g)/dL. Both criteria must be met. If data are in the medical record for fibrin degradation products (FDPs), then FDP must be &lt;=40 μg/mL (FDP &gt;40 μg/mL is indicative of DIC). PT or aPTT &gt; 1.3 times the upper limit of normal for the laboratory. History of major operative procedures that required general anesthesia in the past 2 weeks. History of any prior major unprovoked thrombotic events and/or known inherited disorder of coagulation or platelet function (by history) (not to include clots in catheters, etc). A history or diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or hemolytic uremic syndrome. Females who are breastfeeding. Venoocclusive disease or possible venoocclusive disease. Receiving active, inpatient treatment with antiplatelet drugs and/or full anticoagulation therapy. Note: a heparin flush may be given daily and before and after blood draws to patients with a central line to keep the line patent. Subject previously enrolled in this study and received a study transfusion.</criteria>
