NOTE: Switching patient from current pain regimen to morphine equivalent for at least 12 weeks prior to registration for protocol therapy is required. Requiring greater than or equal to 180 mg of morphine per day. See Appendix 1 for Morphine Conversion Calculator.

Patients with neurological symptoms should undergo a head CT scan or brain MRI to exclude brain metastasis, at the discretion of the treating physician. NOTE: Patients with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis, no longer require corticosteroids, and are asymptomatic. • Concurrent use of adjuvant medication such as but not limited to: gabapentin, pregabalin or duloxetine etc. NOTE: Patients on gabapentin or pregabalin can be considered if they can be tapered off before enrolling on the study.

Patient with rapidly escalating pain that require hospitalization or an intravenous opioid therapy Concurrent participation in a clinical trial which involves another investigational agent. Concurrent use of medications that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors within 14 days prior to registration for protocol therapy as Oxcarbazepine is strong CYP3A4 inducer. See Appendix 7.
