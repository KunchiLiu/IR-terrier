	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to identify biomarkers and potentially actionable mutations/ activated molecular pathways and evaluate the impact of molecular profiling information on patients with gynaecological cancer. The hypothesis of the study are: - Analysis of gynaecological tumour samples will allow us to identify novel and/or actionable molecular changes that may drive therapeutic strategies for the management of these cancers. - Molecular profiling will improve the outcome of novel targeted-agent treatment in clinical trials - Molecular profiling of paired samples (primary/recurrent and primary/metastatic) will provide new insights into mechanisms underlying drug resistance and metastasis in gynaecological cancers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advances in our understanding of cancer biology has led to a rapid expansion of molecularly targeted therapeutics in pre-clinical and clinical development over the last decade. The systematic sequencing of cancer genomes has revealed that individual tumours frequently harbor multiple "driver" somatic mutations that confer growth advantage and positive selection. Importantly, many of the altered proteins resulting from the mutations identified by these studies are in fact actionable, i.e. "druggable", targets. Hence, evaluating drug efficacy in tumours selected by a combination of histopathology and molecular analysis has the potential to result in a greater therapeutic gain. The premises behind personalised cancer medicine include: i) genetic aberrations exist in human malignancies; ii) a subset of these aberrations frequently exist across multiple tumour types and have functional relevance as drivers for oncogenesis and tumour progression; iii) the molecular effects of these genetic aberrations are potentially actionable targets; and iv) there are medicinal compounds that can safely and effectively modulate such targets in patients with these tumours. The key challenge to optimising this personalised approach to cancer therapy is to ensure that patients with tumours harbouring specific molecular/ genetic aberrations are specifically matched to a particular drug or combination of drugs. In this respect, molecular analysis of tumours to identify somatic mutations and/or other genetic aberrations are examples of enrichment strategies to assist in matching patients to drugs or treatments that have gained increasing interest in the oncology communityGenetic heterogeneity in gynaecological cancer underpins the observed variations in patient outcomes. Hence, the ability to characterise the unique genetic features of each patient's tumour will be a critical step to identifying the optimal therapeutic strategy for the individual.It is anticipated that once a validated process for molecular profiling is fully established at NUHS, this will eventually be integrated into patient care at a much earlier stage. The spectrum and development of molecularly-targeted agents is rapidly expanding, and it is increasingly likely that the future of cancer management will require the molecular and histological subtype of one's tumour to be defined in order to decide on the most appropriate treatment strategy. By initiating this first step towards the development of a well-validated, cohesive, streamlined and efficient process for molecular profiling, the eventual aim will be to obtain formal accreditation so that cancer physicians at NUHS/NCIS, NCC and KKH will be able to unequivocally use the data for patient care.</detailed_description>
