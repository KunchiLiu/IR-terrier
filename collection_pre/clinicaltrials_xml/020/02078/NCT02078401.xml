	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to get more insight into the (neuro)ophthalmological characteristics of children with neurofibromatosis type 1. This way investigators would like to update the current guidelines for follow up and treatment of optic pathway gliomas. Clinical findings will be compared with the results of Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).</brief_summary>
