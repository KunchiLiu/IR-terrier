	<brief_title>Attention Bias Modification Treatment for Major Depression Disorder in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is a common health problem in adolescents. Attentional bias has been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of depression, suggesting that reduction of such biases may treat symptoms of depression. Recent studies have shown that attention bias modification(ABM) training could reduce depressive symptoms in both dysphoria and previously depressed patients.To test the effectiveness of ABM training on the treatment of depressive symptoms in adolescents, we designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in depressed adolescents.</detailed_description>
