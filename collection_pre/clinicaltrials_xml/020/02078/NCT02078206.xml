	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of an early neurocognitive intervention for ICU patients, in terms of psychopathological, neuropsychological and functional improvement. The treatment is supported in an interactive advanced computing platform that includes the continuous biomedical registration of the patients and a virtual reality software specifically designed for critical patients. The investigators expect an improvement in neuropsychological, psychopathological and functional status at hospital discharge and 3 months follow-up in those patients that have received the early neurocognitive intervention comparing with patients treated as usual. Furthermore the investigators expect a decrease of episodes and/or duration of delirium in ICU patients.</brief_summary>
