	<brief_summary>This study will assess multiple doses of MK-8892 administered to participants with pulmonary hypertension "out of proportion" (PHOOP) and heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (rEF). It is hypothesized that generally safe and well tolerated multiple doses of MK-8892 will achieve a true reduction from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 12%.</brief_summary>
