	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if abatacept (Orencia) is effective in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who do not respond adequately to standard treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, Urso, Ursodiol, Actigall).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Abatacept (Orencia) to Treat Primary Biliary Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, active treatment trial to assess the efficacy and safety of abatacept in subject with PBC who have had an incomplete biochemical response to UDCA. In this trial, 20 subjects with PBC who have had an incomplete biochemical response to UDCA will be assigned to treatment with weekly subcutaneous injections of 125 mg of abatacept. The treatment phase of the study will last 24 weeks with an off-treatment follow up at Week 36. Inclusion criteria include: - Confirmed diagnosis of PBC - Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 1.67 times the upper limit of normal after 6 months of treatment with UDCA</detailed_description>

Liver biopsy findings consistent with PBC Incomplete response to UDCA defined by an alkaline phosphatase &gt; 1.67 X the upper limit of normal after 6 months of UDCA at a minimum dose of 13 mg/kg/d Taking a stable dose of UDCA for at least 3 months prior to Day 0 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase ALT &lt; 5 times the upper limit of normal Presence of concomitant liver diseases including viral hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, alcoholic liver disease, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, or Gilbert's syndrome.
