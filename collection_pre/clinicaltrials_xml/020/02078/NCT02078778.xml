	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect on blood pressure of 3 months of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Hypothesis: 1. Central 24-h blood pressure (BP) monitoring hedges day fluctuations in blood pressure more accurately than peripheral 24-h BP monitoring, because the measurement is painless and does not interfere with the patient / subject's activities during the daytime or nighttime sleep. 2. Blood pressure is elevated in patients with OSA and falls during treatment with CPAP. 3. The renal treatment of salt and water is abnormal in OSA, improved during treatment with CPAP. 4. Quality of life improves during treatment with CPAP</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Central and Peripheral Blood Pressure in Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 20 patients with hypertension and moderate to severe OSA are treated with CPAP 3 months to examine the treatment effect on blood pressure throughout the day, but especially nocturnal, renal treatment of salt and water, and quality of life. Before and after 3 months of CPAP treatment is made central and peripheral 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 24-h urine collection and blood samples.</detailed_description>
