	<brief_summary>Aim of the clinical multicenter study (OptimEx-CLIN) is to assess the optimal exercise intervention in patients with Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF; also termed diastolic heart failure) that will best improve peak oxygen uptake (Peak Vo2) and additionally diastolic function (assessed echocardiographically). The investigators hypothesize that exercise training reverses HFpEF and that intensity of exercise training is more important than duration.</brief_summary>
