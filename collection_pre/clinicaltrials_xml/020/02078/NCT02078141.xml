	<brief_summary>18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) may have application in a promising tool for identification of myocardial inflammation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).Therefore, the purpose of the study is to confirm the hypothesis of the fixation of FDG in non cardiomyocyte cells in a number of patients with DCM, to specify the frequency and describe the different binding profiles in comparison with MRI data. Patients will perform an ethologic evaluation of a non ischemic DCM with in a cardiac MRI. All patients will have with in 4 weeks after the MRI a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. A high fat and low carbohydrate diet and an heparin injection will be prescribed to patients before this FDG PET. Patients will be identified as FDG+ or FDG -. The clinical status of the patient will be completed by a 12 months evaluation.</brief_summary>
