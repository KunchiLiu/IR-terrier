	<brief_summary>Respiratory failure is the main death cause in neuromuscular diseases. Non-invasive and volitional measures of inspiratory muscles strength include the nasal pressure with an occluded nostril (Psnip) and the maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax). Unfortunately, volitional maneuvers depend of patient effort. The aim of this research is to validate a non-invasive and non-volitional technique to evaluate diaphragm strength at neuromuscular diseases patients. The methodology consists to add to PImax and Psnip measures 5 phrenic nerves magnetical stimulation maneuvers (Pstim).Stimulations will be realize at 3 inspiratory pression levels (0, -1 cm H2O and -5 cm H2O).</brief_summary>
