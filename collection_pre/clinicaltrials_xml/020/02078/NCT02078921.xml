	<brief_summary>Previous studies have shown that interventions which modestly increase blood nitrite_ improve skeletal muscle function on exercise while sparing oxygen, and have been also shown to open up the blood flow during periods of oxygen deprivation. Inorganic nitrate in the diet is absorbed into the bloodstream, concentrated and reduced by bacteria in the mouth to nitrite, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. . The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of oral inorganic nitrate supplementation on clinical markers of heart ischaemia and the frequency of angina.</brief_summary>
