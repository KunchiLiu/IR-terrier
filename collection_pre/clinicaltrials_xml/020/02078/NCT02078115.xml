	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find the change of blood pressure (BP) control pattern (true controlled, white-coat, masked, and sustained uncontrolled/ dipper, non-dipper, reverse-dipper, and extreme-dipper) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) over 3 years. And Other objective is the relationship between the BP control pattern and the target organ damages such as renal function, proteinuria, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and so on. In addition, we will find clinical factors related to the BP control pattern.</brief_summary>
