	<brief_summary>Botulinum toxin type A (Botox A) has shown great success in treating certain urologic conditions. A recent study has documented that Botox injected around the ureteral orifice (or place where the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder enters the bladder), during placement of a ureteral stent (small rubber tube that facilitate drainage of urine from the kidney to the bladder), resulted in a marked decline in the amount of stent pain experienced by patients. This finding was quite remarkable as stents are commonly used in many Urologic conditions, and these stents produce a remarkable degree of patient discomfort. Despite the great improvement in pain reduction, the irritative voiding symptoms [frequent need to void, urgency, burning with urination (dysuria) or nighttime voiding (nocturia)] were not ameliorated by the Botox injections in the ureteral orifice. However, it has already been well documented that in other clinical settings, administrations of Botox into the bladder muscle, has been shown to reduce these irritative symptoms. The objective of the study is to determine if pain and irritative lower urinary tract symptoms related to ureteral stent placement will improve after the injection of Botox around the ureteral orifice and in the bladder itself.</brief_summary>
