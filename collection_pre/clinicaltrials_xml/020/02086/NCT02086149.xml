	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effect of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention for helping individuals with elevated depressive symptoms to quit smoking. The investigators expect that this project will contribute much needed knowledge about the role that aerobic exercise can play in smoking cessation. The long-term goal of this program of research is to disseminate an effective, aerobic exercise (AE) intervention for smoking cessation that can be readily adopted by smokers with elevated depressive symptoms, including those with current major depressive disorder (MDD).</brief_summary>
