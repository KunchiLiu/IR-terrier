	<brief_summary>The investigator's global hypothesis is that women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) can be separated into subtypes based on their response to metformin. The investigators propose here to use both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic approach to identify pathways associated with metformin's effect on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function. This pilot project will be the foundation for developing tailored therapeutic approaches to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and identifying novel drug targets.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeting Pathways in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Using Metformin (MET)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to use both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic approaches to identify pathways associated with metformin's effect on insulin sensitivity, weight, androgens and endothelial function. This project will be the foundation for developing tailored therapeutic approaches to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and identifying novel drug targets. This pilot project is intended to inform the development of hypothesis and specific aims for a future grant application to National Institutes of Health (NIH).</detailed_description>
