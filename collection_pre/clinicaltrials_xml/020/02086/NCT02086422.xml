	<brief_summary>Patients with CHF benefit from heart rate lowering, and the investigators have previously demonstrated that this does not adversely affect exercise tolerance. In a pacemaker population we also have shown that preventing heart rate lowering is detrimental in terms of symptoms and prognosis. The aim of the study is to therefore to establish whether heart rate limitation in patients with heart failure has a negative impact on exercise capacity. If the investigators establish that this is not the case, physicians will be able to confidently prescribe heart rate lowering agents, and programme pacemakers to allow bradycardia without the concern that there will be detrimental effects of symptom.</brief_summary>
