	<criteria>Patient must be at least 18 years of age and for the 35patient subset, patients must be over the age of 50 Patient is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives of receiving the DESolve Nx Novolimus Eluting BCSS and he/she provides written informed consent, as approved by the appropriate Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site, prior to any clinical study related procedure Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina, silent ischemia, positive functional study or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with ischemia) Patient must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery Patient must agree to undergo all clinical study required followup visits, angiograms, and as applicable, IVUS, OCT, MSCT and coronary vasomotion testing Patient must agree not to participate in any other clinical study for a period of two years following the index procedure Angiographic Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a nominal vessel diameter of between 2.75 and 3.5 mm assessed by online QCA Target lesion must measure ≤ 14 mm in length Target lesion must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated stenosis of ≥ 50% and &lt; 90% with a TIMI flow of ≥ 1 Percutaneous intervention of lesions in the target vessel if: 1. Not part of a clinical investigation 2. ≥ 6 months prior to the study index procedure 3. ≥ 9 months after the study index procedure (planned) 4. Previous intervention was distal to and &gt;10mm from the target lesion Patient has a known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours preceding the index procedure and CK and CKMB have not returned within normal limits at the time of procedure Patient is currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with AMI Patient requires the use of any rotablator intervention during the index procedure Patient has current unstable arrhythmias Patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% Patient has received a heart transplant or any other organ transplant or is on a waiting list for any organ transplant Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy within 30 days prior to or after the procedure Patient is receiving immunosuppression therapy and has known immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus etc.) Patient is receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, coumadin) that cannot be stopped and restarted according to local hospital standard procedures. Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and bivalirudin, both clopidogrel and ticlopidine, Novolimus, PLLA polymers or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated Elective surgery is planned within the first 6 months after the procedure that will require discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel Patient has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3, a WBC of &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3, or documented or suspected liver disease. Patient has known renal insufficiency (e.g., serum creatinine level of more than 2.5 mg/dL, or patient on dialysis) Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions Patient has had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic neurological attack (TIA) within the past six months Patient has had a significant GI or urinary bleed within the past six months Patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause noncompliance with the clinical study plan, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year) Patient is already participating in another clinical study Women of childbearing potential who have not undergone surgical sterilization or are not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrheic for at least one year) as well as women who are pregnant or nursing Patient is unable to give their consent, is legally incompetent, or is institutionalized by virtue of an order issued by the courts or other authority Angiographic Exclusion Criteria Target lesion(s) meets any of the following criteria: 1. Aortoostial location 2. Left main location 3. Located within 5 mm of the origin of the LAD or LCX 4. Located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft or distal to a diseased arterial or saphenous vein graft 5. Lesion involving a side branch &gt;2mm in diameter or bifurcation 6. Previous placement of a scaffold proximal to or within 10 mm of the target lesion 7. Total occlusion (TIMI flow 0), or TIMI flow &lt; 1 8. Excessive tortuosity proximal to or within the lesion 9. Angulation (≥ 45o) proximal to or within the lesion 10. Calcification moderate or heavy 11. Previous intervention restenosis The target vessel contains visible thrombus Another clinically significant lesion (&gt;40%) is located in the same major epicardial vessel as the target lesion Patient has a high probability that a procedure other than predilatation and scaffolding and (if necessary) postdilatation will be required at the time of index procedure for treatment of the target vessel (e.g. atherectomy, cutting balloon or brachytherapy)</criteria>
