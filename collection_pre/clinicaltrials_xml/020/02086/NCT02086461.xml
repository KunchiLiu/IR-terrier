	<brief_summary>Delayed emptying of the gastric tube after esophagectomy is a frequent and durable problem. No treatment is currently available. It can be hypothesized that incomplete relaxation of the pyloric sphincter may be a significant contributing factor. Pneumatic dilatation may therefore be a potentially effective treatment.</brief_summary>
