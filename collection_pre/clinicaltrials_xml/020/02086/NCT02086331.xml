	<brief_title>Evaluation of Musculoskeletal Microcirculation With Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose a model for the use of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (DCEU) to directly evaluate the microcirculation of the musculoskeletal system. We believe that this will be a valuable research tool into diseases of the microcirculation, and in the future may also offer a clinical benefit by quantifying and monitoring disease over time and after intervention. It may also allow targeting of therapies towards those patients most at risk of ulcers and peripheral neuropathy, and those that would get the maximum benefit from these therapies.</detailed_description>
