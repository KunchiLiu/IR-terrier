	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well sonidegib and lenalidomide after stem cell transplant works in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Sonidegib and lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may delay multiple myeloma from coming back after a stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sonidegib and Lenalidomide After Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the complete response (CR) rate with lenalidomide and sonidegib (LDE225) maintenance following an upfront single autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the toxicity of lenalidomide and LDE225 when used as maintenance therapy in patients post autologous SCT. II. To determine the progression-free survival rate at 1 and 2 years post autologous SCT. III. To evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status. OUTLINE: Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stringent complete response (sCR), CR, very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), minor response (MR), or stable disease (SD) (or unconfirmed [u]sCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR) continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 90 days for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>

NOTE: if the patient had treatment for the relapsed disease prior to transplant, the patient must have measurable disease at the time of relapse prior to this therapy Patients may have a history of current or previous deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism but must be willing to initiate prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 1014 days prior to and again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and LDE225 and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide and LDE225; FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing; men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy; all patients must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure; a female of childbearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) Sexually active males must be willing to use a condom (even if they have undergone a prior vasectomy) while having intercourse, while taking lenalidomide and for 4 weeks after stopping treatment Patient enrolling to this study must agree to register to the mandatory REVLIMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS [TM]) program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of (REVLIMID REMS [TM]) Patients must be willing to provide biological samples as required by the study Prior allogeneic bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant Patients with evidence of disease progression post SCT at the time of consideration for the study enrollment will not be included Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant heart disease, including any one of the following: Angina pectoris within 3 months Acute myocardial infarction within 3 months Fridericia QT (QTcF) &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for females on the screening electrocardiogram (ECG) A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history of prolonged QTinterval syndrome Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen) Seroreactivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human Tlymphotropic virus type I (HTLV I) or II, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) Other active malignancy requiring therapy; EXCEPTIONS: nonmelanotic skin cancer or carcinomainsitu of the cervix Any of the following: Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test (&gt;
