	<brief_summary>HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize that sonoelastography (SE) provide accurate quantitative measurements that can be used to stage liver fibrosis in pediatric patients with chronic liver disease. Specific Aims: To measure liver stiffness with sonoelastography in pediatric and adolescents with suspect diffuse liver disease who will undergo nonfocal liver biopsy as part of their routine clinical care.</brief_summary>
