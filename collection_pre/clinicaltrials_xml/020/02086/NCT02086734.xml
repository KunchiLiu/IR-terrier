	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is the evaluation of dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (Perfusion-CT) for therapeutic response predicition in patients with metastasized renal carcinoma (mRCC) undergoing antiangiogenetic therapy (AAT) with multikinase inhibitors. In this study patients with mRCC under AAT will be examined with 3 serial Perfusion - CT scans - partially intergrated in their regular staging CT scheme - at baseline (before AAT start), 1 week after AAT as well as 8 weeks after AAT initialization. Thereby selected intrabdomial or intrathoracic metastases will be monitored longitudinally with perfusion CT. Pretreament and post-treament perfusion characteristics of the assessed metastatic lesions will be quantified and correlated with patient outcome.</brief_summary>
