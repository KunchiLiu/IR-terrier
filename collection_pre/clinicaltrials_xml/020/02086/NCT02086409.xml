	<brief_summary>Gait and posture disorders are very common in subjects aged 65 and over, and result mainly from neuromuscular and cognitive disorders. Many studies have shown that 1) vitamin D deficiency is very common in women aged 65 and over, 2) individuals with hypovitaminosis D have lower muscle, gait and executive performances and are more prone to fail than individuals with no hypovitaminosis D, 3) the intake of vitamin D combined or not with calcium may improve muscle strength and cognitive performance. The investigators hypothesized that the daily intake of 2 yogurts containing 200 IU of vitamin D and 400 mg of calcium 1) can improve spatiotemporal gait parameters, posture and executive performance, 2) and that this improvement depends of the initial level of vitamin D deficiency.</brief_summary>
