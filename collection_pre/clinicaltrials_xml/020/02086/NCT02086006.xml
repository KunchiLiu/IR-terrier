	<brief_summary>This prospective, consecutive enrolment, single-arm study will enroll up to 15 patients with single de novo, Type A lesions &lt; 10 mm in length and located in a native coronary artery with a reference vessel diameter of 2.75 mm - 3.0 mm as measured by both offline QCA and IVUS. All patients will receive a 3.0 x 14mm DESolve Stent loaded with approximately 40 mcg of Myolimus. - Angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) will be completed for all patients at baseline and at 6 months. - Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will will be completed for all patients at baseline and at 6 months. - Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) will be conducted on all patients enrolled at 12 and 24 months.</brief_summary>
