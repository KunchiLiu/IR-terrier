	<brief_title>PERIOPERATIVE TREATMENT WITH COI-B (CAPECITABINE, OXALIPLATIN, IRINOTECAN AND BEVACIZUMAB) OF HIGH RISK OR BORDERLINE RESECTABLE COLORECTAL CANCER LIVER METASTASES</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies demonstrated a significant association between tumor regression grade of hepatic colorectal metastases (TRG1: complete pathological response; TRG2: major pathological response; TRG3: partial pathological response; versus TRG4-5 no pathological response) and outcome in terms of survival after neoadjuvant treatment. In particular, retrospective data showed an association between oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and improvement of grade and percentage of tumor regression; moreover, the addition of Bevacizumab seems to improve TRG over chemotherapy alone, conferring also a protection against liver damage due to chemotherapy-induced sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. This is the rationale that induced us to carry out an evaluation and feasibility assessment of a perioperative approach with COI-B regimen in patients affected by high risk or borderline resectable colorectal liver metastases, with or without previous resection of primary tumor.</detailed_description>

Body Mass Index &gt; 35 Brain metastases. Pregnancy and breastfeeding. Serious or uncontrolled medical pathologies or active infections that would jeopardize the possibility of receiving the investigated treatment. Disorders that could influence the absorption of capecitabine (e.g. malabsorption), intestinal occlusion, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Psychiatric disorders, neurologic disease or other conditions that would make it impossible to comply with the protocol procedures. Peripheral neuropathy not related to oxaliplatin previous administration. Previous dangerous life threatening toxicities from fluoropyrimidine. Positive anamnesis with regard to other neoplastic diseases except for the ones that have been cured for more than 5 years.</criteria>
