	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a 6 months upper arm proprioceptive pressure therapy on Assisting Hand Assessment ("AHA") performance in Cerebral Palsy (CP). To perform this study, 80 CP patients aged of 5 to 10 years old will be included in a multicentric, double blind, prospective parallel-group randomized study. Treatment will be a pressure therapy using a LYCRA® compressive sleeve initially used in burn therapy. Primary outcome is to increase of 60% of AHA performance. The secondary outcome are to increase Quality of Upper Extremity Skill Test (QUEST), quality of life and improve Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP).</brief_summary>
