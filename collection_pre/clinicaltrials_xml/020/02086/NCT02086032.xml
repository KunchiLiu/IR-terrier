	<brief_summary>Investigators have found that sleeping disorder is an important problem in menopausal women. There have been papers reporting the effect of hormonal therapy on sleeping, but fews have reported the effect of different progestogens on sleeping quality. There is a need for more in-depth study and more conclusive evidence about the progestins which have the most beneficial effects on sleeping disorders in menopausal women. This study is going to collect the data from newly identified menopausal patients who are eligible for continuous estrogen-progestogen therapy for their climacteric treatment. The affects of the therapy will be monitored for 3 months.</brief_summary>
