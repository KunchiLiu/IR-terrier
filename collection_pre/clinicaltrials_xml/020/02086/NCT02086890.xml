	<brief_summary>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a slowly progressive retinal degeneration for which there is no proven treatment. Patients are interested in trying alternative therapies to try to reduce their vision loss, but only limited research evidence exists to support their use and potential benefit. The goal of this research project is to gain a better understanding of possible changes in ocular and retinal blood flow and measures of vision in RP patients receiving two promising therapies, electroacupuncture and transcorneal electrical stimulation.</brief_summary>
