	<brief_summary>This is a non-inferiority trial of Engage, a new intervention for late-life depression, and problem solving therapy (PST). Patient participants will be randomized to either Engage or PST and receive 9 weeks of either intervention. Interview assessments will be collected at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 26, and 36. Clinician participants, social workers from mental health agencies, will be randomized to receive training and certification in either Engage or PST.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Engage to PST for Late Life Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Policy reports document that evidence-based psychotherapies are rarely employed and sustained in the community. Several causes of this science to service gap have been identified. One cause, specific to behavioral interventions, is the complexity of interventions and the competencies community clinicians must acquire and sustain over time in order to deliver them. A realistic solution is to streamline behavioral interventions and tailor them to the settings and therapist skill level available in the community. In response to this need, we have developed Engage, which: 1) is streamlined on the basis of concepts and findings on the neurobiology of depression; 2) consists of psychotherapeutic and ecosystem management components of known efficacy; 3) has distilled and simplified these components so as they can be accessible to most depressed older patients and taught to larger numbers of clinicians than available therapies, e.g., Problem Solving Therapy (PST); and 4) is personalized through a structured stepped approach focusing on "reward exposure". Problem Solving Therapy is an evidenced-based intervention shown to be effective in treating late-life depression. Three hundred (150 per site) patient participants will be randomly assigned to receive 9 sessions of either Engage or PST. Forty-two clinician participants will be randomly assigned to receive training and certification in either Engage or PST. Once certified, clinicians will be assigned a patient participant and administer their assigned intervention.</detailed_description>
