	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic imaging method with constant progress and improvement in the way the MRI images are obtained. Many of these advances involve changes to MRI software and hardware. The goal of this study is to find out the possible benefits of new MRI techniques. This will allow us to use the new MRI methods in research and patient care.</brief_summary>
