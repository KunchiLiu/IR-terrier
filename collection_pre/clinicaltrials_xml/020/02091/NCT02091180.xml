	<brief_summary>Decreased cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was reported to occur during insufflation for laparoscopic procedures due to increased Intracranial pressure (ICP) with resultant decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mannitol Improves Cerebral Oxygen Saturation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be enrolled in this double blind, randomized controlled study. Patients will receive either 0.5g/kg of 20% intravenous (i.v.) mannitol infusion over 10 minutes immediately before induction of anesthesia (group M) or an equal volume of 0.9% normal saline instead (group C). Primary outcome measure is rSO2. Secondary outcome variables include extubation time, clinical assessment of consciousness recovery using the modified Observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale (OAA/S) and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) for cognitive evaluation after recovery.</detailed_description>
