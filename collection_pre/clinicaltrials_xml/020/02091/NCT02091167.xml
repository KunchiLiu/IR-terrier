	<brief_summary>In this study, eligible crack-cocaine addicted inpatients recruited from a specialized clinic for addiction treatment, filling inclusion criteria and not showing any exclusion criteria, will be randomized to receive the repetitive (5 sessions, every other day) bilateral dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC: cathodal left / anodal right) tDCS (2 milliamperes, 3x7 cm2, for 20 min) or placebo (sham-tDCS). Craving to the use of crack-cocaine will be examined before (baseline), during and after the end of the tDCS treatment. Other clinical outcomes, and also visual P3 event-related potential and neuroimagings exams will be also performed before and after treatment. Based in our previous data, our hypothesis is that repetitive bilateral tDCS over dlPFC will favorably change clinical, cognitive and brain function in crack-cocaine addiction and these will be long-lasting effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before (baseline) and after tDCS or sham-tDCS treatment, subjects will be examined: 1. clinically, regarding craving (obsessive compulsive scale), depressive (Hamilton depression rating scale) and anxiety (Hamilton anxiety rating scale) symptoms and quality of life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF); 2. cognitively, regarding frontal (Frontal assessment battery), mental state (mini-mental status examination) and working memory (verbal and visual-spatial n-back tasks); 3. P3 cue-reactivity in visual event-related potentials (ERPs); 4. neuroimaging: structural (volumetric) and functional such as resting stating functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). They will be followed-up for clinical examination at least 6 months after treatment.</detailed_description>
