	<brief_summary>Functional Magnetic Stimulation (FMS) appears to modulate autonomic and somatic nervous systems that innervate the lower urinary tract. Stimulation of the pudendal afferent nerve near the third sacral root induces relaxation of the detrusor muscles and reinforcement of urethral sphincter. Some preliminary studies had indicated the positive effect of FMS on stress urinary incontinence. Investigators aimed to evaluate the immediate and long-term effect of this method on stress urinary incontinent patients.</brief_summary>
