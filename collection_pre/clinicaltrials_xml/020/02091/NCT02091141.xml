	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate four treatment regimens in patients with advanced cancer for whom there is no available, beneficial treatment. Patients with HER2 overexpression, amplification, or -activating mutation will be treated with Herceptin/Perjeta; those with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with Tarceva; those with BRAF-activating mutation, with Zelboraf/Cotellic; and those with Hedehog pathway potentially clinically relevant mutation, with Erivedge. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Study is expected to last up to 5 years.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt;/= 18 years Life expectancy &gt;/= 12 weeks Histologically documented metastatic cancer (solid tumors, not including hematologic malignancies) Molecular testing results from certified laboratories (using tissue from the most recent tumor biopsy in the metastatic setting) that show at least one of the following abnormalities: HER2 overexpression, amplification, or HER2activating mutation EGFRactivating mutation BRAFactivating mutation Hedgehog pathway potentially clinically relevant mutation (activating mutation of SMO or lossoffunction mutation of PTCH1) Patients who have received standard firstline therapy for metastatic cancer (except for the tumors for which no firstline therapy exists) and in whom a trial of targeted therapy is considered the best available treatment option. Eligible patients should not have available therapies that will convey clinical benefit.
