	<brief_summary>The trial will test the equivalence of a repeat bolus protocol of magnesium sulfate administered by the SpringfusorÂ® controlled pump to a continuous intravenous regimen. The goal of this pharmacokinetic study is to assess the pharmacological equivalence of the serum magnesium sulfate concentrations obtained in the treatment of severe preeclampsia with the continuous intravenous and Springfusor repeat bolus regimens. The study will also document the clinical outcomes, efficacy and acceptability of each treatment for patients and staff.</brief_summary>
