	<brief_summary>The calcineurin inhibitor drugs including cyclosporin and tacrolimus are well-known as nephrotoxicity. However, these drugs are essential for kidney transplant especially in high immunological risks. To date, however, there is an alternative regimen by using of everolimus-based which showing less toxicity than tacrolimus-based regimen by its mechanisms. Of note, this study aims to evaluate the toxicity by using microRNA profiles detection between everolimus-based and tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen in kidney transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MicroRNA Expression in Everolimus-based Versus Tacrolimus-based Regimens in Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The author aims to evaluate the effects of two regimens (everolimus-based versus tacrolimus-based) in kidney transplantation recipients. Both of regimens are prescribed only in recipents who have low immunologicla risks. After informed consent, all eligible recipients will be collected blood and urine sample for microRNA profile testing during study periods.</detailed_description>
