	<brief_summary>Emerging evidences indicate that performance on a variety of functional movement screens can identify athletes/soldiers at risk for injury. These field expedient tests have not been validated in a military setting or across different military occupational specialties. In this prospective study the investigators plan to screen 300 combatants for a 1-year time frame in order to validate the suggested algorithm of a list of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors which are hypothesized to predict injury risk during the military service.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Injury data will be collected through physician exam, self-report, profile data, and healthcare utilization data. Injury data will be collected at baseline and for six iterations, every 60 days, over the course of one year following baseline. Based on the data collected, clinical prediction rules will be used to develop computerized algorithm to predict injury risk in these populations. Moreover, these results will assist in creating individualized preventing physical training program.</detailed_description>
