	<brief_title>a Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating Plaque Removal Around Dental Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Home care and Oral hygiene regimes are as well an important aspect of short and long term dental implant survival and success. The investigators profession demands us to educate the patients about the risk of peri implantitis and peri mucositis in plaque infected dentitions. In periodontal patients the areas of most ineffective plaque removal are typically the palatal/lingual and interdental areas. there is therefore a need to developing scientific evidence to form a framework for professionals to follow when educating patients about their home care.</detailed_description>
