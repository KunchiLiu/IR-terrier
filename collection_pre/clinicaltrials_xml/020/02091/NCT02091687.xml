	<brief_title>Longitudinal Outcomes in Pediatric rTMS and CIT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This longitudinal study will evaluate the subjective and behavioral outcomes of a previous randomized controlled study (RCT) rTMS/CIT (Pediatric Hemiparesis: Synergistic Treatment using rTMS and CIT (NIH Grant Number: 1RC1HD063838-01; PI: Dr. James Carey). The previous rTMS/CIT study evaluated the safety and efficacy of 5 treatments of 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS applied to the non-stroke hemisphere combined with constraint induced therapy (CIT) to promote recovery of the paretic hand in children and adolescents. CIT has shown improved behavioral outcomes as well as cortical reorganization in representation of the affected limb. The previous RCT was a rTMS-Sham/CIT study design (real rTMS n=10 and sham rTMS n=9). Our research question, 'What is the medical status and perception of previous participants concerning their involvement in an intensive rTMS/CIT RCT specific to symptom monitoring, the TMS experience, and their current functional status'.</detailed_description>
