	<brief_title>Antiepileptic Efficacy Study of GWP42003-P in Children and Young Adults With Dravet Syndrome (GWPCARE1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GWEP1332 Part B will recruit an entirely new group of subjects to GWEP1332 Part A. Patients who failed the entry criteria for Part A may be eligible to take part in Part B. Part B is a 1:1 randomized, double blind placebo-controlled 14-week comparison of GWP42003-P versus placebo. The aim of Part B is to assess the antiepileptic efficacy of GWP42003-P as an adjunctive antiepileptic treatment compared with placebo, with respect to the percentage change from baseline during the treatment period of the study in convulsive seizure frequency in children and young adults. Following establishment of initial eligibility and baseline measurements, subjects will enter Part B and begin a 28-day baseline observation period. Eligible subjects will then be randomized to receive either GWP42003-P or placebo on a 1:1 basis, and will titrate up to the target dose that was identified in Part A (up to 20 mg/kg/day: to be confirmed following completion of Part A by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee who will review unblinded safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A). Subjects will receive investigational medicinal product for 14 weeks, consisting of a titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period. Efficacy and safety will be monitored at various clinic visits and via telephone. After 14 weeks of treatment, all subjects will be offered the option of entering an open label extension study. Entry is to be within seven days of the final treatment visit. Subjects who do not immediately enter the open label extension study will commence a down-titration taper period lasting up to 10 days. The taper period may be interrupted if the subject wishes to enter the open label extension study within the seven-day timeframe. For subjects who opt not to enter the open label extension study, a follow-up telephone call will be made 28 days after the end of dosing and weekly safety telephone calls will be made during the 28-day follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Subject must be male or female aged between 2 and 18 years (inclusive). Subject must have a documented history of Dravet syndrome which is not completely controlled by current antiepileptic drugs. Subject must be taking one or more antiepileptic drugs at a dose which has been stable for at least four weeks. All medications or interventions for epilepsy (including ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation) must have been stable for four weeks prior to screening and subject is willing to maintain a stable regimen throughout the study. Key Subject has clinically significant unstable medical conditions other than epilepsy. Subject has had clinically relevant symptoms or a clinically significant illness in the four weeks prior to screening or randomization, other than epilepsy. Subject is currently using or has in the past used recreational or medicinal cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid based medications (including SativexÂ®) within the three months prior to study entry and is unwilling to abstain for the duration for the study. Subject has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients of the investigational medicinal products. Subjects who have been part of a clinical trial involving another investigational product in the previous six months. There are plans for the subject to travel outside their country of residence during the study. Subjects previously randomized into this study. In particular, subjects who participated in Part A of the study cannot enter Part B.</criteria>
