	<brief_title>A Dose-ranging Pharmacokinetics and Safety Study of GWP42003-P in Children With Dravet Syndrome (GWPCARE1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center study will consist of two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A only will be described in this record. Part A is a randomized, double blind 21-day treatment study period. Subjects will be randomized to one of three doses of active or placebo at a 4:1 ratio. Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be assigned a unique participant number and then begin a 28-day baseline observation period. Eligible subjects will then be randomly assigned to receive one of three dose levels of GWP42003-P: 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg per day, or matching placebo. There will be three groups of 10 subjects. In each group, subjects will be randomly assigned so that eight subjects receive active treatment and two subjects receive placebo. Subjects will receive GWP42003-P or placebo for a 21-day exposure period, which consists of a titration period, followed by a stable dose period. A pharmacokinetic assessment will take place after the first single dose of GWP42003-P. There will be a second pharmacokinetic assessment after 21 days of consecutive dosing with GWP42003-P. Subjects who take clobazam as an adjunctive treatment will be asked to take their usual dose two hours prior to attending the clinic. The same recommendation will be made for other concomitant antiepileptic drugs, if applicable. This is so that the pre-treatment (with GWP42003-P) plasma concentrations of clobazam, its major metabolite N-desmethylclobazam, and any other concomitant antiepileptic drugs can be measured, and the impact of GWP42003-P treatment on these levels evaluated. Interim clinic visits to (primarily) evaluate safety and adherence to the titration regimen will take place at seven and 14 days of treatment. After 21 days of treatment, all subjects will commence a 10-day down-titration taper period. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee will review unblinded safety and pharmacokinetic data and recommend the target dose (up to 20 mg/kg/day) for Part B of the study and for an open label extension study. Once the safety review of Part A data has taken place, subjects will have the option of entering the open label extension study. A follow-up telephone call will be made 28 days after the end of dosing for subjects who do not enter the open label extension study within this time-frame. Throughout the 21-day treatment period and the 10-day taper period, there will be regular safety telephone calls (i.e., approximately every two days) to check subject status. Weekly safety telephone calls will be made during the 28-day follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Subject must be male or female aged between four and 10 years (inclusive). Subject must have a documented history of Dravet syndrome which is not completely controlled by current antiepileptic drugs. Subject must be taking one or more antiepileptic drugs at a dose which has been stable for at least four weeks. All medications or interventions for epilepsy (including ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation) must have been stable for four weeks prior to screening and subject is willing to maintain a stable regimen throughout the study. Key Subject has clinically significant unstable medical conditions other than epilepsy. Subject has had clinically relevant symptoms or a clinically significant illness in the four weeks prior to screening or randomization, other than epilepsy. Subject is currently using or has in the past used recreational or medicinal cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid based medications (including SativexÂ®) within the three months prior to study entry and is unwilling to abstain for the duration for the study. Subject has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients of the investigational medicinal products. Subjects who have been part of a clinical trial involving another investigational product in the previous six months. There are plans for the subject to travel outside their country of residence during the study. Subjects previously randomized into this study. In particular, subjects participating in Part A of the study cannot enter Part B.</criteria>
