	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the trial is to determine the effect of a study drug known as LY2409021 on blood pressure and pulse rate in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) when compared to placebo. The study has two periods. Each participant will receive LY2409021 or placebo in each period. At least 4 weeks will pass between periods. The study will last about 23 weeks for each participant. Participants may remain on stable dose metformin, as prescribed by their personal physician.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Have type 2 diabetes mellitus (according to the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria) and use diet and exercise alone or in combination with a stable dose of metformin ( &gt;/=1000 mg/day [or &lt;1000 mg, if documented intolerance to 1000 mg or higher dosages] immediaterelease metformin or extendedrelease metformin for at least 2 months before screening). Have glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values &gt;/=6.5% and &lt;/=8.5%, as determined by the central laboratory at screening. Have mean blood pressures &gt;90/60 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and &lt;140/90 mm Hg at screening. If being treated for hypertension, are taking 3 or fewer antihypertensive medications and have been taking stable doses of the same medications for at least 1 month before screening. Stable body weights (±5%) for &gt;/=3 months before screening. Body mass indexes &gt;/=20 kilograms/meters squared (kg/m²) and &lt;40 kg/m². In the investigator's opinion, are well motivated, capable, and willing to: Reliably administer the oral study drug once daily; Maintain a study diary; Perform selfmonitored blood glucose testing; and Wear an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device for at least 24 hours (on multiple occasions). Are women not of childbearing potential due to: Surgical sterilization, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy (at least 6 weeks postsurgery) or tubal ligation (confirmed by medical history); or Menopause. Women with an intact uterus are deemed menopausal if they have a cessation of menses for at least 1 year with follicle stimulating hormone &gt;40 milliinternational units per milliliter (mIU/mL), are not taking hormones or oral contraceptives within 1 year, and are otherwise healthy. Males who are sexually active and/or have partners of childbearing age must use reliable methods of birth control during the study and until 3 months after the last doses of study medication. These requirements do not apply if a participant or his partner has been surgically sterilized or is not between menarche and 1 year postmenopausal. Have severe gastrointestinal disease that may significantly affect gastric emptying or motility. Previous histories or active diagnoses of pancreatitis. Acute or chronic hepatitis, signs or symptoms of any other liver disease, or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Elevated total bilirubin (greater than 2 times ULN), clinically suspicious signs or symptoms of cirrhosis or history of cirrhosis. Mean resting pulse rate (PR) less than 60 beats per minute (bpm) or greater than 100 bpm. Current diagnosis or personal history of neuroendocrine tumors, family history of any type of multiple endocrine neoplasia, or Von HippelLindau disease.</criteria>
