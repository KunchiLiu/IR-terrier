	<brief_title>A Study of Escalating Doses of ASG-22CE Given as Monotherapy in Subjects With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer and Other Malignant Solid Tumors That Express Nectin-4</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will receive a single 30 minute IV infusion of ASG-22CE once weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks (i.e., on Days 1, 8, and 15). A cycle is 4 weeks. This is a 3 part study. Part A will evaluate ASG-22CE in subjects with histologically confirmed malignant solid tumors (excluding sarcomas) that are resistant or have recurred. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of ASG-22CE, investigator decision or consent withdrawal. Part A will follow a modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM). Part B, will evaluate ASG-22CE in 3 different expansion cohorts: 1) Urothelial cancer subjects who have not received any prior lines of therapy and who are unfit for Cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Cisineligible) defined as a Creatinine Clearance ≥ 15 ml/min and &lt; 60 ml/min, 2) subjects with Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and 3) subjects with Metastatic Ovarian Cancer. Enrollment into Part B will occur after the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been assessed in Part A, and the preliminary recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been established. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of ASG-22CE or consent withdrawal. Part C will evaluate ASG-22CE at the preliminary RP2D (determined from Part A) in subjects who have been previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in the metastatic setting. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of ASG-22CE, investigator decision or consent withdrawal. All subjects will be followed post-treatment every 2 months via disease assessment or telephone contact to obtain information on disease progression and death. For Part A (Dose Escalation) and Part B (Cis-ineligible), a data review team (DRT) will review cumulative unaudited data on an interim basis to explore additional doses and/or schedules, or the expansion of existing cohorts. Doses intermediate to those predefined in the protocol may be explored with DRT endorsement.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Dose Escalation, Cisineligible and CPITreated Expansion cohorts: Subjects must have histologically confirmed Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Urothelium (TCCU) (i.e., cancer of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra). Subjects with Urothelial Carcinoma with squamous differentiation or mixed cell types are eligible. Ovarian Expansion Cohort: Subjects with recurrent disease or histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage III/IV diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have previously progressed while receiving or within 6 months of completing a platinumcontaining regimen. NSCLC Expansion Cohort: Subjects must have histologic or cytologic diagnosis of NSCLC (squamous or nonsquamous or NSCLCnot specified) For Dose Escalation, Cisineligible and CPITreated Expansion Cohorts, subjects must submit a tumor tissue for Nectin4 expression; however, the results are not required for enrollment. For the NSCLC and Ovarian Expansion Cohorts: Subjects must have tumor tissue positive (IHC Hscore ≥150) for Nectin4 expression For Dose Escalation, NSCLC and Ovarian Expansion Cohorts: Subject must have failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease (urothelial and bladder cancer subjects are not required to have failed prior chemotherapy regimen if considered unfit for cisplatinbased chemotherapy) For the Cisineligible Expansion Cohort: Subject must not have received any prior lines of chemotherapy (prior treatment with immunotherapy is allowed). For the CPITreated Expansion Cohort: Subject must have received prior treatment with a CPI in the metastatic setting. Subjects must have measurable disease according to RECIST (version 1.1) For Dose Escalation, NSCLC, Ovarian, and CPI Treated Expansion Cohorts: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 For the Cisineligible expansion Cohort: Subject must have an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months Negative pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential) Hematologic function, as follows (no red blood cell or platelet transfusions are allowed within 14 days of the first dose of ASG22CE): Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Renal function, as follows: Dose Escalation, NSCLC, Ovarian, and CPI Treated Expansion Cohorts: serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL, or measured 24 hour creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 mL/min. For Cisineligible Expansion Cohort: creatinine clearance estimate ≥15 ml/min and &lt;60 ml/min by CockcroftGault equation adjusted for body weight Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) Serum albumin ≥2.5 g/dL Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 1.5 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN International normal ratio (INR) &lt; 1.3 or ≤ institutional ULN (or ≤ 3.0 if on therapeutic anticoagulation) Sexually active fertile subjects, and their partners, must agree to use medically accepted doublebarrier methods of contraception (e.g., barrier methods, including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the study and at least 6 weeks after termination of study therapy Competent to comprehend, sign, and date an independent ethics committee/institutional review board/research ethics board (IEC/IRB/REB) approved informed consent form Preexisting sensory neuropathy Grade ≥ 2 Preexisting motor neuropathy Grade ≥ 2 Uncontrolled central nervous system metastases Use of any investigational drug within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug Any anticancer therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug, including: small molecules, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, radiotherapy or any other agents to treat cancer (antihormonal therapy given as adjuvant therapy for earlystage estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer is not considered cancer therapy for the purpose of this protocol) Subjects with immunotherapy related adverse events requiring high doses of steroids (≥ 40 mg/day of prednisone) are not eligible.
