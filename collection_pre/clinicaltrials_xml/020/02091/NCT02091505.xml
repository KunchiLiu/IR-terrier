	<brief_summary>Recent studies have shown that intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agent, Lucentis (Ranibizumab) is effective for macular edema associated with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). However, there is little information on whether there are any predictive factors of treatment outcome after this treatment. We plan to perform comprehensive functional and imaging tests to determine significant predictive factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictive Factors of Ranibizumab Treatment in Macular Edema With CRVO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present study is to investigate predictive factors of treatment outcome after intravitreal injection of Lucentis (Ranibizumab) in eyes with macular edema associated with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) using various comprehensive clinical tests including visual filed, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), ultra wide-field fluorescein angiography, new flicker electroretinogram (ERG) using skin electrodes. Corrected visual acuity, visual filed, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), ultra wide-field fluorescein angiography, and new flicker electroretinogram (ERG) using skin electrodes are performed before and 3, 6, 9, 12 months after the treatment. Predictive factors of treatment outcome are statistically analyzed.</detailed_description>
