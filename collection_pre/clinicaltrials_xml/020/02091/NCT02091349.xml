	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the tolerance and utilization of polydextrose and soluble corn fiber through analyses of fecal samples of fermentative end-products (short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, phenol, and indole) and shifts in microbial populations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tolerance and Utilization of Polydextrose, Inulin, and Soluble Corn Fiber</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soluble fibers have been shown to have many positive effects in humans, including laxation and maintaining gastrointestinal health. It is expected that feeding soluble fibers will decrease protein fermentative end=products while increasing carbohydrate fermenative end-products, and lead to a more beneficial microbial profile. Determination of the effects of nutriose and polydextrose when included as supplemental fiber in a human diet will give insights to its potential to maintain or improve gut health and highlight its use in the food industry. The object of this study are first to determine the tolerance of soluble fibers polydextrose, inulin and nutriose when provided as supplemental fiber to an existing diet. The second objective is to determine the utilization of polydextrose and nutriose through analyses of fecal samples of fermentative end-products and shifts in microbial populations.</detailed_description>
