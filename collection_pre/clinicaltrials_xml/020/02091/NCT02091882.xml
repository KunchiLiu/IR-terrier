	<brief_title>Substudy of the Accuracy of Ingestible Event Marker (IEM) Detection by the Medical Information Device #1 (MIND1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OSMITTER study protocol is designed as a master protocol governing multiple substudies for the rapid assessment of candidate subcomponents for the MIND1 System. This substudy is being conducted to determine the accuracy of IEM detection by the MIND1 System by completing a series of Patch applications and IEM ingestions in the clinic. Following placement of the Patch by clinic staff, subjects will ingest one tablet approximately every 2 hours, for a total of 4 ingestions. Aripiprazole-embedded IEM tablets are being tested along with the placebo-embedded IEM tablets to assess any difference in accuracy of IEM detection and latency. Approximately 32 healthy volunteer subjects will be enrolled in the substudy. The duration of this substudy for each subject is estimated to be 1 day of active participation plus a 2-week safety follow up (phone call) period.</detailed_description>
