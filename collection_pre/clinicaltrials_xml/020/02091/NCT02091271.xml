	<brief_summary>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) has a number ofiRB approved research studies involving human subjects, both normal volunteers and patients. As a means of identifying interested volunteers and other participants in the research process, this screening mechanism is established to identif'y potential eligible participants for NlA protocols. To participate, volunteers/patients must meet the specific requirements of at least one of the available NlA research studies; this protocol serves as a first step for admitting volunteers/patients to an appropriate approved protocol and creating a contact database for approved NlA studies. This protocol will facilitate their recruitment into NIA approved studies and provide NlA staff the opportunity to examine subjects where diagnostic observations can be documented and evaluated for research potential.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Protocol to Evaluate Volunteers for NIA Approved Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The screening protocol is designed to evaluate volunteers/patients for participation in IRB approved clinical studies of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). An additional purpose of this protocol is to develop a registry of individuals who have been evaluated through the NIA Clinical Research Unit screening clinic. To participate, volunteers/patients must meet the specific requirements of at least one of the available NIA research studies. This protocol serves as a first step for admitting volunteers/patients to an appropriate approved protocol, and it is used to develop a registry of individuals who meet eligibility criteria for existing research projects.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. All volunteers/patients who meet the criteria of an approved NIA protocol. 2. People with diagnosed or undiagnosed conditions 3. Patients may be eligible if they have rare, unusual, interesting or unknown conditions that require diagnosis EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1.
