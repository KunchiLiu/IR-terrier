	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of consumption of a novel food supplement consisting of Canola Oil, Fibre and DHA, containing the most effective food bioactives, including n-3 fatty acid enriched dietary oil high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and soluble dietary fibre, aiming at the management of heart disease risk factors in people with metabolic syndrome and to test its efficacy and safety in humans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Canola Oil, Fibre and DHA Enhanced Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial, it will be conducted at the Richardson Centre for Functional Food and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN), University of Manitoba. The study design will consist of 4 phases with 30 days per phase, each phase will be separated by 4-week washout periods. Participants will consume a recommended weight-maintaining diet (35% energy from fat, 50% carbohydrate, 15% protein) supplemented with the following novel Muffin and cookies: (a) control food containing butter, sunflower and safflower oil comprised largely of saturated fat with substantial levels of n-6 linoleic acid, and refined wheat flour common to current North American intakes, (b) food containing high oleic canola oil and docosahexaenoic acid (HOCO-DHA) and refined wheat flour, (c) food containing high molecular weight barley B-glucan and a combination of sunflower, safflower oil and butter, (d) food containing combination of HOCO-DHA and high molecular weight barley β-glucan. Treatments will be isocalorically incorporated into muffin and cookies consumed in equal parts at breakfast and supper.</detailed_description>
