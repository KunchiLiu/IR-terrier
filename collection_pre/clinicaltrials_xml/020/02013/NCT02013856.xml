	<brief_summary>Fruit and vegetable rich diets are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The protective effect may be ascribed to compounds contained within these foods, called flavonoids. Flavanols (epicatechin and procyanidins) are a particular group of flavonoids and are found mostly in apples, berry fruits, dark chocolate, tea and red wine. There is evidence to suggest that ingestion of flavanol rich foods and beverages beneficially alter 'markers' of CVD risk (e.g. blood pressure). The aim of this study is to determine the acute and chronic effects of apple derived flavanols on some risk markers for CVD.</brief_summary>

Depressed or elevated blood pressure measurements (&lt;90/50 or 95/55 if symptomatic or &gt;160/100 (mmHg)) during the course of the trial.</criteria>
