	<brief_summary>Infants showing high local pulmonary inflammation diagnosted by respiratory distress syndrome usually need the second or more pulmonary surfactant and is easier to developing to Brochopulmonary. Cursurf is used worldwide in infants with respiratory distress syndrome, Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with a high local anti-inflammatory effect.Our hypothesis is Cursurf combined with Budesonide could reduced the need of Cursurf and incidence of Brochopulmonary dysplasia.</brief_summary>
