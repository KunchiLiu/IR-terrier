	<brief_summary>The Family Hypercholesterolemia remains poorly diagnosed disease with an outlet sometimes suboptimal care. However, the Family Hypercholesterolemia exposes patients concerned at increased cardiovascular risk. The frequency of familial hypercholesterolemia in cardiologic is little studied and remains unknown, and there is little data on the profile of patients, diagnostic methods and management. Main objectives: - Establish a monitoring patients with hypercholesterolemia Family cardiology in France - Characterize the Family hypercholesterolemia in cardiology, including assessing the frequency of the most severe forms, which are at higher cardiovascular risk.</brief_summary>
