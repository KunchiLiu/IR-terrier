	<brief_title>Randomized Phase III Study of Intensive Chemotherapy With or Without Dasatinib (Sprycel™)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized phase III open-label, multicenter trial evaluating standard induction therapy (daunorubicin [DNR] and cytarabine [Ara-C]) and consolidation therapy (high-dose cytarabine [HDAC]) with or without dasatinib in adult patients with newly diagnosed CBF-AML; in the investigational arm, consolidation therapy is followed by a one-year maintenance therapy with dasatinib. Patients with molecular disease persistence or molecular relapse as assessed by quantitative RQ-PCR for the CBF fusion transcripts will be eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before overt hematologic relapse occurs. Primary endpoint is event-free survival. AML patients will be assessed for the CBF fusion genes in one of two AMLSG central laboratories within 48 hours of diagnosis, and only patients with CBF-AML will be enrolled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Corebinding factor (CBF) AML with molecular diagnosis of RUNX1RUNX1T1 fusion transcript resulting from t(8;21)(q22;q22) (or a variant form) or of CBFBMYH11 fusion transcript resulting from inv(16)(p13.1q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) as assessed in one of the central AMLSG reference laboratories (Ulm, Hannover) Age ≥ 18; there is no upper age limit No prior chemotherapy for leukemia except hydroxyurea for up to 5 days during the diagnostic screening phase Nonpregnant and nonnursing. Due to the unknown teratogenic potential of dasatinib in humans, pregnant or nursing patients may not be enrolled. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 72 hours prior to registration. Women of childbearing potential must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control one highly effective method (e.g., IUD, hormonal, tubal ligation, or partner's vasectomy), and one additional effective method (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap) AT THE SAME TIME, at least four weeks before she begins dasatinib therapy. "Women of childbearing potential" is defined as a sexually active mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months. Men must agree not to father a child and must use a latex condom during any sexual contact with women of childbearing potential while taking dasatinib and for 3 months after therapy is stopped, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Signed written informed consent. Performance status WHO &gt;2 Pulmonary edema and/or pleural/pericardial effusion within 14 days of day 1. If edema/effusion resolves to CTC Grade ≤1, patients can be treated with dasatinib. Patients with ejection fraction &lt;50% by echocardiography within 14 days of day 1 Organ insufficiency (creatinine &gt;1.5x upper normal serum level; bilirubin, AST or AP &gt;2.5x upper normal serum level; heart failure NYHA III/IV; severe obstructive or restrictive ventilation disorder) Uncontrolled infection Patients with a "currently active" second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers. Patients are not considered to have a "currently active" malignancy, if they have completed therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse within one year. Severe neurological or psychiatric disorder interfering with ability of giving an informed consent Known positive for HIV, active HBV, HCV, or Hepatitis A infection Bleeding disorder independent of leukemia No consent for registration, storage and processing of the individual disease characteristics and course as well as information of the family physician and/or other physicians involved in the treatment of the patient about study participation. No consent for biobanking.</criteria>
