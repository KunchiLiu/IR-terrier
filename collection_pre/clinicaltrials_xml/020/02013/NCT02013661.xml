	<detailed_description>Forty patients participated in this prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Vertical mattress sutures were used following resective periodontal surgery performed by one operator. Four suture materials were selected for evaluation: 5-0 silk; 5-0 polypropylene; 5-0 polyglycolic acid (PGA), and 4-0 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Seven days after the surgical procedure, the surgeon assessed suture loosening and removed the sutures. A blind researcher clinically evaluated erythema and edema.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Qualification for the study was based on the need for resective periodontal surgery (apically positioned flap and osseous recontouring) at four or more consecutive interproximal sites per quadrant systemic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or an immunologic disease that would affect wound healing; allergies to prescribed medication; and/or current pregnancy or breast feeding were excluded from the study</criteria>
