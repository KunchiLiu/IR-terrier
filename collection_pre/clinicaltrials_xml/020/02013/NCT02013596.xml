	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of TEAS pretreatment and treatment on hepatic and renal dysfunction induced by pneumoperitoneum in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation(TEAS) for Hepatic and Renal Dysfunction After Pneumoperitoneum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were randomly assigned to three groups, control group and two intervention groups, receiving TEAS before and after general anesthesia induction respectively. TEAS was given through electrodes attached to acupoints. The time for TEAS was 30min. Venous blood samples were collected before and 20min after pneumoperitoneum. Hepatic and renal function index including AST, ALT, ALP, BUN, Cr were measured.</detailed_description>
