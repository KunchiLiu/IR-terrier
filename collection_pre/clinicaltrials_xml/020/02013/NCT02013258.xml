	<brief_summary>Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have been found to have a deficit of oxytocin-producing neurons and decreased oxytocin receptor gene function, so the purpose of this study is to determine if oxytocin (OT) administration will improve some of the aspects of Prader-Willi syndrome that are particularly troublesome for children and their families (the insatiable appetite and social behaviors). The research questions are: 1. Does intranasal oxytocin cause any side effects in children with PWS? 2. Does intranasal oxytocin administration alter appetite or behaviors in PWS?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxytocin Trial in Prader-Willi Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to investigate if intranasal oxytocin will improve hyperphagia, social skills, and behaviors in subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome. This will be a randomized placebo controlled pilot study. The primary outcome measure is to determine if intranasal administration of oxytocin will cause any adverse events in subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome. Secondarily, the investigators will also perform evaluations to determine if intranasal oxytocin has any effect on social skills, behaviors, or appetite in children with Prader-Willi syndrome.</detailed_description>
