	<brief_summary>Many studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of Adapted Physical Activity (APA) in different cancer types. It therefore seems necessary to assess spontaneous Physical Activity in order to integrate it to the overall calculation of physical activity in clinical practice. To assess the AP, two types of methods are validated : the subjective method using a questionnaries and objective method using a pedometer , accelerometer or measures calorimetry . Subjective method shows , good acceptability by patients and low cost but can sometimes lead to poor estimation of the level of activity. Objective methods obviously increase the accuracy of assessments but are more difficult to use for epidemiological studies , less accepted by the patient and more expensive. In this study the investigators will measure the spontaneous Daily Physical Activity by both methods andd evaluate the correclation.</brief_summary>
