	<brief_summary>The purpose of the current work is to determine the efficacy of the re-application of surgical prep solution in decreasing surgical site bacterial contamination following lower extremity surgery. Decreasing the extent of bacterial colonization of the skin surrounding the surgical site during the initial healing phases would theoretically decrease the rate of infection in high-risk persons.</brief_summary>
