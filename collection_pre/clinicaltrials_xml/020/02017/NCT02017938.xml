	<brief_summary>Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Past researches indicated that more than half of the individuals with PD demonstrated fatigue symptom. The severity of fatigue was also correlated to the quality of life in individuals with PD. Finding the contributions of the central and the peripheral factors to fatigue, building reliable fatigue indexes, and developing an effective training program for individuals with PD are very important. The purpose of this project is to develop non-invasive method to monitor central and peripheral fatigue, to establish Virtual Reality(VR) anti-fatigue ergo cycling training paradigm, and to evaluate the long term training effect in individuals with PD.</brief_summary>
