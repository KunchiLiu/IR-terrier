	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of a Dual PI3K Delta/Gamma Inhibitor in Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined based on the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy data. Safety analyses include AE's, AE's related to the drug, SAE's, laboratory values, vitals/ ECG and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). PK include measurement of peak plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration versus the time curve (AUC), time of maximum concentration observed (Tmax). Efficacy analyses include overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR).</detailed_description>
