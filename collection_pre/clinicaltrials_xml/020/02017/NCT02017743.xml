	<brief_summary>This study is a multicenter post authorization observational study. Cancer patients diagnosed with non high risk VTE and are followed up in an outpatient setting will be treated with LMWH and the data will be recorded. Since this is an observational study there are no specific treatment protocols, i.e., patients will be treated according to the best investigator's criteria. Treatment protocol will be based on the routine treatment practice of the involved investigator. Patients to enroll will be cancer patients diagnosed for VTE and who are able to receive outpatient LMWH treatment. There will be no specific hypothesis to be tested.</brief_summary>
