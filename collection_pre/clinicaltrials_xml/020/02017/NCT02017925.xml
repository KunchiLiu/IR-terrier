	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies pulmonary rehabilitation in improving lung function in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer undergoing chemoradiation. Individualized exercise rehabilitation programs may reduce breathing problems and improve quality of life in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. It is not yet known whether pulmonary rehabilitation is more effective when started during or after cancer treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Improving Lung Function in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine feasibility of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in patients with locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing definite chemotherapy and radiation therapy. II. To measure exercise capacity and respiratory symptoms in lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation before and after pulmonary rehabilitation. III. To compare if there are any differences in symptom relief, exercise capacity, and cancer treatment tolerability between performing pulmonary rehabilitation during chemo-radiation versus after completion of lung cancer treatment. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Beginning within 2 weeks of starting chemoradiation, patients undergo an individualized rehabilitation program comprising aerobic exercise and strength training, including treadmill walking, stationary bicycle, NU-Step, upper body resistance training and breathing retraining, 3 times per week for 8 weeks (36 sessions). ARM II: Beginning 1 month after completion of chemoradiation, patients undergo an individualized exercise rehabilitation program as in Arm I.</detailed_description>
