	<brief_summary>Varicose veins of the leg often have superficial tributaries, which are often symptomatic and a major reason for coming to the doctor. When treating the main varicose vein inside the leg, some doctors prefer to remove these tributaries while others prefer to leave them. This trial aims to see if it is better to remove these veins at the time of the first laser procedure or better to leave them and only remove them when asked.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concomitant or Sequential Phlebectomy After Endovenous Laser Therapy for Varicose Veins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) for varicose veins is associated with high initial occlusion rates, minimal complications and low recurrence rates at 5 years. Randomized trials and meta-analyses have confirmed the efficacy of EVLT in comparison with surgery and other endovenous techniques. There is also evidence that it may be associated with early quality of life (QoL) benefits compared with surgery. The general efficacy of EVLT has therefore been demonstrated and current research focuses on refinement of the procedure. A fundamental question concerns the management of residual varicosities following truncal laser ablation. One approach is to leave these varicosities to regress untouched, minimizing the procedure time and surgical trauma6. This approach, however, is associated with a significant number of secondary and tertiary interventions (sclerotherapy and/or ambulatory phlebectomy). Another option is to combine in a single procedure ambulatory phlebectomy with initial truncal laser ablation (EVLTAP). The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the advantages of performing ambulatory phlebectomy as a concomitant procedure to truncal laser ablation.</detailed_description>
