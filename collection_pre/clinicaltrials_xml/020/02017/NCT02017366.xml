	<brief_summary>It is well known that there is a considerable postoperative weight loss in patients undergoing esophageal resection for cancer. We believe that this weigh loss can be limited by administering postoperative enteral feeding (target: 1000 kCal/ day) via feeding jejunostomy for at least 6 weeks postoperatively. We hypothesize that patients undergoing esophageal resection for cancer will have a better overall survival with postoperative additional enteral feeding than when on regular oral diet alone.</brief_summary>
