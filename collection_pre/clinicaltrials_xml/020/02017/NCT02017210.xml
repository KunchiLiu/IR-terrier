	<brief_summary>People who are overweight and/or obese usually are insulin resistant and so are at risk of type 2 diabetes. However, research has shown that some overweight and/or obese people remain insulin sensitive and healthy despite their weight. The investigators hypothesise that insulin-sensitive overweight and/or obese people maintain their insulin sensitivity and metabolic health over time. The investigators also hypothesise that the preservation of insulin sensitivity will be determined by key metabolic factors.</brief_summary>
