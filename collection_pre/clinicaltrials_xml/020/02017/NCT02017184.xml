	<brief_summary>Soldiers are required to perform and maintain alertness in difficult environmental conditions. The sensor examined in this trail may indicate body core temperature elevation during exertion. 12 male volunteers will arrive to our lab and perform a protocol of sitting and walking in thermoneutral and hot environments with two core temperature sensors. The results obtained from them will be compared.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During the protocol the volunteers will sit in thermoneutral condition for 30 minutes, than they will sit in hot chamber (40 celsius and 40% relative humidity). Afterwards, the participants will walk on a treadmill in 5 km/hr and 4% incline for one hour. The participants will be connected to rectal thermistor which is considered the "gold standard" and to the new noninvasive sensor which is attached to the skin surface.</detailed_description>
