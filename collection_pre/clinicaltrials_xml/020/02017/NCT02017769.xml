	<brief_title>MRI in Diagnosing and Monitoring CIDP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammatory neuropathies such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) can be successfully treated with immunoglobulin either intravenously (IVIG) or subcutaneously (SCIG). CIDP is diagnosed by electrophysiology which is time-consuming and unpleasant for the patient. New techniques suggest that Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging can be used to detect injuries in the peripheral nerves We want to study if MRI and ultrasound is able to detect damages in peripheral nerves, nerve roots and plexus in patients with CIDP. Moreover, we want to compare these findings to healthy matched controls and to see if treatment with immunoglobulin changes findings in MRI</detailed_description>
