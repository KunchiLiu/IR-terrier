	<brief_title>Comparison of BuMA eG Based BioDegradable Polymer Stent With EXCEL Biodegradable Polymer Sirolimus-eluting Stent in "Real-World" Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The BuMA stent (SINOMED, Beijing, China) was a novel biodegradable PLGA polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (SES), with design of adding an electro-grafting (eG) base layer between the polymer and the stainless steel stent strut.The eG layer can secure adhesion of the biodegradable PLGA coating as a result of the interdigitation, and the PLGA coating ensures 100% drug release within 30 days.The initial investigation showed a high strut coverage rate in both the BuMA stent and the Xience V stent at 3 months follow-up. Moreover, earlier vascular healing after drug-eluting stent implantation may reduce the incidence of stent thrombosis at follow-up and potentially shorten dual antiplatelet therapy duration. Therefore, we performed this randomized trial to investigate 12 months target lesion failure between the BuMA and the EXCEL stent, both with same eluted drug sirolimus, however different biodegradable polymer carriers.</detailed_description>

Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer, known malignancy, congestive heart failure, organ transplant recipient or candidate) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause noncompliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than 1 year); Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, stainless steel alloy, cobalt chromium, rapamycin , styrenebutylenesstyrene or polylactic acid (PLA) polymer, and/or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated; Any significant medical condition which in the Investigator's opinion may interfere with the patient's optimal participation in the study; Currently participating in another investigational drug or device study or patient in inclusion in another investigational drug or device study during followup.</criteria>
