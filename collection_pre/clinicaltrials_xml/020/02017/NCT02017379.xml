	<brief_summary>This is a study comparing the effect of erythromycin or metoclopramide, 2 prokinetic drugs (Drugs which are known to speed up the emptying of the stomach or in other words to move the blood out of the stomach faster) given before endoscopy to patients with upper Gastrointestinal bleeding compared to patients who will not receive either of these medications before their endoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Control Trial Comparing Prokinetics and Their Influence on Endoscopy Outcomes for Upper GI Bleed.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the efficacy of pre-endoscopic interventions namely erythromycin, metoclopromide vs control in improving the outcomes of endoscopy in ICU patients admitted upper GI bleeding. Specific aims: 1. Wither erythromycin, metoclopromide vs control can enable visualization of the entire gastric mucosa . 2. Wither erythromycin, metoclopromide vs control can improve the quality of stomach and duodenum visualization: using the scoring system by Fossard et al</detailed_description>
