	<brief_summary>Assessing the safety and effectiveness of a 11-βhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitor (AZD4017), in a placebo controlled trial, in acute idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) IIH is a condition of young, overweight women with characteristic raised intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) leading to papilloedema (swelling of the nerve supplying the eye), visual loss and headaches. Medical literature (Cochrane review) demonstrates there is little evidence for the treatments used for IIH. Weight control appears the most effective method of improving symptoms but weight loss is difficult to maintain. 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) is an enzyme which regulates local steroid levels and our previous research suggests it may influence the production of brain fluid(cerebrospinal fluid or CSF). 11β-HSD1 levels fall with weight loss and this is associated with with decreased intracranial pressure. Our primary outcome is to determine whether AZD4017, an inhibitor of 11β-HSD1, will reduce the pressure in the brain and as a consequence improve IIH. Patients are eligible to enter the study if they are between 18-55 years old with acute (&lt;6 months) IIH, signs of active disease (papilloedema and raised CSF pressure (&gt;25 cmH20)), no other major illnesses and have no plans for pregnancy during the study period. This is an MRC funded single centre, phase II, double-blinded, randomised control drug trial. It will be conducted at the University Hospital Birmingham and the University of Birmingham will act as Sponsor. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to AZD4017 or a placebo ('dummy' with no active drug) for 3 months with a follow up a month later. Investigations during the study will include bloods, urine samples, pregnancy tests, lumbar punctures, DXA scans and small fat/skin biopsies. Participants will benefit from increased monitoring and a potential improvement in their condition. We hypothesise that specific inhibition of 11β-HSD1 will decrease intracranial pressure and consequently treat patients with IIH, thus opening a new and entirely novel therapeutic avenue.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. Female patients between 18 and 55 years Diagnosis of IIH by the Modified Dandy criteria1 with: 1. acute (&lt;6 months), 2. active disease (papilloedema (Frisen grade greater than or equal to 1), 3. significantly raised ICP &gt; 25cmH2O) 4. normal brain imaging during previous routine diagnostic work up (evaluated by either magnetic resonance venography or computerised tomography with venography). Patients must be willing to use one form of highly effective nonhormonal contraception. This would include: 1. a vasectomised partner (sole partner) or tubal occlusion or 2. copper containing IUD all of which should be used in addition to a diaphragm or cervical/vault caps with barrier contraceptive (condom or spermicidal foam/gel/film/suppository) 3. true abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Women should have been stable on their chosen method of birth control for a minimum of 2 months before entering the trial. Patients must agree to undergo a βhCG pregnancy test and urine dipstick test at screening and urine dipstick testing at all trial visits (including the final follow up visit 4 weeks after discontinuation of study treatment). Note: the use of contraception and pregnancy testing would not be required if the screening LH/FSH levels demonstrate the patient is postmenopausal. Participants are able to continue other medications to treat their IIH e.g. acetazolamide, diuretics but this dose must remain fixed throughout the study. Patients who take aspirin therapy will be asked to discontinue aspirin 3 days prior to fat and skin biopsy if clinically safe to do so. Placebo treatment for the duration of the study must not be considered detrimental to the patient. Must be able to understand the consent form and comply with study requirements. Optic nerve sheath fenestration. Patients who undergo CSF shunt insertion (which is not elective or pre planned) during the study, as a result of deterioration will be withdrawn from the study. Abnormal neurological examination (aside from papilloedema and consequent visual loss or VI nerve palsy). Subjects with a secondary cause of raised intracranial pressure will be excluded (venous thrombosis, anaemia, drug causes (lithium, vitamin A, tetracycline or others deems responsible for the condition). Abnormal CSF contents (except for that compatible with a traumatic LP). Unable to perform a visual field reliably. General Positive hCG or urine dipstick pregnancy test or planning to conceive in the 4 study months. Have eGFR calculated by MDRD equation of &lt;60ml/min/1.73m2. Have any endocrine disorder, e.g. thyroid dysfunction. This excludes PCOS where there is a known association to IIH. Suspicion of or known Gilbert's disease. CK &gt;2 x ULN on 2 consecutive measurements. ALT and/or AST &gt;2 x ULN. ALP &gt; ULN. Bilirubin (total) &gt; 2 x ULN. Must not have donated blood within 2 months of screening and avoid further donations for 4 months following the study. Patient is, at the time of signing the informed consent, a user of recreational or illicit drugs (including marijuana) or has had a recent history (within the last year) of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence. Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, unless willing to discontinue breastfeeding by the baseline visit. Have uncontrolled systemic hypertension (BP &gt;160/90), on 3 successive measurements on the morning of the screening visit. Are receiving systemic (including vaginal/rectal) glucocorticoid treatment at the time of the screening visit. Note: Topical and inhaled are acceptable Are taking any hormonebased medication, including hormone contraceptives, at the time of screening. Are taking probenecid at the time of the screening visit. Have any screening laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's judgement, is considered to be clinically significant or any screening laboratory value which is outside the Sponsor specified ranges at screening; testing may be repeated but must be resolved prior to the baseline visit. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation or will influence the results . History or presence of significant gastrointestinal, hepatic , or renal disease or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of IP as judged by the investigator. Have been involved in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site). Have participated in any other interventional study within 1 month prior to the screening visit. Participation in the IIH National database or other observational studies will not prevent enrolment to this study. Previous randomisation for treatment in the present study</criteria>
