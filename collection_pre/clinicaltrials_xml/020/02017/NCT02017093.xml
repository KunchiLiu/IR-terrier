	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the impact of enhancement of the velocity component error in the course of reaching movements of the impaired/hemiparetic limb in an acute stroke subject. We hypothesized that the method would shift velocity profiles toward the optimal, resulting in a reduction in error. A prototype robot. This robotic device system has a two-dimensional motor, basic measurement capacities, and a robotic arm which is engaged to the subject's upper-limb in a sitting position. The enhancement of the velocity component error would shift velocity profiles toward the optimal, resulting in a reduction in error.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The wrist of the subject is connected to the robotic arm by a strip which supports the arm but allows free movements of the wrist. This configuration allows subjects with impaired grasping ability to use the system. A bio-feedback system enables the subject to perform various functional motor tasks that are presented on the screen in front of him. The system's sensors detect motor errors or deviations from an optimal/proper movement trajectory or velocity profile. Any deviation in direction, velocity, acceleration or necessary force from the optimal trajectory results in applied robotic forces that enhance such errors/deviations. The sensors and the applied forces all work and compute in real time, so that the force measurements and the applied force are updated to the executed movement.</detailed_description>
