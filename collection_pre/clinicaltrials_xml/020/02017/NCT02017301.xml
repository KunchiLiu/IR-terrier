	<brief_summary>Patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis, or acute on chronic liver failure often present with malnutrition, and due to the in-hospital stay, their nutritional intake can vary widely, with several periods of fasting, and sometimes insufficient nutritional support. Therefore patients are prone to develop malnutrition or, the already present malnutrition worsens its status. Our aim is to evaluate the daily changes in nutritional status in patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis and evaluate the changes in plasma and serum biomarkers.</brief_summary>
