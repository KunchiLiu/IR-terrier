	<brief_summary>Diabetes is associated with an increased risk for developing premature macrovascular complications. The process of irreversible subclinical damage to the vasculature already starts during its preceding stages. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors have been shown to attenuate vascular damage in preclinical studies. Off-target effects on adipose tissue inflammation, liver steatosis and atherosclerotic plaques have been extensively documented in animal studies. Based on these considerations the investigators hypothesize that early therapy with the DPP4 inhibitor linagliptin in subjects with treatment naive type 2 diabetes will lead to beneficial effects on arterial stiffness as measured by pulse wave velocity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risk for developing premature macrovascular complications. The process of irreversible subclinical damage to the vasculature already starts during its preceding stages. At diagnosis, patients with T2DM already have evidence of subclinical vascular damage. Recent trials have shown no benefit of glucose lowering therapy when started later in the course of the disease, implicating that early interventions could be more effective in preventing macrovascular complications. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors are oral antidiabetic drugs that increase the action of the naturally gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), leading to improvement of postprandial insulin secretion, without hypoglycaemia or weight gain. DPP4 inhibitors improve beta-cell function and insulin resistance. More importantly, off-target effects on adipose tissue inflammation, liver steatosis and atherosclerotic plaques have been extensively documented in animal studies. Furthermore, DDP4 inhibitors improve the cardiovascular risk profile in small clinical studies. Based on these considerations the investigators hypothesize that early therapy with the DPP4 inhibitor linagliptin in subjects with type 2 diabetes will lead to beneficial effects on arterial stiffness, blood pressure and inflammatory markers independent of its effects on glycemic control.</detailed_description>
