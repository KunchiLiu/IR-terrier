	<brief_title>Effect of Physical Therapy on Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical therapy treatment of patients with lymphoedema includes treatment based on the principles of 'Complete Decongestive Therapy' (CDT). CDT consists of following components; skin care, manual lymphatic drainage, bandaging and exercises. Regarding what type of treatment of treatments is most effective, the scientific evidence is sparse. Studies have focused on the time-consuming manual lymphatic drainage, but the scientific evidence is not consistent. A randomized, single-blind, equivalence trial. A total of 160 breast cancer patients with lymphoedema will be recruited from 3 hospitals and randomised into one of two treatment groups: A: Complete Decongestive TherapyA (incl. manual drainage) or B: Complete Decongestive TherapyB (except manual lymphatic drainage</detailed_description>
