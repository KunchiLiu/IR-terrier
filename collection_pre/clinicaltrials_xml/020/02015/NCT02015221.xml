	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Dual Action Pneumatic Compression Device: Patient Ease of Use and Comfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized to receive either the ACTitouch system or standard compression garments, and will respond to symptom surveys and quality of life surveys to assess comfort and ease of use of each. These will be conducted at Baseline, at Day 15 and Day 30.</detailed_description>
