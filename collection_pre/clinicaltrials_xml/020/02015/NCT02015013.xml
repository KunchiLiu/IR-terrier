	<brief_summary>Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a rare syndrome defined by consistently low CD4 T cell counts (&lt;300/mm3) without evidence of HIV infection or other known immunodeficiency. Patients with ICL are at risk for opportunistic infections typically associated with HIV/AIDS such as disseminated cryptococcal infection and severe human papillomavirus-related dysplasia. More than 20 years since the description of ICL, its etiology, pathogenesis, and management remain unclear. In this study we propose to administer the combination of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor to ICL patients and healthy volunteers with the objective of harvesting mobilized CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) by apheresis for transfer into immunocompromised mice and for study with in vitro assays. The mice studies would serve to investigate thymic development, survival, and trafficking of the mobilized human cells within murine lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. HPCs are used for various therapies and there is an increasing use of agents that stimulate the bone marrow to produce progenitor cells and move them into the bloodstream where they may be harvested by apheresis. Not all patients respond to GCSF with vigorous HPC mobilization. The binding of chemokine receptor CXCR4 to stromal cell derived factor (SDF-1 or CXCL12) is an important interaction between a hematopoietic progenitor cell and its marrow environment. Plerixafor is a CXCR4 inhibitor which blocks binding to SDF-1 resulting in the release of hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+) into peripheral circulation. In pharmacodynamic studies of plerixafor in conjunction with G-CSF compared to G-CSF and placebo, a two-fold increase in CD34+ cell count was observed. Due to the important role CXCR4 plays in immune cell trafficking and its potential role in the pathogenesis of ICL, we propose as a secondary objective to assess peripheral CD4 T cell and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers and functions in ICL patients compared to controls following G-CSF and plerixafor administration. Study participants will be screened within 12 weeks prior to the study period. Eligible participants will receive G-CSF for 5 days with hospitalization on Day 4 for plerixafor injection followed by apheresis on Day 5. Participants will return for examinations and blood draws on Days 8 and 12.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA ICL patients: 1. Documented history of idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia as defined by CD4 T cell count &lt;300 cells/microL or &lt;20% of total T lymphocytes on 2 occasions at least 6 weeks apart in the absence of any illness or medications accounting for CD4 lymphocytopenia. Although the protocol will primarily enroll ICL patients who are lymphopenic at the time of enrollment, up to three patients who had clear documentation of ICL in the past and are currently not lymphopenic may still be enrolled for comparative purposes. 2. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL 3. Human Tlymphotropic virus Type 1 (HTLV1) and HTLV2 seronegative Healthy volunteers: white blood cell count &gt;2500/mm(3) and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12.5 g/dL ICL patients and healthy volunteers: 1. Age 1865 years 2. Weight at least 50 kg but less than 167 kg and &lt;175% ideal body weight (due to lack of data regarding appropriate dosing of plerixafor) 3. Ability to give informed consent 4. Capacity and willingness to adhere to study procedures, including scheduled followup visits 5. Willingness to have blood samples stored for future research 6. Willingness to undergo genetic testing 7. Willingness to be hospitalized for approximately 24 hours 8. Established primary care provider 9.
