	<criteria>Subject is a male or female 15 years of age or older. Subject must have had 1 or more of the following occur: 1. gonorrhea with the NAAT or culture within the previous 14 days 2. unprotected genital contact within 14 days with a person confirmed to be infected with gonorrhea, 3. gramnegative present in urogenital gram strain or male subject must present with purulent urethritis or a female subject with must present with mucopurulent cervical discharge Subject agrees to avoid unprotected sexual contact in order to minimize the risk of gonorrhea reinfection Subject must be in good health (ie, based on medical history), as determined by the investigator. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject must be able and willing to comply with protocol requirements. The subject must agree to provide reliable, verifiable contact information and agree to return for the TestofCure Visit.

Confirmed, or suspected, complicated or systemic gonococcal infection, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, arthritis, or endocarditis. Subject has taken one of the following products within 6 hours of the Entry Visit that may interfere with the absorption of a quinolone antibiotic: magnesium/aluminum antacids; sucralfate; VidexÂ® (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets; other highly buffered drugs; or other products containing calcium, iron, or zinc. Use of systemic or intravaginal antibiotics that are potentially effective against gonorrhea 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Subjects with a current or prior history of seizures, and subjects being treated with drugs that are known to have a sizable potential of or reduce the threshold for inducing seizures (eg, bupropion, theophylline, and tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants). Current use of systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drugs. Known significant immunosuppression (eg, CD4 cell count &lt;200/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count &lt;500/mL). Cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy during the previous 3 months. Subject is coinfected with an additional sexually transmitted disease (STD) for which treatment cannot be safely deferred until after the TestofCure Visit unless the treatment is not potentially effective against gonorrhea. Subject has used an investigational drug or product within 30 days before study drug dosing. Medical history of Type 1 hypersensitivity to antibiotics of the quinolone or cephalosporin classes.
