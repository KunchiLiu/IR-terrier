	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Accuvein to facilitate placement of peripheral intravenous catheters in obese patients. This clinical protocol is designed to determine whether using Accuvein increases the ease and efficiency of venous cannulation (as perceived by the operator), decreases the time to effective cannulation, and decreases the patient's perception of the pain.</brief_summary>
