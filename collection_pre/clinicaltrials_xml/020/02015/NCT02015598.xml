	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is characterised by repeated episodes of upper airway occlusion during sleep.It can cause cycles of hypoxia reoxygenation. And it was postulated that intermittent hypoxia seems to resemble ischemia-reperfusion.Many study suggest that ischemia-reperfusion represents an oxidative stress causing increased generation of reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anions.It is one of the most important mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular accident complication with OSAS.So many individuals approve OSAS is an Oxidative Stress disease. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line of treatment method in moderate/severe OSA.But poor adherence to CPAP treatment is very common.The failure rate with CPAP treatment is more than 50%.So we are searching a new treatment for that patients. Carbocysteine is a antioxidant.It can not only scavenges the free radicals but also replenishes glutathione(GSH)which is has double antioxidant capacity. However, Carbocysteine is cheaper than other which has double antioxidant capacity drugs,such as N-acetylcysteine.The purpose is to evaluate efficacy of oral intake of Antioxidant Carbocysteine witch can reduce oxidative stress and improve the symptom of OSAS.It recover the imbalance in the oxidant-anti-oxidant status may reduce cardiovascular abnormalities in Patients with OSAS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antioxidant Carbocysteine Treatment in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OSAS patients are required to fill in questionnaire.And Inflammation biomarkers and Oxidative Stress biomarkers and ultrasonic will be tested.Then patients are randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group is treated with oral intake of Antioxidant Carbocysteine 500mg tid. The second group is treated with CPAP. After 6 weeks treatment, all patients will take the overnight polysomnogram test again, and take questionnaire, blood , ultrasonic test.</detailed_description>
