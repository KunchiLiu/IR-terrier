	<brief_summary>Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the efficacy of IVPR and EPR during an episode of hypokalemia. Alternate Hypothesis: There is a mean difference of 15% in Serum Potassium levels between the two groups. Objective: To compare the efficacy EPR and IVPR for treatment of hypokalemia (measured as change in serum potassium levels in milliequivalent/L after potassium replacement)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Enteral Versus Intravenous Potassium Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypokalemia is frequently encountered in daily clinical practices of cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). The development of ventricular arrhythmias related to hypokalemia can lead to sudden cardiac death. Thus, potassium replacement therapy is the cornerstone therapy for hypokalemia.Though intravenous potassium replacement (IVPR) in hypokalemia is the preferred route in most intensive care settings, it is associated with known safety risks. Inappropriately administered, IVPR can lead to arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and death 1, 7, 8. Given these risks, IVPR is considered a "high-alert medication" by Institute of Safe Medication practice. Enteral potassium replacement (EPR), with its superior safety profile may be a better alternative to IVPR. A retrospective review showed that the efficacy of EPR was comparable to IVPR in pediatric patients after congenital heart disease. The investigators seek to explore this comparison between EPR and IVPR in a randomized prospective trial</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• All patients undergoing surgical repair/palliation of congenital heart lesion at the Aga Khan University Hospital and admitted to the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU) for postoperative management. Serum potassium levels (&lt;4.39 meq/l) immediate post operatively Patients/parents willing to participate in the study Have a central venous line for IVPR and an arterial line for monitoring and blood draws. Able to tolerate oral or nasogastric administration of medication for EPR. • Patients with acute renal failure (estimated clearance creatinine eccr &lt;50) Patients with paralytic ileus, necrotizing enterocolitis or GI bleeding. Patients with nausea, vomiting or diarrhea prior to randomization. Patients will not be excluded if these symptoms develop during the trial after the initial recruitment. Based on clinical decision the route of potassium supplementation may be changed if these symptoms. Intention to treat analysis will be used for the primary end point. Patient with symptomatic hypokalemia (manifested as a rhythm disturbances). Initial serum K level (post surgery) &lt; 2.0 mEq</criteria>
