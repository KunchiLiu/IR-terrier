	<brief_summary>At the hospital, the attacks against health professionals are becoming commonplace, making working conditions difficult. The ophthalmological emergencies are a perfect testing ground to evaluate the effectiveness of a series of original actions to prevent the occurrence of violence against healthcare workers. The main objective is to measure the impact of an integrated prevention of the occurrence of antisocial behavior or attacks against the healthcare workers. The prevention program combines five interventions (steps): 1) a computer sorting algorithm and specific screens for calling patients in waiting rooms, 2) a clear signage to direct patients between waiting rooms, treatment rooms and administrative et medical offices, 3) Posts information on the activity of emergency services displayed on screens, in the waiting rooms, 4) a mediator/go-between/conciliator, 5) and a dummy surveillance camera. This is an interrupted time series study. All patients admitted to the ophthalmological emergency unit of a university hospital located in Lyon, France, are included in the study, from June 2013 to Sept 2015</brief_summary>
