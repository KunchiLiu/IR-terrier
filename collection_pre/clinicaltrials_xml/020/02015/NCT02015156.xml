	<brief_summary>This study is to prove that there is no difference in the number of healthy male volunteers that will experience pyrexia (i.e. fever with body temperature of 38Â°C or higher) within a 24 hour period after administration of a single dose of 6mg/kg of PF-05280014 or trastuzumab sourced from the United States (trastuzumab-US). The study will also compare the safety of both drugs.</brief_summary>
