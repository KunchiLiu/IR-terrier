	<brief_summary>Depending on the fracture pattern of patellar fractures tension band wiring, interfragmentary screw fixation or combinations are common treatments. But there are several problems associated with these techniques as fracture dislocation or loosening and perforation of the wire. Furthermore an anatomic reduction with stable fixation in comminuted fractures is almost impossible to achieve. A new option in the treatment of patellar fractures is the locking plate osteosynthesis, which provides a more stable fixation and higher mechanical strength in biomechanical tests compared to classic tension band wiring. Due to various screw positioning a stable fixation in comminuted fractures can be achieved and an early functional treatment with full weight bearing reduces the loss of knee-motion. Furthermore a removal of the osteosynthesis seems not to be essential anymore and the blood supply is not to be compromised. Because of the absent of clinical evidence investigators want to evaluate the clinical outcome after locking plate osteosyntheses in patellar fractures and compare patient satisfaction, functional motion, complications and number of revisions with common treatments.</brief_summary>
