	<brief_summary>To test the hypothesis that early (within 5-21 days after index event) administration of combined lipid-lowering therapy in extremely high risk population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS) will be effective and well tolerated in achievement of contemporary strict requirements for triglyceride (TG) levels as an independent risk factor in the case of HTG with diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simvastatin and Fenofibrate vs Simvastatin Alone in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this parallel group study is to demonstrate that the combined therapy of simvastatin and fenofibrate is superior compared to monotherapy with simvastatin based on the comparisons of change of TG levels after 12 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Secondary objectives are to compare both treatment alternatives the combination therapy of simvastatin and fenofibrate to simvastatin monotherapy with respect to achievement the European Society of Cardiology 2011 (ESC 2011) non-HDL-C target (less than 2,6 mmol/l), change of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (apoB/apoA1) ratio, High-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (HDL-C), Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C) and Uric Acid (UA) after 12 weeks and 52 weeks (1 year) of treatment compared to baseline.</detailed_description>
