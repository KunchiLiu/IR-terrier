	<brief_summary>Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been shown to be efficient in suppressing the accumulation of pleural fluid. The other widely used treatment for MPE is recombinant human endostatin.</brief_summary>
