	<brief_summary>To evaluate EC/TC (epirubicin and cyclophosphomide or docetaxel and cyclophosphomide) with EC/TC plus DBD (Danggui Buxue Decoction) in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients. The aim is to evaluate whether DBD can decrease the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia induced by EC/TC regimen during chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
