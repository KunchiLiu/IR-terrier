	<brief_summary>Disease of the fallopian tubes is one of the most common reasons for infertility. The most common test, a hysterosalpingogram, tends to be painful,inconvenient, and frequently misses concurrent uterine disease. We propose using a less painful technique (through modified office hysteroscopy) for tubal assessment that can be performed in the office rather than hospital radiology and that uses gold standard technology for identifying coexisting uterine conditions.</brief_summary>
