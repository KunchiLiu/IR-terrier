	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208 and lenalidomide work in treating patients with relapsed, refractory, or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or prolymphocytic leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208 and lenalidomide may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II MOR00208 in Combination With Lenalidomide for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CLL, SLL or PLL or Older Patients With Untreated CLL, SLL or PLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus lenalidomide. II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months for patients with treatment-naive CLL/SLL/PLL treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus lenalidomide. III.To obtain preliminary data on toxicity profiles and efficacy with the combination of MOR00208 plus lenalidomide in patients with Richter's Transformation IV. To obtain preliminary data on efficacy of MOR00208 in patients with progressive disease on ibrutinib monotherapy SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) at 12 months for patients with untreated CLL/SLL/PLL or relapsed/refractory disease treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus lenalidomide. II. To determine the complete response (CR) rate, nodular partial response (nPR) rate, partial response (PR) rate, and stable disease (SD) rate for patients with untreated CLL/SLL/PLL or relapsed or refractory disease treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus lenalidomide. III. To summarize the progression free survival (PFS), time to next treatment, and overall survival (OS) for each of two cohorts of patients treated with this regimen. IV. To evaluate toxicity with this regimen, including frequency and severity of toxicities, dose reduction requirements, and adverse events requiring drug discontinuation. V. To perform baseline analysis of patients enrolled on this trial including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), stimulated karyotype, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (Zap-70) methylation, and immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IgVH) mutational status and describe relationships between these biomarkers and ORR or PFS for each of two cohorts with this regimen. VI. To determine the effect of this regimen on total immunoglobulins, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) expression on CLL cells. VII. To determine whether NK cells and T cells are activated in response to MOR00208 alone or in combination with lenalidomide. VIII. To estimate the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients achieving CR, and whether this correlates with PFS. OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 (days 1, 2, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1) and lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 (days 9-28 of course 1). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with a diagnosis of intermediate or high risk CLL, SLL, or B cell (B)PLL by Biennial International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) 2008 criteria who have COHORT 1: previously untreated disease AND refuse or are ineligible for approved chemo and/or immunotherapy options for untreated CLL/SLL/PLL COHORT 2: previously received at least one therapy for their disease All patients must satisfy one of the following criteria for active disease requiring therapy: Evidence of marrow failure as manifested by the development or worsening of anemia or thrombocytopenia (not attributable to autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia) Massive (&gt;= 6 cm below the costal margin), progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly Massive nodes (&gt;= 10 cm) or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy Constitutional symptoms, which include any of the following: Unintentional weight loss of 10% or more within 6 months Significant fatigue limiting activity Fevers &gt;= 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit (F) for 2 weeks or more without evidence of infection Night sweats &gt;
