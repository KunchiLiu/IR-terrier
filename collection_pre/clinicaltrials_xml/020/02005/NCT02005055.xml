	<brief_title>High Dose Rate Brachytherapy for Treatment of Keloids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective evaluation describes the outcome of surgical excision with adjuvant high-dose-rate brachytherapy for the treatment of recalcitrant keloids in a large mixed Fitzpatrick skin type patient population. After intralesional excision, a unique low dose radiation scheme of 2x6Gray (Gy) was administered in 2 fractions: the first within 4 hours, the second within 24 hours. Keloids were evaluated pre- and postoperative (1 week, 3, 6, 12 months, 5years). Scars were measured and recurrence was judged. An evaluation of the outcome of the scars was obtained using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, III)</detailed_description>
