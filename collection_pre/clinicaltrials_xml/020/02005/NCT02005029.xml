	<brief_summary>Gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying) is a common feature of Parkinson's Disease. Levodopa (Sinemet), a common medication for Parkinson's Disease, can make gastroparesis worse. Gastroparesis effects how the levodopa is absorbed and used by the body. This study will explore the possibility of using Erythromycin, a drug commonly used (off label) for gastroparesis, along with levodopa to determine if there is improved levodopa absorption and motor function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will be required to make four visits for evaluation. Visit 1 is a screening visit, participants will receive the study drug or a placebo during visits 2 and 3, and visit 4 is a follow up visit. Participants will provide blood and urine samples during the visits. Participants will also be required to complete questionnaires and a series of motor tests.</detailed_description>
