	<brief_summary>Serious concern about the role of anesthesia in tumor recurrence has considerably risen over years, but the lack of surrogate markers for tumor spreading made trials addressing this issue difficult to realize. In breast cancer patients CTC positivity has been recently recognized as an independent prognostic factor. In this respect, we postulated that in a first step changes in the number of CTC after general anesthesia would help to determine the effect of anesthesia on this tumor marker.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with primary breast cancer will be randomized to either propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia for curative surgery. CTC will be determined in the pre- as well as postoperative phase and the kinetic of CTC in the two groups will be compared.</detailed_description>
