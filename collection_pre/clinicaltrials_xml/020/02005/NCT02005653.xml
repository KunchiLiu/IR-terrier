	<brief_summary>Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) essentially a micro-filaricidal drug is given for 12 days as standard treatment for the clearance of W. bancrofti infection. It takes about one year for the individuals to completely clear the microfilaria from the blood. It takes another two to four years to clear the antigen. The aim of the present study is to shorten the time taken for clearing the Mf and antigen from the blood either by co-administration or sequential administration of a macrofilaricidal drug, Albendazole or doxycycline. This study is a randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trial to study the efficacy of these drug combinations in complete clearance the Mf and antigen from the blood in shorter span of 180 days and 365 days respectively.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose: Lymphatic dwelling parasite W. bancrofti is the most common cause of secondary lymphoedema. Till today, there is no effective treatment protocol for the complete clearance of W. bancrofti infection, in a short duration of time. Methods: The investigators conducted a double blind RCT under field conditions recruiting 146 asymptomatic W. bancrofti infected individuals. Participants were randomly assigned one of the four regimens for 12 days, DEC 300 mg + Doxycycline 100 mg co-administration or DEC 300 mg + Albendazole 400 mg co-administration or DEC 300 mg + Albendazole 400 mg sequential administration or control regimen DEC 300 mg. Participants were followed up at 13, 26 and 52 weeks post-treatment for the clearance of infection.</detailed_description>
