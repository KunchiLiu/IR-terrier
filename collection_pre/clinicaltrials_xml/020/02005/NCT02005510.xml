	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of In-Home Cervical Cancer Screening in Underscreened Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over half of all cervical cancers in the U.S. are diagnosed in unscreened or underscreened women. New national guidelines identify increasing screening uptake as the number one priority for reducing cervical cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Innovative screening strategies that eliminate the need for clinic-based screening could be highly effective in improving screening compliance while maintaining high-quality care. We propose a large, pragmatic randomized controlled trial within Group Health (a large integrated health care delivery system in Washington State) to compare effectiveness of two programmatic approaches to increasing cervical cancer screening among overdue women. The first approach (control arm) is usual care at Group Health, which consists of patient- and provider-level services to promote adherence to Pap screening, and the second approach (intervention arm) includes usual care plus a mailed in-home high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) screening kit. We will randomize eligible women to the in-home hrHPV screening arm or the usual care arm. Compared to usual care, we hypothesize that in-home hrHPV screening will enhance early detection and treatment of cervical neoplasia and improve compliance with screening. The trial will provide definitive evidence-based data on the impact of an in-home hrHPV screening program in a real-world clinical setting.</detailed_description>
