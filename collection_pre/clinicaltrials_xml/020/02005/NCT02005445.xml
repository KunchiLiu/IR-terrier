	<brief_title>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Treatment to Improve Cardiac Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent condition in patients with coronary heart disease and is associated with impaired exercise performance, functional limitation and reduced health-related quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that identification and treatment of OSA in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation will improve the response to rehabilitation. The proposed study will test this hypothesis using a parallel group, randomized, clinical trial comparing OSA treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to an educational control group in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation who screen positive for previously undiagnosed OSA.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Veterans referred for cardiac rehabilitation at the VA Boston Healthcare System. Moderate to severe OSA (AHI &gt;15) on home sleep testing. Dangerous levels of sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score &gt;16 or a report of falling asleep at the wheel of a car within the past 2 years). Physical limitation precluding exercise testing.</criteria>
