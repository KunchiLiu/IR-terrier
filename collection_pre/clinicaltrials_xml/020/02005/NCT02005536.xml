	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of SP059 (IMOVAX POLIO®: Inactive Poliovirus Vaccine) vaccine against poliovirus and safety after fifth dose. Primary Objective: - To investigate the booster vaccine response rate against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 one month following the vaccination dose with SP059 as 2nd booster Secondary Objectives: - To investigate seroprotection rates (percentage of subjects presenting poliovirus neutralizing antibody titers above 1:8 (1/dil.) at pre- and post-booster time points, Geometric mean titers (GMT) at pre- and post-booster time points and geometric mean of individual titer ratio (GMTR). - To investigate the safety after dosing of SP059 as 2nd booster.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of IMOVAX POLIO® Subcutaneous as a Booster Vaccine in Pre-school Age Children in Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will receive one dose of SP059 (at Visit 1) as a booster vaccination at an age from 4 to 6 years. They will be assessed for immunogenicity at baseline (pre-vaccination) and at 4-6 weeks post- vaccination. Safety data including serious adverse events (SAEs) after vaccination will be collected during the study period.</detailed_description>
