	<brief_summary>This study will compare the incidence of acute clinical or subclinical rejection between immunosuppression with CellCept at a starting dose of 3mg po daily with therapeutic drug monitoring and standard immunosuppression with CellCept and a fixed dose of 2g po daily, in kidney transplant recipients receiving induction by anti-IRL2, cyclosporine therapy, and early discontinuation of steroids. Patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms. The anticipated time on study treatment is 52 weeks.</brief_summary>
