	<brief_summary>This open-label, randomized study will compare the efficacy of GDC-0199 plus rituximab (GDC-0199+R) with bendamustine plus MabThera/Rituxan (Rituximab) (B+R) in patients with relapsed or resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients will be randomized 1:1 into the two arms. Patients randomized to GDC-0199+R will be given GDC-0199 daily (oral, target dose 400 mg) and will receive 6 cycles of rituximab infused intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle (Cycle 1: 375 mg/m2; Cycles 2-6: 500 mg/m2). Patients randomized to B+R will receive 6 cycles of treatment consisting of a rituximab infusion (Cycle 1: 375 mg/m2; Cycles 2-6: 500 mg/m2) on Day 1 and bendamustine infusions (70 mg/m2) on Days 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in the GDC-0199+R arm will continue GDC-0199 treatment until disease progression or 2 years since treatment start, whichever comes first. Anticipated time on study is up to 5 years.</brief_summary>

Received CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as fluconazole, ketoconazole and clarithromycin) or inducers (such as rifampin, carbamezapine, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) within 7 days prior to the first dose of GDC0199. Prior GDC0199 treatment. Patients with another cancer, history of another cancer considered uncured on in complete remission for &lt; 5 years, or currently under treatment for another suspected cancer except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been treated or excised and is considered resolved. Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of administration. Other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including, but not limited to, systemic infection (viral, bacterial or fungal).
