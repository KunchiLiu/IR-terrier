	<brief_title>Usability Study of Spaced Retrieval Exercise Using Mobile Devices for Alzheimer's Disease Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators developed ADcope, an integrated application that includes several modules that target individuals with Alzheimer's disease , using mobile devices. The investigators developed two different user interfaces: a text-based and a graphic-based. To evaluate the usability of the application, participants with early stages of AD were asked to run the two user interfaces of the spaced retrieval memory exercise using a tablet mobile device.</detailed_description>
