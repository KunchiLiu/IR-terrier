	<brief_summary>In this study, we will evaluate the diagnostic yield of the new AliveCor device versus a 14 day event monitor with the use of both devices simultaneously. We will also examine by means of a questionnaire the compliance, ease of use and patient satisfaction for each device. Hypothesis: 1. The AliveCor monitor will be non-inferior to the 14 day event monitor with respect to diagnosis of the arrhythmia responsible for a patient's symptoms. 2. The AliveCor monitor will have better compliance and acceptability compared to the 14 day event monitor, and thus there will be a greater number of days with recordings from the AliveCor monitor.</brief_summary>
