	<brief_summary>In France the prevalence of pre-lingual deafness is between 1 and 1.4 per 1000 habitants, and according to very conservative estimates, about 44 000 deaf persons use the sign language. Additionally, the prevalence of dementia in France is close to 1% (850 000 dements for a total population of 65 millions). The prevalence of dementia in pre-lingual deaf adults has also been described and is between 1 and 1.4 /100 000 habitants. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) of Folstein is a test recommended to perform the cognitive evaluation for the detection of mental disorders including dementia, and a consensual French version exists prepared by GRECO (Group of Research and Cognitive Assessments). However, to date, there are no simple, rapid and validated screening tests to study cognitive disorders in deaf persons who use the sign language. The only tests available allow a late diagnosis avoiding an optimal treatment of the patients.</brief_summary>
