	<brief_summary>Scleroderma as well as numerous other rheumatologic conditions can affect the skin. Scleroderma in particular involves skin thickening and hardening. Currently, evaluation of skin involvement by scleroderma is assessed based on a combination of physical examination and histologic assessment after biopsy. The investigators propose to measure skin hardness using ultrasound elasticity imaging, in the form of acoustic radiation force impulse/shear wave velocity imaging (ARFI/SVI). The investigators hypothesize that ARFI/SVI may be able to distinguish normal skin from skin affected by scleroderma (and other rheumatologic conditions) as well as perhaps quantify the amount of fibrosis in the dermis. Such a radiologic biomarker could be used to help confirm the diagnosis of scleroderma as well as to follow patients over time and assess response to therapy and progression of disease.</brief_summary>
