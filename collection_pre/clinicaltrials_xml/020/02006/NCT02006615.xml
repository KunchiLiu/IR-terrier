	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that ten sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation yield ability to upregulate the function of primary motor cortex and prefrontal cortex that play key roles in motor and frontal memory processing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Primary Motor Cortex and Prefrontal Cortex for Facilitation of Motor System and Working Memory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excitatory (&gt;3Hz) rTMS could facilitate the brain cortex and neuroplasticity that benefits motor control and working memory when the coil is applied over primary motor cortex or dorsolateral prefrontal gyrus.</detailed_description>
