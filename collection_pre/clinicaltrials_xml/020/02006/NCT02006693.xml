	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the AqueSys XEN Implant for the treatment of moderate primary open angle glaucoma patients when medications have failed to control intraocular pressure (IOP). Effectiveness will be evaluated by comparing medicated preoperative, intraocular pressure to postoperative values. Additionally, the number of IOP lowering medications subjects are on at each study visit will be compared to preoperative medication.</brief_summary>
