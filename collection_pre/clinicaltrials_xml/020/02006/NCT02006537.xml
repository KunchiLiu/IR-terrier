	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of GSK2256294 in healthy young and elderly subjects to explore the effects of food, gender and age on drug exposure. The biliary metabolites in healthy young males will be investigated using the Entero-test after a single oral dose of GSK2256294. This study will be conducted in two cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Cohort 1 is open label in order to characterise the PK profile of GSK2256294 in healthy young males and also to investigate the biliary metabolites of GSK2256294. Cohort 2 uses a crossover design to allow comparison of the PK parameters of GSK2256294 between in the fed and fasted state within subject and also to compare the PK parameters of GSK2256294 between male and female subjects. A washout period of a minimum of 2 weeks has been chosen to allow and adequate washout of GSK2256294.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Safety All Cohorts 12 lead ECG without any clinically significant abnormality as judged by the Investigator, and ECGs QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) determined by the average of triplicate ECGs. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 2 weeks postlast dose. Body weight &gt;=60 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 19 35 kg per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5xUpper limit of normal [ULN] (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter outside the reference range for the population being studies may be included only of the Investigator agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with study procedures. Consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor is required. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Safety Cohort 2 Only A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy [for this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milli international units per milliliter (mIU/mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picogram per milliliter (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole per liter) is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.] Other Cohort 1 Only. Cohort 1 only: Male aged between 18 and 45 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Cohort 1 only: BP &lt;=130/80. Other Cohort 2 Only Cohort 2 only: Male and females (of nonchild bearing potential) aged &gt;=60 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent. Cohort 2 only: BP &lt;=160/100. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to 12 grams of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. Subjects with a history of any type of malignancy with the exception of successfully treated squamous cell cancer of the skin. History of sensitivity to the study medication, or components thereof or a history of drug allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicated their participation. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening.</criteria>
