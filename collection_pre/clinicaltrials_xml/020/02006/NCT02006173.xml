	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is a double-blind, randomized, within-subject controlled, 2-armed, single-center study sponsored by SciVision Biotech Inc. and approved by National Taiwan University Hospital Research Ethics Committee. The aim of this post-marketing study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hya-Dermis mixed with lidocaine, as well as the effectiveness of corrections of Hya-Dermis mixed with lidocaine. Accounting for potential loss to follow-up, the minimum enrollment was statistically determined to be 40 patients. The study was estimated to be held one and half year including a 0-2 weeks screening period, a day of treatment, and follow-up at month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12. Patient informed consent forms will be obtained before the treatment. A pre-treatment photograph, nasolabial folds (NLF) severity scale scores, and individual aesthetic satisfaction will be the baseline. Two sets of randomized numbers are used, patient numbers and treatment numbers. Participants with odd patient numbers will be assigned to nasolabial group and those with even patient numbers will be assigned to nasolabial&amp;cheekbone group. Participants receive experiment treatment (Hya-Dermis mixed with lidocaine) in one side and control treatment (Hya-Dermis mixed with normal saline) in the other side of the face randomly depending on the treatment numbers. Both physicians and participants are only blind to the treatment assignment. 30 minutes after the injection, a post-photograph will be used to evaluate NLF severity scale scores and global aesthetic improvement scale (GAIS) by physicians. A questionnaire including the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of pain during the treatment and individual aesthetic satisfaction will be collected from patients. The effectiveness analyses compare NLF severity scale scores and GAIS based on photograph records from physicians, as well as participant questionnaires for each group on every visit. The safety assessment evaluates any recorded adverse events following the device treatment.</brief_summary>
