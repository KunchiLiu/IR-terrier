	<brief_title>Beneficial Effects of Microsurgical Varicocelectomy on Semen Parameters for Causes Other Than Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While most studies are continued to validate the observations of significant improvements in sperm density and motility after varicocele ligation in infertile patients, there have been few studies to investigate the effects of varicocelectomy on semen parameters in adult men unrelated with infertility. The purpose of this study was to determine whether varicocelectomy could improve the semen parameter of these patients as well as whether clinical varicoceles are associated with abnormal semen parameters in patients unrelated with infertility.</detailed_description>
