	<brief_summary>This one-year randomized crossover study is proposed to compare the changes of postprandial oxidative stress (POS) after consumption of meals from different cultures in healthy Chinese adults, using a 'real-life, cultural meal' approach. It is hypothesized that the changes of POS differ with meals from different cultures. Four cultural meals are chosen, namely Southern Chinese, Northern Chinese, American, and South Indian, based on the known prevalence of chronic diseases between Caucasians, Chinese and Indians, and within the Southern and Northern Chinese population.</brief_summary>
