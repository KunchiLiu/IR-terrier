	<brief_title>Oxytocin Levels in Typically Developing Boys</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Measuring basal levels of plasma oxytocin in individuals with typical development across childhood and adolescence using both extracted and unextracted EIA methods. This study is necessary since there is great variability in reported plasma oxytocin in typically developing children from other studies as well as up to 1000 fold variability in such levels using different assay procedures. Further existing studies have not clearly described variation in levels with age. all samples will be taken in the afternoon.</detailed_description>
