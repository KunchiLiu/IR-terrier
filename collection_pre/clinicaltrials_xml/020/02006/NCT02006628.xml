	<brief_summary>A study to compare the change in symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder when treated with GWP42003 or placebo, added to existing anti-psychotic therapy over a period of six weeks. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of GWP42003 on quality of life and cognition and to assess the safety and tolerability of GWP42003.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of GWP42003 as Adjunctive Therapy in the First Line Treatment of Schizophrenia or Related Psychotic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This eight-week (six week treatment period and two week follow-up), multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group study aims to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GWP42003 in patients with schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder. Eligible subjects will enter the study at a Screening and Randomisation Visit (Visit 1, Day 1), where the following information will be obtained for each participant: 1. Informed consent 2. Demographics 3. Medical history 4. Physical examination 5. Electrocardiogram (ECG) 6. Vital signs 7. Pregnancy test (if appropriate) 8. Safety blood test (biochemistry and haematology) 9. Efficacy blood test (plasma cannabinoid levels, serum High Density Lipoprotein [HDL]-Cholesterol [C] levels, serum prolactin levels and markers of inflammation) 10. Urinalysis (including drugs of abuse screen) 11. Concomitant medications (current and recent) 12. Assessment of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder symptom severity (positive, negative and general) 13. Severity of mental illness 14. Assessment of functional ability (social, occupational and psychological) 15. Severity of Parkinsonian symptomatology (rigidity) 16. Assessment of cognition 17. Current substance abuse status (if applicable) 18. Current dependence disorders and frequency of abuse (if applicable). 19. Body weight 20. Body Mass index (BMI) 21. Waist circumference Once all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reviewed, participants will be randomised to receive either GWP42003 or placebo alongside their prescribed anti-psychotic medications and begin treatment at Visit 1 as instructed. A second (Visit 2, Day 8) and third (Visit 3, Day 22) visit will take place mid-treatment, where the following assessments will be performed: 1. Assessment of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder symptom severity (positive, negative and general) 2. Severity of mental illness and level of change since baseline 3. Assessment of functional ability (social, occupational and psychological) 4. Severity of Parkinsonian symptomatology (rigidity) 5. Assessment of cognition 6. Review of concomitant medications 7. Review of medication compliance 8. Participant's global impression of change since baseline 9. Carer's global impression of change since baseline (if applicable) 10. Safety assessments (Adverse Event(s) (AE)) 11. Body weight 12. BMI 13. Waist circumference In addition, a safety blood test and efficacy blood test will also be performed during the third visit (Visit 3, Day 22). A further visit will take place at the end of treatment (Visit 4, Day 43), where the following assessments will be performed: 1. Assessment of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder symptom severity (positive, negative and general) 2. Severity of mental illness and level of change since baseline 3. Assessment of functional ability (social, occupational and psychological) 4. Severity of Parkinsonian symptomatology (rigidity) 5. Assessment of cognition 6. Physical examination 7. Review of concomitant medications 8. Review of medication compliance 9. Participant's global impression of change since baseline 10. Caregiver's global impression of change since baseline (if applicable) 11. Safety assessments (AEs) 12. ECG 13. Safety blood test 14. Efficacy blood test 15. Urinalysis (including drugs of abuse screen) 16. Pregnancy test (if appropriate) 17. Physical examination 18. Vital signs 19. Body weight 20. BMI 21. Waist circumference 22. Review of dependence disorders (if applicable) There will be a safety follow-up telephone following the end of treatment (Visit 5, Day 57), which will involve a review of any new or ongoing AEs and changes to concomitant medications.</detailed_description>

Patient is male or female aged 18 to 65 years. Patient is able (in the investigator's opinion) and willing to comply with all study requirements. Patient is diagnosed with schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder (such as schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder) as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version 4. Patient must have been treated for a minimum of fourweeks and be on a stable dose of their current antipsychotic (AP) medication. Patient must have shown the capacity to respond at least partially to first line AP medication in the opinion of the investigator. Patient must be able to remain stable on their dose of AP and concomitant medications for the duration of the study, in the opinion of the investigator. Patient is willing for his or her name to be notified to the responsible authorities for participation in this study, as applicable in individual countries. Patient is willing to allow his or her primary care practitioner and consultant, if appropriate, to be notified of participation in the study. Exclusion Criteria (any of the following): Any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients of the Investigational Medicinal Product. Patient has a Positive and Negative Symptom Scale total score of &lt; 60 at Visit 1. Patient presents with a current clinical picture and/or history that is consistent with: i. delirium or dementia ii. acute drug induced psychosis iii. bipolar disorder Patient is taking more the one AP medication during the study. Female patients of child bearing potential and male patients whose partner is of child bearing potential, unless willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective contraception, for example, oral contraception, double barrier, intrauterine device, during the study and for three months thereafter (however a male condom should not be used in conjunction with a female condom). Female patient who is pregnant, lactating or planning pregnancy during the course of the study and for three months thereafter. Patients who have received an Investigational Medicinal Product within 30 days prior to the screening visit. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study, may influence the result of the study, or the patient's ability to participate in the study. Following a physical examination, the patient has any abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigator would prevent the patient from safe participation in the study. Unwilling to abstain from donation of blood during the study. Travel outside the country of residence planned during the study. Patient previously randomised into this study.</criteria>
