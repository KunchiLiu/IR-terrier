	<brief_summary>This is a randomised study to examine whether high dose Sillymarin will be able to help improve fat-induced liver damage in the liver. The study hypothesis is that high dose Sillymarin will be able to reduce steato-hepatitis (fat-related liver inflammation) better than placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Silymarin for the Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES OF STUDY Primary Objectives 1. To assess the safety and adverse event profile of Silymarin compared to placebo. 2. To assess the efficacy of Silymarin as defined by an improvement in non-alcoholic steatosis (NAS) activity score by at least 30% from baseline compared to placebo. Secondary Objectives 1. To compare NAS activity before and after Silymarin therapy. 2. To characterize changes in ALT and AST during Silymarin therapy. 3. To compare insulin resistance measured by HOMAr during Silymarin therapy.</detailed_description>

Weight gain//loss of no more than 10% between biopsy and screening or within 30 days of screening if the biopsy is performed during the screening period. No change in diabetic and/or lipid medications between biopsy and screening or within 30 days of screening if the biopsy is performed during the screening period Use of silymarin or other milk thistle preparations for a period of 90 consecutive days or longer between biopsy and initial screening, or within 30 days prior to screening if the biopsy is performed during the screening period. Use of other antioxidants or nonprescribed complementary alternative medications for a period of 90 consecutive days or longer between biopsy and initial screening, or within 30 days prior to screening if the biopsy is performed during the screening period. Use of warfarin, metronidazole, or acetaminophen (greater than 2 grams per day) between screening and randomization. Use of oral steroids for more than 14 days of screening or prior to randomization. BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 between screening and randomization. Poorlycontrolled diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 8 %) between screening and randomization Diabetes mellitus treated with oral agents other than the secretagogues or metformin between screening and randomization.

Secondary hepatic malignancy or extrahepatic malignancy. Serum Creatinine of 176 μmol/L or greater or creatinine clearance (calculated according to CockcroftGault) 60 mL/min or less, or on dialysis, at screening.
