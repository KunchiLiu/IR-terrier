	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized pilot/pharmacodynamic/genomic study of neoadjuvant paricalcitol to target the microenvironment in resectable pancreatic cancer to determine the effect of targeting the vitamin D metabolic program in the tumors of patients treated with one cycle of gemcitabine/abraxane with or without paricalcitol prior to surgery for resectable pancreatic cancer through an assessment of cellular and imaging markers.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Previously untreated, apparently resectable, adenocarcinoma of the pancreas at registration. Age greater than or equal to 18 years ECOG performance status of 02. Standard laboratory criteria for hematologic, biochemical, and urinary indices within a range that, in the opinion of the physician, clinically supports enrollment of the patient on the trial. Note: subjects must have: Creatinine &lt; 2xULN, Transaminases &lt; 3xULN, Neutrophils &gt;1.5x109/L, and Platelets &gt;100,000/mm3 Ability to provide written informed consent Exclusion Criteria Patients with hypercalcemia (blood levels greater than 11.5 mg/dL; in patients with kidney disease, blood calcium levels must be 9.5 mg/dL or lower before starting paricalcitol). Patients who are currently pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. Patients who, in the opinion of the physician, would not be clinically appropriate for receipt of the therapy regimen associated with participation</criteria>
