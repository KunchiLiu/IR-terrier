	<brief_title>Comparison of the Efficacy of rTMS and tDCS of the Motor Cortex in Patients With Chronic Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study ims to compare directly the efficacy of two noninvasive neurostimulation techniques : repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct electrical current (tDCS) of the motor cortex in patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy on average pain intensity. This will be a sham controlled crossover design : patients will be randomized to receive either active rTMS or tDCS during 3 consecutive days followed by the alternative treatment within 3 weeks apart, or sham rTMS or tDCS during 3 consecutive dats followed by the alternative treatment within 3 weeks apart. The investigator will be blind to the treatment. Assessments will be performed before each treatment, then 1 hour after the end of the third day session, then 2 days and 1 week after the stimulation. Assessments will include pain questionnaires, quality of life, anxiety and depression, catastrophizing and evaluation of treatment effect on experimental pain using Quantitative sensory testing.</detailed_description>
