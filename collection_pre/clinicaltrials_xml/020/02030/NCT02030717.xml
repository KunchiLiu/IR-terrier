	<brief_summary>The study aim to study whether spinal anesthesia (using: bupivacain, morfin och klonidin) can be better than epidural anesthesia during and after open surgery for renal cell carcinoma. Per- and postoperative pain after spinal anesthesia with klonidin can be reduced and, thus, shorten the hospital stay and rehabilitation of the patients.</brief_summary>
