	<brief_summary>Prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, international multicenter, clinical safety and effectiveness of a leadless pacemaker system in patients who are indicated for a VVIR pacemaker. Following completion of enrollments in the IDE, patients will continue to be enrolled in the continued access phase of the study under the same protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The LEADLESS Pacemaker IDE Study (Leadless II)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the leadless pacemaker system in treating patients with a slow heart rate or irregular heartbeats. The Nanostim leadless pacemaker provides bradycardia pacing as a pulse generator with built-in battery and electrodes, for permanent implantation in the right ventricle. As a leadless pacemaker, it does not need a connector, pacing lead, or pulse generator pocket, but it has the same operating principles as a conventional pacemaker.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject must have one of the clinical indications before device implant in adherence with Medicare, ACC/AHA/HRS/ESC single chamber pacing guidelines including: Chronic and/or permanent atrial fibrillation with 2 or 3° AV or bifascicular bundle branch block (BBB block), including slow ventricular rates (with or without medication) associated with atrial fibrillation; or Normal sinus rhythm with 2 or 3° AV or BBB block and a low level of physical activity or short expected lifespan (but at least one year); or Sinus bradycardia with infrequent pauses or unexplained syncope with EP findings; and 2. Subject ≥18 years of age; and 3. Subject has life expectancy of at least one year; and 4. Subject is not enrolled in another clinical investigation; and 5. Subject is willing to comply with clinical investigation procedures and agrees to return for all required followup visits, tests, and exams; and 6. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent, approved by the IRB; and 7. Subject is not pregnant and does not plan to get pregnant during the course of the study. 1. Subject has pacemaker syndrome, has retrograde VA conduction or suffers a drop in arterial blood pressure with the onset of ventricular pacing; or 2. Subject is allergic or hypersensitive to &lt;1 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate; or 3. Subject has a mechanical tricuspid valve prosthesis; or 4. Subject has a preexisting endocardial pacing or defibrillation leads; or 5. Subject has current implantation of either conventional or subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT); or 6. Subject has an implanted vena cava filter; or 7. Subject has evidence of thrombosis in one of the veins used for access during the procedure; or 8. Subject has an implanted leadless cardiac pacemaker; or 9. Subject had recent cardiovascular or peripheral vascular surgery within 30 days of enrollment</criteria>
