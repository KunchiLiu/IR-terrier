	<brief_summary>Head and neck cancer would be suitable for quick diagnostic programs because their initial symptoms are easy detectable and the curation rates in the initial stages are very high. Actually the stages at diagnosis are about 30% in initial stages and 70% in advanced stages. The hypothesis of this study is that a program for quick referral of patients with symptoms of head and neck cancer would help early diagnosis.</brief_summary>
