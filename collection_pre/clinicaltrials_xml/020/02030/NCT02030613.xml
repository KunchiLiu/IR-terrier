	<brief_title>Effective Dose of Etanercept in Patients Treated for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Etanercept, a fully human soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor fusion protein, has been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of patients with polyarticular JIA. However, many patients experience primary or secondary response failure, suggesting that individualization of treatment regimens may be beneficial. It has been shown that the clinical response to two anti-TNFalpha biological agents (infliximab, adalimumab) closely follows the trough drug levels and the presence of antibodies directed against the drugs. This study was undertaken to investigate whether serologic monitoring of etanercept bioavailability and immunogenicity in individual patients with JIA would be useful in optimizing treatment regimens to improve efficacy and tolerability</detailed_description>
