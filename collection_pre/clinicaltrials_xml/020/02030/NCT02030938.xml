	<brief_title>SERI® Surgical Scaffold for Soft Tissue Support in Revision Augmentation Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Negative nicotine test at screening visit Previous augmentation with siliconefilled or salinefilled breast implants requiring Revision Augmentation surgery for increased nipple:inframammary fold distance Well vascularized skin flaps that can be approximated without tension BMI (Body Mass Index) that is ≥ 30 kg/m2 Active smoker or have smoked within 6 weeks prior to screening visit Pregnant or nursing Advanced fibrocystic disease considered to be premalignant without accompanying subcutaneous mastectomy Carcinoma of the breast Previous mastectomy or lumpectomy Abscess or infection in the body at the time of enrollment Had any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes (e.g., HbAIc &gt; 8%), that is clinically known to impact wound healing ability. For example: collagenvascular, connective tissue or autoimmune disorders (e.g., Systemic Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Scleroderma) Subjects with diagnosed diabetes must have HbAIc ≤ 8% within 3 months of enrollment Showed tissue characteristics that were clinically incompatible with mammaplasty, such as tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue, compromised vascularity or ulceration Had, or was under treatment for, any condition that may have constituted an unwarranted surgical risk (e.g., unstable cardiac or pulmonary problems) History of prior implantation of any surgical scaffold (e.g., synthetic mesh, acellular dermal matrix, or biologic mesh) in the breast Implantation of any nonSERI® surgical scaffold (e.g., synthetic mesh, acellular dermal matrix, or biologic mesh) during the study period Product contraindications for use of SERI® Surgical Scaffold per the supplied package insert (e.g., hypersensitivity to silk)</criteria>
