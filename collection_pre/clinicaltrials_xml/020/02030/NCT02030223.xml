	<brief_summary>This prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the postoperative analgesic efficacy of the ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block with ropivacaine 0,75 %, in patients undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia repair with a mesh under general anaesthesia, and how the efficiency of early postoperative analgesia achieved correlates with the risk of developing a chronic pain state, a not uncommon condition after this type of surgery.</brief_summary>
