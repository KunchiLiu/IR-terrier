	<brief_summary>This trial aims to compare two training programs for children suffering functional abdominal pain. These two programs are comparable in number of sessions and group sizes, but show differences in content (very focused on pain management vs. more general information and support). Focus of the trial is the evaluation of "Stop the pain", which has shown high effectiveness in one first trial. This time, five clinics, experienced in diagnosis and treatment of childhood chronic abdominal pain, will take part. Children aged 7-12 years are eligible. The programs imply six weekly group sessions for the children and 2 parent evenings. The study group assumes that participation in "Stop the pain" will reduce pain experience and will improve the children's quality of life and coping strategies - up to 12 months after training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized-controlled Study of a Cognitive-behavioral Intervention for Children With Functional Abdominal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial aims to assess the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral self-management program (intervention group, IG) compared to an equally extensive information-only control group (CG). The interventions contain 6 weekly group sessions and 2 parent meetings according to the cognitive-behavioral, manualized program "Stop the pain with Happy Pingu". Follow up per patient: 3- and 12 months. Children aged 7-12 years suffering functional abdominal pain (according to Rome III criteria H2a, H2b, H2d, H2d1) are eligible. Our primary hypothesis is that for patients in the IG the frequency and intensity of pain will be reduced more successfully and more sustainable than for children in the CG. Secondary hypotheses state that the IG will experience a higher increase in quality of life and psychosocial well-being compared to the active CG.</detailed_description>
