	<brief_summary>This single-centre study was carried out in collaboration with the Cardiovascular Research Laboratory of Harvard University (Boston, USA). This preliminary study does not include a control group. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a hybrid reconditioning programme (electrostimulation of the lower limb muscles associated with voluntary strengthening of the upper limbs) on a specially developed rowing machine in patients presenting stabilized paraplegia of a traumatic origin. This study will bear on the increase in maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) between the start and end of the 9-month reconditioning programme.</brief_summary>
