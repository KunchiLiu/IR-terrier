	<brief_summary>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist are new treatment of type 2 diabetes, they lower blood glucose level (by enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppression of excess glucagon secretion) and reduce weight by inducing satiety and slowing of gastric emptying. Beneficial effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists on cardiovascular function have been suggested. They improve biomarkers of CV risk, decrease systolic blood pressure, improve endothelial function and have beneficial effects on myocardium. Nevertheless, few studies have analysed the effect of GLP1 treatment on myocardial function in type 2 obese diabetic. Myocardial steatosis is an independent predictor of diastolic dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was recently shown that 16 weeks of caloric restriction in obese patients with diabetes decrease myocardial triglyceride content and improve myocardial function (cardiac output, normalized stroke volume, LV mass and normalized end diastolic volume), and diastolic function. However, no study has evaluated the impact of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist in obese diabetics on myocardial TG content. Recent studies have suggested that increased epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) could be an important risk factor for cardiac diseases. We and others have already evidenced a correlation between the volume of epicardial adipose tissue and the presence or the severity of coronaropathy. The impact of weight loss on the volume of EAT or the characteristics of EAT is mostly unknown.</brief_summary>
