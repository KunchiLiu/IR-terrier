	<brief_title>Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection With Laparoscopic Assistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The laparoscopic resection with a linear stapler for subepithelial tumors (SET) can lead to excessive resection of healthy tissue of the gastric wall resulting in deformity or stenosis. Attaining a positive surgical margin is also possible. Endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) can be used for tumor resection by direct visualization of the tumor from inside the stomach lumen leading to a free surgical margin with little resection of healthy tissue. In order to overcome current endoscopic technical limitations, we will combine the conventional laparoscopic approach with EFTR.</detailed_description>
