	<brief_title>A Study of Rucaparib in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer and a Known Deleterious BRCA Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) that inhibits a specific DNA repair pathway known as base excision repair (BER). PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been shown to effectively kill tumors with a defect in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Clinical benefit has been observed in patients with a gBRCA mutation as well as in those with a somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutation. Clinical data have also shown that pancreatic cancer patients with a gBRCA mutation benefit from PARPi treatment. Clinical activity of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer combined with the paucity of 2nd line therapies support evaluation of rucaparib in pancreatic cancer patients known to harbor a deleterious BRCA mutation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (ductal adenocarcinoma and related subtypes eligible; endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors excluded) Received at least 1, but no more than 2, chemotherapybased regimens for locally advanced or metastatic disease and has relapsed or progressive disease. Patients no longer able to continue treatment with chemotherapy due to intolerable toxicity may be considered for study participation provided that radiology assessment confirms either stable disease or disease progression (i.e. no response to treatment) Documented deleterious or suspected deleterious (or equivalent interpretation) BRCA mutation (germline or somatic) as assessed by a local laboratory Measurable disease Presence of another active cancer Prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor, including rucaparib. Patients treated with prior iniparib are eligible. Symptomatic and/or untreated central nervous system metastases. Clinical evidence of malabsorption and/or any other gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the absorption of rucaparib.</criteria>
