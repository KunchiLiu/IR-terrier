	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective observational cohort study. The study will be conducted in routine clinical practice settings. It is planned to enroll 1000 patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) who have been previously treated with other approved treatments for metastatic disease and for whom a decision has been made by the physician to treat with regorafenib according to local health authority approved label. It is the aim of this observational cohort study to further characterize safety and effectiveness of regorafenib in routine clinical practice setting. Healthcare resource utilization in the routine provision of care is becoming increasingly important from a health economics and outcomes research perspective. Therefore, another aim of this observational cohort study is to capture healthcare resource associated with the management of treatment emergent adverse events in the real world setting. The primary objective of this study is to further characterize safety of regorafenib use in routine clinical practice settings. The secondary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of regorafenib in routine clinical practice settings as measured by Overall Survival (OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Disease control rate (DCR). Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Data will be collected in applicable countries.</brief_summary>
