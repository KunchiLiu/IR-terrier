	<brief_summary>This is a pilot sub-study of patients receiving myeloablative transplant using total body irradiation (TBI) or total marrow irradiation (TMI) in their preparative regimen. The objective of this stub-study is to estimate the heterogeneity in cellular proliferation (FLT-PET uptake) as well the heterogeneity in marrow composition distribution (measured using whole body water-fat MRI) using positron emission tomography imaging. This will be used to design future trials as well as to determine the feasibility of PET and MRI imaging.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of hematologic malignancy and fitting into one of the following categories: Newly diagnosed and/or day 14 postinduction chemotherapy Relapsed, including relapse after hematopoietic cell transplant Planned hematopoietic cell transplant (if enrolling at "close") or within 100 days post hematopoietic cell transplant (if enrolling posttransplant) with a preparative regimen that includes either total marrow irradiation (TMI) or total body irradiation (TBI) Undergoing natural killer cell therapies (with or without subsequent transplant) Aged 18 years and older Not pregnant women of childbearing potential will have a confirmatory pregnancy test prior to each imaging per routine procedures Adequate renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 60 ml/min) as determined by a serum creatinine level performed as a part of standard of care within 7 days of imaging Able and willing to provide written consent Otherwise eligible patients meeting one or more of the contraindicates for an MRI, may enroll in the study without undergoing the MRI: ferromagnetic implants history of shrapnel or shot gun injury too large to fit in the magnet (approximate body mass index â‰¥ 40) cardiac pacemakers or other implanted devices that are not MRcompatible claustrophobia large tattoos</criteria>
