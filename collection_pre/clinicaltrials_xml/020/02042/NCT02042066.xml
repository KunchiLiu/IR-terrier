	<brief_summary>Low intensity shockwaves have been proven in animal and human studies to increase tissue perfusion, promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration and improve neural function. The hypothesis of this study is that shockwave therapy could improve the symptoms of patients with resistant hypertension.</brief_summary>
