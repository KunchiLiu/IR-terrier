	<brief_summary>KNOW-KT (KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With KT: A 9-year Longitudinal cohort study of the Korean adult KT patients), funded by Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) was established in 2012 by a group of transplant physicians, transplant surgeons, nephrologists, epidemiologists, and biostatisticians in Korea. We aimed to establish an adult KT cohort, to investigate the renal allograft outcomes, mortality, complications, and to explore traditional or nontraditional risk factors for morbidity and mortality. We established a bio-bank to integrate clinical and biological information. Here, we report design and method of the KNOW-KT.</brief_summary>
