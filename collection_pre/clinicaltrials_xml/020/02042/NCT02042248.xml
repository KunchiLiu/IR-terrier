	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: - find out the intensity and duration of the immune response after multiple injections of the investigational study product AGS-004 made from one's own dendritic cells and one's own strain of HIV; - understand the changes in the body's HIV DNA , and HIV-1 RNA in peripheral and resting CD4+ cells prior to and following administration of AGS- 004. - find out if low levels of HIV virus that are not detectable by standard HIV RNA assays will decrease following the administration of AGS-004. - find out if it is safe to give individuals with HIV multiple injections of AGS-004 made from the person's own dendritic cells and their own strain of HIV. - find out if administration of AGS-004 decreases the amount of latent HIV infection in resting CD4 cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study to Evaluate the Immunologic Response and Virologic Impact of AGS-004</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I/II, single-site, pilot study of the kinetics of the immunological response and virological impact of AGS-004 administered in participants with durable viral suppression on ART initiated during acute (AHI) and chronic HIV infection (CHI). Patients will be screened for eligibility in Step 1. Those meeting study eligibility and with successful production of Argos (AGS)-004 product will then enter Step 2 with administration of AGS-004. All participants will continue ART throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmation of HIV1 infection: Chronic HIV infection (CHI) is defined as documentation of a positive HIV test result by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by Western blot or Multispot HIV1/HIV2 assay prior to screening. HIV culture, HIV antigen, plasma HIV RNA, or a second antibody test by a method other than ELISA is acceptable as an alternative confirmatory test. Acute HIV infection (AHI) is defined as a negative or indeterminate enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or a negative HIV RNA test within 45 days of reproducibly detectable plasma HIV RNA by amplification methods. Participants in the AHI arm of this study must have initiated ART within 45 days of AHI diagnosis Ages ≥ 18 to &lt; 65 years old Stable ART regimen for ≥ 6 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) NOTE: The ART regimen is defined by current treatment guidelines. Participants may have had one or more changes in their ART regimen for tolerance, change of guidelines, or dosing simplification. On potent antiretroviral therapy, defined as at least 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, integrase inhibitor, or a protease inhibitor. Other potent fully suppressive antiretroviral combinations will be considered on a casebycase basis. Prior changes in or elimination of medications for easier dosing schedule, intolerance, or toxicity are permitted. All participants must continue cART throughout the study. Plasma HIV1 RNA below detected limit by conventional assays (limit of detection determined by assay employed: 75, 50, 40, or 20 copies/mL) for ≥ 1 year A single unconfirmed plasma HIV RNA &gt; limit of detection but &lt; 1000 c/mL allowed if a subsequent assay was below the limit of detection; but none in the 6 months preceding the study screening visit. Plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at screening (Visit 1) CD4 cell count ≥ 350 cells/mm3 at screening (Visit 1) Availability of an adequate sample of frozen plasma (may have been thawed and refrozen only once) drawn no more than 90 days (and preferably within 30 days) before starting ART, OR an adequate frozen sample of HIV p24 antigenpositive culture supernatant obtained from culture of resting CD4+ T cells. Note: The VL documented from the preART HIV plasma sample must be ≥8,000 copies/ml before commencing ART regimen (abstracted from medical records). If there is no viral load measurement associated with the preART HIV plasma sample, another preART VL measurement of 8,000 copies/ml can be used to accept the sample for AGS004 manufacturing. No history of autoimmune disease or autoimmune manifestations No active HCV infection (measureable HCV RNA) within 90 days of eligibility visit (visit 3). No active HBV infection (measureable HBV DNA or HBVsAg+) within 90 days of eligibility visit (visit 3). Ability and willingness of participant to give written informed consent Able and willing to provide adequate locator information Ability and willingness to communicate effectively with study personnel; considered reliable, willing, and cooperative in terms of compliance with the Protocol requirements Adequate vascular access for leukapheresis Able and willing to receive Intradermal (ID) injections without difficulty All female study participants of childbearing potential must agree not to participate in a conception process, and, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, these female participants and their partners must agree to use at least two reliable forms of contraception for at least 21 days prior to study entry and for 12 weeks after the last dose of the study drug product: o Acceptable forms of contraception include the following: Condoms (male or female) with or without spermicidal agent Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide Intrauterine device (IUD) Hormonal birth control drugs given by pills, shots, or placed on or under the skin Tubal ligation NuvaRing Potential participant must have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values: System/Laboratory Value: Hematological: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): ≥1,500/mcL Platelets: ≥125,000/mcL Hemoglobin: ≥12g/dL Coagulation: Prothrombin Time or INR: ≤1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) Chemistry: K+ levels: Within normal limits Mg++levels: ≥1.2 mEq/L but &lt;1.5 x ULN Glucose: Screening serum glucose (fasting or nonfasting) &lt;120 mg/dl Albumin: ≥3.3 g/dL Renal: Serum creatinine or calculated creatinine clearance: ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥ 60mL/min for potential participants with creatinine levels &gt; 1.3 x institutional ULN Hepatic: Serum total bilirubin: Total bilirubin &lt;1.8 times the upper limit of the normal range, unless history of Gilbert's disease or deemed related to treatment with atazanavir. If total bilirubin is elevated, direct bilirubin must be &lt;2 times the ULN range.
