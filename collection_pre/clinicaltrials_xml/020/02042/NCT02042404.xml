	<brief_summary>The EarLens System is an assistive hearing device that is intended to provide amplification for the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing impairment. The purpose of this multi-center definitive study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the EarLens System for subjects with bilateral mild to severe sensorineural hearing impairments wearing the fully activated system in their daily lives for a 4 month period of time. This study is designed to support US and International marketing applications to commercialize the EarLens System. The main efficacy hypothesis is that the EarLens System will be shown to improve speech understanding in quiet.</brief_summary>
