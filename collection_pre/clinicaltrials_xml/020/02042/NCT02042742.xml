	<brief_summary>A crossover trial was carried out in healthy volunteers aged 45-70 years and BMI &lt;30 kg/m2. Subjects consumed a Antioxidant Supplement (AS) containing 65 mg of punicalagin mixed with 3.3 mg of hydroxytyrosol 3 times daily or a Control Supplement (CS) with maltodextrin for an 8 wk each phase with 4-wk rest period. Supplementation order was randomly assigned and the consumption of derivative products of punicalagin and/or hydroxytyrosol restricted. The endothelial function parameters (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), biochemical markers), inflammatory markers and nutritional status were evaluated before and after each phase. Previously a pilot study was completed with no placebo (n=30) to determinate the effective dose of Functional Supplement.</brief_summary>
