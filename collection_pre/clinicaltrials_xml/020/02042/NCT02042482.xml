	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is determine whether combination Q10 , L-carnitine and multivitamin and mineral complex is effective in treatment of patients with low and intermidiate1-2 risk Myelodysplastic syndrome</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Combination Ultra Q10 and L-carnitine on the Course of Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are to assess response (as measured by increase in blood counts, cytogenetic/molecular changes in the bone marrow, improved endurance) to the supplements treatment. The secondary objectives are to determine: Quality of life assessment(FACT: QOL Questionnaire) Cancer fatigue reduction. Physiological functioning assessment Rate and depth transfusion reduction Duration of response. Time to progression. Overall survival. Estimated cytokine profile and another immunological and biochemical parameters of mitochondrial function before and after six months of treatment.</detailed_description>
