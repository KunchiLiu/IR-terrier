	<brief_summary>This Phase Ia study aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose of once-weekly IV infused PG545 and to evaluate its safety in subjects with advanced solid tumours. In addition, the study will explore whether PG545 exposure results in changes to chemicals produced by the body that are associated with cancer growth and spread.</brief_summary>
