	<brief_summary>We compare two POC-tests (INRario2 and CoaguChek) for the INR with the laboratory. Therefore, we take bloodsamples (capillary and venous blood) and put it on the tool. After the measuring, a number is shown = INR. We develop a Bland-Altman-plot for the correlation between the tool value and the laboratory value to illustrate the applicability in the clinical daily routine.</brief_summary>
