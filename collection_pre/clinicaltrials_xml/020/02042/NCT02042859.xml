	<detailed_description>Only a small proportion of patients with biliary obstruction caused by cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer are suitable for surgical resection. Therefore most patients with malignant biliary obstruction will need palliation of their jaundice to relieve the symptoms of pruritus, malabsorption, sepsis and to minimize potential hepatorenal complications. Restoring biliary flow with relief of jaundice is the primary goal in the palliation of obstructive biliary malignancy. Drainage at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ECRP) is established as a safer approach than at percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) because it has a lower risk of bile leak, infection and hemorrhage. ECRP is the first approach to relieve malignant biliary obstruction but sometimes it is not technically possible to stent the patient by this approach, then a PTC needs to be undertaken. Self expanding mesh metal stents (SEMS) were introduced back in the 1990s. Problems can still arise with the use of covered stents such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis or tumor overgrowth at the end of the stent, and not all studies have shown that covered stents actually reduce the problems of tumor ingrowth and consequent stent occlusion. EndoHPB can be deployed via an ERCP or PTC route. By using radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat the tissue in the duct prior to insertion of the stent, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may may delay tumor growth and the time before the stent lumen becomes blocked. Thereby this allows increased periods between the need for intervention and further stent deployment. If EndoHPB use of luminal RF is demonstrated to be effective in luminal tumor ablation, it may have an additional role as a form of neoadjuvant therapy in cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
