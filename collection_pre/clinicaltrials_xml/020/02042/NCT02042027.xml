	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test the investigational drug Gamunex-C on the growth of blood vessels over the cornea. This study is being conducted by Dr. Balamurali Ambati at the Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah. The cornea is the clear outer front part of the eye. In corneal neovascularization, blood vessels grow over the cornea. Corneal neovascularization and ocular anterior segment inflammations are sight-threatening conditions. Lipid deposition and edema with subsequent scar formation can compromise corneal clarity irreversibly. Corneal neovascularization is also a well recognized risk factor for corneal graft failure. In its natural state, the cornea is a site of immune privilege well suited to tissue transplantation. Once vascularized, there is direct exposure of corneal antigens to circulating host immune mechanisms greatly increasing the chance of rejection [Collaborative Corneal Transplantation Study]. Melting or inflammation in the anterior chamber, cornea, or ocular surface can cause irreversible scarring or destruction of the optical elements of the eye, which can compromise vision. Current standard of care for such conditions includes use of topical steroids and sometimes immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine). These do not address a common underlying corneal neovascularization or melting. This is a Phase 1 clinical trial of subconjunctival IVIg (Gamunex-C) injection for treatment of corneal neovascularization in the setting of corneal transplantation with neovascularization. Candidates for corneal transplantation with corneal neovascularization in one or more quadrants crossing more than 0.5mm over the limbus will be identified for inclusion in our study.</brief_summary>
