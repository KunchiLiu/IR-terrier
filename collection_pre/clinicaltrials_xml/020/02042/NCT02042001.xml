	<brief_summary>Despite long-term use in clinical practice, chronic treatment with efavirenz (EFV) has been associated with persistent central nervous system symptoms or mild or even asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment. Whether switching to rilpivirine (RPV) containing regimen is beneficial among patients who experience mild or asymptomatic neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse events during EFV has not been explored yet. The proposed pilot study will examine whether switching from EFV-based regimen to single tablet regimen TDF/FTC/RPV is associated with neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric improvement among HIV-infected patients with mild/asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment or neuropsychiatric symptoms during EFV-containing antiretroviral treatment. Patients under stable treatment with EFV, confirmed HIV-1 RNA viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL and altered scores in depression, quality of sleep or anxiety tests and/or alteration in 1 or more domains as assessed by neuropsychological assessment, will be randomized to immediate or deferred (12 weeks) switch to TDF/FTC/RPV. Neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric tests will be repeated after 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up and variations will be compared between groups.</brief_summary>
