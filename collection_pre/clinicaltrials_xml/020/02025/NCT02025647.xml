	<brief_summary>Innerview can address some of the challenges of integrating mental health and primary care by accurately and reliably collecting mental health evidence and activities directly from patients, and then organizing and automating that evidence and activity into reports for providers and care teams that support diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of the mental health issues within a practice population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Innerviewâ„¢, a Web-based Tool to Support the Integration of Mental Health in the Primary Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To deliver integrated quality care, innovative strategies are needed to efficiently collect, understand, monitor and manage mental health evidence and its contribution to the primary care office visit. Computer applications can provide solutions to providers by helping their processes to be feasible, manageable, and sustainable. We hypothesize that by both providing patients the opportunity to reflect on their physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms and functioning, and giving providers accurate, reliable, current, symptom-based mental health evidence in an accessible organized format prior to the face-to-face visit, Innerview will enhance diagnostic and treatment processes from both a patient- and population-based perspective, as well as enhance communication between patient and provider.</detailed_description>
