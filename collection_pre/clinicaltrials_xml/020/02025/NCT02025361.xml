	<brief_summary>Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-Bx) is the gold standard method for prostat cancer diagnosis. Cancer detection rate is an important issue in TRUS-Bx. Effective biopsy protocol is necessary to enhance cancer detection rate during the procedure. Patient tolerance may improve the protocol effectiveness and quality. Adequate patient tolerance with optimal local anesthesia may enhance cancer detection rate in TRUS-Bx.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Local Anesthesia Type on Cancer Detection Rate in Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostate Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy ultrasound's probe manipulation is necessary for effective biopsy. Patient discomfort and pain frequently occurs with manipulation of probe during transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy and this situation may qualify of the achievement of this procedure. In this study, we aimed to describe the impact of different two local anesthesia types on cancer detection rate in transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.</detailed_description>
