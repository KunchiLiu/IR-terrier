	<brief_summary>It has previously been seen that increased fish intake improves the metabolic health of overweight and obese adults, and animal protein improved metabolic health of obese rats. In this project the investigators will investigate whether increased intake of fish or meat improve metabolic health in children aged 9-12 years as well when replacing processed food. The hypothesis is that increased intake of unprocessed fish or meat will improve metabolic health in children as measured by glucose tolerance, lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers.</brief_summary>
