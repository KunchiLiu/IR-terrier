	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ONT-380 and to assess the safety and tolerability of ONT-380 combined with capecitabine alone, trastuzumab alone and with both capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Study of ONT-380 Combined With Capecitabine and/or Trastuzumab in Patients With HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1b, open-label study of ONT-380 given in combination with capecitabine alone, trastuzumab alone and with both capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. Phase 1 will use a 3+3 dose escalation design to evaluate escalating dose levels of ONT-380 in each of these three combinations in order to identify the maximal tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of ONT-380. Capecitabine will be given at 1000 mg/m2 PO BID on Days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle. Trastuzumab will be given as a loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV followed by 6 mg/kg once every 21 days. However, a loading dose of trastuzumab will not be given to patients who have received trastuzumab within 4 weeks of the first study dose of trastuzumab. These patients will receive trastuzumab at 6 mg/kg each cycle, including Cycle 1. Trastuzumab may also be given on a weekly basis at 2 mg/kg IV q 7 days, but only in the circumstance that trastuzumab infusion has been delayed, and weekly infusions are required to resynchronize the cycle length to 21 days, after discussion with the medical monitor. Trastuzumab infusion rates will be per institutional guidelines. ONT-380 will be given PO BID at a dose dependent upon the dosing cohorts to which the patient is enrolled. There will be 3-6 evaluable patients enrolled in each cohort in the dose escalation phase, unless that dose is found to be intolerable prior to completion of enrollment. At least 6 evaluable patients are to be treated at a dose level in order for an MTD/RP2D to be determined. The MTD/RP2D of ONT-380 to be used in combination with either capecitabine alone (Combination 1) or trastuzumab alone (Combination 2) will be determined prior to evaluating ONT-380 in combination with both capecitabine and trastuzumab (Combination 3). If Combination 1 and Combination 2 are found to be tolerable, then ONT-380 will be evaluated in Combination 3, using the lowest MTD/RP2D or other SMC-recommended dose of ONT-380 determined for either of the two drug combinations. This will be followed by enrollment of an expansion cohort of patients treated at the MTD/RP2D for Combination 3. Additional expansion cohorts for either Combination 1 (ONT-380 and capecitabine) or Combination 2 (ONT-380 and trastuzumab) may also be enrolled. Provided that only seven dose cohorts are needed for dose escalation and only the expansion cohort for Combination 3 is enrolled, up to 66 evaluable patients may be enrolled. Additional patients may be enrolled if additional expansion cohorts are opened.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible for the study: 1. Metastatic breast cancer, documented as HER2+ by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or 3+ staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC). 2. Progressive disease, with a history of prior treatment with both trastuzumab and TDM1 (unless deemed intolerant to or ineligible for TDM1 by the investigator) for metastatic disease. 3. ≥ 18 years at time of consent. 4. If female and of childbearing potential, has negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to treatment. 5. If a sexually active male or a sexually active female of childbearing potential, agrees to use dual (two concurrent) forms of medically accepted contraception from the time of consent until 6 months after the last dose of ONT380, capecitabine, or trastuzumab, whichever is longest. 6. Signed an informed consent document that has been approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC). 7. Must have target or nontarget lesions as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. 8. All toxicity related to prior cancer therapies must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1, with the following exceptions: alopecia; neuropathy, which must have resolved to ≤ Grade 2; and congestive heart failure (CHF), which must have been ≤ Grade 1 in severity at the time of occurrence and must have resolved completely. 9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at screening. 10. In the opinion of the Investigator, life expectancy &gt; 6 months. 11. Adequate hematologic function as defined by: 1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL 2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000 cells/μL 3. Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL 12. Adequate hepatic function as defined by the following: 1. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN), unless a known history of Gilbert's disease 2. Transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [AST/SGOT] and alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ALT/SGPT]) ≤ 2.5 X ULN (&lt; 5 X ULN if liver metastases are present) 13.
