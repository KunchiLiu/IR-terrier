	<brief_summary>Disseminated leishmaniasis (DL) is an emerging and severe form of leishmaniasis, with increasing prevalence in Bahia, Brasil. It is characterized by multiple acneiform, papular and ulcerated lesions localized on the face, chest, abdomen and extremities. The number of lesions ranges from 10 to hundreds, and mucosal disease has been documented in more than 40% of the cases. DL is a hard to cure disease and therapeutic failure with pentavalent antimony has been documented in up to 70% of the cases caused by L. braziliensis in the endemic area of Corte de Pedra, Bahia. The majority of DL patients need several courses of antimony or the use of high dose of Amphotericin B desoxicolate to cure. Therefore DL patients are exposed to relevant drug toxicity, high morbidity due to a long lasting disease, with an important socio-economic impact. Our hypothesis is that liposomal Amphotericin B has a higher cure rate than historic cure rates of pentavalent antimony in the treatment of disseminated leishmaniasis.</brief_summary>
