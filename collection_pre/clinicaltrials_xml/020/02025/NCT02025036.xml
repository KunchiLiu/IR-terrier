	<brief_summary>A three-arm Phase III trial was started in Oct. 2014. Definitive chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil is the standard in Western countries in esophagus cancer. But in China because of its toxic reaction, most of patients stop the halfway. Because low toxicity, the chemotherapy regimen of capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin are widely used in clinical. The purpose of this study is to confirm the difference of Capecitabine plus with or without oxaliplatin over cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil with definitive chemoradiotherapy for esophagus squamous cell carcinoma. A total of 630 patients will be accrued from China within 2 years. The primary endpoint is overall survival and the secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, response rate, pathologic complete response rate and adverse events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoradiotherapy of Capecitabine With or Without Oxaliplatin Versus Cisplatin-5-FU for Esophageal Squamous Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to recruit the patients who were pathologically confirmed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from the Oct 2014. The patients will be divided into three groups.Experimental group 1 : single drug Capecitabine and concurrent radiotherapy.Experimental group 2: Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin and concurrent radiotherapy. Control group:cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil and concurrent radiotherapy. To evaluate the overall survival of the three group. Also observe the patient's progression-free survival, response rate, pathologic complete response rate and adverse events.</detailed_description>
