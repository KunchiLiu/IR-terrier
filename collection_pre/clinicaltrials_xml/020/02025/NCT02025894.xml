	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors for thromboembolic and /or infectious complications in 3,000 patients with solid tumor and receiving a Percutaneous Central Venous Catheter (PCVC). A better understanding of the risk factors for these complications in this population would then allow interventional studies to be proposed to assess the benefit of prophylactic procedures in a sub-group of patients at most risk.</brief_summary>
