	<brief_summary>The primary trial objective is to determine the efficacy of KPT-330 (selinexor) in patients with advanced or metastatic gynaecological cancers by disease control rate (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 12 weeks, assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of KPT-330 (Selinexor) in Female Patients With Advanced Gynaecologic Malignancies &amp; Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two different dosing schedules for ovarian cancer patients. Two additional treatment schedules will be explored in the ovarian cohort to optimize the dosing schedule in a patient population with ovarian carcinoma. Two parallel cohorts of patients with breast carcinoma will also be enrolled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal carcinoma: both platinum refractory and platinum resistant patients, who have received ≥ 1 lines of chemotherapy for relapsed disease (i.e., ≥2 lines of chemotherapy in total). Endometrial carcinoma: patients must have received ≥ 1 line of chemotherapy for relapsed or advanced (stage IV, IIIc) disease. Cervical carcinoma: patients must have received ≥ 1 lines of chemotherapy for relapsed or advanced (stage IVb) disease. Breast cancer: adenocarcinoma of the breast with metastatic or locally advanced disease not amenable to curative resection or any other curative treatment. Breast cancer: Patients must have received ≥ 1 line of endocrine treatment or chemotherapy for metastatic disease as applicable for the respective breast cancer subtype. Breast cancer: Patient must have either triple negative cancer or be hormone receptor positive (i.e., ER+ and/or PR+) and HER2 negative. Must have either measurable disease (RECIST 1.1) or evaluable disease outside irradiated field on CT/MRI. A rise in CA125 or other tumor marker alone is not sufficient. ECOG performance status of 01. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Able to swallow and retain oral medication. Evidence of complete or partial bowel obstruction. Gynecological cancer: All nonepithelial cancers of the ovary, fallopian tube, peritoneum, endometrium or cervix as well as neuroendocrine tumors are excluded. Radiation (except planned or ongoing palliative radiation to bone outside of the region of measurable disease) ≤ 3 weeks prior to C1D1. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy or systemic anticancer therapy ≤ 3 weeks prior to C1D1.</criteria>
