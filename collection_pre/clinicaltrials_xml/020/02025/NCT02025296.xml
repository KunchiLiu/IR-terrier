	<brief_summary>Recently, we generated a new multidisciplinary ubiquitous healthcare system by upgrading our clinical decision supporting system (CDSS) rule engine, and integrating a physical activity-monitoring device and dietary feedback into a comprehensive package. We hypothesize that individualized multidisciplinary u-healthcare service combined with exercise monitoring and dietary feedback will result in better glucose control with less hypoglycemia in an elderly population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use of telemedicine (also known as connected health, e-health, or telehealth) has been proven to be beneficial in chronic disease management. Now, the classic concept of telemedicine has been evolving to ubiquitous (u)-healthcare system with advanced information technologies which provides real-time individualized feedback using a monitoring device attached to the internet or a mobile phone system. A few studies showed that adopting a u-healthcare system helped patients improve their blood glucose control and reduced hypoglycemia or weight gain. In a previous study, supervised telemonitoring was effective for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients in primary care settings. A recent study showed that telemonitoring with pharmacist's help achieved better blood pressure control compared with usual care during 12 months of intervention. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is the key to this system, building up an individualized CDSS rule engine is the crux of the u-healthcare system because current glucose control status, antidiabetic medications, lifestyle, and severity of hypoglycemia vary between individual patients. Recently, our u-healthcare team generated a new multidisciplinary u-healthcare system by upgrading the CDSS rule engine, and integrating a physical activity-monitoring device and dietary feedback into a comprehensive package. With this integrated system, we investigate the effect of individualized multidisciplinary u-healthcare service combined with exercise monitoring and dietary feedback on glucose control with less hypoglycemia in Korean elderly population.</detailed_description>
