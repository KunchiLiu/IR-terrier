	<brief_summary>Getting better sleep in the hospital is especially important due to a variety of adverse health effects that can potentially worsen patient recovery. To address these concerns and improve sleep in US hospitals, we aim to develop the SIESTA (Sleep for Inpatients: Empowering Staff to Act) program as an educational intervention designed to prepare hospital staff to assist patients in obtaining better sleep in hospitals and recognize the importance of screening for sleep disorders. The major educational goals of this proposal is to develop and pilot test an online educational program (SIESTA) which aims to train and motivate medical professionals to provide better sleep for hospitalized patients. We will utilize data from an ongoing sleep study, performed by the research team at the University of Chicago that looks at how adult patients are able to sleep while they are in the hospital, as a means of education for the participating medical staff.</brief_summary>
