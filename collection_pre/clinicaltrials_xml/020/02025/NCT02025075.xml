	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of depth of neuromuscular block (NMB) on global and regional (dependent versus nondependent) respiratory mechanics during laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, we will investigate if the level of NMB influences intraoperative hemodynamic and cerebral oxygenation.</brief_summary>
