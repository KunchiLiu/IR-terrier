	<brief_title>The Effect of Strain-counterstrain on Ankle Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aimed to determine the effect of Strain Counterstrain (SCS) on dynamic balance and subjective sense of instability in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Although many studies have been published on CAI, the cause for this common clinical dysfunction remains inconclusive. No studies have assessed the effectiveness of SCS on CAI. Baseline information on all participants includes a demographic questionnaire, the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM). Participants were randomized into the SCS intervention group or the sham SCS control group. All participants received an intervention (as assigned) once a week for four weeks in addition to performing a prescribed home exercise program. At week four all participants repeated the outcome measures and completed a Global Rating of Change (GROC) form. The primary aim was examined with a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).</detailed_description>
