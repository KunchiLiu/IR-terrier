	<brief_summary>The investigators have previously reported on patient utilization of an eRehab patient education web portal that utilizes streaming, clinician prescribed video instruction to motivate and inform patients in self-care of their orthopedic condition, focusing on the importance of a home exercise program. The greatest barrier to patient use of this web-based home exercise treatment plan was the initial access to the program. The purpose of this study is to compare an Internet-based patient education rehab portal (eRehab) to formal physical therapy (PT) in terms of patient costs and outcomes.</brief_summary>
