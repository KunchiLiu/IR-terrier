	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) compared to placebo in the treatment of participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), who have inadequate glycemic control on maximally or near-maximally effective doses of metformin and sitagliptin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of the Addition of Canagliflozin in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus With Inadequate Glycemic Control on Metformin and Sitagliptin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a study drug, to test whether the study drug has a real effect), multicenter study of efficacy, safety, and tolerability of canagliflozin in participants with T2DM, who have inadequate glycemic (blood sugar) control on maximally or near-maximally effective doses of metformin &gt;=1500 mg/day and sitagliptin 100 mg/day. Approximately 200 participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in 1:1 ratio for 26 weeks. During the study the participants will be also provided with diet and exercise counseling (standardized non-pharmacological therapy).</detailed_description>
