	<brief_title>Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood Therapy in Children With CP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions with abnormal movement and posture resulted from a non-progressive cerebral disturbance. It is the most common cause of motor disability in childhood. Most therapies are palliative rather than restorative. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) may be used as restorative approach for children with CP. Many experimental animal studies have revealed that UCB is beneficial to improve and repair neurological injuries. Based on animal studies and some clinical trials, UCB is suggested as a potential therapy for children with CP. This study was designed to find cytokines relevant to UCB therapy.</detailed_description>
