	<brief_summary>Hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance are associated with severity of fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic hepatitis C. However, clinical significance of steatosis and insulin resistance on fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is not well established. The aim was to investigate the relationship between insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and fibrosis in patients with CHB.</brief_summary>
