	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication) and relative bioavailability (the extent to which a medication or other substance becomes available to the body) of JNJ-56021927 when administered as 7 test tablet formulations of JNJ-56021927 compared with the softgel capsule formulation of JNJ-56021927 in healthy male participants under fasted conditions at a single dose of 240 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Relative Bioavailability of 7 Test Tablet Formulations of JNJ-56021927 With Respect to the Capsule Formulation of JNJ-56021927 in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, 8-treatment, parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time) study. Approximately 120 participants (15 participants in each treatment group) will participate in this study. All participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 8 possible treatments (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H). The study will consist of a screening phase (within 21 days before the first administration of the study medication), a treatment phase with 8 parallel single-dose treatments (8 days); a follow up phase (42 days) and an end-of-study or early withdrawal assessments (Day 57). Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be approximately 78 days.</detailed_description>
