	<brief_summary>- The primary objective of the study was to compare stool composition (stool soap and non-soap fatty acids, total fatty acids, minerals, and other stool constituents) of infants randomized to receive either standard formula, or 1 of 2 innovative formulas containing a new fat blend or the new fat blend plus fiber. - The secondary objectives were to evaluate among the feeding groups, stool characteristics (stool consistency and frequency), GI tolerance assessed by the Infant Gastrointestinal Symptom Questionnaire (IGSQ), and urinary markers (F2-isoprostanes and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG], and urine osmolality and specific gravity). - The primary safety objective was to describe the frequency of adverse events (AEs) among the formula-fed (FF) groups. - The secondary safety objective was to describe anthropometric measures (weight, length, and head circumference) among the feeding groups.</brief_summary>

Formulafed infants were exclusively consuming and tolerating a cow's milk infant formula and parents/LAR must have previously made the decision to continue to exclusively formula feed. Infants receiving any amount of supplemental HM with infant formula feeding or vice versa Family history of siblings with documented cow's milk protein intolerance/allergy Major congenital malformations, suspected or documented systemic or congenital infections, evidence systemic diseases</criteria>
