	<brief_summary>Impaired uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle is a key feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is unclear to what extent impaired insulin uptake from capillaries into skeletal muscle interstitium plays a role in this process. We hypothesize that impaired uptake of insulin from capillaries into skeletal muscle interstitium is involved in impaired glucose uptake by skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
