	<brief_summary>Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy plus intercalated EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) combination therapy with TKI alone therapy as first-line treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Patients with untreated, stage IIIB/IV, EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC will be randomly assigned to combination therapy group (receiving four cycles of docetaxel or pemetrexed (on day 1) plus platinum (on day 1) with intercalated TKI (gefitinib, erlotinib or Icotinib, on day 2-15) every 3 weeks) or TKI alone therapy (gefitinib, erlotinib or Icotinib, daily). All patients were continued to receive TKI until progression or unacceptable to toxicity or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survivial (PFS). Expected results: PFS of combination therapy group will be prolonged to nineteen months while PFS of TKI alone therapy group is ten months. Overall survival (OS) of combination therapy group will be prolonged to 36 months while OS of TKI alone therapy group is 26 months. Hypothesis: Platinum-based chemotherapy plus intercalated TKI combination therapy as first-line treatment will prolong PFS and OS for patients with NSCLC.</brief_summary>
