	<brief_summary>This study is intended to compare the new Carnation patch monitoring system with the Zio patch, which represents the current standard for continuous recording of the ECG over extended periods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Continuous Sternal ECG Patch Monitors (Carnation and Zio) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research is to confirm the clinical value of a new P-wave sensitive recording vector combined with an easy-to-use long-term cardiac rhythm monitoring patch system, the CarnationTM Ambulatory Monitoring (CAM) System. The P-wave is a critical aspect of the electrocardiogram and a key finding for proper arrhythmia diagnosis. The CAM system is optimized for both ease of use and for maximum P-wave clarity for arrhythmia diagnosis.</detailed_description>
