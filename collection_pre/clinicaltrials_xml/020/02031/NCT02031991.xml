	<brief_summary>This study is to prove that the handling (also referred to as pharmacokinetics) of the following drugs PF-06439535, Avastin® (bevacizumab) that is licensed for use in the United States (bevacizumab-US) and Avastin® (bevacizumab) obtained from Europe (bevacizumab-EU) is similar in healthy male volunteers after receiving a single intravenous dose of either drugs. During the course of the study, the similarity in pharmacokinetics will be assessed by sampling the levels of drug in the blood, and by comparing these levels among the different administration arms of PF-06439535, bevacizumab-US and bevacizumab-EU. Safety, tolerability, and immunologic response to the administered drugs will also be evaluated throughout.</brief_summary>
