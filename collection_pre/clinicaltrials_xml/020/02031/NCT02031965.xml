	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the safety of injecting HSV1716 (a new experimental therapy) into or near the tumor resection cavity. The injection will be done at the time of surgery. HSV1716 is a virus that has a gene which has been changed or removed (mutated) in such a way that lets the virus multiply in dividing cells of the tumor and kills the tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether intratumoral/peritumoral injection of HSV1716 (oncolytic HSV-1716) is safe in children with recurrent high-grade gliomas amenable to resection. II. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended Phase II dose of intratumoral/peritumoral injection of HSV1716. III. To describe any dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of intratumoral/peritumoral injection of HSV1716 at the doses given to children with high-grade gliomas. IV. To evaluate changes in tumor enhancement, quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) measures of tumor perfusion (relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV], transfer coefficient [k^trans], fractional blood-plasma volume [Vp] and extravascular extracellular space per unit volume tissue [Ve] values and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) in response to HSV1716 injection. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To measure antiviral immune response in patients with refractory high-grade gliomas injected with HSV1716. II. To measure the systemic viremia and viral shedding following intratumoral/peritumoral administration of HSV1716. III. To preliminarily describe the antitumor activity of HSV1716 injection within the confines of a Phase I study. IV. To evaluate anti-tumor immune cellular and humoral immune responses. V. To evaluate changes in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- positron emission tomography (PET) uptake in response to HSV1716 injection. VI. To evaluate changes in tumor choline values using magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy in response to HSV1716 injection and further delineate from progressive disease versus pseudo-progression post therapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oncolytic HSV-1716 intratumorally (IT) and peritumorally after undergoing surgical tumor resection. Patients also receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) prior to and 6 and 12 hours after surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually for 10 years.</detailed_description>

patients with metastatic disease are not eligible Patients must be those for whom surgical resection is clinically indicated; the intent of surgical resection may include debulking or attempt to resect as much of the tumor as safely feasible; if a gross total or near total resection is not feasible, HSV1716 injection into the wall of the resection cavity, encompassing residual tumor, is permissible Patients must be amenable to receiving 1 dose of HSV1716 intraoperatively with planned HSV1716 injection sites &gt;= 1 cm from the ventricular system AND meet at least one of the criteria below based upon presurgical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Tumor is &gt;= 1 cm from the ventricular system Patients whose tumors that are =&lt; 1 cm from the ventricular system are eligible if there is sufficient space within the tumor cavity and/or residual tumor to perform the HSV 1716 injections that are &gt;= 1 cm from the ventricular system An intraoperative MRI upon resection will confirm the distance of the planned injection sites from the ventricular system prior to the HSV1716 injection; intraoperatively, the neurosurgeon may decide to not inject the HSV1716 or may revise the sites of HSV1716 injection if injection cannot be guaranteed &gt;= 1 cm from the ventricular system; patient will removed from the study if there are not sufficient areas in the tumor cavity to guarantee injection of HSV1716 &gt;= 1 cm from the ventricular system Patients must have received prior therapy other than surgery and must have fully recovered from the acute treatment related toxicities of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study Patients must have received their last dose of known myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy at least three (3) weeks prior to study registration treatment or at least six (6) weeks if nitrosourea Investigational/Biologic agent: Biologic or investigational agent (antineoplastic): Patient must have recovered from any acute toxicity potentially related to the agent and received their last dose of the investigational or biologic agent &gt;= 7 days prior to study registration For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur Monoclonal antibody treatment: At least three halflives must have elapsed prior to registration;
