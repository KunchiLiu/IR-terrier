	<brief_summary>This phase I study will examine the pharmacokinetics and safety of Onartuzumab (MetMAb) in chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Patients will be divided into 3 cohorts, which will each be given a different dose of MetMAb. The cohorts will be treated sequentially, starting with the lowest dose. MetMAb will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Patients may be treated for up to 16 cycles (21 days each) or 1 year, whichever occurs first, in the absence of disease progression.</brief_summary>
