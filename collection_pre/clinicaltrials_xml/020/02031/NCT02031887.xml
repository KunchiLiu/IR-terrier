	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this trial are: - to show differences in the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract with the bacteria Bifidobacterium sp. between infants born by normal or caesarean delivery, fed with the test or a control product - to investigate whether there is equivalence in growth between the four different groups of infant described above. Design: This is a controlled, double blind, randomized, multi center, clinical trial of 4 groups in parallel. Two groups of infants (born from normal or caesarean delivery) will each consume one of 2 milk formulae. Number of patients (to be enrolled / to be analyzed): Approximately 450 / 240 Stratification will be done by gender and delivery mode.
