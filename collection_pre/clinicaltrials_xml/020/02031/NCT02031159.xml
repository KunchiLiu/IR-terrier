	<brief_summary>Hypothermia is common in patients undergoing general anesthesia. There have been several negative outcomes reported. Zero heat flux is a non-invasive method for measurement of body core temperature. The aim of this study is to see if this method is comparable in terms of correlation, accuracy, precision and practicability to commonly used sublingual and nasopharyngeal temperature monitoring.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothermia is common in patients undergoing general anesthesia. There have been several negative outcomes reported such as bleeding, infection rate, cardiac complications, prolonged wound healing and patient discomfort. Zero heat flux is a non-invasive method for measurement of body core temperature. The aim of this study is to see if this method is comparable in terms of correlation, accuracy, precision and practicability to commonly used sublingual and nasopharyngeal temperature monitoring. Measurements are performed with the SpotOnÂ® sensor by Arizant Healthcare, Inc..</detailed_description>
