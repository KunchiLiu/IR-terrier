	<brief_summary>The purpose of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of a new Cardiac Vascular Reconstruction (CAVAREC, Siemens Medical Systems, Germany) image reconstruction algorithm for use during transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI) procedures. CAVAREC utilizes the same x-ray projection images as currently acquired for clinical DynaCT. X-ray image acquisition to allow CAVAREC will occur during the TAVI procedure and after the TAVI device is implanted. If you already have a surgically-implanted TAVI device and are having a cardiac catheterization, then an extra set of images will be acquired after your clinical care is complete, but before you leave the procedure room. The CAVAREC image processing algorithm will be implemented on an off-line workstation after the TAVI procedure is complete. After the TAVI procedure, CAVAREC images will be quantitatively and qualitatively compared to Siemens DynaCT and cardiac CT images from Radiology. The results of this study will be used to direct further development of CAVAREC toward the end goal of providing improved imaging capabilities to guide TAVI procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Vascular Reconstruction DynaCT for TAVI Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Compare utility of CAVAREC to standard DynaCT and cardiac CT for clinical assessment of the aortic valve and relevant, nearby anatomical structures. 2. Investigate the utility of CAVAREC to assess calcification within and surrounding the native aortic valve. 3. Investigate the utility of CAVAREC to assess procedural success, including prosthetic valve placement and annular anatomic correlates of paravalvular leak. 4. Validate utility of CAVAREC for images acquired during normal sinus rhythm.</detailed_description>
