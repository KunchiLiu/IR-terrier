	<brief_title>Geriatrics Balance and Low Back Pain Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study uses a randomized controlled research design and will enroll up to three hundred patients. Treatment will take place in outpatient facilities. It is hypothesized that among older adults with low back pain manual therapy will reduce low back pain and improve balance more than physical therapy; and that among older adults without low back pain manual therapy and physical therapy will be equally efficacious in improving balance. The results of this study will help to further define effective treatment protocols.</detailed_description>
