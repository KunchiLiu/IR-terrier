	<brief_summary>Gait dysfunction often occurs following stroke, neurological or musculoskeletal disease, injury and surgery. One of the consequences of such deficit is an increased risk of fall and injury. A gait training regime that incorporates controlled perturbation has been found to reduce falls in elderly population but the effectiveness of such training has yet to be studied. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of specific controlled dynamic perturbation training, during gait, on gait rehabilitation, fear of falling and falling with gait impaired individuals. Perturbation will be performed using a specifically designed system that provides small, controlled and unpredictable perturbations during treadmill walking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Controlled-perturbation Gait Training on Gait Rehabilitation and Fear of Falling in Individuals With Gait Impairments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 100 adults with gait dysfunction will be enrolled, evaluated and trained. They will be randomly assigned to two groups: perturbation training group and balance exercises group. Both groups will receive standard physiotherapy treatments. No gender based differences are expected so we will be able to pool male and female individuals for this analysis. Each subject of the experimental and of the control groups will be trained on 12 occasions over a period of 10-12 weeks (15 minutes, 2-3 times/week) in addition to standard care physiotherapy. Gait, balance function and fear of falling will be tested in both groups before, immediately after, 3 and 6 months after completion of the training period to explore the benefit of training.</detailed_description>
