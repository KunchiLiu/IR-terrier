	<brief_summary>It has been demonstrated that successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation may be effective in preventing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, the effectiveness of only isthmus ablation on atrial fibrillation itself is unclear.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Cavotricuspid Isthmus Ablation in Patients Without History of Typical Flutter During Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers hypothesized that an organized activation pattern around the tricuspid annulus during atrial fibrillation indicated a mother reentrant circuit that could be terminated by a cavocaval isthmus ablation, thus preventing atrial fibrillation. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effectiveness of isthmus ablation in preventing atrial fibrillation and to identify predictors of its success.</detailed_description>
