	<brief_summary>The purpose of this current prospective study is to assess the effects of body weight support treadmill training (BWSTT) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Training intervention aim at improving: quality of life, walking capability, spasticity, functions in every day life, bone mass density and related hematological factors. The examination consisted of (1) neurological classification by ASIA standard neurological classification of spinal cord injury working sheet, (2) spasticity evaluation of lower limbs by Modified Ashworth Scale, (3) walking independence evaluation by Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI II), (4) patient's quality of life perspective by World Health Quality of Life- BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), (5) the functional status by 10-item Modified Barthel Index, (6) bone mass density (BMD) by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, (7) body tissue consistency by full body DXA scan, (8) skeletal system health associated blood factors (calcitonin, osteocalcin, 25 OH vitamin D, 1,25- (OH)2 vitamin D, ostase and parathyroid hormone) by hematological tests. The results will be collected and evaluated using statistical software (i.e. SPSS).</brief_summary>
