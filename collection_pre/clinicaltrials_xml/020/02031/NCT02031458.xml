	<brief_summary>This multicenter, single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Atezolizumab in participants with PD-L1-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Participants will receive Atezolizumab 1200 milligrams (mg) intravenously every 3 weeks as long as participants are experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, that is , in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression.</brief_summary>
