	<brief_title>Comparison of the Effects of a 12-Week Consumption of Two Carbonated Beverages on Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sweeteners are natural or synthetic sugar substitutes which provide a sweetness taste to drink and food with few or no additional calories. Sweeteners are widely used in commercialized beverages. Despite some debate, no significant toxicity was demonstrated at a reasonable level of consumption (less than 20 cans per day). However little data is available on the metabolic effects of a regular consumption of beverages containing sweeteners. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a regular consumption (twice a day for 12 weeks) of a carbonated drink with sweeteners, in a normal diet, compared with unsweetened sparkling water on insulin sensitivity in healthy normoweight and overweight subjects.</detailed_description>
