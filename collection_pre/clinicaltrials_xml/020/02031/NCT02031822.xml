	<brief_summary>Headache is one of the most common reasons for patients to access healthcare. Greater occipital nerve (GON) block with local anesthetic and steroid has been described for the management of primary headache refractory to conventional treatment. Two ultrasound (US)-guided techniques for greater occipital nerve (GON) block have been described for the management of refractory headache syndromes: a proximal technique performed at the level of the second cervical vertebra and a distal technique performed at the level of the superior nuchal line. Our airm is to compare the accuracy, efficacy and safety of these two techniques in patients with refractory headaches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two US-guided Techniques for Greater Occipital Nerve Blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conducted a double-blinded, randomized control trial to compare accuracy, efficacy and safety of these two techniques in patients with refractory headache syndromes. Following REB approval, 40 patients with moderate or severe refractory headaches (intensity score&gt;4/10) will be randomized to the "proximal" or "distal" groups with a 1:1 allocation. Each patient receives an injection of 2ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with 40mg of methylprednisolone. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in intensity scores for headache at one month after the interventions. Outcomes related to efficacy (numbness immediately after the injection, reduction in episodes of severe headache, sleep quality), performance (time taken for and discomfort during procedure), and safety (incidence of hematoma, intravascular injection) are measured after one month.</detailed_description>
