	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Males aged 18 to 60 years A history of competitive triathlon performance (≥ 2 years) Participation in at least four competitive triathlon events within the past 2 years Be in regular training for triathlon events A personal best time for a standard ½ Ironman race (1.9 km swim, 90 km cycle, 21.1 km run) in the last year of either: ≤ 6 h 00 min, for men aged 1840 years or ≤6 h 05 min for men aged 4050 years or ≤6 h 20 min for men aged 5060 years Alternatively, if not competed in ½ Ironman in the last year, at least one standard distance triathlon (1.5 km swim, 40 km cycle, 10 km run) within the last 12 months: ≤2 h 13 min, for men aged 1840 years or ≤2 h 18 min for men aged 4050 years or ≤2 h 23 min for men aged 5060 years Available to compete in the ½ Ironman events and complete all study requirements Experienced in using carbohydrate supplementation, as gels, bars, and drinks in training/racing, specifically at rates ≥6090g/h) Experience of specific formulations may include both or only multiple and single transportable carbohydrates, thus a full assessment would be made prior to recruitment to ensure balance during randomization and account for any association with the primary outcome Obtained his (or his legal representative's) informed consent.
