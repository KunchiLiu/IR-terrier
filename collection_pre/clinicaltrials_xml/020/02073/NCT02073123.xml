	<brief_summary>To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the established dose of indoximod in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition as measured by the best overall response rate (ORR) (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR))across both standard of care agents administered sequentially in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of IDO Inhibitor in Combination With Checkpoint Inhibitors for Adult Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of melanoma is increasing. Based upon data obtained between 2004 and 2006, the lifetime probability of developing melanoma in the United States is estimated to be 1 in 37 for men and 1 in 56 for women. In the United States, melanoma is the fifth leading cancer in men and the seventh in women. Locally confined, fully-resectable disease may be curable with current therapy; but Stage IV metastatic disease (or relapsed/recurrent disease) is highly refractory to therapy. Thus, experimental clinical trials provide an accepted treatment option for metastatic or relapsed/refractory melanoma. The current study is designed as a prospective trial to evaluate the combination of indoximod and checkpoint inhibitors in adult patients with metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab will be used at the recommended approved doses for this indication. The current trial will be done in two phases: a Phase 1b dose escalation of indoximod in combination with ipilimumab, starting at half the recommended single-agent dose, to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose for the combination. This will be followed by a three arm expansion study testing a fixed dose of indoximod (at the recommended Phase 2 dose) combined with standard-dose ipilimumab, pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigational or commercial cancer directed agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered. Safety assessment will follow the guidelines provided in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version.4.03. Patients will be followed both clinically and radiographically starting 12 weeks after initiation of treatment then every 8 weeks for tumor evaluation. Post-treatment scans will be compared to the baseline scan and responses will be assessed based using mWHO and immune related response criteria (irRC) described by Wolchok et al. (Wolchok et al., 2009).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as lesions that can be accurately measure in in 2 perpendicular diameters with at least one diameter &gt; 20mm and the other &gt;10mm on conventional CT or MRI or 10mm x 10 mm by spiral CT. No systemic treatment in the previous 28 days. Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of ipilimumab or indoximod in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study. ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60% ) Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following laboratory values : Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL INR ≤ 2 x ULN Potassium, calcium, magnesium ≤ Grade 1 per CTCAE Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum Bilirubin, amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN (in patients with known Gilbert Syndrome, total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN, with direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN) AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN (or ≤ 5.0 x ULN if hepatic metastases are present) Serum Albumin ≥ 3 g/dL Patients must have normal pituitary function as defined below: free T4, TSH within normal institutional limits ACTH within normal institutional limits Patients with known brain metastases will only be eligible after their tumors have been treated with definitive resection and/or radiotherapy and they are neurologically stable for at least 1 month off steroids. The effects of indoximod on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because indoximod may affect maternal immune tolerance of the fetus, sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree to use two forms of contraception (hormonal and barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Use of contraception or abstinence should continue for a minimum of 1 month after completion of the study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should discontinue the study drug and inform her treating physician immediately. A pregnancy test is required prior to study enrollment and monthly while on treatment with indoximod for all women of childbearing potential. Also men should be discouraged from fathering children while on treatment. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients who have had molecular targeted therapy (including vemurafenib) or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients who have had prior therapy with immune checkpoint inhibition or or indoximod are excluded from the trial. Pretreatment with other immune modulators is allowed in the phase 1 component of the study only. For the Phase II component, patients are excluded if they have had prior therapy with or immunestimulating agents including interleukin2, interferons, CTLA4 or PD1 antagonists, CD40 or CD137 agonist, or cancer therapeutic vaccines in any prior line for metastatic disease. Interferons used in the adjuvant setting are allowed (Phase 1 or 2 component). Patients with known active, uncontrolled brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ipilimumab or tryptophan containing substances. This would include Ltryptophan or 5hydroxytryptophan supplements. Also patients with a history of known hypersensitivity reactions to mouse or humanized monoclonal antibodies are excluded. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection (especially toxoplasmosis, which could potentially be worsened by indoximod (Divanovic et al., 2012)), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because indoximod is an immunoregulatory agent with the potential for abortifacient effects due to fetal rejection by the maternal immune system. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with indoximod, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with indoximod. Known HIVpositive patients and those with other acquired/inherited immunodeficiencies are ineligible due the possibility of affecting the response to indoximod, and the higher risk of active opportunistic infections. Any other cancer, unless the patient has been diseasefree for ≥5 years (except treated and cured basalcell or squamouscell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or bladder and treated localized prostate cancer with undetectable PSA for 2 years). Patients with laboratory evidence of pancreatitis are excluded. Patients with autoimmune disease (e.g., psoriasis, extensive atopic dermatitis, asthma, IBD, M.S., uveitis, vasculitis), chronic inflammatory condition, or any condition requiring concurrent use of any systemic immunosuppressants or steroids for any reason are excluded from the study. Patients with isolated vitiligo remain eligible. Any patient with an allotransplant of any kind would be excluded as well, including xenograft heart valve. Mild, intermittent asthma requiring only occasional betaagonist inhaler use or mild localized eczema will not be excluded. Chronic use of immunesuppressive drugs (ie, systemic corticosteroids used in the management of cancer or noncancer related illnesses, eg, COPD). Patients who are receiving any other investigational agent.</criteria>
