	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-120 in advanced solid tumors, including glioma, that harbor an IDH1 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-120 to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is a dose expansion phase where four arms of patients will receive AG-120 to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs or at Investigator discretion.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key 1. Dose Escalation 1. Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, IDH1 genemutated advanced solid tumors, including glioma, that have recurred or progressed following standard therapy, or that have not responded to standard therapy. 2. Subjects must have evaluable disease by RECIST v1.1 for subjects without glioma or by RANO criteria for subjects with glioma. 2. Dose Expansion: Cholangiocarcinoma 1. Subjects must have histologicallyconfirmed diagnosis of IDH1 genemutated cholangiocarcinoma Stage II, III, or IV (intrahepatic, extrahepatic and perihilar) that is not eligible for curative resection, transplantation, or ablative therapies. Tumors of mixed histology are not allowed. 2. Cholangiocarcinoma subjects must have progressed following gemcitabinebased regimen. 3. Cholangiocarcinoma subjects must have radiographically measurable disease in at least one site not previously treated with radiation, chemoembolization, radioembolization, or other local ablative procedures; a new area of tumor progression within or adjacent to a previouslytreated lesion, if clearly measurable by a radiologist, is acceptable. 3. Dose Expansion: Chondrosarcoma a. Subjects must have IDH1 genemutated chondrosarcoma that is either locally advanced or metastatic and not amenable to complete surgical excision. 4. Dose Expansion: Nonenhancing Glioma 1. Subjects must have progressive glioma that is solely nonenhancing on MRI. 2. Progression of glioma must have occurred over 12 months or less. 3. Subject must have available at least 3 prior full sets of scans (not including screening), each separated by at least 2 months with less than or equal to 5 mm slice thickness and up to 1 mm interslice gap on either 2D T2 weighted image, 3D T2 weighted image, or FLAIR. 4. Subjects must not have had prior surgery (biopsy allowed) or radiation therapy within 6 months of enrollment. 5. Dose Expansion: Solid Tumors Not Otherwise Eligible for the Cholangiocarcinoma, Chondrosarcoma, or Nonenhancing Glioma Cohorts 1. IDH1 genemutated solid tumors refractory to conventional therapy or the subject does not tolerate the conventional therapy 2. Subjects must have radiographically measurable disease in at least one site not previously treated with radiation, chemoembolization, radioembolization, or other local ablative procedures; a new area of tumor progression within or adjacent to a previouslytreated lesion, if clearly measurable by a radiologist, is acceptable. 6. Subject must be ≥18 years of age. 7. Subjects must have documented IDH1 genemutated disease based on local test evaluation. (Centralized testing will be performed retrospectively.) 8. Subjects must be amenable to serial peripheral blood sampling, urine sampling, and biopsies during the study. 9. Subject must be able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent. A legally authorized representative may consent on behalf of a subject who is otherwise unable to provide informed consent, if acceptable to and approved by the site and/or site's Institutional Review Board (IRB). 10. Subjects must have ECOG PS of 0 to 1. 11. Subjects must have expected survival of ≥3 months. 12. Subjects must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by: 1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 ×109/L; 2. Hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dL (Subjects are allowed to be transfused to this level) 3. Platelets ≥ 75 × 109/L. 13. Subjects must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by: 1. Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to Gilbert's disease or disease involvement following approval by the Medical Monitor; 2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤2.5 × ULN. For subjects with bone metastases and/or suspected diseaserelated liver or biliary involvement, ALP must be ≤5 × ULN. 14. Subjects must have adequate renal function as evidenced by: a. Serum creatinine ≤2.0 × ULN OR b. Creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min based on the CockroftGault glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation: (140 Age) x (weight in kg) x (0.85 if female)/72 x serum creatinine 15. Subjects must be recovered from any clinically relevant toxic effects of any prior surgery, radiotherapy, or other therapy intended for the treatment of cancer. (For example, subjects with residual Grade 1 toxicity or stable Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy due to prior chemotherapy are allowed with approval of the Medical Monitor.) 16. Female subjects with reproductive potential must agree to undergo medically supervised pregnancy test prior to starting study drug. The first pregnancy test will be performed at screening (within 7 days prior to first study drug administration), and on the day of the first study drug administration and confirmed negative prior to dosing. Subjects with reproductive potential are defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal occlusion or who have not been naturally postmenopausal (i.e., who have not menstruated at all) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Females of reproductive potential, as well as fertile men and their partners who are female of reproductive potential, must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse or to use two highly effective forms of contraception from the time of giving informed consent, during the study and for 90 days (females and males) following the last dose of AG120. A highly effective form of contraception is defined as hormonal oral contraceptives, injectables, patches, intrauterine devices, doublebarrier method (e.g., synthetic condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), or male partner sterilization. 1. Subjects who received systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy &lt;21 days prior to their first day of study drug administration. 2.

Subjects with right bundle branch block and a prolonged QTc interval should be reviewed by the Medical Monitor for potential inclusion. 14. Subjects taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval (see Section 9.11.3). 15. Subjects with known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B or C. 16.
