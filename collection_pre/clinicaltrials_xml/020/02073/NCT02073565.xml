	<brief_title>HARMONEE - Japan-USA Harmonized Assessment by Randomized, Multi-Center Study of OrbusNEich's Combo StEnt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 50 sites are proposed in Japan and the United States to enroll 286 subjects (271 evaluable) in each of 2 arms, for a total sample size of 572 subjects (542 evaluable) who are admitted to the hospital for a planned (elective and urgent) percutaneous coronary artery intervention procedure. After stent implantation, subjects will be contacted for follow-up at 30 days; 6 months; and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. At 12 months a clinical evaluation will be completed before cardiac catheterization and angiographic assessment. Rationale: This study is intended to demonstrate that the Combo stent platform shows superiority to an imputed BMS performance goal, noninferior effectiveness and safety vs best-in-class second-generation everolimus-eluting stent (EES) (Xience V, Xience Prime, Xience Xpedition stents; [Abbott Vascular/Abbott Vascular Japan]), and evidence of mechanistic activity of the anti-CD34-Ab EPC capture technology with healthy level of intimal tissue coverage superior to that of the best-in-class EES. To ensure the robustness and interpretability of results, the current proposal includes a number of unique design features: - Largest randomized DES study ever performed in Japan - Enriched population, including stabilized non-STEMI (NSTEMI) subjects with greater likelihood of plaque rupture associated with their clinical syndromes - Collaboration between with Japan and the United States as a "Proof of Concept" program under the auspices of the Harmonization by Doing Initiative, WG 1, including concomitant enrollment in U.S.A. sites as an FDA-approved IDE study - Head-to-head randomization against state-of-the-art EES platform control, analyzed for clinical noninferiority - Statistical analysis vs imputed BMS analyzed for clinical superiority - Fractional flow reserve (FFR) follow-up of 100% of subjects enrolled, providing clinically relevant physiologic assessment of all subjects for 1 year ischemia-driven TVR analysis - Mechanistic OCT imaging observations in 140 subjects using 6 French catheters as follows: - Cohort A (30 subjects, 1:1 Combo and EES): Mechanistic imaging observations to provide serial 6 month and 1 year OCT evaluation of healthy intimal tissue coverage, intracoronary thrombosis, and stent malapposition and quantitative coronary angiographic (QCA) analysis to assess 1 year late loss. - Cohort B (110 subjects, 1:1 Combo and EES): Mechanistic imaging observations to assess 1 year OCT evaluation of healthy intimal tissue coverage, intracoronary thrombosis, and stent malapposition, and QCA analysis to assess 1 year late loss. Combined with the 12 month imaging of Cohort A, this study will provide OCT and QCA observations at 1 year in 140 patients, half with Combo and half with EES. - Cohort C: 432 subjects (216 subjects per arm) will undergo all clinical follow-up assessments with FFR and angiographic assessments at 12 months. Cohort C will be the last cohort to enroll. - In the 110 subjects in Cohort B, 30 day and 1 year human antimurine antibody (HAMA) titers will also be collected.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria To be eligible for this trial, subjects must meet all of the following criteria: 1. Subject is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits, and treatment alternatives of Combo vs EES stent, and the subject or a legally authorized representative (LAR) must provide written informed consent before any studyrelated procedures are performed. 2. Subject must be at least 20 years of age at the time of randomization. 3. Subject must have clinical or functional evidence of myocardial ischemia (eg, stable or unstable angina, stabilized nonSTelevation MI confirmed by serum markers, ischemia by positive functional study, abnormal FFR, or a reversible change in the electrocardiogram [ECG] consistent with ischemia). 4. Subject must be acceptable candidate with anatomy suitable for PCI with a DES. 5. Subject agrees to return for all studyrelated followup assessments, including invasive OCT followup assessment at 6 months (Cohort A) and at 1 year postprocedure (Cohorts A, B, and C). 6. Subject is an acceptable candidate for CABG surgery. Angiographic Anatomy Criteria— 7. Target lesions must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated diameter of 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm, inclusive, and up to 3 de novo target lesions may be treated, with a maximum of 2 de novo target lesions per epicardial vessel, with a maximum of 2 target vessels. 8. Target lesions should be treatable with a single stent, and must measure 28 mm or less in length by visual estimation (2 mm or more of nondiseased tissue on either side of the target lesion should be covered by the study stent). 9. If more than 1 target lesion will be treated, the reference vessel diameter and lesion length of each target lesion must meet the above criteria. 10. Target lesions must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated stenosis of 50% or greater and less than 100% with a TIMI flow of 1 or greater. 11. Previous percutaneous intervention of lesions in a target vessel (including side branches) is allowed if done 9 or more months before the study procedure and greater than 10 mm from the current target lesion. 12. Nonstudy percutaneous interventions for lesions in a nontarget vessel are allowed if done 9 or more months before the study procedure, in the absence of documented ischemia or angiographic restenosis related to the vessel. Exclusion Criteria If a subject meets any of the following criteria, he or she may not be enrolled in the study: 1. STEMI at index presentation or within 7 days of study screening. 2. Subject has current unstable arrhythmias or intractable angina with ECG changes or shock requiring pressors or mechanical assist device (intraaortic balloon pump, left ventricular assist device, Impella, etc.). 3.
