	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate point accuracy of the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring (GM) System interstitial glucose results against Reader capillary Blood Glucose (BG) reference using the Consensus Error Grid. During the course of the wear duration, the subject is required to test fingerstick glucose measurement at least eight (8) times a day for capillary reference glucose measurements and three in-clinic visits of a maximum 13 hours each for venous reference glucose measurements. With every reference measurement, the subject or study staff will perform a measurement on the System.</brief_summary>
