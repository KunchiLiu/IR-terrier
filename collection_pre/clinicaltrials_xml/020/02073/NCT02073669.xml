	<brief_summary>The aim of study is to evaluate the prevalence of latent TB in second generation immigrants from countries with high incidence of tuberculosis (above 20 of 100,000) compare to the control native Israelis without a family member who was born in a country with high incidence of tuberculosis. Using study questionnaire IGRA and tuberculin skin test the investigators expect that the second generation immigrants group will have more positive IGRA test than the control native group.</brief_summary>
