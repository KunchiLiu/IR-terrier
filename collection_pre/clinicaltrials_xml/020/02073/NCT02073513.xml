	<brief_summary>BACKROUNDS: Thumb in palm deformity restricts hand function by prevent somatosensory input in the children with cerebral palsy who have spasticity in their hands. OBJECTİVES: To investigate the effects of thenar palmar kinesiotape application with and without pressure on hand function in children with cerebral palsy. METHOD: 45 children were randomly allocated to one of the thenar taping groups either with or without pressure or to the control group. Nine hole peg test and nine parts puzzle test were used to measure hand function. The two study groups were evaluated initially, with taping 20 minutes later and 20 minutes after taping was removed.</brief_summary>
