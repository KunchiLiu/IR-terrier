	<brief_title>Effects of Infant Formula on the Growth and Tolerance in Preterm/Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stage 1: In hospital, preterm/low birth weight infants less than or equal to 34 weeks gestational age at birth, birth weight of ≥ 1000g to &lt;1800g and conditions meeting the enrollment criteria will be fed formula with or without parenteral nutrition until discharge. Stage 2: Post-discharge, all infants with birth weight &lt; or =1500g will be followed on formula per standard of care and accepted standard of care including feeding until the infant's weight &gt;or= 25th percentile of growth expectation based on corrected age (P25) or until infant reaches 9 months corrected age.</detailed_description>
