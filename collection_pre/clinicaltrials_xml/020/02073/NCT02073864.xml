	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Neuro-embolic Consequences of TAVR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, multi-center study enrolling a minimum of 20 up to a maximum of 80 patients at up to six investigational sites in the United States and European Union. Patients meeting eligibility criteria for TAVR will be enrolled to undergo diffusion-weighted MRI brain imaging pre-procedure (optional) and post-procedure and neuropsychological testing pre- and post-procedure, and at 30 days of follow-up.</detailed_description>

Patients undergoing TAVR via the transaxillary, subclavian, or direct aortic route Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to index procedure per site standard test. Patients with known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours preceding the index procedure (according to definition) or AMI &gt;72 hours preceding the index procedure, in whom creatine kinase and creatine kinase have not returned to within normal limits at the time of procedure. Patients who are currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with new onset AMI, such as nitrateunresponsive prolonged chest pain. Patients with impaired renal function (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate] &lt;30, calculated from serum creatinine by the CockcroftGault formula). Patients with a platelet count of &lt;100.000 cells/mm³ or &gt; 700.000 cells/mm³ or a white blood cell&lt; 3000 cells/mm³ within 7 days prior to index procedure or per standard local practice. Patients with a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, or who will refuse transfusion. Patients who have received any organ transplant or are on a waiting list for any organ transplant. Patients with known other medical illness or known history of substance abuse that may cause noncompliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a life expectancy of less than one year. Patients with known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin/bivalirudin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, nitinol, stainless steel alloy, and/or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated. Patients with a history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the prior 6 months. Patients with an active peptic ulcer or history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 6 months. Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock. Patients with documented friable or mobile atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic arch. Patients with contraindication to cerebral MRI.
