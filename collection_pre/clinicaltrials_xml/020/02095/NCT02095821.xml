	<brief_summary>Plasma exchange is a frequently used therapy in many antibody-mediated disorders, such as humoral rejection after kidney transplantation. Treatment frequency is adjusted to daily measured fibrinogen blood levels to prevent bleeding complications. However, data about the correlation of fibrinogen blood levels and function of the coagulation system during plasma exchange therapy is scarce. In the present study we examine blood fibrinogen levels and coagulation factors as well as thrombin clotting time in patients under plasma exchange therapy.</brief_summary>
