	<criteria>1. Subject has a systolic blood pressure â‰¥ 140 mmHg based on an average of 3 office blood pressure readings measured according to the BP guidelines. 2. Subject is adhering to a stable drug regimen of at least 3 different classes of antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic (with no changes for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to enrollment) at optimal dose and is expected to be maintained for at least 6 months. 3. Subject is &gt; 18 and &lt; 85 years of age. 4. Subject agrees to have all study procedures performed, and is competent and willing to provide written, informed consent to participate in this study. Key 1. A secondary cause of hypertension, e.g. "white coat" hypertension (assessed by 24 h ABPM at physician's discretion), primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, renal artery stenosis, drug inducedhypertension, Adult Polycystic kidney Disease, renal cell carcinoma, pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, coarctation of the aorta, acromegaly, Cushing's Syndrome, Conn's (primary hyperaldosteronism), polyarteritis nodosum, systemic sclerosis, parenchymal kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnoea based on a workup performed within the 12 months preceding enrollment. 2. Subject has aortoiliofemoral artery anatomy not suitable for treatment with the investigational device(s). 3. Subject has main renal arteries that are &lt; 20 mm in length or &lt; 4 mm in diameter. 4. Subject has a prior history of any renal artery intervention including but not limited to balloon angioplasty, stenting, renal denervation or surgery. 5. Subject has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt; 45mL/min/1.73m2, using the MDRD formula. 6. Subject has type 1 diabetes mellitus. 7. Subject has history of Myocardial Infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or a cerebrovascular accident in the 6 months period prior to enrolment, or documented widespread atherosclerosis, intravascular thrombosis or unstable plaques. 8. Subject has hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease for which reduction of blood pressure would be considered hazardous.</criteria>
