	<brief_summary>Radioopaque fiducial markers or electro-magnetic transponders will be implanted into or in close proximity of the tumor. During a radiotherapy treatment session image and/or signal acquisition will be performed by ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or by specialized signal detectors The data will help to characterize tumor and organ motion during one treatment session which may in fact have impact on dose distribution</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Intrafractional Motion of Liver Tumors Using Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the development of more conformal and precise radiation techniques such as Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), patients with hepatic tumors could be treated with high local doses by sparing normal liver tissue. However, frequently occurring large HCC tumors are still representing a dosimetric challenge in spite of modern high sophisticated RT modalities. This interventional clinical study has been set up to evaluate the value of different fiducial markers, and to use the modern imaging methods for further treatment optimization using physical and informatics approaches.Radioopaque fiducial markers or electro-magnetic transponders will be implanted into or in close proximity of the tumor.
