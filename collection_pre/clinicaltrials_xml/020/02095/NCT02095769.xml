	<brief_summary>The goal of the POETRY Registry is to determine whether data from Pharmacogenomic (PGx) Testing for elderly and disabled patients can help physicians manage patient medication regimens and assess if the testing has an effect on reducing adverse drug events, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits. The way an individual processes or metabolizes a drug is in part determined by their genes, and there is known to be genetic variation from one human to another. The study of the way in which genes affect an individual's response to drugs is known as "Pharmacogenomics."</brief_summary>
