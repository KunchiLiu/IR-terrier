	<brief_summary>The prehospital resources are limited. The emergency medical dispatch center (EMDC) is manned by qualified health care personnel around the clock. The investigators believe that the EMDC is an unexploited resource in the prehospital treatment of patients. By the use of videoconferencing the investigators will activate this resource. Mobile videoconferencing between ambulances and physician at the EMDC enables patient consultation at a distance. Video consultation between patient and the physician at the EMDC can take place when the patient is at home or in the ambulance. The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of video consultation between physicians at the EMDC and patients receiving treatment by ambulance personnel on the number of patients receiving final treatment on-site in the pre hospital setting.</brief_summary>
