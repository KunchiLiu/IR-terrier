	<brief_summary>The following is an open label, non comparative, pilot study of palliative treatment as a second, third line or more of treatment in patients with recurrent, persistent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer; it has a limited sample of 15 patients with the primary goal of evaluating the response (defined as: Complete, partial or stable disease) to treatment with a Monoclonal Antibody, Nimotuzumab, on a weekly basis + CDDP 50mg/m2/BSA as a single agent every 3 weeks for patients with good renal function (Creatinine clearance =&gt; 60) or Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2/BSA in patients with renal failure (Creatinine clearance &lt;60). Secondary objectives consist of evaluating disease-free survival, overall survival and assess patient tolerance to treatment with Nimotuzumab.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnostic criteria: Female patients in whom a diagnosis of cervical cancer of epithelial origin has been confirmed by histologic and/or radiologic assessment. Said patients must be in relapse or persistency after receiving first line chemoradiotherapy and one or more lines of palliative chemotherapy. Karnofsky score of 80 or more. A CT scan will be performed in all patients to assess measurable target lesions. The clinical diagnosis must be evaluated by more than clinical investigator Patients who give their written consent of participation in this study. Patients with recurrent or persistent cervicaluterine cancer, with local and/or systemic disease with measurable lesions, whether by physical examination, CT Scan or MRI detected at least in the previous 6 weeks. If there is only one lesion and it is less than 10 mm in length, a biopsy confirmation is required. Patients currently receiving a second, third line or more of palliative chemotherapy diagnosed at least 30 days after the last chemotherapy. Patients with one of the following Histopathological reports: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (epidermoid carcinoma), adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or glassy cell carcinoma. Patients must be older than 18 years old. ECOG score no worst than 3. Patients with life expectancy greater than 4 weeks. Patients with left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50 measured by radioisotopic ventriculography. Patients who meet all previous criteria with previously radiated metastatic disease in the central nervous system will be included. Patients with normal functioning of the bone marrow and other organs as defined by the following parameters: Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/L Leucocytes ≥ 4000/microL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/microL Platelet count ≥ 100000/microL Total serum Bilirubin: up to 1.5 times the normal value Total Proteins: Within normal limits AST and ALT =/&lt; 2.5 times the normal superior limit of the institutional laboratory Serum creatinine: within normal limits or up to 2 mg and GFR ≥ 60ml/min calculated with the CockcroftGault equation. Pregnant or nursing mothers. Patients with cervicaluterine cancer with a histopathological report of: small cell carcinoma and/or neuroendocrine tumor. Patients currently receiving another investigational oncospecific drug. Patients with a history of allergy to chemical substances with similar chemical composition to that of the monoclonal antibody or chemotherapeutic agents used in this study. Patients with noncontrolled comorbid states such as active infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmias, uncompensated diabetes and/or psychiatric illness. Presence of a second tumor. With the exception of those patients who have received adequate treatment for skin carcinomas (basal or squamous). Previous or concomitant malignancy except nonmelanoma skin carcinoma. Social, familiar or geographic conditions that suggest poor attachment to the study. Discontinuation of treatment criteria: At the patient´s request. Progression of disease causing worsening of the patient´s overall status in non manageable clinical conditions, (ECOG worst than 3). Death. Discontinuation of monitoring and/or loss of patient followup for more than 2 months. Severe adverse reaction grade 4 according to CTCAE.</criteria>
