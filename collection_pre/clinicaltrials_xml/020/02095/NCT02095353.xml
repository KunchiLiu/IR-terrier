	<criteria>Subjects with brain tumors will be enrolled. These subjects may be newly diagnosed, undergoing treatment or undergoing followup. If a subject has undergone surgery or treatment they should have what appears to be residual tumor. Renal failure (GFR &lt;45). Subjects will be screened utilizing UNMC gadolinium contrast guidelines. Allergic reactions to MRI contrast agents. Subjects who do not fit the criteria for the population we are evaluating. Subjects should not participate in this study if they have any of the following conditions: Anxiety attacks Panic disorder Claustrophobia Pregnant, or trying to become pregnant Breast feeding Subjects should not participate in this study if they have certain kinds of metal in their body, for example: a heart pacemaker, defibrillator, neurostimulator, a metal plate, certain otologic implants, certain types of heart valves, metal slivers in eye, brain aneurysm clips or metal slivers and bullet fragments in or near certain structures in their body. Our standard MRI safety screening will be performed on all subjects. If a subject has metal in their body that requires an additional xray beyond what is needed for the clinical MRI examination to safely perform the research MRI examination that subject would be excluded.Subjects not being able to return for a followup examination</criteria>
