	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies pomegranate-extract pill in preventing tumor growth in patients with prostate cancer that is limited to a certain part of the body (localized), who have chosen observation as their treatment plan. The use of pomegranate-extract pill may slow disease progression in patients with localized prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomegranate-Extract Pill in Preventing Tumor Growth in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Active Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of pomegranate fruit extract (PFE) 1000 mg, taken daily for 1 year, on the plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) from baseline to end of study (52 weeks) in participants undergoing active surveillance (AS) for early stage prostate cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess compliance with a once daily oral administration of PFE versus placebo over a 52-week period of time. II. To assess the toxicity of PFE vs. placebo when taken daily for 52 weeks (+/- 1 week). III. To compare and correlate the modulation of the following biomarkers with response to PFE versus placebo on follow-up biopsy results performed at week 52 +/- 1 week (or earlier if clinically indicated), including the presence or absence of tumor, the extent of tumor and Gleason scores; plasma biomarkers: Insulin-like growth factor 1/IGF binding protein 3 ratio (IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio); normal and abnormal prostate tissue biomarkers: prostate-specific antigen (PSA), IGFBP-3, apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), 8-hydroxy-2' -deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and androgen receptor. IV. Measure PFE constituents/metabolites in plasma and urine for evidence of accumulation (trough levels): ellagic acid, dimethyl ellagic acid, dimethyl ellagic acid glucuronide (DMEAG), urolithin A, urolithin A-glucuronide, urolithin B and urolithin B-glucuronide. V. Measure PSA doubling time (PSA DT) in serum, using the calculation provided on the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center website. VI. To assess the feasibility of cancer chemoprevention trials in a population of men undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer. VII. Measurement of serum testosterone. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I: Patients receive pomegranate-extract pill orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 52 weeks (± 1 week). GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 52 weeks (± 1 week).</detailed_description>
